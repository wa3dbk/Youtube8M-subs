 They can use patience, right? 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.550
 So today I'm going to try to help these 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.130
 people are going to start there are three 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.960
 types of sight the radio cope the famous 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.539
 is that you always stay 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.609
 admired to soon pass in their sights and 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.260
 already making it difficult is that he had 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:38.920
 with people paying you dick and that 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.719
 famous 3d trocar announced that bonbon 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.940
 cow knows everyone at the time of the 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.879
 coup and a notebook 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.399
 the shot kiss you only serve if you have 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.649
 stuck with the guy what's going to matter is 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.929
 to know when you will use each one 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.850
 these have even the flash carve that is a 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:58.030
 pop album so fast that my friend 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.920
 it seems to like the cup 12 and 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.100
 there are even some variations within 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.409
 these lines I got over 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.640
 base is that even not a good suit of 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.130
 cheetah of two things 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.050
 lyre and drive while admiring you 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.480
 must have practice and confidence 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.910
 while moving the right strategy 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.530
 and trust because I speak confidence 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.810
 because if you not to venture ever 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.650
 will achieve nothing in life and not play 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.900
 it's different right? 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.960
 sometimes you die but do what you want 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.970
 You can not give up on training in the 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.280
 beginning is difficult but the results are 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.230
 good are motivators you have to have 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.580
 a certain notion of game you have to have 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.560
 the awareness of who will have a burden 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.570
 then you have to know if 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.180
 moves well with her what many 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.040
 call classes and called for him pla 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.260
 already comes with the game is just you tighten of 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.690
 milk it out and tighten ethical 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.310
 it comes back like a magic pass 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.590
 a tip is to know very well all the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.150
 maps your preferred mode for example 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.010
 you will always have not actually 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.130
 because you play a lot in it 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.200
 know all their mothers knows him 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.850

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.100
 Prison maps in this landscape may not be 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.320
 so bad in two kinds that a 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.239
 it will be useful to you and others who 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.220
 You will dominate your life and I think 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.040

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.380
 7 really helps you only game in youtube 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.510
 Like I 'm the October project on 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.330
 truth is more beauty in the grip of access 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.160
 to the game r7 with great headphones and cheap the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.349
 microphone more or less so already 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.840
 He could talk to your skype Clan 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.610
 You know who this business is. 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.349
 character and was staged in a 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.569
 character is everything best 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.030
 You can even watch the video that 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.680
 female characters the screen where i 4k 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.810
 Who are you going to understand better? 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.319
 sensitivity does not have minc in the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.989
 event 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.830
 it just depends a lot on the mouse and the mouse pad 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.900
 what do you use 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.849
 but of course it's very important you 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.739
 should seek the ideal for you 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.780
 nowadays there are mouse pads 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.459
 professional gamers did not ask nor do they 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.140
 Only you give me a day, anyway. 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.630
 I have our playmaker then 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.459
 mouse sensitivity 30 and 21 15 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.310
 on the old mouse and broke 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.880
 real chance of 10 and 21 5 you have 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.829
 an idea 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.720
 then you can not have a right base is 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.910
 more is the way to go adapting to 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.920
 needs of 1 always half of the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.900
 which is the mouse because I think better or 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.130
 touch rs but there will taste 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.329
 You can even take a test but not 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.980
 I could move on that, you guys. 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.410
 they will know that they can deregulate families 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.760
 are the future problem in good is that what 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.319
