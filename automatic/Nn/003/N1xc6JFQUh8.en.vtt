with<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:42.040> behind<00:03:42.280> us<00:03:42.400> now<00:03:42.550> that's<00:03:42.760> flow<00:03:43.060> edge

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
with that behind us now that's flow edge

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.280 
with that behind us now that's flow edge
starts<00:03:44.320> off<00:03:44.500> very<00:03:45.160> very<00:03:45.310> very<00:03:45.910> steep<00:03:46.330> straight

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
starts off very very very steep straight

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.360 
starts off very very very steep straight
into<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.530> ground<00:03:47.620> gears<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.160> you're<00:03:48.280> gonna

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
into the ground gears and you're gonna

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.340 
into the ground gears and you're gonna
stay<00:03:48.670> in<00:03:48.820> those<00:03:48.940> pretty<00:03:49.210> much<00:03:49.330> all<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.990> way<00:03:50.140> up

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
stay in those pretty much all the way up

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.720 
stay in those pretty much all the way up
because<00:03:50.560> it's<00:03:50.680> quite<00:03:50.860> long<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.220> draggy<00:03:51.460> and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
because it's quite long and draggy and

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.670 
because it's quite long and draggy and
you'll<00:03:52.120> have<00:03:52.270> to<00:03:52.390> avoid<00:03:52.630> quite<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:52.960> few<00:03:53.230> errant

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
you'll have to avoid quite a few errant

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.820 
you'll have to avoid quite a few errant
sheep<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:55.630> just<00:03:55.900> behind<00:03:56.140> me<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.530> probably

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
sheep and just behind me you probably

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.800 
sheep and just behind me you probably
can't<00:03:57.070> see<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.310> but<00:03:57.850> it's<00:03:58.030> SEMA<00:03:58.330> like<00:03:58.630> the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
can't see it but it's SEMA like the

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.750 
can't see it but it's SEMA like the
biggest<00:03:59.080> lake<00:03:59.260> in<00:03:59.470> the<00:04:00.010> Yorkshire<00:04:00.250> Dales

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.400 

so<00:04:05.760> Tony<00:04:05.940> wasn't<00:04:06.300> lying<00:04:06.690> about<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.110> views

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
so Tony wasn't lying about the views

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.230 
so Tony wasn't lying about the views
they<00:04:07.620> are<00:04:07.830> absolutely<00:04:08.430> stunning<00:04:08.700> up<00:04:08.940> here<00:04:09.120> on

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
they are absolutely stunning up here on

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.000 
they are absolutely stunning up here on
top<00:04:09.420> of<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.600> Dow's<00:04:09.810> he<00:04:10.620> didn't<00:04:10.890> really

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
top of the Dow's he didn't really

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.790 
top of the Dow's he didn't really
mention<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.490> wind<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:12.120> very<00:04:12.450> blurry<00:04:12.870> it's

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
mention the wind it is very blurry it's

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.080 
mention the wind it is very blurry it's
okay<00:04:14.250> if<00:04:14.340> it's<00:04:14.460> behind<00:04:14.610> you

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
okay if it's behind you

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.449 
okay if it's behind you
if<00:04:15.210> it's<00:04:15.510> into<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:17.040> gonna<00:04:17.220> be<00:04:17.430> a

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
if it's into you it's gonna be a

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.240 
if it's into you it's gonna be a
struggle<00:04:17.989> I've<00:04:18.989> just<00:04:19.230> climbed<00:04:19.530> up<00:04:19.680> from<00:04:19.890> Grint

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.680 
struggle I've just climbed up from Grint
and<00:04:20.430> that's<00:04:20.610> probably<00:04:20.760> gonna<00:04:20.940> be<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.180> second

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
and that's probably gonna be the second

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.500 
and that's probably gonna be the second
toughest<00:04:22.080> climb<00:04:22.500> on<00:04:22.800> this<00:04:23.340> route<00:04:23.790> it's<00:04:24.390> also

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
incredible views the road was a bit

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.130 
incredible views the road was a bit
sketchy<00:04:44.250> in<00:04:44.610> places<00:04:45.120> quite<00:04:45.390> a<00:04:45.420> lot<00:04:45.600> of<00:04:45.660> gravel

sketchy in places quite a lot of gravel

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.980 
sketchy in places quite a lot of gravel
so<00:04:46.560> if<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:46.890> are<00:04:47.040> riding<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.520> do<00:04:47.790> take<00:04:48.150> care

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
so if you are riding it do take care

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.200 
so if you are riding it do take care
we<00:04:49.500> know<00:04:49.680> this<00:04:50.160> climb<00:04:50.490> though<00:04:50.700> is<00:04:50.850> going<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.060> be

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
we know this climb though is going to be

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.880 
we know this climb though is going to be
resurfaced<00:04:51.990> in<00:04:52.140> time<00:04:52.350> for<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.620> Tour<00:04:52.800> de

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
resurfaced in time for the Tour de

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.230 
resurfaced in time for the Tour de
France<00:04:52.920> so<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.490> should<00:04:53.700> be<00:04:53.820> absolutely

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
France so that should be absolutely

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.710 
France so that should be absolutely
lovely<00:04:54.540> by<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.930> time<00:04:55.110> they<00:04:55.260> finished<00:04:55.620> with<00:04:55.740> it

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
lovely by the time they finished with it

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.030 
lovely by the time they finished with it
