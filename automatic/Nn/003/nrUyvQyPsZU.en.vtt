00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.750
 hello me the divisionals in 2010 has been the year of the movies and the 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.109
 3d televisions 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.209
 and not to argue is in a lodge 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:13.339
 those of fujifilm have developed the real 3d the factors camera that now 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:15.359
 in addition he also records 3d video 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.000
 the real 3d w 1 was the first 3d camera 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.220
 and now we have the w 3 an improved version that is the first to record 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.829
 3d video I agreed 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.859
 this is a very peculiar camera because as you can see it had two objectives and 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.920
 behind these two objectives two sensors of 10 megapixels each 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.900
 so you can capture your world in 3d 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.060
 and since having two separate objectives is capable of capturing 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.780
 from the same scene but from some choose different environments that detail 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.900
 st then allow to generate the three-dimensional effect 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.270
 as if we were looking with our own eyes 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.210
 what better is that you can also enjoy the results in the same 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.580
 camera and without glasses yes yes no glasses because its screen is telescopic cars 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.260
 which means that your lenticular layer is born, escape, we show the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.360
 images so down naked what is a basket you of air do not 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.340
 you can appreciate 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.960
 forward that is the first and at the moment the only camera that 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.470
 is capable of recording 3d hd video at 720p 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.530
 so you can see the images not only on your camera but also on television 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.550
 I do not know how many inches that is like this has to be 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.890
 it is not allowed to connect it with a cable h 1 point 4 the results are 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.390
 absolutely amazing the screen is widescreen lcd while Cuba 5 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.930
 inches and has more than three million 150 thousand pixels the truth is that it is 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.460
 better and much bigger 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.990
 that the screen that brought the w 1 and also the 3d effect is also much 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.380
 better and being here is something so parallax with which you can adjust 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.760
 the point of importance of the capture 3d 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.830
 you can adjust it before making the capture 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.830
 or you can adjust it after doing it 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.810
 praise to make a good picture a good 3d video you need the baskets very 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.110
 well lit so you do not cut yourself when using the flash 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.869
 if the astana that the tails will not have for a result 3d the good objective 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.510
 the desired goals are a train of 5 105 millimeters and the luminosity that is 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.329
 intermediate 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.389
 of elevators zener a sensitivity that awakens the instincts and south 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.599
 all this you have here 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.230
 they are two microphones also twins the photos and 3d videos are recorded on cards 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.850
 sd today you see hs 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.209
 in formats in the period for photos 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.239
 and there three days for videos but beware that that guy that you like is that way 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.420
 soto photography of life in 2d you can also do them with this 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.159
 camera 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.650
 you just have to press 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.039
 this zp button here to go from 2d to 3d and 3d ados from 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:49.059
 the camera are not quite light as others weigh 230 grams and neither 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.539
 they have especially remarkable autonomy but this is logical if 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.619
 we think that there are scholarships and two cameras integrated into a single body 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:00.470
 so if you want to be a 3d pioneer the bbc is more versatile inflation 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.579
 and although it costs 450 euros 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.439
 It's cheap if we compare it with other options available in the market by 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.369
 that and for much more takes our yesterday certification 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:11.569
 that the pp 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.249
 she knows is that if you want to know more about 3d or about anything that is 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:19.339
 Technologically speaking, you have to visit us, start point, net 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:21.879
 easy and fun technology up to 100 that would come
