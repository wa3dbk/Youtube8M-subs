00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.760 
mirror so I think he's heavily
influenced<00:04:21.890> with<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.190> Susa<00:04:22.550> Niles<00:04:22.729> and<00:04:22.910> as

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
influenced with the Susa Niles and as

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.409 
influenced with the Susa Niles and as
we're<00:04:25.160> not<00:04:25.340> we're<00:04:25.580> not<00:04:25.610> too<00:04:25.910> sure<00:04:25.940> but

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
we're not we're not too sure but

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.330 
we're not we're not too sure but
apparently<00:04:28.419> Tommy<00:04:29.419> yeah<00:04:29.720> he<00:04:30.080> has<00:04:30.340> strong

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
apparently Tommy yeah he has strong

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.100 
apparently Tommy yeah he has strong
Sharingan<00:04:32.240> technique<00:04:32.599> so<00:04:32.750> he's<00:04:32.900> heavily

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
Sharingan technique so he's heavily

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.710 
Sharingan technique so he's heavily
related<00:04:33.710> with<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:33.889> Sharingan<00:04:34.490> that's<00:04:35.449> what<00:04:35.690> I

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
related with the Sharingan that's what I

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.170 
related with the Sharingan that's what I
think<00:04:35.840> and<00:04:36.319> since<00:04:36.860> he<00:04:37.250> has<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.370> running<00:04:38.060> on

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
think and since he has a running on

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.119 
think and since he has a running on
narrow<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:38.569> everything<00:04:38.870> whatever<00:04:39.650> but

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:40.129 
narrow and everything whatever but

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.869 
narrow and everything whatever but
basically<00:04:42.009> that's<00:04:43.009> that's<00:04:43.370> not<00:04:43.430> my<00:04:43.699> only

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
currently we don't know much about

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.520 
currently we don't know much about
kagamine<00:05:14.210> we've<00:05:14.479> only<00:05:14.630> ever<00:05:14.780> seen<00:05:15.050> him<00:05:15.169> for

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
kagamine we've only ever seen him for

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.939 
kagamine we've only ever seen him for
one<00:05:15.680> episode<00:05:15.800> for<00:05:16.190> a<00:05:16.250> couple<00:05:16.550> minutes<00:05:16.669> and<00:05:17.530> I

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.219 

my<00:05:21.949> idea<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.969> this<00:05:23.090> is<00:05:23.240> just<00:05:23.360> a<00:05:23.509> guess<00:05:23.930> is

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
my idea that this is just a guess is

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.080 
my idea that this is just a guess is
something<00:05:24.979> might<00:05:25.159> have<00:05:25.340> happened<00:05:25.370> within<00:05:25.879> a

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
something might have happened within a

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.510 
something might have happened within a
squad<00:05:26.449> he<00:05:27.050> took<00:05:27.259> on<00:05:27.409> the<00:05:27.560> squad<00:05:27.889> name<00:05:28.129> and<00:05:28.310> made

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
squad he took on the squad name and made

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.830 
squad he took on the squad name and made
the<00:05:28.699> name<00:05:28.849> Toby<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:30.460> he's<00:05:31.460> doing<00:05:32.270> something

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
the name Toby and he's doing something

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.520 
the name Toby and he's doing something
too<00:05:33.050> I<00:05:33.789> don't<00:05:34.789> know<00:05:34.880> for<00:05:35.150> this<00:05:35.300> by<00:05:36.020> of<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.349> moon

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
too I don't know for this by of the moon

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.790 
too I don't know for this by of the moon
plan<00:05:36.889> whatever<00:05:37.190> is<00:05:37.520> he's<00:05:37.699> planning<00:05:38.180> I<00:05:38.800> think

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
plan whatever is he's planning I think

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.249 
plan whatever is he's planning I think
he's<00:05:39.979> taken<00:05:40.729> on<00:05:40.849> his<00:05:41.000> name<00:05:41.240> from<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:41.750> squad

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
he's taken on his name from the squad

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.659 
he's taken on his name from the squad
from<00:05:42.529> Toby<00:05:43.009> from<00:05:43.639> tobirama<00:05:44.800> so<00:05:45.800> that's<00:05:46.550> just

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
from Toby from tobirama so that's just

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.059 
from Toby from tobirama so that's just
my<00:05:47.029> personal<00:05:47.930> idea<00:05:48.259> please<00:05:48.529> believe<00:05:48.889> your
