00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.370
 hey here's me for euronics nice 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.360
 there you are, you know me in the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.219
 last moves 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.019
 for my preparations because I have 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.089
 a date and how to see it 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.770
 but I iron something and that my 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.060
 favorite change that is complete child 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.770
 lay is already in the whole time 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.210
 Laundry basket in there so I can not do that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.080
 Go the door but thank god 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.420
 i from philips you that gc 96 20 20 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.550
 perfect song my date is reluctantly waiting 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.130
 we start the iron immediately and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 heat is right on we need before 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.460
 all things the hot steam of the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.290
 from the iron comes out the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.910
 takes a few seconds but then you are 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.789
 we are ready and ready to go 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.079
 get started and start ironing 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.239
 we just have to carry the IV 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.789
 solve and have thanks to a 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.559
 Ultra light her 1 800 grams of light weight 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.780
 irons here in hand with them 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.059
 you really very carefully to ours 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.430
 clothing and thus have one of the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.410
 lightest iron ever with it 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.640
 but we also do the worst 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.489
 get our clothes out 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.489
 we need something very clear then 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.859
 with the animal without lubricant soles 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.170
 we can be gentle about ours 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.850
 glide clothes 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.250
 What do we need to get steam 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.709
 Clearly we produce water 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.069
 our tank 1.8 liters so a whole 

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:24.990
 amount 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.270
 Of course we only need it today 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.770
 a fraction and good to know 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.359
 also we can as tap water 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.579
 that means no distilled 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:38.189
 Water is needed and therefore could 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.950
 always start and iron our steam 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.299
 By the way, comes with 6.5 on our 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.129
 clothes that's a whole lot 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.780
 considering that one 

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:47.369
 High pressure washer already with 15 bar 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.170
 starts without anything in front of everything 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.170
 Pressure loss with the most pleasant 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.689
 Function is the opti temp function because 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.969
 We can do that without the heat 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.219
 Regulate about every clothing from us 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.649
 wings without any interbrand spots or 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.479
 other problems with gives on the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.849
 back of the iron we have the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.709
 eco function with it as the name already 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.629
 says we are more ecological and save 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.670
 some money because we work with less 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.200
 pressure but still enough pressure around 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.430
 keep our clothes free to get 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.440
 and if you are in a hurry right now 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.700
 then the turbo function helps with the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.700
 cme namely iron perpendicular 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.280
 but also to difficult places like 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.620
 buttons we come around so perfect 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.200
 just fold over and that 's it 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.030
 wrinkle free that's how it must be 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.340
 just dump on the water tank and 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.860
 then with the easycard function in the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.290
 turn around our iron included 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.150
 and then it can start 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.959
 it was tested by michael for me 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.180
 onyx the philips gc 96 20 20 perfect 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.620
 khalid and from me there are two thumbs 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.880
 up so a smooth one and you 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.769
 can keep you informed on 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.430
 our website or just in 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.900
 our shop 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.900
 See you next time 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.300
 Alright forgot the iron 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.810
 but then I fall again 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.670
 on 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.680
 we have an automatic switch-off here 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.069
 So nothing can burn 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.069
 Thank God
