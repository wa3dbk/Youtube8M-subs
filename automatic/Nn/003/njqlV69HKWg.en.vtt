the current jungle environment compared
to<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> past<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:53.009> reasons<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.549> is

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
to in the past the reasons for this is

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.370 
to in the past the reasons for this is
because<00:01:54.030> she<00:01:54.210> benefits<00:01:54.689> more<00:01:54.960> from<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
because she benefits more from the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.950 
because she benefits more from the
single<00:01:55.829> target<00:01:56.369> focus<00:01:56.790> clearing<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
single target focus clearing and the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.990 
single target focus clearing and the
increased<00:01:58.350> golden<00:01:58.799> comes<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.310> junglers<00:01:59.790> are

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
increased golden comes that junglers are

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.940 
increased golden comes that junglers are
afforded<00:02:00.630> nowadays<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.560> reason<00:02:01.799> why<00:02:01.920> this

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
afforded nowadays the reason why this

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.039 
afforded nowadays the reason why this
high<00:02:02.369> golden<00:02:02.850> common<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.509> hoped<00:02:03.719> sorella

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
high golden common really hoped sorella

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.050 
high golden common really hoped sorella
is<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.530> she<00:02:04.680> has<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> very<00:02:05.159> high<00:02:05.610> gold

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
is because she has a very high gold

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.440 
is because she has a very high gold
threshold<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.439> six<00:02:07.710> items<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
threshold and with six items is a

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.540 
threshold and with six items is a
complete<00:02:09.450> monster<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> flip<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.370> this

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
complete monster and on the flip of this

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.580 
complete monster and on the flip of this
she<00:02:11.760> doesn't<00:02:12.120> perform<00:02:12.300> very<00:02:12.780> well<00:02:12.810> without

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
she doesn't perform very well without

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.470 
she doesn't perform very well without
many<00:02:14.010> items<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.640> she<00:02:14.700> does<00:02:14.940> rely<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.269> getting

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
many items so she does rely on getting

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.420 
many items so she does rely on getting
that<00:02:15.599> gold<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.319> order<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.680> get<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.920> items<00:02:17.250> to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
that gold in order to get the items to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.460 
that gold in order to get the items to
be<00:02:17.519> effective<00:02:18.060> she<00:02:18.450> also<00:02:18.569> here's<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:19.080> fairly

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
big power spike when she gets to core

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.990 
big power spike when she gets to core
items<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.650> usually<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:23.069> triforce<00:02:23.760> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
items and this is usually a triforce and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.790 
items and this is usually a triforce and
a<00:02:24.330> blade<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.690> ruined<00:02:24.780> King<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:25.650> she's

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
a blade of the ruined King but she's

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.830 
a blade of the ruined King but she's
pretty<00:02:26.069> weak<00:02:26.640> before<00:02:26.940> she<00:02:27.300> gets<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.720> that

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
pretty weak before she gets to that

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.110 
pretty weak before she gets to that
point<00:02:27.900> as<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.620> jungler<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.310> takes<00:02:29.550> longer<00:02:29.849> to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
point as a jungler it takes longer to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.910 
point as a jungler it takes longer to
get<00:02:30.239> those<00:02:30.420> items<00:02:30.660> because<00:02:31.200> not<00:02:31.379> only<00:02:31.410> do<00:02:31.860> you

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
get those items because not only do you

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.550 
get those items because not only do you
get<00:02:32.190> less<00:02:32.430> golden<00:02:33.030> Elena<00:02:33.480> but<00:02:33.660> also<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.260> have

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
get less golden Elena but also you have

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.830 
get less golden Elena but also you have
to<00:02:34.590> spend<00:02:35.280> gold<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.819> jungle<00:02:36.330> item<00:02:36.450> to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
to spend gold on a jungle item to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.289 
to spend gold on a jungle item to
survive<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.470> jungle<00:02:38.190> efficiently<00:02:38.790> all<00:02:38.970> in

survive and jungle efficiently all in
all<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.690> equates<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.260> some<00:02:40.590> low<00:02:40.890> impact

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
all this equates to some low impact

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.699 
all this equates to some low impact
early<00:02:42.030> game<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.450> also<00:02:42.870> makes<00:02:43.140> playing<00:02:43.440> her

early game and also makes playing her

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.039 
early game and also makes playing her
kinda<00:02:44.190> risky<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.849> despite<00:02:45.330> being<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.840> lake<00:02:46.019> a

earlier in the late game that hit a

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
power spike earlier on in the game all

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.120 
power spike earlier on in the game all
can<00:02:54.030> have<00:02:54.209> more<00:02:54.450> high<00:02:54.810> impact<00:02:55.470> early<00:02:55.920> games

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
can have more high impact early games

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.850 
can have more high impact early games
usually<00:02:56.790> because<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.420> decent<00:02:58.230> clear<00:02:58.590> speed

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860
