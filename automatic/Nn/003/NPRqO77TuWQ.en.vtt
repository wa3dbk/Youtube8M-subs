aren't<00:01:56.189> very<00:01:56.399> realistic<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.119> therefore<00:01:57.479> it's

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
aren't very realistic and therefore it's

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.600 
aren't very realistic and therefore it's
a<00:01:57.750> more<00:01:57.930> casual<00:01:58.380> game<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.280> maybe<00:01:59.399> other

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
a more casual game and then maybe other

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.920 
a more casual game and then maybe other
games<00:01:59.820> where<00:02:00.000> they're<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.270> realistic<00:02:00.630> it's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
games where they're so realistic it's

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.569 
games where they're so realistic it's
like<00:02:01.170> you're<00:02:01.770> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.920> go<00:02:02.040> hide<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.399> bush

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
like you're going to go hide in a bush

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.280 
like you're going to go hide in a bush
for<00:02:02.790> four<00:02:03.149> hours<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.719> maybe<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.110> to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
for four hours and maybe you get to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.319 
for four hours and maybe you get to
fight<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:04.920> bad<00:02:05.130> guy<00:02:05.310> or<00:02:05.490> something<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.090> I

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
fight one bad guy or something so I

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.120 
fight one bad guy or something so I
think<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.229> come<00:02:07.380> does<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> great<00:02:07.829> job<00:02:07.860> of

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
think so come does a great job of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.180 
think so come does a great job of
offering<00:02:08.549> choices<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.570> player<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
offering choices of the player and

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.530 
offering choices of the player and
letting<00:02:11.190> them<00:02:11.370> play<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.790> game<00:02:11.910> how<00:02:12.090> they<00:02:12.330> want

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
letting them play the game how they want

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.300 
letting them play the game how they want
to<00:02:12.810> if<00:02:13.290> they<00:02:13.440> want<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.709> be<00:02:13.800> tactical<00:02:14.250> in

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
to if they want to be tactical in

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.070 
to if they want to be tactical in
hardcore<00:02:14.700> we

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
hardcore we

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.020 
hardcore we
can<00:02:15.260> do<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:15.560> if<00:02:15.710> they<00:02:15.860> want<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.130> be<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:16.880> little

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
can do that if they want to be a little

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.090 
can do that if they want to be a little
more<00:02:17.120> running<00:02:17.540> gun<00:02:17.750> they'll<00:02:18.500> have<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> tougher

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
more running gun they'll have a tougher

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.500 
more running gun they'll have a tougher
time<00:02:19.130> beating<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.730> game<00:02:19.910> but<00:02:20.150> they<00:02:20.240> can<00:02:20.390> do

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
time beating the game but they can do

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.480 
time beating the game but they can do
that<00:02:20.660> as<00:02:20.870> well<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.470> think<00:02:21.590> that's<00:02:22.280> one<00:02:22.460> of

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
that as well so I think that's one of

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.190 
that as well so I think that's one of
the<00:02:22.580> really<00:02:22.730> things<00:02:23.030> great<00:02:23.690> things<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:23.990> sets

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
the really things great things that sets

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.230 
the really things great things that sets
the<00:02:24.290> game<00:02:24.440> apart<00:02:24.680> another<00:02:25.070> thing<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.640> think

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
the game apart another thing is I think

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.850 
the game apart another thing is I think
we<00:02:26.300> have<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.420> great<00:02:26.600> equal<00:02:27.110> emphasis<00:02:27.590> on<00:02:27.710> both

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
we have a great equal emphasis on both

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.550 
we have a great equal emphasis on both
single-player<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.430> multiplayer

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
single-player and multiplayer

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.270 
single-player and multiplayer
particularly<00:02:30.560> in<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:30.710> latest<00:02:31.010> game<00:02:31.160> we

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
particularly in this latest game we

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.500 
particularly in this latest game we
tried<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.610> add<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> bunch<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.090> new<00:02:32.180> single

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
tried to add a bunch of new single

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.420 
tried to add a bunch of new single
player<00:02:32.660> features<00:02:32.960> so<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:33.950> think<00:02:34.040> it's<00:02:34.250> almost

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
player features so I think it's almost

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.250 
player features so I think it's almost
like<00:02:34.610> you're<00:02:34.700> getting<00:02:34.820> two<00:02:35.120> complete<00:02:35.300> games<00:02:35.810> I

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
like you're getting two complete games I

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.660 
like you're getting two complete games I
know<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.710> played<00:02:36.950> another<00:02:37.160> games<00:02:37.430> out<00:02:37.640> there

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
know I played another games out there

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.300 
know I played another games out there
where<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:39.080> game<00:02:39.260> really<00:02:39.290> shines<00:02:39.560> in<00:02:39.950> one<00:02:40.100> area

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
where the game really shines in one area

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.400 
where the game really shines in one area
the<00:02:40.580> other<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.000> think<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.330> calm<00:02:41.540> 3<00:02:41.930> we

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
the other and I think so calm 3 we

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.750 
the other and I think so calm 3 we
really<00:02:42.740> tried<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.130> bring<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.400> single-player

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
really tried to bring the single-player

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.300 
really tried to bring the single-player
up<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:45.020> multiplayer<00:02:45.530> level<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:45.950> gameplay

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
up to the multiplayer level of gameplay

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.290 
up to the multiplayer level of gameplay
as<00:02:47.290> well<00:02:48.290> as<00:02:48.470> sharing<00:02:48.770> strengths<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:50.120> two

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
as well as sharing strengths the two

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.110 
as well as sharing strengths the two
titles<00:02:50.780> also<00:02:51.170> feature<00:02:51.470> exciting<00:02:52.280> contrasts

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
titles also feature exciting contrasts

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.960 
titles also feature exciting contrasts
there<00:02:54.020> are<00:02:54.170> some<00:02:54.410> big<00:02:54.590> differences<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.459> one

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
there are some big differences and one

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.040 
there are some big differences and one
of<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.150> things<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.510> actually<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.870> major

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
of the things is actually a major

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.500 
of the things is actually a major
changes<00:02:57.590> how<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.250> camera<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.090> with<00:02:59.390> the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
changes how the camera is with the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.690 
changes how the camera is with the
character<00:02:59.930> traditionally<00:03:00.740> SOCOM<00:03:01.250> games<00:03:01.520> in

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
character traditionally SOCOM games in

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.010 
character traditionally SOCOM games in
the<00:03:01.760> ps2<00:03:02.150> have<00:03:02.300> had<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.510> camera<00:03:02.690> right<00:03:02.959> over

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
the ps2 have had the camera right over

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.290 
the ps2 have had the camera right over
the<00:03:03.380> character<00:03:03.770> and<00:03:03.950> what<00:03:04.520> we<00:03:04.610> decided<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.090> do

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
the character and what we decided to do

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.270 
the character and what we decided to do
was<00:03:05.510> because<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.900> PSP<00:03:06.290> has<00:03:06.470> this<00:03:06.650> very<00:03:06.980> wide

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
was because the PSP has this very wide

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.730 
was because the PSP has this very wide
luscious<00:03:07.970> cinematic<00:03:08.480> screen<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.110> we

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
luscious cinematic screen is that we

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.199 
luscious cinematic screen is that we
will<00:03:09.860> put<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.040> camera<00:03:10.370> over<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.820> shoulder<00:03:11.180> of

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
will put the camera over the shoulder of

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.000 
will put the camera over the shoulder of
the<00:03:11.360> character<00:03:11.870> I've<00:03:12.200> had<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.560> character<00:03:12.890> off

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
the character I've had the character off

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.620 
the character I've had the character off
to<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.310> side<00:03:13.490> not<00:03:13.850> allowed<00:03:14.090> us<00:03:14.240> to<00:03:14.270> bring

to the side not allowed us to bring
camera<00:03:15.110> into<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.500> character<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.130> actually

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
camera into the character and actually

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.920 
camera into the character and actually
see<00:03:16.580> him<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.850> little<00:03:17.090> bit<00:03:17.180> more<00:03:17.330> on<00:03:17.510> screen

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
see him a little bit more on screen

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.430 
see him a little bit more on screen
while<00:03:18.440> also<00:03:18.590> allowing<00:03:18.800> a<00:03:19.130> clear<00:03:19.790> field<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.150> you

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
really the large-scale systems that are

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.820 
really the large-scale systems that are
different<00:03:23.330> is<00:03:23.690> one<00:03:24.290> of<00:03:24.350> them<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.650> target

different is one of them is the target
lock<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.670> that<00:03:25.820> affects<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.209> game<00:03:26.450> across

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
lock and that affects the game across

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.470 
lock and that affects the game across
the<00:03:27.380> board<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:28.090> we<00:03:29.090> were<00:03:29.180> really<00:03:29.300> nervous

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
the board and we were really nervous

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.509 
the board and we were really nervous
about<00:03:29.690> target<00:03:30.140> locks<00:03:30.320> I<00:03:30.440> mean<00:03:30.590> as<00:03:30.980> we<00:03:31.190> designed

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
about target locks I mean as we designed

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.100 
about target locks I mean as we designed
the<00:03:31.640> game<00:03:31.790> in<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.150> back<00:03:32.330> of<00:03:32.480> our<00:03:32.600> minds<00:03:32.930> we

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
the game in the back of our minds we

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.570 
the game in the back of our minds we
were<00:03:33.230> constantly<00:03:33.590> thinking<00:03:34.040> is<00:03:34.190> this<00:03:34.340> going

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
were constantly thinking is this going

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.220 
were constantly thinking is this going
to<00:03:34.610> make<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.940> game<00:03:35.090> too<00:03:35.360> easy<00:03:35.570> what<00:03:36.140> we

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
to make the game too easy what we

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.690 
to make the game too easy what we
decided<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.650> do<00:03:36.830> was<00:03:36.980> make<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.160> target<00:03:37.430> lock

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
decided to do was make a target lock

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.130 
decided to do was make a target lock
that<00:03:37.970> would<00:03:38.180> allow<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.780> player<00:03:39.110> to

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
that would allow the player to

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.710 
that would allow the player to
indirectly<00:03:39.800> aim<00:03:40.070> at<00:03:40.430> what<00:03:40.850> you<00:03:41.360> know<00:03:41.450> he<00:03:41.600> was

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
indirectly aim at what you know he was

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.800 
indirectly aim at what you know he was
looking<00:03:42.019> at<00:03:42.110> by<00:03:42.800> his<00:03:43.250> stamps<00:03:43.970> by<00:03:44.150> his<00:03:44.330> move<00:03:44.570> by

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
looking at by his stamps by his move by

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.780 
looking at by his stamps by his move by
the<00:03:44.900> kind<00:03:45.080> of<00:03:45.170> weapon<00:03:45.470> he<00:03:45.560> had<00:03:45.739> so<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.610> player

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
the kind of weapon he had so the player

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.430 
the kind of weapon he had so the player
had<00:03:46.910> lots<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.269> options<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.780> be<00:03:47.930> able<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.170> refine

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
had lots of options to be able to refine

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.840 
had lots of options to be able to refine
his<00:03:48.680> name<00:03:48.860> even<00:03:49.040> though<00:03:49.160> he<00:03:49.370> was<00:03:49.489> locked<00:03:49.640> onto

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
his name even though he was locked onto

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.910 
his name even though he was locked onto
a<00:03:49.970> target<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:50.989> think<00:03:51.170> what<00:03:51.290> that<00:03:51.440> meant<00:03:51.739> is

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
a target and I think what that meant is

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.890 
a target and I think what that meant is
finally<00:03:52.850> we<00:03:52.940> had<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.090> system<00:03:53.330> that<00:03:53.660> allowed<00:03:53.870> us

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
finally we had a system that allowed us

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.229 
finally we had a system that allowed us
to<00:03:54.110> use<00:03:54.230> that<00:03:54.500> single<00:03:54.890> I'm<00:03:54.980> log<00:03:55.190> stick<00:03:55.550> but

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
to use that single I'm log stick but

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.820 
to use that single I'm log stick but
really<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.630> wasn't<00:03:56.810> a<00:03:56.959> cheap<00:03:57.200> system<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:57.769> it

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
really it wasn't a cheap system and it

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.350 
really it wasn't a cheap system and it
didn't<00:03:58.070> make<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.370> game<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.700> Arkady<00:03:59.060> there's

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
didn't make the game to Arkady there's

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.479 
didn't make the game to Arkady there's
still<00:03:59.510> a<00:03:59.540> lot<00:03:59.720> of<00:03:59.750> tactics<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.620> play<00:04:01.459> left

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
still a lot of tactics and and play left

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.160 
still a lot of tactics and and play left
in<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.000> system<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.570> that's<00:04:02.810> something<00:04:02.989> that

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
in the system and that's something that

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.990 
in the system and that's something that
we<00:04:03.590> had<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:03.890> do<00:04:04.010> for<00:04:04.040> PSP<00:04:04.519> but<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.760> worked<00:04:04.910> out

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
we had to do for PSP but it worked out

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.660 
we had to do for PSP but it worked out
really<00:04:05.060> well<00:04:05.269> for<00:04:05.390> us
