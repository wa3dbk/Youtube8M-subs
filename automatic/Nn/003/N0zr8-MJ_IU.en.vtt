00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
og 1000 as usual it seemed to be a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.319 
og 1000 as usual it seemed to be a
little<00:00:34.649> different<00:00:34.890> than<00:00:35.100> past<00:00:35.250> g1000<00:00:36.059> because

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
little different than past g1000 because

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.569 
little different than past g1000 because
we've<00:00:36.480> got<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> weather<00:00:36.930> radar<00:00:37.309> embedded<00:00:38.309> into

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
we've got a weather radar embedded into

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.010 
we've got a weather radar embedded into
it<00:00:38.700> as<00:00:38.790> well<00:00:38.940> as<00:00:39.120> multiple<00:00:39.629> cast<00:00:39.989> messages<00:00:41.000> and

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
it as well as multiple cast messages and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.670 
it as well as multiple cast messages and
the<00:00:43.020> special<00:00:43.379> imp<00:00:43.879> inputted<00:00:44.879> keyboard<00:00:45.680> as

the special imp inputted keyboard as

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.380 
the special imp inputted keyboard as
well<00:00:46.770> even<00:00:47.430> though<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.550> saw<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.969> morsel<00:00:48.300> on

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
well even though we saw that morsel on

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.600 
well even though we saw that morsel on
the<00:00:48.510> TBM<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.860> little<00:00:50.129> different<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.460> see

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the TBM it's a little different to see

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.819 
the TBM it's a little different to see
it<00:00:50.700> now<00:00:50.820> built<00:00:51.300> into<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.690> Phenom<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.320> it

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
it now built into the Phenom and it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.380 
it now built into the Phenom and it
looks<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.460> actually<00:00:53.670> has<00:00:53.789> updated<00:00:54.120> nav

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
looks like it actually has updated nav

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.790 
looks like it actually has updated nav
data<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.780> well<00:00:54.930> when<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.170> was<00:00:55.289> looking<00:00:55.559> at<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
data as well when I was looking at the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.729 
data as well when I was looking at the
aircraft<00:00:55.920> yesterday<00:00:56.550> making<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.180> video<00:00:57.739> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
aircraft yesterday making the video the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.250 
aircraft yesterday making the video the
nav<00:00:58.949> data<00:00:59.160> expired<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.820> March<00:01:00.090> 11th<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.600> 2014

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
nav data expired like March 11th of 2014

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.779 
nav data expired like March 11th of 2014
so<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.500> only<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.100> month<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> date

the<00:01:37.680> page<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.369> tell<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.579> with<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> little

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the page just to tell you with a little

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.910 
the page just to tell you with a little
bit<00:01:39.180> about<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> aircraft<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.470> don't<00:01:43.470> really

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
bit about the aircraft so I don't really

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.230 
bit about the aircraft so I don't really
know<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.220> gonna<00:01:44.310> try<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.579> compare<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
know I'm gonna try to compare it to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.030 
know I'm gonna try to compare it to
something<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:46.110> released<00:01:46.649> beforehand

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
something that was released beforehand

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.530 
something that was released beforehand
it's<00:01:47.159> more<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.610> kind<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> compares<00:01:48.210> towards

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
it's more so it kind of compares towards

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.780 
it's more so it kind of compares towards
the<00:01:48.630> TBM<00:01:49.140> when<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> comes<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.189> interior

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.010 
case I believe this is one this is
Coronado's<00:03:33.140> largest<00:03:33.880> product<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:35.209> far

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
Coronado's largest product so far

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.650 
Coronado's largest product so far
so<00:03:38.020> yeah<00:03:38.710> it's<00:03:39.430> just<00:03:39.640> hard<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:39.970> believe<00:03:40.210> that<00:03:40.240> a

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
so yeah it's just hard to believe that a

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.710 
so yeah it's just hard to believe that a
package<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:41.770> still<00:03:42.010> like<00:03:42.280> fairly<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.000> size<00:03:43.360> of

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
package is still like fairly the size of

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.290 
package is still like fairly the size of
the<00:03:44.590> TEM<00:03:45.040> because<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.430> TVM<00:03:45.700> was<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.940> pretty

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
the TEM because the TVM was a pretty

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.390 
the TEM because the TVM was a pretty
large<00:03:46.900> package<00:03:47.380> as<00:03:47.530> well<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:50.250> don't<00:03:51.250> really

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
large package as well I don't really

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.950 
large package as well I don't really
know<00:03:51.580> much<00:03:51.790> more<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.120> say<00:03:52.270> I'm<00:03:52.420> just<00:03:52.570> gonna<00:03:52.720> be
