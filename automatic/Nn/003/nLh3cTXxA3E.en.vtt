00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.280 

there's<00:00:01.530> my<00:00:01.740> exhaust<00:00:02.100> I<00:00:02.810> just<00:00:03.810> had<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.049> relate

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
there's my exhaust I just had to relate

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.730 
there's my exhaust I just had to relate
my<00:00:04.440> fire<00:00:04.680> because<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.190> kind<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.430> let<00:00:05.549> it<00:00:05.640> go<00:00:05.759> out

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
my fire because I kind of let it go out

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.530 
my fire because I kind of let it go out
so<00:00:07.740> it<00:00:07.890> wouldn't<00:00:08.160> be<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.309> smoky<00:00:08.820> once<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.389> gets

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
so it wouldn't be a smoky once it gets

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.999 
so it wouldn't be a smoky once it gets
hotter<00:00:10.070> but<00:00:11.070> my<00:00:11.219> exhaust<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:12.059> quite<00:00:12.300> long<00:00:13.009> it

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
hotter but my exhaust is quite long it

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.439 
hotter but my exhaust is quite long it
is<00:00:15.379> 20<00:00:16.379> feet<00:00:16.850> and<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.970> goes<00:00:18.119> into<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
is 20 feet and it goes into the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.060 
is 20 feet and it goes into the
greenhouse<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:20.240> important<00:00:21.240> part<00:00:25.070> not

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
greenhouse the important part not

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.919 
greenhouse the important part not
finished<00:00:26.720> everything<00:00:27.720> yet<00:00:29.480> around<00:00:30.480> here<00:00:30.720> you

can<00:00:31.050> see<00:00:33.559> where<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.620> comes<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.329> don't<00:00:36.329> use<00:00:36.510> this

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
can see where it comes in don't use this

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.490 
can see where it comes in don't use this
stuff<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:38.300> used<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.420> right<00:00:39.600> now<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:40.020> I

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
stuff I just used it right now because I

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.240 
stuff I just used it right now because I
didn't<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.430> enough<00:00:42.379> venting<00:00:43.379> pipe<00:00:43.620> oh<00:00:43.860> it

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
didn't have enough venting pipe oh it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.979 
didn't have enough venting pipe oh it
works<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:44.640> pretty<00:00:44.789> cool<00:00:44.969> at<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.450> point<00:00:45.780> but

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
works it's pretty cool at that point but

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.660 
works it's pretty cool at that point but
it's<00:00:46.230> not<00:00:46.410> very<00:00:46.649> strong<00:00:46.860> if<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.190> dog<00:00:47.340> stuffs

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it's not very strong if your dog stuffs

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.670

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
am see 5 10 15 20 25 30 maybe 35 feet

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.380 
am see 5 10 15 20 25 30 maybe 35 feet
away<00:01:03.379> in<00:01:04.379> exhaust<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.159> lied<00:01:05.400> I've<00:01:05.970> got<00:01:06.210> more

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
away in exhaust I lied I've got more

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.660 
away in exhaust I lied I've got more
here<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.380> finally<00:01:07.650> got<00:01:07.740> close<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> 40<00:01:08.430> feet

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
here I finally got close to the 40 feet

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.940 
here I finally got close to the 40 feet
of<00:01:09.299> exhaustion<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.320> at<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.710> point

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
of exhaustion here and at this point

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.020 
of exhaustion here and at this point
it's<00:01:11.159> about<00:01:11.280> 35<00:01:11.760> feet<00:01:12.570> away<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.640> I've<00:01:14.820> got

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
it's about 35 feet away and I've got

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.499 
it's about 35 feet away and I've got
heat<00:01:15.270> coming<00:01:15.720> out<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.020> pipe<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.420> I'm

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
heat coming out of this pipe so what I'm

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.730 
heat coming out of this pipe so what I'm
doing<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.650> I'm<00:01:19.830> kind<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> benching<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.580> in

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
doing is I'm kind of benching it in

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.660 
doing is I'm kind of benching it in
initially<00:01:22.790> used<00:01:23.790> gravel<00:01:25.159> I'm<00:01:26.159> finding<00:01:26.580> that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
initially used gravel I'm finding that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.270 
initially used gravel I'm finding that
the<00:01:26.759> gravel<00:01:27.270> doesn't<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.159> as

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the gravel doesn't really it's not as

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.670 
the gravel doesn't really it's not as
good<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> conductor<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.450> heat<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.470> cob

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
good a conductor of the heat as the cob

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.100 
good a conductor of the heat as the cob
is<00:01:31.909> so<00:01:32.909> I'll<00:01:33.180> probably<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.509> use<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> gravel

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
is so I'll probably just use the gravel

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.219 
is so I'll probably just use the gravel
underneath<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.770> carve<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.790> top<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:37.079> then

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
underneath and carve it on top and then

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.679 
underneath and carve it on top and then
it's<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> nice<00:01:37.560> little<00:01:37.650> place<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.689> it's

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it's a nice little place for you it's

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.149 
it's a nice little place for you it's
kind<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.900> dark<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:40.619> clients<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.040> stuff

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.320 
far it's still quite wet so it's
steaming<00:02:23.540> away<00:02:23.750> as<00:02:24.140> its<00:02:24.710> drying<00:02:24.980> but<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.180> can

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
steaming away as its drying but you can

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.990 
steaming away as its drying but you can
see<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.990> fire<00:02:27.370> it's<00:02:28.370> working<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.790> hot

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
see the fire it's working like a hot

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.530 
see the fire it's working like a hot
down<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:32.660> my<00:02:32.780> barrel<00:02:33.260> again<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.480> don't<00:02:35.480> even

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
down so my barrel again I don't even

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.590 
down so my barrel again I don't even
know<00:02:36.460> one<00:02:37.460> of<00:02:37.490> my<00:02:37.580> headlight<00:02:37.940> on<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.210> camera

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
know one of my headlight on this camera

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.990 
know one of my headlight on this camera
is<00:02:38.660> on<00:02:41.290> really<00:02:42.290> help<00:02:42.470> much<00:02:42.710> but<00:02:43.700> I've<00:02:43.760> got<00:02:43.910> the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
is on really help much but I've got the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.380 
is on really help much but I've got the
55<00:02:44.420> gallon<00:02:44.750> barrel<00:02:45.580> inside<00:02:46.580> that<00:02:46.850> I've<00:02:47.090> got

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
55 gallon barrel inside that I've got

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.820 
55 gallon barrel inside that I've got
the<00:02:47.680> insulated<00:02:48.680> chimney<00:02:48.940> pipe<00:02:49.940> it's<00:02:50.300> about

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
the insulated chimney pipe it's about

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.280 
the insulated chimney pipe it's about
seven<00:02:51.830> inches<00:02:52.220> across<00:02:52.820> I<00:02:53.390> guess<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.960> about<00:02:54.140> an

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
seven inches across I guess and about an

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.100 
seven inches across I guess and about an
inch<00:02:54.440> around<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:55.180> diameter<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.600> insulated

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
inch around the diameter is insulated

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.250 
inch around the diameter is insulated
it's<00:02:57.290> sealed<00:02:57.530> at<00:02:57.650> both<00:02:57.800> ends<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.660> guess<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.810> hard

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
it's sealed at both ends I guess a hard

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.430 
it's sealed at both ends I guess a hard
to<00:03:00.410> see<00:03:00.650> because<00:03:01.040> it's<00:03:01.340> getting<00:03:01.520> dirt<00:03:01.790> and

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
to see because it's getting dirt and

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.690 
to see because it's getting dirt and
then<00:03:03.760> again<00:03:04.760> my<00:03:05.210> exit<00:03:05.960> comes<00:03:06.170> out<00:03:06.320> here<00:03:06.700> around

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
then again my exit comes out here around

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.920 
then again my exit comes out here around
this<00:03:08.030> bench<00:03:10.240> and<00:03:11.240> then<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.480> makes<00:03:11.660> another

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
this bench and then it makes another

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.000 
this bench and then it makes another
turn<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:15.220> then<00:03:17.230> all<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.380> way<00:03:18.440> down<00:03:18.620> there<00:03:18.860> and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
turn and then all the way down there and

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.480 
turn and then all the way down there and
oak<00:03:19.460> and<00:03:19.790> that<00:03:20.390> part<00:03:20.600> as<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.780> said<00:03:21.020> I<00:03:21.050> haven't

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
oak and that part as I said I haven't

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.030 
oak and that part as I said I haven't
haven't<00:03:22.490> finished<00:03:22.850> I've<00:03:23.030> been<00:03:23.410> I've<00:03:24.410> built

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
haven't finished I've been I've built

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.740 
haven't finished I've been I've built
the<00:03:25.190> same<00:03:25.400> important<00:03:25.940> part<00:03:26.180> now<00:03:26.360> probably

the same important part now probably

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.930 
the same important part now probably
four<00:03:27.470> times<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:30.310> really<00:03:31.310> think<00:03:31.670> you<00:03:31.760> need<00:03:31.790> to

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.520 
four times I really think you need to
get<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.240> book<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.570> I<00:03:32.690> really<00:03:32.900> think<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.380> need
