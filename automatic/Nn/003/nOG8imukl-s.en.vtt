00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:22.850 

my<00:04:08.070> sample

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.369 

then<00:04:23.490> we<00:04:23.639> pretty<00:04:23.879> much<00:04:23.939> of<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.360> just<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.110> switch

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:25.379 
then we pretty much of it just to switch

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:30.399 
then we pretty much of it just to switch
