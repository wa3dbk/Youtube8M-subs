just going to call that an on-court tone
we're<00:02:46.220> gonna<00:02:46.310> start<00:02:46.550> taking<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.849> look<00:02:46.880> at<00:02:47.120> those

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
we're gonna start taking a look at those

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.460 
we're gonna start taking a look at those
because<00:02:47.540> sums<00:02:47.750> are<00:02:47.900> also<00:02:48.020> going<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.260> start

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
because sums are also going to start

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.380 
because sums are also going to start
being<00:02:48.590> built<00:02:48.830> out<00:02:48.980> of<00:02:49.010> not<00:02:49.489> just<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.940> notes<00:02:50.180> in

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
being built out of not just the notes in

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.440 
being built out of not just the notes in
the<00:02:50.540> chords<00:02:51.040> but<00:02:52.040> also<00:02:52.370> notes<00:02:52.819> outside<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.360> the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
the chords but also notes outside of the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.880 
the chords but also notes outside of the
chords

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.490 

they're<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.340> cheese<00:02:57.550> outside<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:59.080> he's<00:02:59.260> not

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
they're the cheese outside that he's not

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.980 
they're the cheese outside that he's not
a<00:02:59.560> chord<00:02:59.830> tone<00:03:00.040> there

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
a chord tone there

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:08.699 
a chord tone there
I'm<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.440> Jesus<00:03:01.800> on<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.980> court<00:03:02.220> time<00:03:02.430> there

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.050 

okay<00:03:09.709> so<00:03:09.770> once<00:03:10.069> you<00:03:10.160> practice<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:10.550> just<00:03:10.970> be

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
okay so once you practice that just be

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.010 
okay so once you practice that just be
used<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.300> do<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:11.390> with<00:03:11.599> your<00:03:11.660> left<00:03:11.900> hand

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
used to do that with your left hand

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.690 
used to do that with your left hand
we're<00:03:12.260> going<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.440> do<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.650> same<00:03:12.680> thing<00:03:13.160> as<00:03:13.340> we

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
we're going to do the same thing as we

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.800 
we're going to do the same thing as we
did<00:03:13.849> with<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.030> right<00:03:14.180> hand<00:03:14.390> before<00:03:14.510> we're

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
did with the right hand before we're

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.880 
did with the right hand before we're
going<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.020> fill<00:03:15.319> in<00:03:15.500> for<00:03:15.739> beats<00:03:16.580> of<00:03:17.150> C<00:03:17.540> major

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
going to fill in for beats of C major

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.180 
going to fill in for beats of C major
then<00:03:18.890> d<00:03:19.280> minor<00:03:19.520> then<00:03:20.239> F<00:03:20.510> major<00:03:20.780> then<00:03:21.590> C<00:03:21.950> major

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
then d minor then F major then C major

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.059 
then d minor then F major then C major
and<00:03:22.750> we<00:03:23.750> can<00:03:23.870> just<00:03:23.900> start<00:03:24.140> by<00:03:24.590> using<00:03:24.739> whole

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
and we can just start by using whole

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:39.250 
and we can just start by using whole
notes

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.420 

two<00:03:39.530> three<00:03:40.069> four<00:03:41.170> just<00:03:42.170> like<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.319> and<00:03:42.680> then

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
two three four just like that and then

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.130 
two three four just like that and then
once<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.150> get<00:03:44.299> used<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.659> just<00:03:44.900> do<00:03:44.989> it<00:03:45.079> a

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
once you get used to that just do it a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.929 
once you get used to that just do it a
couple<00:03:45.260> times<00:03:45.409> try<00:03:46.040> different<00:03:46.370> variations

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:46.939 
couple times try different variations

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:52.630 
couple times try different variations
each<00:03:47.090> time

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.400 

just<00:03:53.360> try<00:03:53.540> see<00:03:53.870> in<00:03:53.990> different<00:03:54.290> positions

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
just try see in different positions

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:01.300 
just try see in different positions
maybe<00:03:55.040> try<00:03:55.280> two<00:03:55.460> notes<00:03:55.819> try<00:03:56.600> four<00:03:56.900> notes<00:04:00.310> when

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
maybe try two notes try four notes when

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.680 
maybe try two notes try four notes when
you're<00:04:01.459> playing<00:04:01.700> through<00:04:01.940> these<00:04:02.120> court<00:04:02.450> toes

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
you're playing through these court toes

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.360 
you're playing through these court toes
you're<00:04:03.290> pretty<00:04:03.560> much<00:04:03.590> me<00:04:03.860> working<00:04:04.190> with<00:04:04.220> the

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
you're pretty much me working with the

you're pretty much me working with the

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
same set of intervals at any given point

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.490 
same set of intervals at any given point
you're<00:04:06.470> going<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.650> either<00:04:06.830> playing<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.400> third<00:04:07.790> a

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
you're going to either playing a third a

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.520 
you're going to either playing a third a
fit

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
fit

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.080 
fit
or<00:04:10.950> if<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.370> invert<00:04:11.640> it<00:04:11.700> you're<00:04:11.910> going<00:04:12.000> to

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
or if you invert it you're going to

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.410 
or if you invert it you're going to
either<00:04:12.180> have<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.390> fourth<00:04:12.830> or<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:13.890> six<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:15.270> it's

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
either have a fourth or the six so it's

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.680 
either have a fourth or the six so it's
always<00:04:15.600> going<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.750> be<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.019> same<00:04:17.329> kind<00:04:18.329> of<00:04:18.480> hand

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
always going to be the same kind of hand

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.010 

the<00:04:29.790> best<00:04:30.030> way<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.240> do<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:30.450> is<00:04:30.630> in<00:04:30.720> your<00:04:30.810> head

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
the best way to do it is in your head

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.320 
the best way to do it is in your head
just<00:04:31.050> visualize<00:04:31.740> almost<00:04:32.370> like<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.520> grid<00:04:32.850> for

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
just visualize almost like a grid for

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.570 
just visualize almost like a grid for
beats<00:04:33.660> for<00:04:33.990> each<00:04:34.170> of<00:04:34.380> these<00:04:34.500> chords<00:04:34.980> divided

they be whole notes for four counts you

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.180 
they be whole notes for four counts you
can<00:04:52.020> use<00:04:52.140> half<00:04:52.350> notes<00:04:52.650> one<00:04:53.610> two

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
just like that there's quarter notes

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.950 
just like that there's quarter notes
anything<00:05:10.490> you<00:05:10.610> like<00:05:10.820> you<00:05:11.330> don't<00:05:11.480> have<00:05:11.570> to<00:05:11.690> hold

anything you like you don't have to hold

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.020 
anything you like you don't have to hold
these<00:05:12.200> notes<00:05:12.470> down<00:05:12.740> you<00:05:13.160> can<00:05:13.310> bounce<00:05:13.640> off<00:05:14.000> of

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
these notes down you can bounce off of

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:32.540 
these notes down you can bounce off of
them<00:05:14.390> you<00:05:14.990> cannot<00:05:15.350> play

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.750 

you

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.790 

either<00:05:36.360> way<00:05:36.630> just<00:05:36.870> remember<00:05:37.350> stick<00:05:37.590> to<00:05:37.680> these

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
either way just remember stick to these

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.560 
either way just remember stick to these
chord<00:05:38.070> tones<00:05:38.280> keep<00:05:38.670> the<00:05:38.820> beat<00:05:39.000> goin<00:05:39.420> and
