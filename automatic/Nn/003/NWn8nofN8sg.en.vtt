00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.970
 on March 4 , 2000 to sony 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.160
 present to see the world with one of 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.000
 most successful brands in all 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.880
 times 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.369
 playstation 2 hit the market 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.130
 promising revolutionary games 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.000
 using modern dvd technology 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.760
 player 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.519
 the only competitor on the island of sony 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.149
 at the time was dreamcast ultimate device 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:44.280
 produced by the sega that still in 2002 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.089
 a year later, nintendo and microsoft 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.940
 a game club and xbox came into the fray 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.890
 the beginning was not very promising the ps2 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.039
 was much more expensive than its predecessor 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.600
 who still had great games for prices 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.339
 much more affordable 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.069
 Another problem is the delay in manufacturing 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.980
 of the console which made it very difficult 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:07.200
 find it in the stores on the internet was 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.560
 possible to buy the console but for a 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.170
 exorbitant price over a thousand dollars 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.090
 gradually the price was lowered and the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.490
 consumers noted that it was worth 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.439
 have a state-of-the-art console that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.180
 moreover, it was compatible with 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.610
 games in the previous version 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.500
 solis knew that a new era had 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.390
 reached the final 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.159
 none of its competitors did 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.030
 against the powerful video game of 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.030
 company 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.979
 who had an xbox the gamecube after 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.440
 months of use already put the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.310
 device for sale on sites with the clear 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.710
 purpose of acquiring ps2 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.780
 after consolidating in the market in 2004 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.210
 reached the shelves of the whole world 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.360
 a thinner version of playstation 2 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.240
 baptized of slim to promote him it was 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.820
 released together with gta san andrÃ©s 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.820
 one of the best selling console games 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.980
 Another novelty of the ps2 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.540
 ability to play online via 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.940
 of a modem 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.150
 nowadays it is unthinkable a game that does not 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.800
 have an online mode in April 2009 to 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.750
 sony decided to lower the price of 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.709
 playstation 2 at 99 dollars and 99 cents 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.170
 enabling classes of lower power 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.890
 without the conditions to buy the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.320
 consoles of having a good video game 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.510
 even a decade after the PS2 still has 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.830
 launches and lots of people having fun 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.720
 with your games 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.370
 style play to the number of 100 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.190
 millions of units sold worldwide 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.800
 whole after five and a half years 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.000
 years before the time taken by his 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.620
 predecessor the ps 11 in brazil the ps2 still 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.600
 the most popular console among 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.730
 consumers which should largely 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:16.489
 to the football franchise and neither lead to 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.489
 I 'm at the time 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.920
 it was in playstation 2 that arose 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.880
 important franchises of games like 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.440
 guitar heroes and garoa floor another series 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.850
 were consolidated during their dynasty 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.160
 like himself and raise and gta 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.680
 as promised by sony with its 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.110
 10th anniversary comes to an end 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.540
 playstation 2 life 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.550
 so it is very likely that from the 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.350
 next year we will not see more releases 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.660
 to the console 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.900
 a decade later we realize that 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.400
 until the modern one day becomes 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.600
 exceeded 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.600
 Congratulations play 2
