architects<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.559> engineers<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.149> we

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
architects and engineers and we

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.880 
architects and engineers and we
introduce<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.050> today

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
introduce you today

introduce you today
energy-saving<00:00:38.460> house

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.860 

so<00:00:44.460> we're<00:00:44.579> actually<00:00:44.730> standing<00:00:45.390> here<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
so we're actually standing here in the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.630 
so we're actually standing here in the
brain<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.409> the<00:00:46.500> house<00:00:46.679> this<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.129> where<00:00:47.429> it<00:00:47.519> all

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
brain of the house this is where it all

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
brain of the house this is where it all
happens<00:00:48.059> where<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> heat<00:00:48.719> comes<00:00:48.749> and<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
happens where the heat comes and the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.039 
happens where the heat comes and the
heat<00:00:49.589> goes<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.699> this<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.089> yeah<00:00:51.629> that's<00:00:51.899> where

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.049 
heat goes is this it yeah that's where

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.349 
heat goes is this it yeah that's where
we<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:53.399> only<00:00:53.609> let's<00:00:54.149> say<00:00:54.299> two

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
we are and it's only let's say two

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.740 
we are and it's only let's say two
square<00:00:54.899> meters<00:00:55.049> and<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> all<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.750> space

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
square meters and this is all the space

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.869 
square meters and this is all the space
that<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.289> heating<00:00:58.559> system<00:00:58.890> needs<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.729> have

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
that the heating system needs so we have

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.000 
that the heating system needs so we have
the<00:01:00.030> sun<00:01:00.239> shining<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> earth<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the sun shining on the earth and the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.189 
the sun shining on the earth and the
earth<00:01:02.129> actually<00:01:02.489> stores<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.510> solar<00:01:03.750> energy

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
earth actually stores the solar energy

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.550 
earth actually stores the solar energy
and<00:01:04.439> then<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.339> take<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.580> out<00:01:05.789> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.000> ground

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
and then we take it out of the ground

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.830 
and then we take it out of the ground
with<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> circulation<00:01:08.520> system<00:01:09.149> and<00:01:09.179> then<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
with a circulation system and then the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.960 
with a circulation system and then the
heat<00:01:09.960> pump<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.350> able<00:01:10.679> to<00:01:10.799> use<00:01:11.009> this<00:01:11.369> difference

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
heat pump is able to use this difference

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:21.539 
heat pump is able to use this difference
in<00:01:12.210> temperature<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.979> heat<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> house

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.950 

so<00:01:22.549> I'm<00:01:22.670> standing<00:01:22.939> here<00:01:23.119> in<00:01:23.539> front<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:23.869> the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
so I'm standing here in front of the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.200 
so I'm standing here in front of the
house<00:01:24.170> with<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.560> owner<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.159> house<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.759> I

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
house with the owner of the house and I

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.510 
house with the owner of the house and I
wanted<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.539> ask<00:01:26.750> her<00:01:27.079> why<00:01:27.920> did<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:28.219> choose

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
wanted to ask her why did you choose

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.959 
wanted to ask her why did you choose
this<00:01:28.759> location<00:01:29.289> it's<00:01:30.289> quite<00:01:30.890> simple<00:01:31.280> if<00:01:31.429> you

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
this location it's quite simple if you

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.249 
this location it's quite simple if you
can't<00:01:32.240> see<00:01:32.420> it<00:01:32.569> but<00:01:32.719> if<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.929> would<00:01:33.049> turn

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
can't see it but if you would turn

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.910 
can't see it but if you would turn
around<00:01:33.619> there's<00:01:34.009> a<00:01:34.069> fabulous<00:01:34.520> Lake<00:01:35.619> sitting<00:01:36.619> I

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
around there's a fabulous Lake sitting I

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.429 
around there's a fabulous Lake sitting I
don't<00:01:37.399> know<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.759> three<00:01:38.209> minute<00:01:38.360> walk<00:01:38.659> away<00:01:38.959> from

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
don't know a three minute walk away from

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.550 
don't know a three minute walk away from
the<00:01:39.560> place<00:01:39.770> which<00:01:40.069> is<00:01:40.299> really<00:01:41.299> wonderful<00:01:41.780> in

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
the place which is really wonderful in

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.709 
the place which is really wonderful in
the<00:01:42.740> summertime<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.490> could<00:01:43.729> theoretically

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
the summertime you could theoretically

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.440 
the summertime you could theoretically
swim<00:01:45.319> every<00:01:45.829> day<00:01:45.979> especially<00:01:46.909> with

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
swim every day especially with

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.059 
swim every day especially with
everything<00:01:47.539> getting<00:01:47.959> warm<00:01:48.229> all<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.500> time<00:01:48.590> the

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
everything getting warm all the time the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.300 
everything getting warm all the time the
fact<00:01:49.280> that<00:01:49.369> it's<00:01:49.579> sustainable<00:01:49.759> makes<00:01:50.539> it

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
fact that it's sustainable makes it

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.219 
fact that it's sustainable makes it
financially<00:01:52.310> viable<00:01:52.520> because<00:01:53.239> the<00:01:53.479> design<00:01:54.020> of

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
financially viable because the design of

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.819 
financially viable because the design of
the<00:01:54.319> house<00:01:54.500> with<00:01:55.280> its<00:01:55.429> very<00:01:55.700> high<00:01:56.829> gabled

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
the house with its very high gabled

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.179 
the house with its very high gabled
roofs<00:01:58.579> you<00:01:59.500> wouldn't<00:02:00.500> be<00:02:00.560> able<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.799> heat<00:02:01.009> it

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
roofs you wouldn't be able to heat it

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.440 
roofs you wouldn't be able to heat it
here<00:02:01.399> because<00:02:01.670> of<00:02:01.849> the<00:02:01.939> temperature

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
here because of the temperature

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.959 
here because of the temperature
differences<00:02:02.929> I<00:02:03.110> guess<00:02:03.319> in<00:02:03.729> particularly<00:02:04.729> in

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
differences I guess in particularly in

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.209 
differences I guess in particularly in
this<00:02:05.149> part<00:02:05.629> of<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:05.780> world<00:02:06.020> they<00:02:06.349> go<00:02:06.530> from<00:02:06.860> in

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
this part of the world they go from in

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.339 
this part of the world they go from in
the<00:02:07.340> summer<00:02:07.549> time<00:02:07.849> up<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.360> almost<00:02:08.539> 40<00:02:08.959> degrees

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
the summer time up to almost 40 degrees

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.000 
the summer time up to almost 40 degrees
