00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 I will fight at the National Stadium of the New Year, and its semifinals now 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:13.110
 The game is started with a kickoff of Gamba Osaka with a mechanism 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:16.680
 I'm talking about say large When was it you can be lead then I Well, most of the high 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.070
 I think it is this position that brings out the taste, but speed from the surfer 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.210
 rg Spring is back again 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.270
 Gumbar This is probably not the case Gamba also have a quarterfinal set in the final point 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.450
 It was a long time from this Endo's free kick 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.480
 Wedding I went around but a short corner 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.480
 Futagawa Endo fast ball golden tee 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.829
 I met directly 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:45.159
 Gamba Osaka match at best 3-23 minutes 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.159
 Endo who went around the hall to the boat cult aimed at a goal at a stretch 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.110
 Exercise skill shoot 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.690
 It is very 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.550
 Though it is change , but it is beautiful 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.850
 The tempo was fast, and the shoot was like Kashima's failure to respond. 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.230
 I think 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:06.420
 Let's take a look Cocos This ball was quickest, this return was also fast 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.420
 But I hit it again earlier 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:15.050
 I entered a place where there is only here as a course 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.740
 Oh yeah in the bottom corner of this 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.689
 Gamba Osaka teacher 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.689
 I want faces it there is hot water in the Gamba players 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.649
 I went to the finals with a bedrock 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.780
 Disappointing and painful season but its last 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.330
 The reason why I got the ticket to buy Setoda 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.460
 It is Gamba Osaka 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.460
 I decided to go into the final for the first time in 3 years 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:56.920
 The challenge of Kashima Antlers and the coach at 10 o'clock is over 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:01.450
 No, but juniors say they should handle their own flow 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.710
 The challenger was seen many times Well speaking in the latter half of the contents 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.970
 I think it was a flow 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.039
 But I think that it was, however Well missing parts of Kashima that could not break it 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.180
 But 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.870
 It is the end of those of one of the Gamba was pulled suffering suffering 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:20.030
 We arrived at the best system to save the player 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.030
 I received such an impression today
