00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
go one side will be that way and the

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:50.040 
go one side will be that way and the
other<00:00:41.800> will<00:00:42.010> be<00:00:42.040> this<00:00:42.310> way<00:00:48.450> go<00:00:49.450> up<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:49.870> little

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
we're going to make another line over

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:20.010 
we're going to make another line over
here<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:13.080> also<00:01:14.080> on<00:01:14.290> this<00:01:14.470> side<00:01:16.979> very<00:01:17.979> good<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
now we're just going to divide that over

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:29.340 
now we're just going to divide that over
