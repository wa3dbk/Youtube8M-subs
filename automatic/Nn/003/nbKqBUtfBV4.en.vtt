00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.910
 This is it, the people here are talking 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.960
 hobby one and this time the event bringing 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.980
 a video of program tips as well as 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.190
 like this 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.139
 weird is a good program to 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.320
 win bope 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.359
 I always use a certain program to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.359
 people are doing the classes that the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.130
 sketchbook but the staff always asks 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.830
 It's the best program in my land. 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.099
 using such then I've been bringing 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.899
 here's one that's free 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.290
 so it turns out to be very interesting 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:46.850
 if you use the program name correctly 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.850
 it's hotter it's inscribed on top right 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:03.120
 that this program meets legal 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:05.280
 good first it 's program 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.810
 free drawing is not a defect for 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.580
 linux but also works on windows and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.520
 You may be downloading and I'll leave the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.310
 link in his legal description is that he 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.430
 works great in configurations as well. 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.619
 interesting for those who draws high 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.560
 pressures and searched the internet 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.470
 search on youtube same you go 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.320
 find several videos being made are 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.540
 made with it and it has a 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.979
 very interesting configuration with 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.170
 some parts do not like flame if 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.810
 here is a brush list to everything in 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.680
 Portuguese only has several if you click 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.659
 here o 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.060
 when you are the program it opens like this 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.610
 How do you find the brushes? 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.540
 first come here 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.650
 in this brush symbol is right here 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.600
 in the menu né 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.010
 but if you click here at the end 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.140
 it will open a flap is that I think of 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.810
 sex that you may be using has a 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.910
 classic experimental favorites that 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.440
 obviously I think you're going to favor 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.210
 to use set 2 whose three in 123 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.300
 of course not 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.120
 good one that is interesting because 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.450
 they are common to use this goat 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.550
 here is also a color triangle 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.400
 she also has a body picker 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.950
 cool 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.250
 well his way and let me put 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.250
 here in the center for you to see is 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.970
 The way you can is mixing the 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.650
 your drawings as for example you can 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.780
 starting with pencil is not conventional 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.780
 and go out doing normal barbecue 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:03.200
 auditioning years is good to make a 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:06.310
 character palette certain beauty scandal 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.310
 he here on the mouse 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.990
 remembering that the character palette that I 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.670
 I do a little more elaborate as 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.620
 I told everyone to do it, huh? 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.500
 already training in your character that 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:23.240
 you cooler than the other 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.460
 Very well, okay, here are the laws that you 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.200
 may be changing is interesting that it is 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.030
 the first layer you clicked on 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.590
 can give an opacity here in 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.950
 low getting invisible legally to 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.080
 when you are going to make a draft and 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.360
 now you want to make a painted business 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:48.800
 even then just click on the ink that 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:52.490
 yesterday brush out can also use her or 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.740
 you can also use this one that leaves a 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.780
 only she has a certain delay like 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.050
 her name says nothing 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.110
 there are several pens several things that 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.750
 You can be testing before you leave. 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:10.070
 doing the drawing ends up being well 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.550
 interesting even this set 2 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:17.299
 I have several items that I think are really cool 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:21.049
 is working on something else way 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:24.680
 that he has is that you can mix the 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.050
 parts you may be making your 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.750
 design here I will not do the design 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.370
 not changed my mind we will explain a 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.310
 little on the brush 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.660
 You choose something right there, let's go. 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.170
 put a red 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.910
 here we paint your eventual now you 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:46.810
 will choose blue put the color blue 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.380
 He kind of blends almost 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.240
 automatic 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:58.940
 is using these pathologies here 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:03.500
 you can create a bizarre mix is 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:05.180
 more or less so it 's cool here how much 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.200
 the further you make it clearer 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.480
 stay right then showing how you 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.340
 you may be mixing your drawing and 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.970
 it also depends on the police officer you use 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.680
 There are several things that have a sponge model. 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:23.780
 Let's see if this sponge comes back thinking 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:27.590
 even cool is with people who she 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.450
 Look at your ink 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.400
 So you can make it clearer in the 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:37.550
 coolest songs this is interesting 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.110
 We also have the toe here after we smoke. 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:44.150
 in the same hand 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.620
 if you take a pencil and scratch it talking 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:52.460
 on plain paper, né 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:56.720
 you take your pencil there risk - up and 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:59.990
 you take your finger at risk for one 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.410
 shading so to speak, but there 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.810
 the word he does so then that is O 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.450
 program simulates this is very interesting 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:12.470
 There are several things you really can do. 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:16.610
 be using it is really worth 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:18.800
 test and like I said it's free 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.380
 so it's great for those who are learning 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.930
 to draw very well this is going to be a 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.050
 short video only of tips even like 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.900
 use this program it works with the 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.060
 tablet'm not I use one of the bamboo 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.220
 the bamboo with that little 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.040
 works very well but one can be 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.140
 also using a genius have to 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.080
 other brands and such but worth it 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.660
 then search the programinha for pc 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.920
 that you can draw here in the 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.110
 your right hand 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.540
