the<00:02:06.060> set<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:06.570> installation<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.710> such<00:02:07.950> guide<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
the set up installation and such guide a

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.600 
the set up installation and such guide a
bunch<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.679> information

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
bunch of information

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.210 
bunch of information
and<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.540> probably<00:02:12.870> should<00:02:13.170> read<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.830> I

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
and I probably should read but I I

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.210 
and I probably should read but I I
haven't<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.050> currently<00:02:16.050> my<00:02:16.110> PC<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.680> not<00:02:16.710> on

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
haven't so currently my PC is not on

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.020 
haven't so currently my PC is not on
fire<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.880> hope<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.680> yeah<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:22.520> down<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
fire I hope but yeah and down in the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.030 
fire I hope but yeah and down in the
bottom<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.300> here<00:02:24.570> we<00:02:24.720> have<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> ton<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.590> cables

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
bottom of here we have a ton of cables

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.600 
bottom of here we have a ton of cables
and<00:02:26.160> as<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.790> said<00:02:26.850> before<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:28.130> repackage<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.400> so

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
and as I said before I repackage this so

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.580 
and as I said before I repackage this so
as<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.790> can<00:02:29.880> see<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.150> wires<00:02:30.420> put<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:31.320> I

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
as you can see this wires put in like I

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.690 
as you can see this wires put in like I
don't<00:02:32.430> know<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> piece<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.630> Boop<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.700> didn't

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
don't know a piece of Boop I didn't

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.030 
don't know a piece of Boop I didn't
really<00:02:35.940> care<00:02:36.660> about<00:02:36.780> holding<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.680> back<00:02:37.830> up

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
really care about holding it back up

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.440 
really care about holding it back up
like<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.340> came<00:02:38.610> because<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.970> didn't<00:02:39.240> have<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
like it came because I didn't have the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.940 
like it came because I didn't have the
original<00:02:39.840> little<00:02:40.080> wires<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.620> hold<00:02:40.800> it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
original little wires to hold it

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.740 
original little wires to hold it
together<00:02:41.100> but<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.030> tried<00:02:42.240> my<00:02:42.360> best

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
together but I tried my best

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.100 
together but I tried my best
and<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.200> also<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.190> package<00:02:44.910> there<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:46.080> a

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
and then also in that package there is a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.840 
and then also in that package there is a
little<00:02:46.590> cable<00:02:46.740> here<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.250> no<00:02:47.340> idea<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.670> what

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
little cable here I have no idea of what

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.630 
little cable here I have no idea of what
it<00:02:47.940> was<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.510> first<00:02:48.690> cable<00:02:49.620> was<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.280> power

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
it was but the first cable was the power

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.780 
it was but the first cable was the power
cable<00:02:51.450> these<00:02:52.440> two<00:02:52.709> cables<00:02:52.920> seemed<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.610> be

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
cable these two cables seemed to be

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.480 
cable these two cables seemed to be
power<00:02:54.390> cables<00:02:54.870> for<00:02:55.230> internal<00:02:55.860> parts<00:02:56.220> like<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
power cables for internal parts like the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.640 
power cables for internal parts like the
graphics<00:02:56.880> card<00:02:57.120> although<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.050> power<00:02:58.230> supply

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
graphics card although the power supply

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.160 
graphics card although the power supply
I<00:02:58.920> believe<00:02:59.190> is<00:02:59.340> at<00:02:59.459> 230<00:03:00.240> watts<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.840> don't

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
I believe is at 230 watts so I don't

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.390 
I believe is at 230 watts so I don't
really<00:03:01.230> know<00:03:01.440> what<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> point<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.920> including

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
really know what the point of including

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.390 
really know what the point of including
those<00:03:02.580> are<00:03:03.470> what<00:03:04.470> at<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.709> point<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.040> them<00:03:05.190> is

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
those are what at the point of them is

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.010 
those are what at the point of them is
because<00:03:06.090> you're<00:03:06.330> not<00:03:06.420> going<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.600> be<00:03:06.660> upgrading

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
because you're not going to be upgrading

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.540 
because you're not going to be upgrading
with<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.200> 20<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.530> 30<00:03:07.709> watt<00:03:07.920> power<00:03:08.100> supply

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
with the 20 to 30 watt power supply

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.910 
with the 20 to 30 watt power supply
right<00:03:08.820> here<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.420> also<00:03:10.230> want<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.440> apologize<00:03:10.620> just

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
the PC itself and right there looked

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.600 
the PC itself and right there looked
like<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.350> was<00:03:25.410> kind<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.620> struggling<00:03:25.860> but<00:03:26.310> it's

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
like I was kind of struggling but it's

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.479 
like I was kind of struggling but it's
actually<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.150> very<00:03:27.209> light<00:03:27.959> PC<00:03:28.530> which<00:03:29.220> i<00:03:29.430> think

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
actually a very light PC which i think

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.120 
actually a very light PC which i think
is<00:03:29.760> awesome<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:33.680> there<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.709> cut<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.040> video

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
is awesome and there I cut the video

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.920 
is awesome and there I cut the video
because<00:03:35.519> my<00:03:35.790> face<00:03:36.060> was<00:03:36.090> in<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:36.870> don't

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930

so here I flip it over just to get this
tape<00:03:41.400> off<00:03:41.610> at<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.940> bottom<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:42.840> let's<00:03:42.870> slip

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
tape off at the bottom so let's slip

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.820 
tape off at the bottom so let's slip
this<00:03:43.590> off<00:03:44.570> without<00:03:45.570> ripping<00:03:46.019> it
