ahead and press that button now you as
you<00:02:02.159> already<00:02:02.340> seen<00:02:02.670> my<00:02:02.880> printhead<00:02:03.359> is<00:02:03.509> raised

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
you already seen my printhead is raised

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.020 
you already seen my printhead is raised
up<00:02:04.109> so<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.979> do<00:02:05.100> not<00:02:05.249> have<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.609> raise<00:02:05.820> up<00:02:05.999> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
up so we do not have to raise up the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.440 
up so we do not have to raise up the
printhead<00:02:06.539> all<00:02:07.200> we<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.590> do

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
printhead all we have to do

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.150 
printhead all we have to do
after<00:02:08.690> inserting<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.229> filament<00:02:09.649> is<00:02:09.800> hit<00:02:09.979> the

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
after inserting the filament is hit the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.610 
after inserting the filament is hit the
load<00:02:10.369> filament<00:02:10.940> button<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:12.020> that's<00:02:12.200> going<00:02:12.470> to

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
load filament button and that's going to

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.920 
load filament button and that's going to
cause<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.069> warm<00:02:13.250> up<00:02:13.489> now<00:02:13.819> mine<00:02:14.569> was<00:02:14.720> already

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
cause it to warm up now mine was already

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.979 
cause it to warm up now mine was already
warm<00:02:15.319> so<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:15.830> went<00:02:16.040> real<00:02:16.280> quick<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:17.090> we

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
warm so it went real quick and we

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.839 
warm so it went real quick and we
grabbed<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.500> I'll<00:02:19.160> show<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.459> here<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:22.280> if

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
grabbed it I'll show you here it is if

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.270 
grabbed it I'll show you here it is if
you<00:02:23.000> can<00:02:23.150> tell<00:02:23.360> ever<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:23.780> slightly<00:02:24.160> pulling<00:02:25.160> in

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
you can tell ever so slightly pulling in

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.470 
you can tell ever so slightly pulling in
the<00:02:25.370> filament<00:02:27.370> in<00:02:28.370> just<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:28.790> minute<00:02:28.910> you'll<00:02:29.239> see

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.900 

out<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.690> bottom<00:02:33.340> we<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.400> get<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.580> better<00:02:34.700> angle

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
out the bottom we can get a better angle

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.780 
out the bottom we can get a better angle
a<00:02:35.470> little<00:02:36.470> dark<00:02:36.680> in<00:02:36.830> here<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.160> filament<00:02:37.670> is

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
a little dark in here the filament is

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:54.010 
a little dark in here the filament is
now<00:02:38.030> coming<00:02:38.269> out<00:02:38.799> it's<00:02:39.799> just<00:02:40.280> that<00:02:40.459> simple

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.620 

okay<00:02:54.710> now<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:55.580> filament<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:56.120> in<00:02:56.330> and

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
okay now that the filament is in and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.620 
okay now that the filament is in and
coming<00:02:57.110> out<00:02:57.290> we<00:02:57.890> need<00:02:58.070> to<00:02:58.370> add<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.850> profile<00:02:59.390> for

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
coming out we need to add a profile for

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.050 
coming out we need to add a profile for
the<00:02:59.720> filament<00:03:00.140> as<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.740> see<00:03:01.010> it's<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.910> blue

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
the filament as you see it's a blue

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.690 
the filament as you see it's a blue
filament<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:02.720> my<00:03:03.140> thing<00:03:03.350> says<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.770> have<00:03:03.980> had

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
filament and my thing says I have had

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.210 
filament and my thing says I have had
great<00:03:05.120> loaded<00:03:05.690> in<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.590> now<00:03:06.740> we're<00:03:06.920> going<00:03:07.100> to

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
great loaded in so now we're going to

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.240 
great loaded in so now we're going to
add<00:03:07.970> profile<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.590> you'll<00:03:09.710> see<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:09.980> gives<00:03:10.130> you

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
add profile and you'll see it gives you

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.680 
add profile and you'll see it gives you
a<00:03:10.280> couple<00:03:10.520> different<00:03:10.610> options<00:03:11.860> standard<00:03:12.860> abs

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
a couple different options standard abs

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.100 
a couple different options standard abs
in<00:03:14.690> 3d<00:03:15.110> abs<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:16.040> 3d<00:03:16.280> PLA<00:03:16.730> that's<00:03:17.630> their<00:03:17.960> new

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
in 3d abs and 3d PLA that's their new

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.840 
in 3d abs and 3d PLA that's their new
chameleon<00:03:18.680> that's<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:18.980> color-changing<00:03:19.640> that's

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
chameleon that's a color-changing that's

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.000 
chameleon that's a color-changing that's
a<00:03:19.940> good<00:03:20.120> one<00:03:20.560> but<00:03:21.560> we<00:03:21.680> have<00:03:21.830> a<00:03:21.860> standard<00:03:22.340> PLA

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
a good one but we have a standard PLA

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.690 
a good one but we have a standard PLA
color<00:03:25.090> would<00:03:26.090> be<00:03:26.240> blue<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:27.100> it's<00:03:28.100> our<00:03:28.340> draw<00:03:28.670> I

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
color would be blue and it's our draw I

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.640 
color would be blue and it's our draw I
don't<00:03:29.030> know<00:03:29.120> how<00:03:29.240> many<00:03:29.300> feet<00:03:29.840> are<00:03:29.990> on<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.350> so

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
don't know how many feet are on it so

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.630 
don't know how many feet are on it so
yeah<00:03:31.220> 250<00:03:32.380> it's<00:03:33.380> very<00:03:33.650> important<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.310> set<00:03:34.490> up

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
yeah 250 it's very important to set up

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.520 
yeah 250 it's very important to set up
the<00:03:34.760> profiles<00:03:35.180> like<00:03:35.390> that<00:03:35.630> that<00:03:35.960> way<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.200> know

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
the profiles like that that way you know

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.830 
the profiles like that that way you know
that<00:03:36.860> you've<00:03:37.790> printing<00:03:38.300> at<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.480> proper

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
that you've printing at the proper

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.530 
that you've printing at the proper
temperature<00:03:39.350> up<00:03:39.530> abs<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.520> printing<00:03:41.330> it<00:03:41.420> at

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
temperature up abs is printing it at

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.680 
temperature up abs is printing it at
different<00:03:41.840> temperatures<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:42.530> say<00:03:42.740> a<00:03:43.040> PLA<00:03:43.940> and

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
different temperatures and say a PLA and

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.360 
different temperatures and say a PLA and
that<00:03:44.870> can<00:03:44.990> affect<00:03:45.110> your<00:03:45.380> print<00:03:45.710> quality<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:46.100> lot

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
that can affect your print quality a lot

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.570 
that can affect your print quality a lot
so<00:03:46.730> make<00:03:46.880> sure<00:03:47.030> that's<00:03:47.210> proper<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:52.370> last

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
so make sure that's proper the last

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.820 
so make sure that's proper the last
obvious<00:03:53.150> button<00:03:53.570> that<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.380> didn't<00:03:54.650> show<00:03:54.770> you

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
obvious button that I didn't show you

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.560 
obvious button that I didn't show you
before<00:03:55.010> that<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.460> obviously<00:03:55.970> should<00:03:56.360> have

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
before that I obviously should have

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.740 
before that I obviously should have
would<00:03:57.170> be<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.380> remove<00:03:57.860> button<00:03:58.270> very<00:03:59.270> simple

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
would be the remove button very simple

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.340 
would be the remove button very simple
if<00:04:00.350> you're<00:04:00.560> wanting<00:04:00.800> to<00:04:00.860> remove<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.340> filament

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
if you're wanting to remove the filament

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.140 
if you're wanting to remove the filament
you<00:04:03.350> hit<00:04:03.700> obviously<00:04:04.700> we<00:04:04.790> haven't<00:04:04.940> loaded

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
you hit obviously we haven't loaded

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.780 
you hit obviously we haven't loaded
externally<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:06.140> remove<00:04:06.500> filament<00:04:06.980> external

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
externally so remove filament external

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.170 
externally so remove filament external
brings<00:04:08.630> up<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.960> same<00:04:09.170> screen<00:04:09.610> our<00:04:10.610> print<00:04:11.030> head

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
brings up the same screen our print head

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.660 
brings up the same screen our print head
is<00:04:11.360> still<00:04:11.630> in<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.870> up<00:04:12.050> position<00:04:12.340> so<00:04:13.340> no<00:04:13.520> need

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
is still in the up position so no need

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.250 
is still in the up position so no need
to<00:04:13.730> do<00:04:13.940> that<00:04:14.080> we<00:04:15.080> just<00:04:15.320> hit<00:04:15.530> just<00:04:15.890> like<00:04:15.950> before

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
to do that we just hit just like before

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.760 
to do that we just hit just like before
remove<00:04:18.260> filament<00:04:18.799> now<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.280> will<00:04:19.460> pop<00:04:19.670> up

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
remove filament now it will pop up

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:29.040 
remove filament now it will pop up
-<00:04:21.770> hot<00:04:21.980> so<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.400> came<00:04:22.580> quick<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:27.050> can<00:04:27.080> see

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
- hot so it came quick and you can see
