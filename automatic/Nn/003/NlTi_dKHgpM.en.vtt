this<00:00:06.710> is<00:00:07.100> a<00:00:07.130> reed<00:00:07.400> cutter<00:00:07.700> reed<00:00:08.480> cutters<00:00:08.900> come

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:09.350 
this is a reed cutter reed cutters come

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.200 
this is a reed cutter reed cutters come
in<00:00:09.500> all<00:00:09.710> shapes<00:00:10.220> and<00:00:10.550> sizes

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
in all shapes and sizes

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.640 
in all shapes and sizes
depending<00:00:11.780> on<00:00:11.840> the<00:00:11.960> single<00:00:12.260> reeds<00:00:12.469> you're

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
depending on the single reeds you're

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.500 
depending on the single reeds you're
working<00:00:12.950> on<00:00:13.070> and<00:00:13.310> right<00:00:13.940> now<00:00:14.090> we're<00:00:14.330> going<00:00:14.450> to

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
working on and right now we're going to

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.450 
working on and right now we're going to
show<00:00:14.690> the<00:00:14.870> proper<00:00:15.230> use<00:00:15.410> of<00:00:15.440> the<00:00:15.710> reed<00:00:16.250> cutter

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
show the proper use of the reed cutter

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.370 
show the proper use of the reed cutter
so<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:16.910> reed<00:00:17.060> cutter<00:00:17.270> has<00:00:17.510> three<00:00:17.779> basic<00:00:18.200> parts

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
so the reed cutter has three basic parts

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.160 
so the reed cutter has three basic parts
you<00:00:19.040> have<00:00:19.250> your<00:00:19.640> latch<00:00:19.910> here<00:00:20.330> that<00:00:20.630> opens<00:00:20.990> and

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
you have your latch here that opens and

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.470 
you have your latch here that opens and
closes<00:00:21.380> that<00:00:21.560> holds<00:00:22.039> the<00:00:22.160> reed<00:00:22.310> on<00:00:22.460> you<00:00:23.240> have

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
closes that holds the reed on you have

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.529 
closes that holds the reed on you have
your<00:00:24.199> slider<00:00:24.980> here<00:00:25.400> which<00:00:25.789> changes<00:00:26.330> the

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
your slider here which changes the

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.769 
your slider here which changes the
direction<00:00:26.720> or<00:00:27.260> the<00:00:27.640> length<00:00:28.640> of<00:00:28.940> tip<00:00:29.510> coming

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
direction or the length of tip coming

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.480 
direction or the length of tip coming
out<00:00:29.960> of<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:30.140> top<00:00:30.320> and<00:00:30.560> then<00:00:31.100> you<00:00:31.130> have<00:00:31.340> your

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
out of the top and then you have your

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.790 
out of the top and then you have your
cutting<00:00:31.820> device<00:00:31.939> up<00:00:32.300> here<00:00:32.480> at<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:32.689> top

how to use a reed cutter reed cutters
are<00:00:42.590> not<00:00:42.980> super<00:00:43.340> complicated<00:00:43.699> but<00:00:44.180> everything

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
are not super complicated but everything

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.689 
are not super complicated but everything
needs<00:00:44.840> to<00:00:44.930> be<00:00:45.019> lined<00:00:45.379> up<00:00:45.500> exactly<00:00:45.710> right<00:00:46.129> so

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
needs to be lined up exactly right so

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.520 
needs to be lined up exactly right so
the<00:00:46.820> two<00:00:47.059> big<00:00:47.360> things<00:00:47.600> you<00:00:47.809> need<00:00:47.989> a<00:00:48.019> coarser

erie cutter in your reed the reed will
work<00:00:51.199> best<00:00:51.530> if<00:00:51.890> it's<00:00:52.039> dry<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:53.239> more<00:00:53.449> quality

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
work best if it's dry the more quality

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
reed cutter you have you can the more

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.660 
reed cutter you have you can the more
wet<00:00:56.719> your<00:00:56.989> reed<00:00:57.170> can<00:00:57.409> be<00:00:57.559> when<00:00:57.949> you<00:00:58.129> cut<00:00:58.489> them

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
wet your reed can be when you cut them

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.430 
wet your reed can be when you cut them
if<00:00:59.059> you<00:00:59.180> have<00:00:59.360> a<00:00:59.390> really<00:00:59.690> low<00:00:59.839> quality<00:00:59.989> one

doesn't matter too much how much of the
tip<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:24.649> in<00:01:24.800> there<00:01:24.979> yet<00:01:25.220> because<00:01:25.580> we<00:01:25.729> can<00:01:25.909> use

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
tip is in there yet because we can use

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.300 
tip is in there yet because we can use
our<00:01:26.240> little<00:01:26.420> slider<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:27.560> adjust<00:01:27.950> that<00:01:28.100> later

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
our little slider to adjust that later

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.139 
our little slider to adjust that later
on<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:33.440> next<00:01:33.619> part<00:01:33.979> is<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.190> tricky<00:01:34.759> one<00:01:34.789> you

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
on the next part is the tricky one you

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.880 
on the next part is the tricky one you
want<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.450> line<00:01:35.630> everything<00:01:35.810> up<00:01:36.259> very<00:01:36.799> very

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
want to line everything up very very

well so looking here you want to see
that<00:01:39.679> there's<00:01:39.860> reed<00:01:40.100> on<00:01:40.310> either<00:01:40.610> side<00:01:41.030> as<00:01:41.810> well

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
that there's reed on either side as well

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.740 
that there's reed on either side as well
as<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.380> little<00:01:42.770> bit<00:01:42.890> at<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.160> tip<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:43.750> want

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
as a little bit at the tip and you want

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.740 
as a little bit at the tip and you want
everything<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.110> be<00:01:45.289> nice<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.739> straight<00:01:46.750> now

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
everything to be nice and straight now

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.800 
everything to be nice and straight now
remember<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:48.500> can<00:01:48.679> always<00:01:48.979> take<00:01:49.489> more<00:01:50.300> off

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
remember you can always take more off

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.859 
remember you can always take more off
you<00:01:51.679> can<00:01:51.860> never<00:01:52.069> put<00:01:52.369> more<00:01:52.610> back<00:01:52.910> on<00:01:53.209> so<00:01:53.840> I

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
you can never put more back on so I

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.710 
you can never put more back on so I
always<00:01:54.319> suggest<00:01:54.619> cutting<00:01:55.160> in<00:01:55.489> little<00:01:56.479> tiny

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
always suggest cutting in little tiny

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.869 
always suggest cutting in little tiny
slivers<00:01:57.289> and<00:01:57.530> that's<00:01:58.129> where<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:58.550> use<00:01:58.580> your

00:01:58.869 --> 00:01:58.879 
slivers and that's where you use your

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:02.020 
slivers and that's where you use your
adjuster<00:01:59.629> here<00:01:59.959> and<00:02:00.170> if<00:02:01.099> you<00:02:01.280> need<00:02:01.459> to<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:01.910> can

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
adjuster here and if you need to you can

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.300 
adjuster here and if you need to you can
use<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.239> finger<00:02:02.509> back<00:02:02.810> here<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.830> make<00:02:04.160> it

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
use a finger back here to make it
