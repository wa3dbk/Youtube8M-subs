00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.569
 Another package with aliexpress is this 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.940
 A package that was waiting and very 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.820
 very worried now open with 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.769

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.070
 electrical goods never cleared 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.300

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.490
 lanta sites here 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.550

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.499
 shellac or gel polish and here frezer with 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:38.560
 by which you can do hardware 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:40.540
 manicure means opening don't know there or 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:46.270
 there is no better like ears packed 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:51.160
 this helps to protect the goods from damage 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:01:03.400
 and here are the pimples oh god she's even without 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:01:12.790
 boxes and suddenly working not whether not 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:18.220
 apparently the camera should not be worth it here 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:21.640
 Means lamp frezer and I with my 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.900

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.900
 I want to learn how to do a hardware manicure 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.580
 looked on the internet and read about 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.790
 despised by which does 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.790
 hardware manicure is recommended not 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.650
 novice beginners to take devices 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.040
 not very resourceful 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.619
 can damage the cuticle nails and so 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.909
 further so what it consists of 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:53.530
 here is such a pen so here 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.420
 you can adjust the speed maximum 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.610
 in my 20,000 rpm, I leave the link 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.720
 read there understand such 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.049
 here and here in the kit 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.600
 A set of cutters is included or how they are correct 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.700
 are called for the router and 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.690
 you must mean this part is also from 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.690
 phaser and this is ours 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.740
 transition 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.280
 on reserve but who understands the parameters 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.800
 You can see what the parameters are 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.670
 220 volts should be supported 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.160
 now try 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:37.220
 it seems so worried about this business is inserted 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.770
 here let's open some one 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.110
 most 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:49.610
 packed hands are shaking I'm so worried 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:55.480
 I will not work I can open 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:59.240
 box so here we take some 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:04.640
 tip tip seemingly know 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:07.150
 such as leg then insert it Show me 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.010
 do 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.690
 so well let's turn on the bitch know 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.710
 It turns on so you need to hold this button 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:22.510
 unplug the socket and insert it here 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.510
 then holding this button we spin 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.700
 now turn on my outlet here next 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:52.109
 Rosita which is just convenient and this 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:54.180
 a switch on a bitch, I understand 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.780
 there is no reverse movement it is only in 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.879
 I'm going to try one side 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.519
 watched only video never to myself 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.680
 did not do a hardware manicure 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.510
 There are such for which went to 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.909
 complete also ordered a separate 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.769
 question the pace set on a task there by 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.169
 my ceramic some iron 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.870
 I will learn suddenly I like it 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:18.229
 make a manicure and most friends and how 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.599
 says to everyone here is such a milling cutter 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:24.050
 the site stated that up to 18,000 rpm 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:29.729
 but I don't know how hard it is to believe 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.760
 try and Kazan it costs me 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:38.810
 said milling cutter costs 8 dollars 85 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.810
 cents and ordered so I lamp 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:05:02.599
 such it costs 20 cents to come in here 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.599
 this item 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:20.400
 inserted is not scary to get it 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:37.750
 i.e. they tried the lamp pad 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:39.940
 secure and now we are back 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.860
 insert into this surface according to the idea 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:53.920
 there must be something mirrored it like 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:55.720
 this film is 21 still say quality 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.570
 lamps in plastic quality 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:03.130
 sorry for the expression garena i'm here 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:08.110
 some kind of badly made 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:13.150
 he is such a shoddy that 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:15.460
 here there is a button here on it 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:20.260
 get turn off there is a primer on 2 on 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:23.340
 120 minutes there is such I do not know who 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.530
 knows write and when ordering necessarily 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:30.270
 you should have chosen 220 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.270
 volt they have there two kinds of these lamps 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.710
 for our networks 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:50.039
 it works one it works not 

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:53.259
 earned all all four lamps work 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:56.889
 I will try to do is such a manicure 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.449
 I again emphasize the package found 26 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:00.369
 days 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:02.609
 then you need to experiment 

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:02.609
 sample 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.000
 so I tried to make hardware 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.760
 manicure using the device for which 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.180
 which ordered and nozzles 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:19.390
 which came in another parcel means 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.280
 what i want to say is while your hands are shaking bye 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:25.360
 you fail on something tried and 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:29.410
 covered gel varnishes that bought as well 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:32.380
 in china here is number 1604 such zolotnichny 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.770
 there is less colorless such gel 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.930
 varnish 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.970
 because while hands are shaking while I am so 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.310
 do not cover with serious color here 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.900
 set the lamp to work fine timer 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.900
 unfortunately there is such a minute 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:47.550
 I would like for a minute to be with 

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.550
 I still need to learn how to use the router.
