 Hello everyone, the channel is without wires and 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.519
 the topic of today's video lesson is like 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.640
 Turn on the wifi on the laptop Yulik because 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.900
 Well, first I want to say that not all 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.050
 so simple and straightforward as it happens with 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.990
 manufacturers of other laptops 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.410
 popular 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:33.160
 manufacturing companies that is here very 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.980
 Much depends on the model because as 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.430
 would be a great variety and practically on 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.790
 power button for each laptop model 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.239
 Wi Fi is always in the new 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.949
 place for some reason not in this question about 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.129
 manufacturer of some kind of stability 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.920
 unambiguity but I want to say right away that 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.550
 more often 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.239
 Wifi button on laptops 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.979
 from php rst including meets 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.800
 programmed f12 key 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:10.300
 Here is an image known to all 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.380
 Turn on Wi Fi antenna with waves and 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.520
 here it is programmed under f12 but 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.270
 Often there are models 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.850
 me filip picket where this button she 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.760
 for example, just separate wi-fi that is 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.250
 there is no insanity mark here this f12 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.560
 that is, 12 is a separate button that 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.780
 Wi fi is a separate button here 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.510
 is found although it goes among the common 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.840
 buttons happens that the button Wi fi 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.900
 generally located somewhere on 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:47.650
 The enclosure is not separately included in a 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:50.350
 keyboard unit and also happens as 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.340
 wi-fi button 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.120
 programmed elsewhere that is 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.070
 not in on f12 and with that just need 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.100
 carefully study the keyboard can 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.040
 be watch instruction specifically 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.690
 I want this laptop model 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.649
 add another very important feature 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.390
 which distinguishes their laptop or tracked 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.370
 from many other laptops 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.680
 this feature is that 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.680
 programming of these functional 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.410
 keys it is available to the user and 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.170
 this is done in the bios settings but 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.790
 default not if you are bios setting not 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.010
 did not change anything then 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.540
 default what is the essence 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.220
 programming soup essence 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.100
 programming this is 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.380
 To activate these functions, they gave 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.380
 by simply pressing either pressing for example 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.600
 via 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.500
 use of this functional 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.780
 fn keys 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.800
 so here is often the default function 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.080
 here they are additional buttons 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.340
 work without pressing the fn key that is 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.100
 in order to enable wi-fi you 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.140
 just press at 12 they like it in 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.000
 other laptops first click with 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.690
 one finger and second click 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.240
 so here it is often the case that 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.640
 people press fpn presses a button 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.600
 wifi on laptop keyboards 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.120
 electrician 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.100
 wi-fi is not included for this simply 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.650
 try pressing them without fn repeat that 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.010
 This is a feature of these laptops and 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.540
 This feature can be configured bios and 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.760
 Basically, this is all about 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.950
 inclusion features or rather inclusion 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.110
 wifi on laptops policy with you was 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.000
 channel without wires all the while and remember 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.810
 that any problem can be solved 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.810
 the main thing is to know how
