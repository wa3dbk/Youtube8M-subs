 I will see again 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.059
 miramar record 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.779
 they said that 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.959
 and if we want to record a new much 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.970
 could continue with the one we live explained that in this case as we have not 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.739
 said nothing 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.779
 but you should not continue 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.429
 riquelme continued

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.140
 and that's what we're going to do now we're going to win a big 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.740
 and when we determine 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.150
 my mom to finish it 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.150
 and I will explain how it is done 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.770
 in another section of the avenue 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.340
 but we must not forget that it does 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.340
 from the stands 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:32.289
 here we have the colorado 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.899
 much has been fought for 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:41.779
 true 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:42.829
 keep 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.079
 because I wanted her 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.389
 of doing 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.479
 Agüere sports area 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.539
 another record 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:51.279
 for what 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:54.279
 tr3s the eia 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.569
 but still more in the act 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.489
 but let's see it as walking 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.219
 well now we have seen a duration of between indicating the duration the last 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:16.499
 path 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:22.009
 percent the speed at which we've gone I want the most obvious to slide 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.800
 he pauses

 delamata usa 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.879
 and then more a summary that we have walked between commas the chipi 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.240
 kilometer 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.330
 although the duration what we have walked miter ground signing 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:36.699
 and practically 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.240
 the city camera who the map 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.689
 novoa minimize a 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.449
 from there a small square of red color that means the end the end in its 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.180
 path

 páramo decrease 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.939
 and here we go well all our weapons 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.409
 walked until now from the exit the dot 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.069
 my father and of good quality to avoid diseases 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.830
 to record another 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.720
 7 how is it going to accelerate screen but little read that can be spoken of 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.490
 air base plaza 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.990
 the coordinator of the work area that 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.150
 the little bit more of ethanol 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.189
 laso is shortened 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:22.360
 it should be associated a bit 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.199
 a team of 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.819
 that is, there is some 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.240
 as the third of the orientation 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.960
 is applied on the compass also also 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.389
 the setting of the map 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.360
 ead to block it 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.360
 He also indicated the camera 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.930
 to be able to take the photograph the reference interest 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:51.059
 On the other hand, the interest to return when documenting the other 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:55.409
 on his walk 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:56.529
 of seven 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:00.689
 that when he arrived on time when I realized that I am mobility coria 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:01.599
 on the way back 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.999
 there appears statistical data 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.900
 I hope to be 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.250
 this is going to be like it was 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.139
 the moratorium 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:08.789
 Peter Luczak 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.490
 this agreement can 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.219
 they continued 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:15.349
 well once we have finished our tour 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:20.330
 now we do not have to visualize it and it has extracted the data of the way we are going to 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.169
 open the complication 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.740
 madrid 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.869
 remember that he had her handcuffed with the name of nothing 

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:28.439
 the one that we already have 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.439
 we are jama 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:33.499
 no way 

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:37.960
 it opens and tells us the statistical data of the distance 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.110
 the duration 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.400
 speed 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.699
 AIDS 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:45.479
 my day and the maximum 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.360
 the rise the descent of the way 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.319
 and is that here 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:51.909
 I cover up that one habit that this is for 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:54.909
 eder the way of evil 

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:58.619
 here we have our path that we have made 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:00.800
 petista 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.979
 where we were 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:04.669
 from the exit 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.669
 that this green square symbol 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.330
 until the arrival 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.360
 that this symbol 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.020
 Red 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.729
 indicating the arrival 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:20.139
 Per hundred I have realized that 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.969
 when he recorded the track 

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:26.210
 my idea was always achieved I do not know why but that was between 27 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.210
 I took that map this rally on a road motorcycle that yes 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.729
 and we hit the road 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:37.729
 know it was the map change a little bit of envy 

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:41.139
 chuquicamata 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:43.399
 find out in highway format 

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:47.189
 that can be visualized also but what prevented the time to wash it as 

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:50.419
 that I achieved in relief on an imprisoned bike I do not know if it's like that 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.479
 I'll look at them better 

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:54.620
 on this map 

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.060
 we have here we can not yet the document weapons we can
