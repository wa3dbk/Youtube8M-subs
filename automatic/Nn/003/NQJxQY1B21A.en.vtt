00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
why I keep pointing that out is just

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.370 
why I keep pointing that out is just
because<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:37.030> seems<00:03:37.299> like<00:03:37.480> these<00:03:37.780> items<00:03:38.230> were

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
because it seems like these items were

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.430 
because it seems like these items were
brushed<00:03:39.340> when<00:03:39.970> they<00:03:40.120> were<00:03:40.180> created<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.079> I

brushed when they were created and I

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.080 
brushed when they were created and I
don't<00:03:41.530> really<00:03:41.709> like<00:03:41.950> them<00:03:42.190> when<00:03:42.579> I<00:03:42.609> purchase

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
don't really like them when I purchase

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.760 
don't really like them when I purchase
something

cutting off string whether that's

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.210 
cutting off string whether that's
