00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
a little bit right and then I thought no

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.360 
a little bit right and then I thought no
we<00:00:50.390> have<00:00:50.629> medium<00:00:51.260> tanks<00:00:51.680> going<00:00:51.860> up<00:00:52.040> there<00:00:52.220> and

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
then we also had the AMX 50 100 there so

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.029 
then we also had the AMX 50 100 there so
no<00:00:56.600> need<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:56.809> meet<00:00:57.079> for<00:00:57.260> me<00:00:57.379> to<00:00:57.500> go<00:00:57.590> there<00:00:57.649> all

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
no need to meet for me to go there all

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.240 
no need to meet for me to go there all
and<00:00:58.930> it's<00:00:59.930> actually<00:01:00.020> just<00:01:00.350> because<00:01:00.949> it's<00:01:01.190> a

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
and it's actually just because it's a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.540 
and it's actually just because it's a
brain<00:01:01.460> part<00:01:01.699> because<00:01:02.059> I<00:01:02.829> forgot<00:01:03.829> that<00:01:04.460> I<00:01:04.489> was

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
outside the game I fire he just takes a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.590 
outside the game I fire he just takes a
shot<00:01:21.800> on<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:22.130> move<00:01:22.280> which<00:01:22.789> was<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.450> only

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
shot on the move which was the only

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.359

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
backing up against the wall here a fire

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.440 
backing up against the wall here a fire
right<00:03:24.380> there<00:03:24.440> behemoth<00:03:25.370> has<00:03:25.549> backed<00:03:26.060> up<00:03:26.239> just

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
right there behemoth has backed up just

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.729 
right there behemoth has backed up just
a<00:03:26.540> little<00:03:26.750> bit<00:03:26.870> more<00:03:27.109> he<00:03:27.410> would<00:03:27.560> have<00:03:27.650> been

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
a little bit more he would have been

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.470 
a little bit more he would have been
that<00:03:27.889> instead<00:03:28.160> of<00:03:28.220> so<00:03:28.730> pushing<00:03:29.060> on<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.359> enemy

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
that instead of so pushing on the enemy

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.960 
that instead of so pushing on the enemy
team<00:03:29.630> because<00:03:30.169> then<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.440> would<00:03:30.590> kill<00:03:30.829> him<00:03:30.970> and

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
team because then I would kill him and

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.900 
team because then I would kill him and
then<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:34.489> t-34<00:03:35.410> takes<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.500> shot<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:37.010> get

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
then the t-34 takes a shot I get

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.330 
then the t-34 takes a shot I get
immobilized<00:03:38.269> by<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.840> is-3<00:03:39.500> who<00:03:39.769> had<00:03:40.040> been<00:03:40.280> on

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
immobilized by the is-3 who had been on

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.009 
immobilized by the is-3 who had been on
spotted<00:03:40.790> over<00:03:40.880> there<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:41.269> I<00:03:41.299> was<00:03:41.510> really<00:03:41.900> lucky

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
spotted over there so I was really lucky

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.220

as<00:03:42.260> well<00:03:42.910> go<00:03:43.910> out<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.209> take<00:03:44.329> out<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.510> t-34

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
as well go out and take out the t-34

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.839 
as well go out and take out the t-34
instead<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.040> behemoths<00:03:46.340> going<00:03:46.579> on<00:03:46.669> because

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
instead of behemoths going on because

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.420 
instead of behemoths going on because
his<00:03:47.209> shot<00:03:47.450> could<00:03:47.720> have<00:03:47.780> not<00:03:48.049> couldn't<00:03:49.040> maybe

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
his shot could have not couldn't maybe

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.080 
his shot could have not couldn't maybe
couldn't<00:03:50.000> have<00:03:50.180> done<00:03:50.810> full<00:03:51.109> damage<00:03:51.849> the<00:03:52.849> enemy

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
couldn't have done full damage the enemy

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.720 
couldn't have done full damage the enemy
is<00:03:53.150> rushing<00:03:53.540> now<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:54.129> I<00:03:55.129> couldn't<00:03:55.340> really<00:03:55.519> see

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
is rushing now and I couldn't really see

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.930 
is rushing now and I couldn't really see
the<00:03:55.879> kv-1s<00:03:56.239> but<00:03:57.019> I<00:03:57.049> get<00:03:57.379> a<00:03:57.410> shot<00:03:57.470> in<00:03:57.769> on<00:03:57.859> EK<00:03:58.519> 36

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
the kv-1s but I get a shot in on EK 36

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.230

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:56.159 
t-34 now that just ramming behemoth I
bet<00:06:53.949> they're<00:06:54.159> in<00:06:54.189> the<00:06:54.550> tomb<00:06:54.759> or<00:06:54.909> something<00:06:55.210> but

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:56.169 
bet they're in the tomb or something but

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:58.889 
bet they're in the tomb or something but
yeah<00:06:56.259> the<00:06:56.439> game<00:06:56.589> was<00:06:56.770> over<00:06:56.919> and<00:06:57.449> yeah<00:06:58.449> we<00:06:58.719> won

00:06:58.889 --> 00:06:58.899 
yeah the game was over and yeah we won

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:02.700 
yeah the game was over and yeah we won
by<00:06:59.289> keeping<00:06:59.830> that<00:07:00.539> corner<00:07:01.539> because<00:07:01.930> if<00:07:02.409> we<00:07:02.589> had

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 
by keeping that corner because if we had

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.070 
by keeping that corner because if we had
died<00:07:02.949> then<00:07:03.399> the<00:07:03.729> Allies<00:07:04.659> would<00:07:04.839> have<00:07:04.960> had<00:07:05.050> a

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
died then the Allies would have had a

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.290 
died then the Allies would have had a
very<00:07:05.469> tough<00:07:05.680> time<00:07:05.919> defending<00:07:06.129> from<00:07:06.550> both<00:07:06.729> both

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.300 
very tough time defending from both both

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.600 
very tough time defending from both both
sides<00:07:07.659> because<00:07:07.960> there<00:07:08.349> was<00:07:08.499> a<00:07:08.710> lot<00:07:09.370> of<00:07:09.399> other

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
sides because there was a lot of other

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.300 
sides because there was a lot of other
tanks<00:07:10.060> coming<00:07:10.810> from<00:07:11.050> from<00:07:11.649> the<00:07:11.770> other<00:07:11.889> side<00:07:12.129> as

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.310 
tanks coming from from the other side as

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.459 
tanks coming from from the other side as
well<00:07:12.460> and<00:07:12.699> they<00:07:12.999> defended<00:07:13.360> against<00:07:13.659> those<00:07:13.839> but

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:14.469
