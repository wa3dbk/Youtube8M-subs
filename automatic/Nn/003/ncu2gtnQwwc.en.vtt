might<00:01:34.229> remember<00:01:34.409> yeah<00:01:34.979> grim<00:01:35.250> bargain<00:01:35.729> he<00:01:36.270> is

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
might remember yeah grim bargain he is

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539

the<00:01:36.630> last<00:01:36.840> living<00:01:37.110> dwarf<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.770> even<00:01:38.310> he

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the last living dwarf and even he

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.359 
the last living dwarf and even he
doesn't<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:39.000> why<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> Dwemer<00:01:39.840> disappeared

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.710 
doesn't know why the Dwemer disappeared
the<00:01:41.369> reason<00:01:41.700> why<00:01:41.820> he<00:01:42.090> himself<00:01:42.450> didn't

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the reason why he himself didn't

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080 
the reason why he himself didn't
disappear<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.350> because<00:01:43.950> he<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.549> an<00:01:44.880> outer

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
disappear is because he was in an outer

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.630 
disappear is because he was in an outer
dimension<00:01:45.750> when<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> events<00:01:46.470> happened<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
dimension when the events happened the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.370 
dimension when the events happened the
most<00:01:47.850> probable<00:01:48.240> explanation<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.079> they

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
most probable explanation is that they

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.740 
most probable explanation is that they
tried<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> create<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.159> new<00:01:50.460> medium<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
tried to create a new medium and the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.289 
tried to create a new medium and the
medium<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.470> ultimate<00:01:52.890> machine<00:01:53.340> by

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
medium is the ultimate machine by

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
medium is the ultimate machine by
creating<00:01:54.720> him<00:01:54.899> they<00:01:55.259> pretty<00:01:55.500> much<00:01:55.680> make<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> god

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
creating him they pretty much make a god

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.580 
creating him they pretty much make a god
and<00:01:56.670> he<00:01:57.540> would<00:01:57.659> allow<00:01:57.930> them<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.200> become

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and he would allow them to become

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.649 
and he would allow them to become
immortal<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.430> grant<00:01:59.909> higher<00:02:00.090> power<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.600> all

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
immortal and grant higher power and all

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.200 
immortal and grant higher power and all
that<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.250> what<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> theory<00:02:02.579> says<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
that and what the theory says is that

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.240 
that and what the theory says is that
pretty<00:02:03.479> much<00:02:03.630> creating<00:02:04.469> him<00:02:04.649> backfired

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
pretty much creating him backfired

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100 
pretty much creating him backfired
because<00:02:05.610> they<00:02:05.939> weren't<00:02:06.090> supposed<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.630> achieve

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
because they weren't supposed to achieve

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.199 
because they weren't supposed to achieve
such<00:02:07.380> power<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.610> why<00:02:08.789> they<00:02:09.000> got

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
such power and that is why they got

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.199 
such power and that is why they got

in<00:02:22.590> Skyrim<00:02:22.950> you'll<00:02:23.099> know<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.310> he<00:02:24.150> tried<00:02:24.390> to

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
in Skyrim you'll know that he tried to

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.020 
in Skyrim you'll know that he tried to

do it and he disappeared himself so that
just<00:02:27.299> further<00:02:27.569> supports<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.170> theory<00:02:28.349> as<00:02:28.709> to

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
just further supports the theory as to

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.890 
just further supports the theory as to
why<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.099> drummer<00:02:29.489> disappeared<00:02:29.970> now

why the drummer disappeared now

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the calling the calling is pretty much

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.069 
the calling the calling is pretty much
like<00:02:37.799> telepathy<00:02:38.359> they<00:02:39.359> were<00:02:39.420> able<00:02:39.870> to

transfer them to a above mortal plane
and<00:02:50.129> that<00:02:50.159> might<00:02:50.970> be<00:02:51.120> linked<00:02:51.329> to<00:02:51.450> their<00:02:51.599> demise

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
and that might be linked to their demise

and that might be linked to their demise
however<00:02:53.400> whether<00:02:53.670> there<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> link<00:02:54.120> or<00:02:54.389> not

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
however whether there is a link or not

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.500 
however whether there is a link or not
is<00:02:54.840> uncertain<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.459> yes<00:02:56.639> that's<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:57.120> as<00:02:57.239> always

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
is uncertain so yes that's it as always

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.720 
is uncertain so yes that's it as always
