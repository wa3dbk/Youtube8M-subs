paper towel on top this is very strange
I<00:03:04.459> know<00:03:04.549> but<00:03:05.239> you'll<00:03:05.810> see<00:03:06.049> in<00:03:06.109> the<00:03:06.230> end<00:03:06.290> why

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
I know but you'll see in the end why

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.280 
I know but you'll see in the end why
this<00:03:06.709> works<00:03:07.609> very<00:03:07.730> nicely<00:03:08.150> as<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.049> can<00:03:09.140> see

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290

this works very nicely as you can see
this<00:03:09.439> paper<00:03:09.620> towel<00:03:09.980> has<00:03:10.790> some<00:03:11.659> texture<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.200> it

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
this paper towel has some texture to it

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.610 
this paper towel has some texture to it
already<00:03:13.299> that's<00:03:14.299> nice<00:03:14.720> for<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.170> end<00:03:15.319> effect

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
already that's nice for the end effect

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.309 
already that's nice for the end effect
but<00:03:16.400> it's<00:03:16.909> not<00:03:17.060> necessary<00:03:17.569> if<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.840> can't<00:03:18.109> find

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
but it's not necessary if you can't find

but it's not necessary if you can't find
paper<00:03:18.530> towel<00:03:18.769> that's<00:03:18.920> not<00:03:19.159> textured<00:03:19.609> so<00:03:20.239> now

boots<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.889> jump<00:03:37.129> hit<00:03:37.340> because<00:03:37.549> this<00:03:38.510> does<00:03:38.750> take

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
boots to jump hit because this does take

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.789 
boots to jump hit because this does take
a<00:03:39.019> while<00:03:40.629> okay<00:03:41.629> this<00:03:42.139> is<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.260> lot<00:03:42.409> of<00:03:42.500> effort

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
a while okay this is a lot of effort

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.589 
a while okay this is a lot of effort
that's<00:03:42.950> probably<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.430> most<00:03:44.090> amount<00:03:44.329> of<00:03:44.450> it

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
that's probably the most amount of it

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.809 
that's probably the most amount of it
I've<00:03:45.049> put<00:03:45.290> into<00:03:45.409> anything<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.280> I've<00:03:46.519> made<00:03:46.760> on

this channel and this will take the

going<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:25.010> boot<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.430> speed<00:04:25.699> at<00:04:25.909> hyperspeed

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
going to boot the speed at hyperspeed

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.719 
going to boot the speed at hyperspeed
now<00:04:26.930> we're<00:04:27.169> gonna<00:04:27.289> go<00:04:27.470> really<00:04:27.919> really<00:04:28.190> quickly

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
now we're gonna go really really quickly

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.180 
now we're gonna go really really quickly
just<00:04:29.210> so<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.360> we<00:04:29.659> can<00:04:29.870> push<00:04:30.440> this<00:04:30.650> really

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
just so that we can push this really

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.189 
just so that we can push this really
really<00:04:31.370> fast<00:04:32.349> so<00:04:33.349> just<00:04:33.860> do<00:04:34.310> black<00:04:34.760> first<00:04:35.199> just

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
really fast so just do black first just

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.180 
really fast so just do black first just
doing<00:04:36.409> a<00:04:36.530> large<00:04:36.770> amount<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.340> cracks<00:04:39.190> again

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
doing a large amount of cracks again

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.140 
doing a large amount of cracks again
this<00:04:40.370> will<00:04:40.580> all<00:04:40.699> make<00:04:40.820> sense<00:04:40.880> in<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.360> end

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
this will all make sense in the end

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.120 
this will all make sense in the end
and<00:04:43.270> they<00:04:43.900> would<00:04:44.050> just<00:04:44.200> jump<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.620> head<00:04:44.860> and

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
and they would just jump the head and

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.070 
and they would just jump the head and
then<00:04:45.550> in<00:04:45.850> between<00:04:45.970> cracks<00:04:46.540> I'm<00:04:46.720> going<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:46.960> do

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
then in between cracks I'm going to do

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.890 
then in between cracks I'm going to do
in<00:04:47.230> brown<00:04:47.500> so<00:04:48.370> now<00:04:48.640> I'm<00:04:48.700> doing<00:04:48.850> sub<00:04:49.330> cracks<00:04:49.660> in

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
in brown so now I'm doing sub cracks in

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.150 
in brown so now I'm doing sub cracks in
brown<00:04:50.170> and<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:53.020> can<00:04:53.230> use<00:04:53.410> other<00:04:53.620> colors<00:04:53.860> like

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160

green if you like this is sort of give

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.090 
green if you like this is sort of give
the<00:04:57.430> marble<00:04:58.210> sort<00:04:58.480> of<00:04:58.570> vein<00:04:58.840> look<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.980> the

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
the marble sort of vein look to the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.410 
the marble sort of vein look to the
stone<00:05:00.340> when<00:05:00.580> it's<00:05:00.700> finished<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:02.760> yeah<00:05:03.760> you

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
in-between Brown cracks now I'm just

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.180 
in-between Brown cracks now I'm just
gonna<00:05:10.570> add<00:05:10.780> some<00:05:10.810> whites<00:05:11.290> and<00:05:11.560> then<00:05:11.830> you've

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.680 
gonna add some whites and then you've
sub<00:05:12.460> crack<00:05:12.730> so<00:05:12.880> those<00:05:13.090> are<00:05:13.330> going<00:05:13.450> to<00:05:13.540> be<00:05:13.630> in

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
sub crack so those are going to be in

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.250 
sub crack so those are going to be in
white<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.640> just<00:05:15.640> continue<00:05:16.180> on<00:05:16.210> hyper<00:05:16.840> splits

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
white and just continue on hyper splits

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.640 
white and just continue on hyper splits
of<00:05:17.440> speed<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:18.000> jump<00:05:19.000> right<00:05:19.270> ahead<00:05:19.450> here<00:05:19.960> the

of speed and jump right ahead here the
paint<00:05:20.980> is<00:05:21.220> still<00:05:21.790> damp<00:05:22.210> and<00:05:22.510> I<00:05:23.050> am<00:05:23.440> now

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
paint is still damp and I am now

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.480 
paint is still damp and I am now
applying<00:05:24.280> more<00:05:25.180> PD<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:25.990> white<00:05:26.230> glue<00:05:26.500> and<00:05:26.920> good

speed<00:05:27.820> speed<00:05:28.570> this<00:05:28.690> up<00:05:28.920> going<00:05:29.920> diagonally<00:05:30.490> one

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
speed speed this up going diagonally one

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.900 
speed speed this up going diagonally one
way<00:05:31.230> then<00:05:32.230> what<00:05:32.380> I<00:05:32.440> going<00:05:32.620> to<00:05:32.710> do<00:05:32.860> is<00:05:33.160> I'm<00:05:33.730> going

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
way then what I going to do is I'm going

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.450 
way then what I going to do is I'm going
to<00:05:34.000> go<00:05:34.210> diagonally<00:05:34.510> the<00:05:35.260> other<00:05:35.440> way<00:05:35.740> so<00:05:36.340> you

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
to go diagonally the other way so you

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.460 
to go diagonally the other way so you
can<00:05:36.700> see<00:05:36.850> the<00:05:37.000> Y<00:05:37.150> queue<00:05:37.360> starts<00:05:37.600> to<00:05:37.840> seep<00:05:38.230> into

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
can see the Y queue starts to seep into

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.640 
can see the Y queue starts to seep into
the<00:05:39.330> into<00:05:40.330> the<00:05:40.450> paper<00:05:40.750> towel<00:05:41.080> that's<00:05:41.350> there

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
the into the paper towel that's there

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.610 
the into the paper towel that's there
and<00:05:41.860> just<00:05:42.640> continue<00:05:43.390> on<00:05:43.420> in<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.140> opposite

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
and just continue on in the opposite

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.710 
and just continue on in the opposite
direction<00:05:44.740> so<00:05:45.340> they're<00:05:46.150> going<00:05:46.270> to<00:05:46.360> be<00:05:46.420> little

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
direction so they're going to be little

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.780 
direction so they're going to be little
gaps<00:05:46.960> it's<00:05:47.500> okay<00:05:47.830> with<00:05:48.010> little<00:05:48.220> gaps<00:05:48.430> it's<00:05:48.640> not

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
gaps it's okay with little gaps it's not

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.600 
gaps it's okay with little gaps it's not
a<00:05:48.850> problem<00:05:49.090> just<00:05:50.080> keep<00:05:50.320> going<00:05:50.650> through<00:05:51.370> right

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
a problem just keep going through right

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.120 
a problem just keep going through right
across<00:05:51.850> the<00:05:52.120> entire<00:05:52.450> piece<00:05:52.780> now<00:05:53.680> the<00:05:53.740> idea

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
across the entire piece now the idea

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.000 
across the entire piece now the idea
with<00:05:54.280> this<00:05:54.430> is<00:05:54.670> the<00:05:55.180> PVA<00:05:55.510> glue<00:05:55.660> and<00:05:56.350> the<00:05:56.800> paper

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
with this is the PVA glue and the paper

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.580 
with this is the PVA glue and the paper
towel<00:05:57.310> just<00:05:57.940> it<00:05:58.060> just<00:05:58.090> seeps<00:05:58.450> in<00:05:58.690> there<00:05:58.870> forms

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
towel just it just seeps in there forms

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.520 
towel just it just seeps in there forms
this<00:05:59.710> hard<00:06:00.130> sort<00:06:00.700> of<00:06:00.870> plasticy<00:06:01.900> kind<00:06:02.350> of

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
this hard sort of plasticy kind of

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.040 
this hard sort of plasticy kind of
substance<00:06:03.100> which<00:06:03.790> you<00:06:03.910> then<00:06:04.060> cut<00:06:04.420> out<00:06:04.450> it<00:06:04.900> has

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
substance which you then cut out it has

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.010 
substance which you then cut out it has
a<00:06:05.080> cardboard<00:06:05.470> base<00:06:05.860> which<00:06:06.550> makes<00:06:06.790> it<00:06:06.990> nice<00:06:07.990> and

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
a cardboard base which makes it nice and

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.490 
a cardboard base which makes it nice and
easy<00:06:08.350> it's<00:06:08.710> flexible<00:06:09.490> and<00:06:10.350> effectively<00:06:11.350> what

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
easy it's flexible and effectively what

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.490 
easy it's flexible and effectively what
we<00:06:11.590> do<00:06:11.710> now<00:06:11.890> is<00:06:12.190> just<00:06:12.460> cut<00:06:12.760> out<00:06:12.910> strips<00:06:13.660> now<00:06:14.410> if

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
we do now is just cut out strips now if

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.310 
we do now is just cut out strips now if
you're<00:06:14.650> going<00:06:14.770> to<00:06:14.920> use<00:06:15.280> one<00:06:15.640> inch<00:06:16.290> one<00:06:17.290> inch

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
you're going to use one inch one inch

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.950 
you're going to use one inch one inch
squares<00:06:17.860> for<00:06:18.850> your<00:06:18.970> flooring<00:06:19.390> you<00:06:19.540> can<00:06:19.720> cut

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
squares for your flooring you can cut

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.250 
squares for your flooring you can cut
these<00:06:20.110> out<00:06:20.320> in<00:06:20.650> 1-inch<00:06:21.100> strips<00:06:22.090> and<00:06:22.630> I'm<00:06:22.990> just

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
these out in 1-inch strips and I'm just

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.930 
these out in 1-inch strips and I'm just
doing<00:06:23.530> them<00:06:23.650> a<00:06:23.740> random<00:06:24.130> length<00:06:24.340> doesn't

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
doing them a random length doesn't

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.760 
doing them a random length doesn't
really<00:06:25.090> matter<00:06:25.330> for<00:06:25.450> me<00:06:25.750> I'm<00:06:26.020> not<00:06:26.050> really

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
really matter for me I'm not really

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.560 
really matter for me I'm not really
doing<00:06:26.980> any<00:06:27.220> grids<00:06:27.460> and<00:06:28.030> then<00:06:28.240> I'm<00:06:28.330> just<00:06:28.420> going

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
doing any grids and then I'm just going

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.450 
doing any grids and then I'm just going
to<00:06:28.660> cut<00:06:28.900> out<00:06:28.930> other<00:06:29.440> squares<00:06:29.860> of<00:06:30.070> varying

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
to cut out other squares of varying

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.660 
to cut out other squares of varying
sizes<00:06:30.790> and<00:06:31.560> continue<00:06:32.560> on<00:06:32.650> I'll<00:06:32.950> jump<00:06:33.520> ahead

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
sizes and continue on I'll jump ahead

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.340 
sizes and continue on I'll jump ahead
here<00:06:33.850> now<00:06:34.180> of<00:06:34.270> course<00:06:34.420> you're<00:06:34.930> doing<00:06:35.110> grids

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
here now of course you're doing grids

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.020 
here now of course you're doing grids
you<00:06:35.560> can<00:06:35.770> just<00:06:35.950> do<00:06:36.070> these<00:06:36.250> as<00:06:36.490> one<00:06:36.850> inch

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
you can just do these as one inch

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.700 
you can just do these as one inch
squares

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
squares

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.170 
squares
you'll<00:06:38.710> need<00:06:38.860> to<00:06:39.040> measure<00:06:39.190> them<00:06:39.520> but<00:06:39.910> I'll

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
you'll need to measure them but I'll

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.990 
you'll need to measure them but I'll
just<00:06:40.240> cut<00:06:41.020> it<00:06:41.050> along<00:06:41.320> and<00:06:41.830> now<00:06:42.190> I'm<00:06:42.550> just<00:06:42.910> doing

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
just cut it along and now I'm just doing

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.170 
just cut it along and now I'm just doing
extra<00:06:43.780> detailing<00:06:44.230> by<00:06:44.830> trimming<00:06:45.460> the<00:06:45.580> corners

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
extra detailing by trimming the corners

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.570 
extra detailing by trimming the corners
making<00:06:46.420> them<00:06:46.660> around<00:06:46.920> so<00:06:47.920> that<00:06:48.070> it<00:06:48.160> looks<00:06:48.340> like

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
making them around so that it looks like

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.110 
making them around so that it looks like
stone<00:06:48.940> paving<00:06:49.570> so

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
stone paving so

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.100 
stone paving so
again<00:06:50.540> this<00:06:50.900> is<00:06:51.080> a<00:06:51.110> very<00:06:51.530> long<00:06:51.800> build<00:06:52.130> the<00:06:53.110> the

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
again this is a very long build the the

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.470 
again this is a very long build the the
PVA<00:06:54.470> glue<00:06:54.560> itself<00:06:55.010> took<00:06:55.220> about<00:06:55.400> 24<00:06:55.970> hours<00:06:56.150> to

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:56.480 
PVA glue itself took about 24 hours to

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.629 
PVA glue itself took about 24 hours to
dry<00:06:56.780> before<00:06:57.410> it<00:06:57.680> got<00:06:57.830> to<00:06:58.010> this<00:06:58.130> hard<00:06:58.550> plastic

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 
dry before it got to this hard plastic

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:01.240 
dry before it got to this hard plastic
stage<00:06:59.330> so<00:07:00.110> you<00:07:00.139> will<00:07:00.440> need<00:07:00.560> to<00:07:00.620> put<00:07:00.889> it<00:07:00.979> in<00:07:01.130> an

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
stage so you will need to put it in an

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.560 
stage so you will need to put it in an
area<00:07:01.430> which<00:07:01.820> is<00:07:02.110> easy<00:07:03.110> to<00:07:03.470> to<00:07:04.100> let<00:07:04.400> it<00:07:04.520> dry<00:07:04.729> here

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:05.570 
area which is easy to to let it dry here

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.030 
area which is easy to to let it dry here
I'm<00:07:05.660> just<00:07:05.840> laying<00:07:05.960> it<00:07:06.139> out<00:07:06.260> so<00:07:06.470> you<00:07:06.500> can<00:07:06.650> see

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:07.040 
I'm just laying it out so you can see

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.159 
I'm just laying it out so you can see
the<00:07:07.550> final<00:07:07.940> effect<00:07:08.210> with<00:07:08.389> all<00:07:08.510> the<00:07:08.630> veins<00:07:08.870> and

everything randomly spread across and

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.890 
everything randomly spread across and
that<00:07:11.780> looks<00:07:12.020> really<00:07:12.410> really<00:07:12.710> cool<00:07:13.540> so<00:07:14.540> that's
