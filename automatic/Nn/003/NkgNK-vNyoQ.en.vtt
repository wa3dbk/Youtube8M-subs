00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.470 
they told me they did the MRI they said
okay<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.500> definitely<00:00:46.739> Toria<00:00:47.280> bicep<00:00:47.760> via<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
okay you definitely Toria bicep via the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.569 
okay you definitely Toria bicep via the
Hemmer<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.809> didn't<00:00:49.289> show<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.219> actually

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
Hemmer I didn't show that I actually

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.130 
Hemmer I didn't show that I actually
tore<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> over<00:00:51.269> they<00:00:51.420> could<00:00:51.600> feel<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.019> was

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
tore it over they could feel that it was

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.779 
tore it over they could feel that it was
detached<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.800> actually<00:00:53.100> from<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.339> shoulder

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
detached and actually from the shoulder

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.540 
detached and actually from the shoulder
so<00:00:54.719> when<00:00:54.870> they<00:00:54.960> opened<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.379> bicep<00:00:56.100> probably

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
so when they opened the bicep probably

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.689 
so when they opened the bicep probably
not<00:00:57.239> only<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.719> detached<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.460> belly

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
not only was it detached but the belly

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.869 
not only was it detached but the belly
was<00:01:00.000> torn<00:01:00.329> via<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> insertion<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.760> it's

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
was torn via the insertion so it's

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.670 
was torn via the insertion so it's
almost<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.239> taking<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.899> steak<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.379> tearing

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
almost like taking a steak and tearing

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.649 
almost like taking a steak and tearing
in<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> middle<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.880> fibers<00:01:06.299> were<00:01:06.420> turned

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
in the middle so the fibers were turned

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.050 
in the middle so the fibers were turned
up<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.080> also<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> what<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:08.610> told<00:01:08.789> me<00:01:08.939> is

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
up for it also so what they told me is

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.820 
up for it also so what they told me is

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
kind of surgery with this bicep at this

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480 
kind of surgery with this bicep at this
point<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.469> still<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.740> little<00:01:52.890> black<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.189> blue

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
you can see sometimes when I actually

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.410 
you can see sometimes when I actually
get<00:01:55.799> tan<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.789> kind<00:01:57.179> of<00:01:57.240> gets

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
get tan you can see it kind of gets

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.020 
get tan you can see it kind of gets
really<00:01:58.079> black<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:58.500> blue<00:01:58.649> out<00:01:58.679> of<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.159> tear

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
really black and blue out of the tear

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.100 
really black and blue out of the tear
like<00:02:00.240> two<00:02:00.509> weeks<00:02:00.719> out<00:02:00.929> there<00:02:01.170> so

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
like two weeks out there so

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.280 
like two weeks out there so
for<00:02:02.560> me<00:02:02.680> it's<00:02:03.270> training<00:02:04.270> back<00:02:04.630> they<00:02:04.930> told<00:02:05.140> me

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
for me it's training back they told me

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.110 
for me it's training back they told me
oh<00:02:05.320> there's<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.830> risk<00:02:06.010> of<00:02:06.220> course<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.760> tear<00:02:06.970> it

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
oh there's a risk of course to tear it

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.999 
oh there's a risk of course to tear it
when<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.360> have<00:02:07.540> you<00:02:08.290> know<00:02:08.380> everything<00:02:08.770> tied

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
when you have you know everything tied

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.710 
when you have you know everything tied
together<00:02:09.190> there<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:09.910> they<00:02:10.270> said<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.509> be

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
together there and they said to be

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.200 
together there and they said to be
careful<00:02:11.170> but<00:02:11.320> I've<00:02:11.470> pushed<00:02:12.400> pretty<00:02:12.790> much<00:02:13.030> the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
careful but I've pushed pretty much the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.520 
careful but I've pushed pretty much the
weights<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.690> was<00:02:14.040> before<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.250> tore<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.610> now

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
weights that I was before I tore it now

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.970 
weights that I was before I tore it now
it<00:02:17.530> just<00:02:17.740> was<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.890> freak<00:02:18.190> thing<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:19.150> hopefully

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
it just was a freak thing so hopefully

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.059 
it just was a freak thing so hopefully
I'm<00:02:20.980> not<00:02:21.040> gonna<00:02:21.340> repair<00:02:21.700> it

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
I'm not gonna repair it

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.700 
I'm not gonna repair it

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
but coming back from that injury was

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.770 
but coming back from that injury was
just<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:32.550> know<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.700> wasn't<00:02:33.060> sure<00:02:33.240> that's<00:02:33.600> why
