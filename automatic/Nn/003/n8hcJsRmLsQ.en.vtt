00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:11.040
 1234567 these historical 8 9 10 11 12 13 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:18.330
 remains of waves Mar 14 and 15 16 17 18 19 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:28.849
 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:36.630
 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:38.579
 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 43 54 55 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:45.390
 this is the first real credit you have 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:47.070
 never had 56 57 58 59 60 62 63 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.530
 I certainly ask you to forgive me for this 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.110
 video will be quite confusing me 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.770
 I started it one day then I got it 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.309
 continued another day and it will be fever 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.960
 and therefore or ol stopped by verse i am 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.409
 resuming before starting this 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:09.240
 video that is a video of challenge in the sense 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.010
 if you feel like proposing me a challenge 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.500
 write me the water under the video can 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.780
 be anything you can eat a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.030
 beehive entice this here without 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.159
 chew cooking a kaka pie 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.500
 can be anything enough not me 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.080
 let them know apple writes below 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.580
 video so next time maybe me 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.829
 all laugh at comments and I see a 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:38.100
 little what to do for nothing 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:40.380
 comment that disgusts guys there was one 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.909
 crazy score and fannie tammaro writes 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.350
 can wear at the same time 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.900
 all her wigs I think 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.400
 now 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.720
 but then I saw that there were below 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.950
 pure shakes without glasses 34 like it 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.300
 it's an interesting thing because maybe 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.750
 in the comments you send me below 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.910
 I could also analyze those with more 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.760
 like or I could also type with 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.760
 paul calls himself up on the facebook group 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.680
 and then choose which challenge to do 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.300
 do that a little bit like the scenes though 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.990
 you think you know what you can 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.670
 take some since he type it wall 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.470
 live and find a lot of ways to 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.300
 kill them make them do whatever you want 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.830
 you are that same thing only that 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.910
 you can't kill me 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.560
 unless you want a gun 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.780
 and kill me like john lennon by now 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.560
 something I still don't hope for 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.170
 then these are all mine 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.080
 wigs I can try but not there 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.070
 we will never ever succeed in our whole 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.610
 life there is not there it cannot be done 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.670
 understood but together keep in mind 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:48.330
 yes but there is no it cannot be done already 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:52.180
 you can do it there is nothing 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.600
 in the end direct type full dynamix 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.440
 set a little bit but not like you do 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:12.670
 oh well i'm putting guys pretend 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:15.340
 those that closed in an envelope freezes 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.870
 crouched clearly not clearly 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.269
 so supporting just home is open tf 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.750
 he knows that there is also a clip that I have like 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.750
 space 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:04:04.860
 I have to move it's impossible to stroke 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:07.290
 there is what I'm doing were is this 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.820
 these too we do projects not 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.680
 closes 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:18.959
 behold, here is how I am perfect 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.940
 I need others but look no oh well me 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.989
 giving up I don't give up 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.240
 I video that I lose I didn't want 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.070
 show it to you in a much nicer way 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.830
 but I could not tear it away from this I know 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.990
 he was doodling the red one 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.090
 how big his face is the hall 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.220
 stationary second stop is a second view the 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.500
 take a look at the room here if you 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.580
 I put red I do n't know and I forget the room 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.890
 so it seems that he is taking a look 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.040
 I 'm sorry for the room, we do n't want you 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:48.990
 see I know but I will present it to you 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.720
 maybe better in another video he is a 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.280
 little bit of ailments in this period 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.790
 11 then the speak very peaceful 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.390
 come and see over his arches and di 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.950
 that is, that is, that is, the less you see 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.170
 I miss eyebrows though 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.790
 a fungus there is a lot of breaking of 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.170
 balls but he will talk about it later maybe 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.750
 when it looks better it would be a top 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.460
 model almost a slap hairdo 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.690
 side so it might almost seem 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.490
 that there is a chewing gum in the mouth 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.710
 that if I say one of these little girls 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.190
 understood that with all the hair from a 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:24.540
 side is shaved on the other by the lots 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.430
 leaving brussels wanted that how much 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.030
 cares nothing about me think i am 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.250
 bone 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:39.980
 so to finish what is the message of 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:39.980
 this video that in life 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.360
 wait, the message is coming 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:00.550
 that in life it is better to wear a hundred 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.350
 wigs that one hundred nas that some 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.860
 wigs allows you to people 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.600
 different a mask will never make you understand 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.600
 the others that you are
