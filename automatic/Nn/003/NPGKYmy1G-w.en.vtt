capturing for dozens of times to compare
the<00:00:24.790> low-light<00:00:25.150> performance<00:00:25.180> of<00:00:25.870> several

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
the low-light performance of several

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.750 
the low-light performance of several
cameras<00:00:27.370> and<00:00:27.610> now<00:00:28.020> Huawei<00:00:29.020> is<00:00:29.640> bragging<00:00:30.640> about

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
cameras and now Huawei is bragging about

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.119 
cameras and now Huawei is bragging about
its<00:00:31.090> low-light<00:00:31.780> performance<00:00:32.079> so<00:00:32.800> let's<00:00:33.010> have

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
its low-light performance so let's have

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.229 
its low-light performance so let's have
a<00:00:33.190> look<00:00:33.340> how<00:00:33.460> it<00:00:33.489> works<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.850> to<00:00:37.000> I<00:00:37.030> have<00:00:37.150> to

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
a look how it works I have to I have to

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.510 
a look how it works I have to I have to
switch<00:00:37.840> off<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:38.200> lights<00:00:38.410> so<00:00:38.650> I'll<00:00:39.220> be<00:00:39.340> back

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
switch off the lights so I'll be back

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.310 
switch off the lights so I'll be back

as<00:00:44.530> dark<00:00:44.829> as<00:00:45.070> it<00:00:45.100> gets<00:00:45.220> this<00:00:46.000> is<00:00:46.149> what<00:00:46.300> I've

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
as dark as it gets this is what I've

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.290 
as dark as it gets this is what I've
been<00:00:46.450> capturing<00:00:47.050> with<00:00:47.920> several<00:00:48.730> smartphones

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300

with<00:00:49.600> flesh<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:51.239> also<00:00:52.239> using<00:00:53.100> very<00:00:54.100> long

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
with flesh and also using very long

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.610 
with flesh and also using very long
shutter<00:00:54.640> times<00:00:55.000> like<00:00:55.239> on<00:00:55.450> the<00:00:55.620> Panasonic

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
shutter times like on the Panasonic

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.370 
shutter times like on the Panasonic
Lumix<00:00:56.700> dmcc<00:00:57.700> m1<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:58.930> now<00:00:59.050> I'm<00:00:59.140> going<00:00:59.320> to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
Lumix dmcc m1 and now I'm going to

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.130 
Lumix dmcc m1 and now I'm going to
capture<00:00:59.559> it<00:00:59.829> with<00:00:59.860> the<00:01:00.250> low<00:01:00.850> IP<00:01:01.059> 8<00:01:01.450> in<00:01:01.960> its

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
capture it with the low IP 8 in its

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.249 
capture it with the low IP 8 in its
super<00:01:02.590> night<00:01:02.770> mode<00:01:03.040> and<00:01:03.969> I<00:01:04.839> think<00:01:05.049> you<00:01:05.110> gotta

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
super night mode and I think you gotta

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:06.929 
super night mode and I think you gotta
find<00:01:05.469> this<00:01:05.560> interesting<00:01:05.829> I<00:01:06.040> put<00:01:06.369> it<00:01:06.460> on<00:01:06.579> super

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
find this interesting I put it on super

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.719 
find this interesting I put it on super
night<00:01:07.090> mode<00:01:07.270> already<00:01:07.420> I<00:01:08.189> would<00:01:09.189> be<00:01:09.340> nice<00:01:09.490> if

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
night mode already I would be nice if

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.239 
night mode already I would be nice if
this<00:01:09.880> Desai's<00:01:10.869> would<00:01:11.109> focus<00:01:11.380> there<00:01:12.009> you<00:01:12.100> go

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249 
this Desai's would focus there you go

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:16.410 
this Desai's would focus there you go
and<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.840> on<00:01:14.020> ISO<00:01:14.380> 100<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.909> you'll<00:01:16.060> see<00:01:16.240> what

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
and and on ISO 100 and you'll see what

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.260 
and and on ISO 100 and you'll see what
happens<00:01:16.450> this<00:01:16.990> only<00:01:17.170> works<00:01:17.469> on<00:01:17.740> its<00:01:18.549> lowest

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
happens this only works on its lowest

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.980 
happens this only works on its lowest
resolution<00:01:19.630> by<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.350> way<00:01:20.529> so<00:01:21.520> this<00:01:21.909> is<00:01:22.029> on<00:01:22.209> 6

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
resolution by the way so this is on 6

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.550 
resolution by the way so this is on 6
megapixel<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.729> you'll<00:01:24.969> see<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.689> sensor

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
megapixel and you'll see that the sensor

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.870 
megapixel and you'll see that the sensor
will<00:01:26.740> capture<00:01:27.159> every<00:01:27.999> possible<00:01:28.840> light<00:01:29.409> it<00:01:30.130> can

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
will capture every possible light it can

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.709 
will capture every possible light it can
find<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.969> it's<00:01:33.969> pretty<00:01:34.240> amazing<00:01:34.450> because

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
find and it's pretty amazing because

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.819 
find and it's pretty amazing because
with<00:01:35.079> my<00:01:35.459> my<00:01:36.459> own<00:01:36.609> eyes<00:01:36.789> I<00:01:36.819> can't<00:01:37.509> see<00:01:37.829> any

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
with my my own eyes I can't see any

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.019 
with my my own eyes I can't see any
difference<00:01:40.349> in<00:01:41.349> the<00:01:41.649> color<00:01:41.859> but<00:01:42.189> as<00:01:42.459> you<00:01:42.849> can

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:43.029 
difference in the color but as you can

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:47.399 
difference in the color but as you can
see<00:01:43.209> on<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:43.450> screen<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:45.219> really<00:01:46.409> capturing

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
see on the screen it is really capturing

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.639 
see on the screen it is really capturing
just<00:01:47.889> about<00:01:48.069> everything<00:01:48.399> it<00:01:48.609> can<00:01:48.789> and<00:01:49.649> it's

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
just about everything it can and it's

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.539 
just about everything it can and it's
working<00:01:50.859> on<00:01:51.929> for<00:01:52.929> 30<00:01:53.349> seconds<00:01:53.829> and<00:01:54.279> there<00:01:54.399> you
