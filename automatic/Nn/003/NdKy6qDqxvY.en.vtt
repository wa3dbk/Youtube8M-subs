00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
help increase the quality at all I know

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.440 
help increase the quality at all I know
that<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.930> doesn't<00:02:25.560> have<00:02:26.010> full<00:02:26.520> auto<00:02:26.850> focus

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
that this doesn't have full auto focus

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.050 
that this doesn't have full auto focus
in<00:02:27.660> video<00:02:28.020> mode<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.620> do<00:02:29.130> believe<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.730> has<00:02:29.850> like<00:02:30.000> a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
in video mode I do believe it has like a

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.450 
in video mode I do believe it has like a
face<00:02:30.300> detection<00:02:30.510> focus<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:31.680> if<00:02:31.950> I'm<00:02:32.190> recording

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
face detection focus so if I'm recording

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.310 
face detection focus so if I'm recording
myself<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:33.030> sit<00:02:33.240> in<00:02:33.330> there<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.660> will<00:02:33.900> have<00:02:34.170> my

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
myself to sit in there it will have my

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.290 
myself to sit in there it will have my
face<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.740> focus<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.460> start<00:02:35.700> moving<00:02:36.120> I

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
face and focus but if I start moving I

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.080 
face and focus but if I start moving I
think<00:02:37.020> everything<00:02:37.260> else<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:38.040> don't<00:02:38.610> know<00:02:38.850> I

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
think everything else is I don't know I

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.120 
think everything else is I don't know I
don't<00:02:39.540> know<00:02:39.840> too<00:02:39.900> much<00:02:40.170> about<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.650> but<00:02:40.890> I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
don't know too much about it but I

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.190 
don't know too much about it but I
