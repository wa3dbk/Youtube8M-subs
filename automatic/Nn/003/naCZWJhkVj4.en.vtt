00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:24.230
 then caught with the site catches the ps 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:27.350
 It takes a while and then you 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.060

 My hair does not fall out. 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:38.650
 but fell quite a lot with the action. 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.060
 fix the bugs until I remembered 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.820
 of a video I had watched does 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.530
 time I was teaching how to pack 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.380
 the control error spoils 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.840
 and it worked only that it is not 100% so if 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.910
 Can you play, I do not know, but four 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.010

 new 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.240
 sure and there will be the cras aires 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.020
 initial inaccurate is the computer for 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.720
 succeed 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.330
 This is what you will do already after 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.310
 have installed here in my case is another 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.500
 kind of shortcut as one can perceive it 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.250
 I 'm not going to achieve this, I 'm going to explain. 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.340
 for you because then she instead of you go 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.560
 there and clicks that shortcut that is 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.650
 the cross out what you will do if 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.490
 right-click and go in 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.070
 properties in april archive location 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.530
 done that's what you're going to do in 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.430
 instead of you open that hakim crossfire 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:33.910
 you will open and if this pet only 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.910
 before opening the pet is a click on this 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.360
 Okay, I do not know who to say 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.550
 But when I opened it, it worked. 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.190
 then explain the tie 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.500
 cf she will not open it because otherwise 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.020
 will open the game the process and the ghost 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.539
 not record the game but after you have 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.610
 updated but you just open it you 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.050
 right click and send to 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.030
 the desktop 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.220
 He's going to stay right there. 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:06.760
 change the icon so that it has more 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.760
 High pet would be that it opens the crossfire 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:13.850
 quickly however will have some 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.050
 bugs in the beginning 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.970
 But you can play 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.789
 quiet several matches I was with 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.770
 this problem and that gives you a lock 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.760
 but at least I can play a little 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.010
