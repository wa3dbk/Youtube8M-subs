00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
had hair sticking up everywhere so I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.819 
had hair sticking up everywhere so I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
needed to get it twisted but for the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.530 
needed to get it twisted but for the
past<00:01:37.979> month<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.520> didn't<00:01:38.790> experience<00:01:39.119> any

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.740 
past month I didn't experience any
itching<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.680> was<00:01:40.920> good<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.750> I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
itching so that was that was good and I

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.990 
itching so that was that was good and I
didn't<00:01:43.140> put<00:01:43.200> anything<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:44.040> retwist<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.700> tree<00:01:44.880> do

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
didn't put anything to retwist a tree do

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.399 
didn't put anything to retwist a tree do
it<00:01:45.090> myself<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.720> kind<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.930> let<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.079> do<00:01:46.259> its

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
it myself I just kind of let it do its

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.380 
it myself I just kind of let it do its
own<00:01:46.530> thing<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.759> guess<00:01:47.939> that's<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.240> big

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
own thing and I guess that's a big

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.319 
own thing and I guess that's a big
reason<00:01:48.540> why<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.840> was<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.200> fuzzy<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:50.460> uh<00:01:50.490> tour

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
reason why I was so fuzzy but uh tour

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.109 
reason why I was so fuzzy but uh tour
hook<00:01:51.570> me<00:01:51.780> up<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:54.110> um<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.740> really<00:01:56.430> actually<00:01:56.790> don't

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
hook me up so um I really actually don't

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.530 
hook me up so um I really actually don't
know<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:57.930> else<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> diet<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
know what else is in the diet of what to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.819 
know what else is in the diet of what to
put<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:00.960> because<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.229> haven't<00:02:01.380> had<00:02:01.619> any

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
put in here because I haven't had any

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.459 
put in here because I haven't had any
problems<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:02.399> them<00:02:02.930> just<00:02:03.930> besides<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
problems with them just besides the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.080 
problems with them just besides the
fuzziness<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.340> gets<00:02:05.700> taken<00:02:05.850> care

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
fuzziness but that just gets taken care

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.999 
fuzziness but that just gets taken care
of<00:02:06.149> whenever<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.600> get<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.840> twisted<00:02:07.110> anyway

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
of whenever you get it twisted anyway

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.869 
of whenever you get it twisted anyway
it's<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.519> big<00:02:08.700> deal<00:02:08.819> oh<00:02:11.840> let<00:02:12.840> me<00:02:12.870> see<00:02:13.230> what
