00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080 

I<00:00:00.199> guess<00:00:01.199> so<00:00:01.680> if<00:00:01.979> you<00:00:02.070> can<00:00:02.220> see<00:00:02.460> there's<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:02.909> lot

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
I guess so if you can see there's a lot

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.350 
I guess so if you can see there's a lot
of<00:00:03.240> rust<00:00:03.480> on<00:00:03.689> this<00:00:04.310> tool<00:00:07.610> and<00:00:08.610> I'm<00:00:08.730> not<00:00:09.000> going

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
of rust on this tool and I'm not going

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.190 
of rust on this tool and I'm not going
to<00:00:09.420> use<00:00:09.540> acids<00:00:10.170> or<00:00:10.410> any<00:00:11.389> brushes<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.840> scrub

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
to use acids or any brushes to scrub

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.079 
to use acids or any brushes to scrub
this<00:00:13.440> I'm<00:00:13.740> gonna<00:00:13.920> clean<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.460> using

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
this I'm gonna clean it using

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.990 
this I'm gonna clean it using
electricity<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.049> actually<00:00:16.529> convert<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
electricity and actually convert the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.410 
electricity and actually convert the
rust<00:00:18.270> which<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.960> iron<00:00:19.350> oxide<00:00:19.500> back<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.250> iron<00:00:20.430> at

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
rust which is iron oxide back to iron at

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.779 
rust which is iron oxide back to iron at
the<00:00:21.480> expense<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.320> sacrificial<00:00:22.830> anode<00:00:23.400> which

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the expense of a sacrificial anode which

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.609 
the expense of a sacrificial anode which
is<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.970> piece<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.210> metal<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.900> railroad

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
is a piece of metal like a railroad

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.390 
is a piece of metal like a railroad
spike<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.340> don't<00:00:26.580> care<00:00:26.970> if<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.359> gets<00:00:27.510> destroyed

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
spike I don't care if it gets destroyed

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.810 
spike I don't care if it gets destroyed
and<00:00:30.410> some<00:00:31.410> coat<00:00:31.650> hangers<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.250> stuff<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and some coat hangers and stuff for the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.959 
and some coat hangers and stuff for the
positive<00:00:33.809> side<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:35.130> negative<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.790> whatever

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you want to clean you see bubbles coming

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.000 
you want to clean you see bubbles coming
off<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.090> that's<00:00:40.020> completely<00:00:40.200> rusted<00:00:40.890> but

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
off of it that's completely rusted but

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.530 
off of it that's completely rusted but
I'll<00:00:41.129> show<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.309> before<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.910> after<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.300> this

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
I'll show you before and after on this

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.470 
I'll show you before and after on this
my<00:00:43.440> setup<00:00:43.710> makes<00:00:44.100> hydrogen<00:00:44.280> gas<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.360> it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
my setup makes hydrogen gas so I have it

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.940 
my setup makes hydrogen gas so I have it
open<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.980> don't<00:00:47.280> explosion<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.079> 12<00:00:49.680> volt

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
open so I don't explosion but a 12 volt

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.130 
open so I don't explosion but a 12 volt
source<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.610> charger<00:00:51.149> pretty<00:00:51.719> powerful

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
source just a charger pretty powerful

charger from the old helicopter charger
running<00:00:55.710> through<00:00:55.949> an<00:00:56.010> ammeter<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.699> can

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
running through an ammeter so you can

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.830 
running through an ammeter so you can
see<00:00:56.879> how<00:00:56.940> much<00:00:57.000> current<00:00:57.360> I'm<00:00:57.420> flowing

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
see how much current I'm flowing

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.900 
see how much current I'm flowing
right<00:00:58.440> now<00:00:58.559> I'm<00:00:58.620> getting<00:00:59.340> about<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> quarter<00:00:59.879> of

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
right now I'm getting about a quarter of

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.209 
right now I'm getting about a quarter of
an<00:01:00.030> amp<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.420> could<00:01:01.350> get<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.559> up<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:01.920> one

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
an amp I could get it up to like one

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.310 
an amp I could get it up to like one
with<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.730> thing<00:01:03.000> people<00:01:03.449> use<00:01:03.690> car<00:01:03.899> chargers

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
with this thing people use car chargers

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.719 
with this thing people use car chargers
and<00:01:04.409> get<00:01:04.559> two<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:04.890> three<00:01:04.920> amps<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and get two or three amps and get the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.160 
and get two or three amps and get the
thing<00:01:05.909> done<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.180> an<00:01:06.299> hour<00:01:06.510> I'd<00:01:06.840> rather<00:01:06.990> leave

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
thing done in an hour I'd rather leave

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.899 
thing done in an hour I'd rather leave
it<00:01:07.229> overnight<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.890> hydrogen<00:01:08.250> gas

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it overnight with a hydrogen gas

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
it overnight with a hydrogen gas
this<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.869> carbonate<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.439> solution<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.130> it

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
this is carbonate in solution so it

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.039 
this is carbonate in solution so it
conducts<00:01:11.880> electricity<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.600> gotten<00:01:12.960> really

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
conducts electricity it's gotten really

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.510 
conducts electricity it's gotten really
dirty<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.409> should<00:01:13.650> change<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.010> soon<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.430> it's

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
dirty I should change it soon but it's

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.190 
dirty I should change it soon but it's
not<00:01:14.700> toxic<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.479> acid<00:01:15.960> sounds<00:01:16.470> good

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
not toxic like acid sounds good

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.560 
not toxic like acid sounds good
yeah<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.530> will<00:01:19.920> leave<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.250> overnight<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
yeah I will leave this overnight on a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.999 
yeah I will leave this overnight on a
really<00:01:21.869> low<00:01:22.020> setting<00:01:22.470> because<00:01:22.619> I'll<00:01:22.950> be

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
really low setting because I'll be

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.620 
really low setting because I'll be
sleeping<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.790> don't<00:01:24.060> want<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.479> done

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630

a test these tools cuz I'm using I'm
using<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.259> clean<00:01:43.380> engine<00:01:43.860> parts<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
using to clean engine parts for the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:54.700 
using to clean engine parts for the
moped<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.930> got<00:01:47.299> see<00:01:48.299> us<00:01:51.770> look<00:01:52.770> at<00:01:52.890> that

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
moped that just got see us look at that

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.950 
moped that just got see us look at that
no<00:01:55.710> more<00:01:55.920> rest<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.700> black<00:02:00.000> stuff<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.750> what

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
no more rest the black stuff is what

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.780 
no more rest the black stuff is what
they<00:02:01.110> call<00:02:01.290> black<00:02:01.649> rust<00:02:02.009> noise<00:02:02.280> let's<00:02:02.520> turn

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
they call black rust noise let's turn

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.760 
they call black rust noise let's turn
back<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.360> original<00:02:03.780> metal<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.560> top

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
back to the original metal but the top

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.859 
back to the original metal but the top
layer<00:02:05.070> sometimes<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.030> black<00:02:06.329> rust

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
layer sometimes is like this black rust

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.969 
layer sometimes is like this black rust
it's<00:02:07.170> actually<00:02:07.560> magnetite<00:02:09.259> which<00:02:10.259> will<00:02:10.800> come

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
it's actually magnetite which will come

it's actually magnetite which will come
right<00:02:11.190> off<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:11.670> almost<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.209> oil<00:02:12.599> I'll<00:02:12.870> just

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
right off with almost like oil I'll just

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:21.470 
right off with almost like oil I'll just
be<00:02:13.980> able<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.220> take<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.430> over<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.760> sink

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.110 

all<00:02:22.480> right<00:02:22.659> here's<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.409> final<00:02:23.829> product

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.470 

got<00:02:28.120> some<00:02:30.510> good<00:02:31.510> metal<00:02:31.840> again<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.209> inside

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
got some good metal again on the inside

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.750 
got some good metal again on the inside
which<00:02:34.599> is<00:02:34.749> the<00:02:34.840> worst<00:02:35.079> I<00:02:35.469> could<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.489> two-hour

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
which is the worst I could do a two-hour

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.759 
which is the worst I could do a two-hour
acid<00:02:37.299> soak<00:02:37.599> base<00:02:38.549> neutralization<00:02:40.650> soaked<00:02:41.650> in

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
acid soak base neutralization soaked in

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.050 
acid soak base neutralization soaked in
alcohol<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.310> displace<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.879> water

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
alcohol to displace the water

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.970 
alcohol to displace the water
there's<00:02:46.060> acid-base<00:02:46.870> drinks<00:02:47.260> for<00:02:47.620> instance

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
there's acid-base drinks for instance

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.940 
there's acid-base drinks for instance
70%<00:02:48.609> isopropyl<00:02:49.120> alcohol<00:02:49.919> displaces<00:02:50.919> the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
70% isopropyl alcohol displaces the

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.679 
70% isopropyl alcohol displaces the
water<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:51.400> there's<00:02:51.519> no<00:02:51.669> flash<00:02:51.969> rusting<00:02:52.480> and

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
water so there's no flash rusting and

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.559 
water so there's no flash rusting and
then<00:02:53.049> I<00:02:53.379> can<00:02:54.250> put<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.519> on<00:02:54.609> this<00:02:54.879> which<00:02:55.269> is

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
then I can put it on this which is

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.869 
then I can put it on this which is
dehumidifier<00:02:56.319> so<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:56.709> got<00:02:56.859> air<00:02:57.040> hot<00:02:57.400> air<00:02:57.430> flow

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
dehumidifier so I got air hot air flow

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.509 
dehumidifier so I got air hot air flow
with<00:02:58.239> no<00:02:58.510> moisture<00:02:58.840> in<00:02:59.199> it<00:02:59.379> and<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.280> would

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
with no moisture in it and that would

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.860 
with no moisture in it and that would
completely<00:03:01.000> get<00:03:01.239> this<00:03:01.359> back<00:03:01.599> to<00:03:01.629> original

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
completely get this back to original

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.379 
completely get this back to original
shiny<00:03:02.319> metal<00:03:02.560> but<00:03:03.519> I<00:03:03.760> don't<00:03:04.120> care<00:03:04.299> how<00:03:04.359> it

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
shiny metal but I don't care how it

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.879 
shiny metal but I don't care how it
looks<00:03:04.659> it's<00:03:04.870> just<00:03:05.019> for<00:03:05.199> prep<00:03:05.469> you<00:03:05.769> know

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
looks it's just for prep you know

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.559 
looks it's just for prep you know
function<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.579> point<00:03:06.790> is<00:03:06.939> you<00:03:07.120> can<00:03:07.299> restore

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
function the point is you can restore

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.659 
function the point is you can restore
metal<00:03:07.930> which<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.560> good<00:03:08.949> because<00:03:09.310> then<00:03:09.609> you

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:09.669
