were<00:00:38.130> the<00:00:38.280> pterosaurs<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.360> kind<00:00:39.629> whose

up<00:00:54.140> here<00:00:54.469> in<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:54.710> trees<00:00:54.949> they<00:00:55.699> were<00:00:55.730> safe<00:00:56.120> from

and<00:01:03.700> there<00:01:03.820> were<00:01:03.910> plenty<00:01:04.150> of<00:01:04.390> flying<00:01:04.720> insects

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
and there were plenty of flying insects

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:28.420 
and there were plenty of flying insects
ordered<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.800> catch<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.790> eat

but these early flying reptiles were
pioneers<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.940> it<00:01:33.270> may<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.510> either<00:01:33.869> just

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
pioneers and it may be either just

pioneers and it may be either just
occasionally<00:01:35.220> they<00:01:35.909> were<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.119> little<00:01:36.390> clumsy
