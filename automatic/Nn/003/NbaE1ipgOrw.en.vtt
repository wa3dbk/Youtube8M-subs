00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.850
 how to get my players to perform 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.850
 plus 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.830
 it is evident that the training of 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.650
 athlete has changed a lot with the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.160
 time before the physical work was the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.380
 foundation however over time the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.540
 experts have been realizing that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.490
 there are other very interesting factors 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.350
 and elementary to get more 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.160
 performance in the players of a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.380
 team 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.570
 the objective that we propose is 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.880
 discover how we can improve the 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.890
 performance of our players to 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.800
 through elements as important as 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.840
 they are setting high goals the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.080
 optimal planning of those objectives 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.620
 without fear and with willpower the 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.110
 teamwork et cetera and here in the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.690
 foundation as one of the things that you 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.180
 teach is that of the sum discipline 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.510
 strict as they prepare us for a 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.700
 future is something different from what I have 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.950
 found in different places and I 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.989
 I think it's fundamental to be a great 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.640
 professional and so on in the future when 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.460
 we have some problem to know how to react 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.530
 and the more you demand in the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.119
 discipline you can give your best in 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.880
 each party and the teachers demand 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.860
 a lot and that's what I like the most because 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.660
 every time I fail they correct me 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.370
 errors and correcting all errors 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.040
 you reach success 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.270
 maximum performance in sports only 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.000
 is achieved by delivering you 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.990
 permanently to one hundred percent and 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.030
 with a maximum level of self-demand 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.450
 every day in training and 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.760
 in the matches always with desire and without 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.400
 you want to do it in the matches is more 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.490
 simple but always training 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.870
 is what distinguishes a good player from 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.820
 a true champion 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.340
 if you want to get the most out of your 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.310
 sport you have to work each and every 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.100
 one of the days giving the hundred of you 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.130
 same in all situations until 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.590
 this becomes a habit you have 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.380
 that set the bar at the top and not 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.990
 never download it for that you need a 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.260
 absolute delivery never put you 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.210
 excuses low goals do not accept any 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.150
 kind of distractions with which 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.610
 we are usually bombed 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.709
 when you are better than the rival the task 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.010
 for some it is much simpler 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.890
 because you have the feeling that the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.530
 rival overcomes them in different ways and 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.840
 at the game level but you do not have to go down 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.519
 the arms and keep on working 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.310
 to fix the high performance and be 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.519
 better at the level of motivation and level of 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.170
 work when not when you're not better 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.930
 that the rival you have to try to 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.790
 to overcome you and to work and to strive 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.190
 to reach a high performance and be 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.840
 better every day and that with work and with 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.329
 effort and with motivation you will be able to 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.069
 to even surpass your rival and 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.500
 be better every day do not have to enter the 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.560
 party thinking that everything is already 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.049
 lost me nor here to grow to learn to 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.730
 training as a player and as a person not 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.069
 you have to play alone with your head you have to 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.569
 play mainly with the heart to 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.879
 less failure are like victories too 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.709
 you acquire qualities that are going to make you 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.079
 Become a professional footballer in 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.060
 football there are no impossible goals and 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.500
 Even if you fail, you have to get up 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.239
 you have to think about all the effort that 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.940
 you've done with my son I have coaches 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.100
 when you're little you'll get more than laugh 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.440
 come down and here with the training that 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.900
 we have not assured us by whom 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.510
 nobody can assure you of anything but you have 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.880
 a large percentage of arriving but maybe 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.400
 you may think that this is very complicated 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.070
 and it's not like this is closer than 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.450
 you think it's about changing some of 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.450
 our habits by others 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.930
 one does not fail for 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.700
 for losing a game for not playing well 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.270
 fails because the mistakes that have 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.910
 task 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.230
 he does not correct them and he blames 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.380
 others invent that is committing 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.340
 mistakes is he when one puts one 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:11.390
 goal because it is not, it is not easy to reach 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.470
 that goal the day to day work is the most 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.690
 important 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.780
 any professional in any 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.299
 success story that you listen to 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.440
 behind all that there is a very basic 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.440
 strong work
