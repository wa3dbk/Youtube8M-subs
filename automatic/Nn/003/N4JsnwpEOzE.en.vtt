00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
single cam it's pretty fast too it's

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.569 
single cam it's pretty fast too it's
around<00:00:45.809> three<00:00:46.440> minutes<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.950> fifty<00:00:47.370> maybe

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
three minutes of 55 seconds or so and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
three minutes of 55 seconds or so and
you<00:00:50.399> might<00:00:50.640> not<00:00:50.670> think<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.180> stopped<00:00:51.510> fast<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.960> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
you might not think I stopped fast of a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.779 
you might not think I stopped fast of a
chemistry<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> reasons<00:00:53.640> why

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
chemistry but one of the reasons why

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.580 
chemistry but one of the reasons why
it's<00:00:54.000> pretty<00:00:54.239> fast<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.440> pretty

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it's pretty fast or we think it's pretty

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.170 
it's pretty fast or we think it's pretty
fast<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.340> no<00:00:56.489> standard<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.059> run

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
fast is because this no standard is run

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.819 
fast is because this no standard is run
the<00:00:57.210> new<00:00:57.390> dlc<00:00:57.840> drops<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.320> really<00:00:58.559> hard<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the new dlc drops it's really hard to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.799 
the new dlc drops it's really hard to
get<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.219> kem<00:00:59.640> strike<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.090> pretty<00:01:00.329> fast<00:01:00.600> on

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
get a kem strike that's pretty fast on

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.410 
get a kem strike that's pretty fast on
new<00:01:01.050> maps<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.699> especially<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> map<00:01:03.210> that's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
new maps and especially on a map that's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.929 
new maps and especially on a map that's
pretty<00:01:03.719> dark<00:01:04.019> itself<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.760> it's

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
pretty dark itself and you know it's

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:06.980 
pretty dark itself and you know it's
pretty<00:01:06.150> hard<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.420> see<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.930> map

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
pretty hard to see on this map

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.109 
pretty hard to see on this map
especially<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:08.130> obviously<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.850> dark

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
especially because obviously it is dark

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.539 
especially because obviously it is dark
and<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.650> fasano<00:01:10.979> really<00:01:11.369> did<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
and I think that fasano really did a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.370 
and I think that fasano really did a
great<00:01:11.729> job<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.090> maneuvering<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> map<00:01:13.020> this

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
great job of maneuvering the map this

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260 
great job of maneuvering the map this
whole<00:01:13.560> entire<00:01:13.710> map<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.250> rewatched<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.090> he

throughout the whole entire game

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.370 
throughout the whole entire game
obviously<00:01:18.210> because<00:01:18.659> he<00:01:18.750> got<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> chemistry

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
obviously because he got the chemistry

people<00:02:12.250> but<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.480> gameplay<00:02:13.720> itself<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:15.400> pretty

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
people but the gameplay itself is pretty

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.820 
people but the gameplay itself is pretty
unique<00:02:15.940> because<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.810> don't<00:02:16.959> really<00:02:17.110> see<00:02:17.440> many

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
unique because you don't really see many

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.530 
unique because you don't really see many
gameplays<00:02:18.370> where<00:02:18.700> you're<00:02:18.940> not<00:02:19.120> using<00:02:19.360> a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
gameplays where you're not using a

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.870 
gameplays where you're not using a
silencer<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:20.200> get<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.350> kem<00:02:20.590> strike<00:02:20.830> because<00:02:21.040> you

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
silencer to get a kem strike because you

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.050 
silencer to get a kem strike because you
do<00:02:22.300> end<00:02:22.600> up<00:02:22.870> getting<00:02:23.440> shown<00:02:23.800> on<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.250> radar<00:02:24.489> so

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
do end up getting shown on the radar so

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.490 
do end up getting shown on the radar so
I<00:02:25.300> guess<00:02:25.720> in<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.380> way<00:02:26.520> he<00:02:27.520> did<00:02:27.959> defeat<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.140> radar

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
I guess in a way he did defeat the radar

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.780 
I guess in a way he did defeat the radar
already<00:02:29.770> did<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.100> feed<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.370> other<00:02:30.489> players

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
already did to feed the other players

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.720 
already did to feed the other players
pretty<00:02:31.150> well<00:02:31.330> because<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.860> radar<00:02:33.250> is<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.430> big

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
pretty well because the radar is a big

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.420 
pretty well because the radar is a big
part<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.360> game<00:02:34.570> in<00:02:34.930> call<00:02:35.470> duty<00:02:35.769> itself

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
part of the game in call duty itself

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.310 
part of the game in call duty itself
because<00:02:36.880> when<00:02:37.570> someone<00:02:37.780> shoots<00:02:38.140> you

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
because when someone shoots you

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.690 
because when someone shoots you
obviously<00:02:38.709> hear<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> Bulls<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.430> see<00:02:39.610> the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
obviously hear the Bulls and you see the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.340 
obviously hear the Bulls and you see the
boys<00:02:39.880> with<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.239> silencer<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.810> could<00:02:40.959> barely

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
boys with the silencer you could barely

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.320 
boys with the silencer you could barely
hear<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.769> shot<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.310> get<00:02:42.459> shown<00:02:42.820> off<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
hear the shot and you get shown off the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.270 
hear the shot and you get shown off the
radar<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.930> he<00:02:44.500> had<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.650> maneuver<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.130> map

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
radar so he had a maneuver the map

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.610 
radar so he had a maneuver the map
pretty<00:02:45.519> well<00:02:45.730> plus<00:02:46.180> yet<00:02:46.480> his<00:02:46.600> dead<00:02:46.840> eye<00:02:46.870> on<00:02:47.200> for

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
pretty well plus yet his dead eye on for

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.250 
pretty well plus yet his dead eye on for
his<00:02:47.739> starting<00:02:48.250> point<00:02:48.489> so<00:02:49.239> he<00:02:49.570> had<00:02:49.690> no<00:02:49.720> stalker

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
his starting point so he had no stalker

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.500 
his starting point so he had no stalker
on<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:50.950> he<00:02:51.160> was<00:02:51.310> just<00:02:51.459> absolutely<00:02:52.000> destroying

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.840 
opinion overpowered perk but it does
work<00:03:14.350> well<00:03:14.380> because<00:03:14.799> if<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.340> do<00:03:15.489> get<00:03:15.640> on<00:03:15.760> the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
work well because if you do get on the

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.449 
work well because if you do get on the
killstreak<00:03:16.329> you<00:03:16.750> know<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.049> is<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.260> big<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:18.070> is<00:03:18.430> a

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
killstreak you know it is a big it is a

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.400 
killstreak you know it is a big it is a
big<00:03:18.820> help<00:03:19.180> when<00:03:19.420> you<00:03:19.600> do<00:03:19.750> get<00:03:19.900> on<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.049> killstreak

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
big help when you do get on a killstreak

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.039 
big help when you do get on a killstreak
but<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.280> then<00:03:21.519> again<00:03:21.820> it<00:03:22.000> is<00:03:22.150> overpowered

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
but I then again it is overpowered

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.479 
but I then again it is overpowered
because<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.620> shouldn't<00:03:23.950> be<00:03:24.070> able<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.310> kill

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
because you shouldn't be able to kill

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.039 
because you shouldn't be able to kill
people<00:03:24.640> faster<00:03:25.299> than<00:03:25.450> they<00:03:25.570> should<00:03:25.600> be<00:03:25.959> able

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
people faster than they should be able

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.289 
people faster than they should be able
to<00:03:26.230> kill<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.590> but<00:03:27.340> at<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.670> same<00:03:27.850> time<00:03:28.060> if

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
to kill you but at the same time if

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.250 
to kill you but at the same time if
you're<00:03:28.420> good<00:03:28.630> enough<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.840> get<00:03:29.049> those

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
you're good enough to get those

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.050 
you're good enough to get those
killstreaks<00:03:29.829> you<00:03:30.100> should<00:03:30.400> have<00:03:30.610> an<00:03:30.730> advantage

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
killstreaks you should have an advantage

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.060 
killstreaks you should have an advantage
because<00:03:31.360> you<00:03:31.600> are<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.810> better<00:03:31.989> player<00:03:32.320> so<00:03:32.920> it

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
because you are a better player so it

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.130 
because you are a better player so it
does<00:03:33.220> make<00:03:33.250> sense<00:03:33.459> in<00:03:34.000> a

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
does make sense in a

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.559 
does make sense in a
and<00:03:35.319> in<00:03:35.740> a<00:03:36.340> sense<00:03:36.610> it<00:03:36.910> does<00:03:37.150> make<00:03:37.360> sense

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
and in a sense it does make sense

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.440 
and in a sense it does make sense
