00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.609 
that for me always comes a sore throat
which<00:00:26.849> isn't<00:00:27.029> always<00:00:27.390> great<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:27.840> talking<00:00:28.289> so

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
which isn't always great for talking so

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.150 
which isn't always great for talking so
today's<00:00:29.609> episode<00:00:30.289> is<00:00:31.289> gonna<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> little<00:00:32.009> bit

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
today's episode is gonna be a little bit

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.190 
today's episode is gonna be a little bit
shorter<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:33.450> kind<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.989> little

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
shorter it's kind of just a little

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.810 
shorter it's kind of just a little
addition<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:35.070> something<00:00:35.430> else<00:00:35.670> I've<00:00:35.790> been

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
addition to something else I've been

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.970 
addition to something else I've been
talking<00:00:36.210> about<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.290> technique<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
talking about and it's a technique a

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.690 
talking about and it's a technique a
little<00:00:38.370> thing<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.790> call<00:00:39.180> hi-hat<00:00:40.079> rolls

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
little thing that I call hi-hat rolls

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.590 
little thing that I call hi-hat rolls
that's<00:00:41.700> because<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.090> supposed<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> sound

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that's because it's supposed to sound

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.709 
that's because it's supposed to sound
like<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.559> hi-hat<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.550> drum<00:00:44.850> set<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.510> when<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
like the hi-hat on a drum set but when a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.080 
like the hi-hat on a drum set but when a
drummer<00:00:46.050> does<00:00:46.649> kind<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.039> roll<00:00:47.340> technique

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
drummer does kind of a roll technique

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.040 
drummer does kind of a roll technique
with<00:00:48.690> that

with that

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.350 
with that
so<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.260> talked<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.710> an<00:00:49.890> earlier<00:00:49.920> episode<00:00:50.370> that

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.620 
give kind of a pitch list sound here I
would<00:02:09.450> go<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:10.050> EE<00:02:10.890> position<00:02:11.610> with<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
would go to this EE position with the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.920 
would go to this EE position with the
with<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> index<00:02:14.130> finger<00:02:14.250> up<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.750> usually

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
with the index finger up and I usually

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.340 
with the index finger up and I usually
do<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.410> up<00:02:16.710> just<00:02:17.040> slightly<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.959> reason<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.290> do

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
do it up just slightly the reason I do

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.100 
do it up just slightly the reason I do
that<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.650> because<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.310> accidentally

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
that is because if I accidentally

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.530 
that is because if I accidentally
produce<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.860> certain<00:02:23.370> airflow<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.120> would

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
produce a certain airflow that would

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.620 
produce a certain airflow that would
actually<00:02:24.810> make<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.959> tone<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:26.490> don't<00:02:27.180> want<00:02:27.540> to

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
actually make a tone I don't want to

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.990 
actually make a tone I don't want to
make<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.780> tone<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.170> want<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.440> be<00:02:28.530> pitch<00:02:28.770> 'less<00:02:29.040> and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
make a tone I want to be pitch 'less and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.360 
make a tone I want to be pitch 'less and
so<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.209> just<00:02:30.420> find<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.900> yes<00:02:31.830> putting<00:02:32.190> some

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
so I just find that yes putting some

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.370 
so I just find that yes putting some
fingers<00:02:32.610> down<00:02:32.790> helps<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.420> sound<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:34.110> get<00:02:34.260> out

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
fingers down helps the sound to get out

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.460 
fingers down helps the sound to get out
through<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> horn<00:02:35.450> but<00:02:36.450> also<00:02:36.600> having<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.260> hole

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
through the horn but also having a hole

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.040 
through the horn but also having a hole
up<00:02:37.709> here<00:02:37.739> up<00:02:38.670> higher<00:02:39.030> helps<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> air<00:02:39.870> release

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
up here up higher helps the air release

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.900 
up here up higher helps the air release
and<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.770> just<00:02:40.950> doesn't<00:02:41.220> make<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.400> clear<00:02:41.700> tone

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
and it just doesn't make a clear tone

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.520 
and it just doesn't make a clear tone
because<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.720> want<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.989> sound<00:02:43.140> like<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.290> hi-hat

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
because I want to sound like a hi-hat

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.240 
because I want to sound like a hi-hat
which<00:02:43.739> does<00:02:43.920> not<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.300> definite<00:02:45.300> pitch<00:02:46.250> one

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
which does not have a definite pitch one

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.009 
which does not have a definite pitch one
other<00:02:47.430> thing<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:48.000> have<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.390> mention<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:48.840> all

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
other thing I have to mention like all

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.890 
other thing I have to mention like all
the<00:02:49.170> effects<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.860> do<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.880> sound<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.630> sounds

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
the effects I do the sound this sounds

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.390 
the effects I do the sound this sounds
like<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:52.050> broken<00:02:52.320> record<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.890> sound<00:02:53.130> needs<00:02:53.310> to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
like a broken record the sound needs to

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.250 
like a broken record the sound needs to
go<00:02:53.550> through<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.180> horn<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.570> out<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.900> can't

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
go through the horn and out so you can't

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.970 
go through the horn and out so you can't
go<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.920> can't<00:02:56.100> just<00:02:56.250> go

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.290 

you<00:02:59.980> can't<00:03:00.190> leave<00:03:00.310> your<00:03:00.430> mouth<00:03:00.580> open<00:03:00.760> now<00:03:01.060> this

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
you can't leave your mouth open now this

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.820 
you can't leave your mouth open now this
this<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.660> picking<00:03:02.020> up<00:03:02.170> because<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.470> mics<00:03:02.650> here

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
this is picking up because the mics here

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.880 
this is picking up because the mics here
for<00:03:03.010> my<00:03:03.100> my<00:03:03.580> talking<00:03:04.030> but<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:04.990> needs<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.230> be

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.770 

and<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.910> can<00:03:10.030> hear<00:03:10.240> a<00:03:10.270> difference<00:03:10.390> when<00:03:10.720> you

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
and you can hear a difference when you

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.089 
and you can hear a difference when you
close<00:03:10.990> your<00:03:11.110> mouth

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.539 

and<00:03:17.189> that's<00:03:17.790> what<00:03:17.969> we're<00:03:18.090> going<00:03:18.359> for<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:19.549> lots

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
and that's what we're going for so lots

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.379 
and that's what we're going for so lots
of<00:03:20.640> different<00:03:20.700> things<00:03:20.939> you<00:03:21.060> can<00:03:21.209> do<00:03:21.299> to

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
of different things you can do to

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.750 
of different things you can do to
practice<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.560> first<00:03:22.709> involves<00:03:23.280> just

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
practice this so first involves just

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.360 
practice this so first involves just
learning<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.060> flutter<00:03:24.329> your<00:03:24.569> t's

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
learning to flutter your t's

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.000 
learning to flutter your t's
which<00:03:26.970> some<00:03:27.780> people<00:03:27.900> either<00:03:28.470> can<00:03:28.620> do<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:28.890> or

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
which some people either can do it or

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.920 
which some people either can do it or
can't<00:03:29.280> if<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:29.610> can't<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:30.150> can<00:03:30.269> work<00:03:30.450> on<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:30.810> I

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
can't if you can't you can work on it I

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.350 
can't if you can't you can work on it I
couldn't<00:03:31.709> referring<00:03:32.430> example<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:32.940> never<00:03:33.030> could

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
couldn't referring example I never could

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.350 
couldn't referring example I never could
roll<00:03:33.510> my<00:03:33.629> arse<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.080> learned<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.410> do<00:03:34.620> that

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
roll my arse and I learned to do that

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.850 
roll my arse and I learned to do that
involves<00:03:36.360> some<00:03:36.480> pressure<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:37.470> your<00:03:37.650> tongue

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
involves some pressure of your tongue

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.520 
involves some pressure of your tongue
against<00:03:38.190> your<00:03:38.340> teeth<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:38.970> just<00:03:39.470> finding<00:03:40.470> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
against your teeth and just finding the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.320 
against your teeth and just finding the
right<00:03:40.650> amount<00:03:41.129> of<00:03:41.160> air<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.910> shoot<00:03:42.090> through

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
right amount of air to shoot through

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.449 
right amount of air to shoot through
there<00:03:42.480> just<00:03:42.750> letting<00:03:43.410> enough<00:03:43.739> air<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.340> it

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
there just letting enough air and so it

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.140 
there just letting enough air and so it
actually<00:03:44.640> starts<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.150> vibrate<00:03:46.519> then<00:03:47.519> there

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
actually starts to vibrate then there

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.509 
actually starts to vibrate then there
are<00:03:48.209> exercises<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:49.019> do<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.739> just<00:03:50.069> be<00:03:50.459> able

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
are exercises you can do to just be able

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:51.949 
are exercises you can do to just be able
to<00:03:50.610> throw<00:03:50.849> that<00:03:51.000> in<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.330> mix<00:03:51.569> it<00:03:51.690> with<00:03:51.810> your

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
to throw that in to mix it with your

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.500 
to throw that in to mix it with your
Tukka<00:03:52.200> Tukka<00:03:52.319> so<00:03:52.950> like<00:03:53.099> just<00:03:53.310> just<00:03:53.730> going<00:03:54.000> to

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
Tukka Tukka so like just just going to

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.809 
Tukka Tukka so like just just going to
connect<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:01.560> forth<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.010> then<00:04:02.340> doing<00:04:02.549> that

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
connect and so forth and then doing that

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.210 
connect and so forth and then doing that
with<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.239> horn<00:04:04.140> in<00:04:04.260> your<00:04:04.319> mouth<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.950> keeping
