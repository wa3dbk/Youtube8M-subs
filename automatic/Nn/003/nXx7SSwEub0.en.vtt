00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.550
 the ingredients we need to 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.120
 about 300 grams of cream are 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.580
 half a liter of cold milk the peel 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.460
 half a lemon 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.390
 a couple of cinnamon sticks or else a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.200
 vanilla bean 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.780
 I have made cinnamon in my case 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.420
 a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch or flour 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.070
 of corn or if you can not replace it with 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.270
 plain flour 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.610
 4 egg whites and 100 grams of sugar 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.800
 The first thing we are going to do is reserve 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.250
 a cup of half a liter of milk 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.250
 We are going to use 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.490
 in a saucepan we will heat the milk 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.040
 with cinnamon or vanilla and the peel 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.120
 of the lemon we will leave it to low heat 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.100
 until it starts well 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.750
 you have to be aware because when 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.550
 start to boil we have to remove it 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.890
 of the fire immediately 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.960
 once removed we will cover it and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.390
 we will let infuse the milk during 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.090
 half an hour 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.560
 In the meantime in a bowl mix the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.200
 cornstarch with the milk that we had 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.270
 reserved in a cup and with some 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.830
 We mix the rods until they are 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.830
 dissolve the flour completely 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.579
 in another bowl we will mix the yolks of 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.320
 egg with sugar with a spoon what 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.569
 we will remove with energy so that 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.570
 they make the ingredients and sugar well 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.760
 be as diluted as possible 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.260
 to this mixture we will add the flour 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.900
 dissolved with the milk that we have mixed 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.050
 before we beat it well so that it 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.780
 integrate the ingredients and in another saucepan 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.180
 we will pour this mixture and after the average 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.000
 we will add the milk and merged 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.440
 with cinnamon and lemon for it to 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.190
 that no pieces or rest of the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.310
 spices we are going to use a colander 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.200
 and now comes the most important point 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.030
 We are going to place the saucepan on a low heat and 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.770
 it is imperative not to stop stirring 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.500
 so that as it warms up 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.530
 the cream is taking consistency and not 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.300
 we are burned and lumps are formed 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.890
 you despair at the beginning it's hard to 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.729
 league because until it takes 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.100
 temperature 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.080
 the mixture will be very liquid when 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.090
 it starts to heat up right away you will see 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.010
 that is thickening and in a matter of nothing 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.530
 you will notice how the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.540
 consistency we want from 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.400
 there to put out the fire and keep stirring 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.670
 until we get the texture we are looking for 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.890
 and see now we should let cool the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.990
 cream but if we need to use it in 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.200
 the moment I tell you a trick to 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.270
 to cool in a plis we introduce in 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.390
 an airtight bag of these to freeze 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.220
 all our cream we closed it very well 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.220
 and we put it on the marble that 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.740
 norm is always quite cold the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.920
 we put aside we expect about 5 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.170
 minutes we put it on the other side and 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.599
 we waited 5 more minutes 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.540
 and in 10 minutes we have our cream 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.489
 cooled and ready to use if you do not go 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.569
 to use at the moment you can leave 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.730
 cool in the saucepan quietly 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.549
 a little advice that I give you is that if you 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.439
 you can freeze it without problems and 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.170
 so it will hold you well frozen during 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.489
 a month or so more time is no longer 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.069
 highly recommended since you will lose 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.870
 consistency and flavor when you go to 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.819
 use will be enough to take it out of the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.189
 freezer and leave it at temperature 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.780
 environment until it's totally 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.180
 thawed 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.340
 I have made this cream to decorate a 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.840
 from the mouths of san juan that by the way 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.630
 I leave the link in the box 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.400
 information but it serves the same to make 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.470
 any filling for some cake or 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.960
 bun for 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.300
 a Catalan cream or some dessert 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.680
 I hope you liked this recipe and 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.410
 if you put it into practice 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.440
 I hope your comments very many
