greatest icons in a first-ballot
hall-of-famer<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.979> mean<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.579> would<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.759> been

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
hall-of-famer I mean it would have been

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
hall-of-famer I mean it would have been
nice<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.090> see<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.570> Undertaker<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:43.170> SummerSlam

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
nice to see the Undertaker at SummerSlam

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.289 
nice to see the Undertaker at SummerSlam
but<00:01:44.189> let's<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.610> down<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.000> nitty-gritty

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
but let's get down to the nitty-gritty

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.539 
but let's get down to the nitty-gritty
he<00:01:45.930> puts<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> performance<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.159> lifetime

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
he puts on a performance of a lifetime

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.760 
he puts on a performance of a lifetime
at<00:01:47.700> WrestleMania<00:01:48.360> he<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.079> his<00:01:49.229> game<00:01:49.290> at

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
at WrestleMania he is on his game at

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.530 
at WrestleMania he is on his game at
WrestleMania<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.490> quite<00:01:50.729> frankly<00:01:50.759> he<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.360> at

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
WrestleMania and quite frankly he is at

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.690 
WrestleMania and quite frankly he is at
his<00:01:51.689> best<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:52.290> WrestleMania<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.399> other<00:01:53.549> thing

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
his best at WrestleMania the other thing

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.300 
his best at WrestleMania the other thing
it<00:01:53.820> doesn't<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.509> many<00:01:55.320> significant

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it doesn't really have many significant

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.190 
it doesn't really have many significant
moments<00:01:56.700> at<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> SummerSlam<00:01:57.360> than<00:01:57.719> he<00:01:57.840> does<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
moments at a SummerSlam than he does a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.679 
moments at a SummerSlam than he does a
Wrestlemania<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.430> think<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.759> WWE<00:02:00.329> fans

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
Wrestlemania and I think the WWE fans

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.179 
Wrestlemania and I think the WWE fans
would<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.840> much<00:02:01.140> rather<00:02:01.439> interested<00:02:02.130> in

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
would be much rather interested in

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.499 
would be much rather interested in
seeing<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> Undertaker<00:02:02.909> perform<00:02:03.360> at

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
seeing the Undertaker perform at

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.780 
seeing the Undertaker perform at
WrestleMania<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.290> give<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.250> peep<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
WrestleMania and give that one peep the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.280 
WrestleMania and give that one peep the
other<00:02:05.909> think<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.210> what<00:02:06.329> he<00:02:06.420> does<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.899> he<00:02:06.960> gives

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
other think of what he does is he gives

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.619 
other think of what he does is he gives
more<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.399> match<00:02:08.640> than<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> superstar

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
more and that one match than a superstar

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.170 
more and that one match than a superstar
would<00:02:09.780> given<00:02:10.050> an<00:02:10.140> entire<00:02:11.039> year<00:02:11.489> that's<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
would given an entire year that's the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.490 
would given an entire year that's the
bottom<00:02:12.480> line<00:02:12.510> at<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.930> end<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.230> day

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
bottom line at the end of the day

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.020 
bottom line at the end of the day
so<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.620> don't<00:02:13.770> fault<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> Undertaker<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.820> don't
