specify the weights here but you can see

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.860 
specify the weights here but you can see
that<00:00:35.350> he's<00:00:35.710> absolutely<00:00:36.370> humongous<00:00:37.030> and<00:00:37.240> his

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
legs or something I don't even get him

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.910

he<00:00:40.390> would<00:00:40.480> walk<00:00:40.750> with<00:00:40.990> legs<00:00:41.200> that<00:00:41.290> size<00:00:41.590> they

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
he would walk with legs that size they

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.500 
he would walk with legs that size they
with<00:00:42.550> it<00:00:42.670> without<00:00:42.790> his<00:00:43.000> legs<00:00:43.210> rubbing

with it without his legs rubbing
together<00:00:43.750> in<00:00:44.080> chafing<00:00:44.470> because<00:00:45.220> they're<00:00:45.460> just

ridiculous dimensions so here's the
photo<00:01:00.550> that<00:01:00.820> I<00:01:00.850> had<00:01:01.090> in<00:01:01.210> mind<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:01.570> review<00:01:01.989> and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
in condition that I would say is not

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.200 
in condition that I would say is not
obviously<00:01:05.049> in<00:01:05.170> contest<00:01:06.159> shape<00:01:06.310> but<00:01:06.490> looks<00:01:07.030> to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
obviously in contest shape but looks to

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.429 
obviously in contest shape but looks to
be<00:01:07.299> in<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.509> high<00:01:07.630> single<00:01:07.990> digits<00:01:08.020> or

see crossed relations you can see his
abs<00:01:14.289> even<00:01:14.829> though<00:01:15.069> it's<00:01:15.219> a<00:01:15.280> front<00:01:15.429> double

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700

bicep shot you can see some vascularity

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.760 
bicep shot you can see some vascularity
you<00:01:18.249> can<00:01:18.429> see<00:01:18.639> his<00:01:19.600> serratus<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.380> would<00:01:20.530> say<00:01:20.740> I

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
you can see his serratus I would say I

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.520 
you can see his serratus I would say I
mean<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:21.939> could<00:01:22.060> see<00:01:22.299> even<00:01:22.689> vascular<00:01:23.200> Eunice

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
mean you could see even vascular Eunice

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.249 
mean you could see even vascular Eunice
calves<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.939> my<00:01:25.389> thoughts<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:25.810> this<00:01:25.960> is<00:01:26.079> that

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
calves so my thoughts and this is that

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.230 
calves so my thoughts and this is that
remy<00:01:26.469> doesn't<00:01:26.979> really<00:01:27.130> need<00:01:27.280> anymore<00:01:27.549> sighs<00:01:27.939> I

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
remy doesn't really need anymore sighs I

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.449 
remy doesn't really need anymore sighs I
think<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.569> as<00:01:28.929> long<00:01:29.049> like<00:01:29.560> Kai<00:01:29.979> Greene<00:01:30.249> I

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
think that as long like Kai Greene I

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.340 
think that as long like Kai Greene I
think<00:01:31.060> all<00:01:31.209> that<00:01:31.329> he<00:01:31.450> really<00:01:31.780> needs<00:01:31.929> to<00:01:32.079> do<00:01:32.200> is

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
think all that he really needs to do is

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.889 
think all that he really needs to do is
come<00:01:32.619> in<00:01:32.649> in<00:01:32.859> condition<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.670> he<00:01:34.389> should<00:01:34.689> be

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
come in in condition and he should be

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.779 
come in in condition and he should be
able<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.319> continue<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.340> improve<00:01:36.579> in<00:01:36.729> the

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
able to continue to improve in the

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.370 
able to continue to improve in the
placings<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.479> I<00:01:37.689> am<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.840> little<00:01:38.020> concerned

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
placings and I am a little concerned

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.559 
placings and I am a little concerned
considering<00:01:39.189> that<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.429> grammy<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:39.909> 5<00:01:40.149> foot<00:01:40.329> 10

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
considering that the grammy is 5 foot 10

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.289 
considering that the grammy is 5 foot 10
and<00:01:40.899> as<00:01:41.619> heavy<00:01:41.859> is<00:01:42.069> 334<00:01:42.850> pounds<00:01:42.909> in<00:01:43.270> the

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
and as heavy is 334 pounds in the

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.779 
and as heavy is 334 pounds in the
offseason<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:44.109> still<00:01:44.950> relatively<00:01:45.549> young

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
offseason and still relatively young

actually be in the offseason at 400
pounds<00:02:04.659> which<00:02:04.779> is<00:02:04.810> ridiculous<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.649> even<00:02:05.920> think

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
pounds which is ridiculous I even think

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.400 
pounds which is ridiculous I even think
that<00:02:06.189> his<00:02:06.729> current<00:02:07.090> weight<00:02:07.240> being<00:02:07.990> that

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
that his current weight being that

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.980 
that his current weight being that
weight<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.759> condition<00:02:10.030> at<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:10.750> height

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
weight in that condition at that height

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.170 
weight in that condition at that height
I<00:02:11.260> just<00:02:12.160> don't<00:02:12.340> see<00:02:12.460> this<00:02:12.580> being<00:02:12.640> good<00:02:13.030> for

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
I just don't see this being good for

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.300 
I just don't see this being good for
herself<00:02:13.420> not<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.870> provide

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
herself not that provide

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.729 
herself not that provide
is<00:02:14.550> healthy<00:02:14.880> under<00:02:15.209> really<00:02:16.050> any<00:02:16.170> circumstance

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
is healthy under really any circumstance

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.740 
is healthy under really any circumstance
but<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.400> grammy<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:18.180> pushing<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.720> a

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
but the grammy is just pushing it to a

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.690 
but the grammy is just pushing it to a
point<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.140> i<00:02:19.410> wonder<00:02:19.920> if<00:02:20.010> his<00:02:20.130> body<00:02:20.370> will<00:02:20.580> be

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
point that i wonder if his body will be

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.780 
point that i wonder if his body will be
able<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.090> withstand<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.810> side<00:02:22.020> effects<00:02:22.319> of

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
able to withstand the side effects of

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.949 
able to withstand the side effects of
everything<00:02:23.790> required<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.360> be<00:02:24.480> at<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.599> size

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
everything required to be at that size

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.630 
everything required to be at that size
so<00:02:25.650> I'm<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> little<00:02:25.950> concerned<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
so I'm a little concerned for the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.130 
so I'm a little concerned for the
grammys<00:02:26.970> health<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:27.810> think<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.020> all

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
grammys health and I just think that all

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.510 
grammys health and I just think that all
he<00:02:28.290> has<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.410> do<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.620> come<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.099> condition

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
he has to do is come in in condition

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.790 
he has to do is come in in condition
because<00:02:29.730> like<00:02:30.569> Kai<00:02:30.810> Greene<00:02:31.110> he<00:02:31.290> just<00:02:31.500> needs<00:02:31.680> to

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
because like Kai Greene he just needs to

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.009 
because like Kai Greene he just needs to
show<00:02:32.069> up<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:32.370> condition<00:02:33.239> he<00:02:33.330> already<00:02:33.540> has<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
show up in condition he already has the

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.290 
show up in condition he already has the
size<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:35.190> those<00:02:35.340> are<00:02:35.430> my<00:02:35.489> thoughts<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:36.030> really

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
size so those are my thoughts I really

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.880 
size so those are my thoughts I really
