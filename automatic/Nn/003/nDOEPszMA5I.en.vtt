00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.800
 all the guy reminds you of the trick 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.650
 of the school universities here then 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.600
 pretty much this video will do it for 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.340
 tell you a little about how to change your makeup 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
 that you did for example in the morning 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.070
 for the evening in this case a trick 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.620
 very natural remember practically 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.869
 to refer them created and now let's go to 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.150
 emphasize it and improve it as far as possible 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.239
 concerns the evening then that the first 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.300
 what i do is always take for years 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.160
 years that two I used in the speech 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.290
 video this time I put this color here 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.940
 which is much darker than the other than 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.840
 I had used that that was the big one 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:01:00.090
 mac on this here is a dark content e 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:03.239
 I'm going to put it with this with this 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.250
 brush of the former al dam wants it 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.670
 admit just this part here 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.100
 of the eye then as you see for 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.369
 fade to make it say more for the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:21.710
 evening ok now for 70 nelina della 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.710
 ecm and starts smoking 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.100
 then regarding the verse 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.990
 the inside of the eye instead of taking 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.580
 this is precisely what he had used 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.550
 the other time 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:02:00.890
 I will take this much more instead 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.890
 sheen always with brushes we channel 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 watch 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:21.580
 we create a more evening look then we are at 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.960
 vehicular that I had used at the beginning 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.750
 in the other last video this 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.730
 third the mind instead as illuminating 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:37.750
 so it will surely no longer be 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.750
 note to illuminate this part here 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.400
 maybe you want but zero even more 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.400
 this part 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.500
 and then never opening my pencil that 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:23.019
 brown that I used in the last video 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:25.440
 and put it here instead inside 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.440
 eye 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:38.620
 here we are, the brown of kiko lo 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.620
 I take and make his pass 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.530
 a little bit bigger 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.980
 and then we make the schooner 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.930
 I'm doing 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.230
 and even not of the best I will put this 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.940
 morrone but morrone automatic motif 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:43.070
 darker than the other one 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.070
 time those as you see much darker 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.740
 and now instead with regard to the 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.480
 cheeks i take this here always ecm 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.840
 in fact, I believe to make him a 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.620
 little more charges here here in 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.650
 this way it is an oscar to a 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:12.660
 use this time a black one instead 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.660
 of the black black lancom 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:51.800
 here is done then regarding the 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.560
 lips you can use both this 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.199
 colors here which is a color on the news 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.099
 or you can also use a color 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:03.009
 which is darker then more on 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:07.550
 rosy on red if I show you 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:10.520
 this no toldo including the essence 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.080
 this new lipstick that belongs to this one 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.430
 new collection that to this 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.169
 container on the black is nothing then 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.280
 now i will try it with you look at a 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.280
 beautiful red color 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:29.129
 beautiful 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.440
 here then the alternative is this one 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.830
 now I'll show you the 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.710
 in short, this is how he did it 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.270
 I could give a little how to change the 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.920
 day makeup as a make-up a 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.330
 little bit more beautiful evening then a little 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.770
 you no longer load 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.410
 so I hope he saw you there 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.940
 liked it known that it was helpful and 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.390
 of when to the girls to the next 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.390
