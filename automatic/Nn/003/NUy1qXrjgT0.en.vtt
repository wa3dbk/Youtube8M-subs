00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
it does not matter which one to hook up

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.609 
it does not matter which one to hook up
to<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.939> outside<00:01:33.360> red<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.750> because<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.500> like

to this outside red one because I like
red<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.920> red<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.189> go<00:01:35.280> together<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:36.000> just

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
red and red to go together I'm just

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.210 
red and red to go together I'm just
gonna<00:01:36.509> plug<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.320> red<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.740> gray<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
red cord here now the next step here

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.530 
red cord here now the next step here
since<00:01:40.920> if<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.850> were<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.030> leave<00:01:42.360> everything

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
since if we were to leave everything

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.850 
since if we were to leave everything
else<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.049> were<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.380> single-stage

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
else if we were to have a single-stage

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.830 
else if we were to have a single-stage
controller<00:01:44.250> everything<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> jacket

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
controller everything in the jacket

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.050 
controller everything in the jacket
would<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.320> hooked<00:01:46.470> up<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.890> run<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.490> single

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
would be hooked up to run on one single

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.200 
would be hooked up to run on one single
temperature<00:01:48.659> heat<00:01:48.810> roller<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.210> plug

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
temperature heat roller so we just plug

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.420 
temperature heat roller so we just plug
everything<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.689> turn<00:01:52.290> one<00:01:52.530> knob<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.189> we

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
everything in turn one knob on and we

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.580 
everything in turn one knob on and we
down<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> road<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.990> because<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.439> want

reference<00:02:51.630> when<00:02:51.720> hooking<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.019> read<00:02:52.110> these<00:02:52.230> two

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
reference when hooking I read these two

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.590 
reference when hooking I read these two
these<00:02:52.500> things<00:02:52.769> up<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:54.030> now<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.239> we've<00:02:54.420> got

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
these things up so now that we've got

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.600 
these things up so now that we've got
power<00:02:54.959> coming<00:02:55.290> from<00:02:55.440> our<00:02:55.620> battery<00:02:55.920> one<00:02:56.370> going

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
power coming from our battery one going

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.130 
power coming from our battery one going
to<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.730> jacket<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.299> one<00:02:57.720> going<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.049> the

to the jacket and one going to the
gloves<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.709> next<00:02:59.280> step<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.760> obviously

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
