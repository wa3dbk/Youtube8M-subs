00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.930
 the university has always wanted to be 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.270
 at the tip of the development and one of the 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.820
 alternatives that we had was to increase 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.829
 the software that the hardware of our 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.079
 equipment so that everything remains the same 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.789
 same level in the long run and did not exist 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.250
 differences from one center to another and 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.340
 our idea was to introduce ourselves to the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.670
 general community with a network of 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.400
 radiology that will not matter where 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.379
 If the person wants to receive it 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.379
 It was going to be the same quality 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.500
 phillips within your portfolio for 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.329
 technological updates but the 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.360
 equipment of the area of ​​that magnetic possesses 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.250
 the interactive conversion product is 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.750
 alternative allows an almost total change 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.370
 of the equipment that the client owns 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.110
 currently everyone is changing you 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.970
 completely the equipment hardware of 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.190
 the control room in the technical room and 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.649
 the examination room keeping only the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.240
 magneto besides beyond having a 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.100
 economic advantage with respect to a 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.320
 new team name intervention 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.610
 civilians is minimal and the time of tension 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.299
 of the resonance service is shortened in 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.009
 At least three weeks 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.990
 comparatively a new team 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.300
 bringing also an advantage in 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.850
 economic matter we have a network of 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.369
 resonators within that of the 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.890
 university and obviously much more 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.869
 by handling it is easier to handle if 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.690
 we have all the equipment of a 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.179
 similar technology that's the reason why 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.130
 which we decided in the conversion the 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.229
 steps for a break are first define 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.659
 what is the client's need to 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.009
 to offer the best solution to the 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.869
 greater efficiency ie the greatest 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.640
 efficiency that you can have in such a way 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.740
 that its cost is the lowest and has the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.790
 best possible solution is a job 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.640
 of partner partner team between 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.780
 provider and the customer from the beginning to 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.479
 finish 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.190
 of and the next step would be to see what is 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.039
 what you need if you need a big 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.870
 change or something small or we arrived nor 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.670
 the most complex where we can upload the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.069
 level of software we can have higher 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.569
 older processing tools 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.190
 those amount of channels so 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.959
 so much can have a larger portfolio 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.550
 of coil that will bring you as 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.590
 consequence a better image quality 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.830
 and a better quality in the exam as 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.830
 hurt 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.020
 the basic difference was for the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.060
 costs obviously you have to install a 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.760
 new equipment costs are much more 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.459
 high here we take advantage of the magnet that 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.400
 an important value and we only add the 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:51.069
 hardware imaging software 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:54.100
 associated the fact of working in network and 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.340
 with equipment of similar characteristics 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.370
 we are not as complex to manage a 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.620
 new equipment because the technologists already 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.350
 they were used to working with 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.269
 technology to chivas they can 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.510
 work indifferently in any 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.580
 place of the radiology network and that 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.950
 obviously it is a tremendous benefit 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.200
 for the organization the patients go to 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.000
 get better image quality more 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.620
 comfort skill for patients and 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.769
 also a decrease in the times of 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.900
 acquisition of the sergeant obviously this 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.810
 Time reduction means doing more 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.910
 exams therefore also has a 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.380
 competitive advantage from the point of 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.760
 economic view 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.670
 we are talking about that if before 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.520
 Acquired more images in 30 40 minutes 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.260
 nowadays we can lower the 25 20 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.840
 minutes a basic exam on an exam 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.810
 simple will increase the amount of 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.300
 exams around 20% in the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.380
 One month can be 30 or 40 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.380
 more patients per month 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.150
 in case the need for 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.370
 update be less 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.319
 phillips also offers blake for the 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.030
 staff that go from just adding one 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.650
 coil that would increase their 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.510
 benefits as well 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.420
 hardware software updates 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.909
 new license for new processing 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.989
 software etcetera the important thing to highlight 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.640
 is that for phillips resonators 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.410
 it is always possible to keep them with the 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.419
 latest technology with the possibility and 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.489
 increasing its benefits and deliver 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.540
 highest performance in terms of person of 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.280
 that magnetic 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.870
 in terms of image quality 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.440
 obviously that software that brings 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:37.440
 This equipment allows to obtain images of 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.440
 better quality to which I already had a lot 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.810
 All our resonators installed in 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.600
 the moment they are at the same level what 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.260
 which makes us have a very good quality 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.180
 of optimal and competitive image in the 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.729
 national and international market 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.539
 all international standards do not 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.820
 just meet the support of philip has 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.150
 been one hundred percent and that for 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.060
 we are tremendously valuable 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.699
 we have to emphasize that philip has a 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.060
 group of people a work team 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.669
 which is quite competent 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.330
 and who understands above all things 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:22.880
 the meaning of the service 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.220
 patients knowing that they are 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.650
 working well prefer to take the 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.120
 exams in this institution and 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.880
 obviously we also constituted a 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.410
 no reference in Latin America 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.540
 only for what is provision of 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.830
 services but something that is very 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.200
 important that is the university that is 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.270
 the formation of people I think with 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.730
 this type of technology and this change 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.070
 what we have done is 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:49.750
 sure we can deliver a better 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.750
 service to our customers
