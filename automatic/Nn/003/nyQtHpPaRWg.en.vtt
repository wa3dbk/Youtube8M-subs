00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
year round so your first most important

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.049 
year round so your first most important
product<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.910> our<00:00:30.390> protein<00:00:31.230> powder<00:00:31.700> now<00:00:32.700> big

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
product is our protein powder now big

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.850 
product is our protein powder now big
misconception<00:00:33.719> about<00:00:33.809> protein<00:00:34.350> powders<00:00:34.710> is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
misconception about protein powders is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.100 
misconception about protein powders is
they're<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.219> mix<00:00:35.370> again<00:00:35.460> wait<00:00:36.110> they

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
they're going to mix again wait they

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.680 
they're going to mix again wait they
won't<00:00:37.469> well<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:39.000> there<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.450> ones<00:00:39.629> that

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
won't well the one there are ones that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.000 
won't well the one there are ones that
will<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.350> that's<00:00:40.620> what<00:00:40.770> they're<00:00:40.890> designed

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
will but that's what they're designed

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.680 
will but that's what they're designed
for<00:00:41.430> their<00:00:41.520> very<00:00:41.610> high<00:00:41.820> calories<00:00:42.420> high<00:00:42.629> in

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
for their very high calories high in

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.930 
for their very high calories high in
carbs<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.170> sugars<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.739> anything<00:00:44.670> that's<00:00:44.700> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
carbs and sugars so anything that's a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.360 
carbs and sugars so anything that's a
local<00:00:45.420> low<00:00:45.930> protein<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.039> great

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
local low protein is going to be great

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.190 
local low protein is going to be great
for<00:00:47.579> anyone<00:00:47.820> who's<00:00:48.180> trying<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> stay<00:00:48.690> lean<00:00:48.960> or

away<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:55.379> case<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.949> haven't<00:00:56.570> seen<00:00:57.570> that

away in case you haven't seen that

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.560 
away in case you haven't seen that
already<00:00:57.899> now<00:00:58.829> when<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> take<00:00:59.850> my<00:00:59.879> protein<00:01:00.390> I

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
already now when I take my protein I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.779 
already now when I take my protein I
always<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> post<00:01:01.680> workout<00:01:02.039> first<00:01:02.280> right

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
always have a post workout first right

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.050 
always have a post workout first right
the<00:01:03.690> reason<00:01:04.110> because<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.650> reason<00:01:05.250> being<00:01:05.489> is

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the reason because it reason being is

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330 
the reason because it reason being is
because<00:01:06.090> after<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.170> workout<00:01:07.530> you've<00:01:08.159> gone

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
because after your workout you've gone

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
because after your workout you've gone
really<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:08.760> hot<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:10.020> buddies<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
really really hot and your buddies in a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.560 
really really hot and your buddies in a
starbase<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.130> calories<00:01:11.580> starvation<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.270> fuel

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
starbase the calories starvation of fuel

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.289 
starbase the calories starvation of fuel
so<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.740> needs<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> enter<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> cover<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:15.180> you

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
so it needs to enter a cover on if you

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.789 
so it needs to enter a cover on if you
don't<00:01:15.420> give<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.659> anything<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.259> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> eat

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
don't give it anything it's going to eat

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.840 
don't give it anything it's going to eat
your<00:01:16.979> muscle<00:01:17.369> while<00:01:17.490> you're<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> get

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
your muscle while you're going to get

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.649 
your muscle while you're going to get
muscle<00:01:18.240> breakdown<00:01:18.530> don't<00:01:19.530> want<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.659> you're

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
muscle breakdown don't want that you're

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.910 
muscle breakdown don't want that you're
not<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.049> bigger<00:01:22.229> bump<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
not going to get bigger bump you like a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.830 
not going to get bigger bump you like a
bodybuilder<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:24.060> what's<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> happen

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
bodybuilder but what's going to happen

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
bodybuilder but what's going to happen
is<00:01:24.930> when<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> take<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.350> show<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.770> you're

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
is when you take your show if you're

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.230 
is when you take your show if you're
going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.070> go<00:01:26.189> into<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.430> recovery<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.119> you're

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
going to go into a recovery and you're

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
going to go into a recovery and you're
going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> build<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.780> lean<00:01:28.020> muscle<00:01:28.470> tone<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
going to build that lean muscle tone and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.429 
going to build that lean muscle tone and
then<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.640> basically<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:30.240> able<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.720> metabolize

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
then you basically be able to metabolize

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.399 
then you basically be able to metabolize
body<00:01:31.950> fat<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.400> lot<00:01:32.729> better<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.750> you're<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
body fat a lot better so you're going to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.410 
body fat a lot better so you're going to
get<00:01:34.530> definition<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.490> time<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.060> you're<00:01:36.270> going

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
get definition and time and you're going

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.010 
get definition and time and you're going
to<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.600> leaner<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:37.619> win<00:01:37.860> um<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.880> spray<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.869> way

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
to get leaner we win um I spray the way

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.889 
to get leaner we win um I spray the way
personally<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:41.579> because<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.180> tastes<00:01:42.780> amazing

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
personally not because it tastes amazing

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.469 
personally not because it tastes amazing
because<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.920> unreal<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
because it's unreal but it's a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.560 
because it's unreal but it's a
hydrolyzed<00:01:46.170> protein<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.790> means<00:01:48.060> it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
hydrolyzed protein so that means it's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.420 
hydrolyzed protein so that means it's
the<00:01:48.659> quickest<00:01:49.049> absorption<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.040> possibly

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the quickest absorption you can possibly

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.609 
the quickest absorption you can possibly
get<00:01:50.670> you're<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.780> get<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.020> protein<00:01:52.259> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
get you're going to get that protein to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.429 
get you're going to get that protein to
your<00:01:52.740> body<00:01:52.920> fast<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:54.750> don't<00:01:54.960> always<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.259> to

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
your body fast you don't always have to

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.550

replacements just don't forget that just

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.430 
replacements just don't forget that just
because<00:02:25.390> these<00:02:25.570> ones<00:02:25.810> will<00:02:25.960> quite<00:02:26.170> low<00:02:26.410> in

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
because these ones will quite low in

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.960 
because these ones will quite low in
carbs<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.010> sugars<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:27.460> it's<00:02:27.580> not<00:02:27.700> enough<00:02:27.940> to

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
carbs and sugars so it's not enough to

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.620 
carbs and sugars so it's not enough to
sustain<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.840> cool<00:02:29.830> our<00:02:30.460> next<00:02:30.910> part<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.300> used<00:02:31.510> to

help keep me lean and and help keep my
body<00:02:33.820> recovering<00:02:34.420> all<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.630> time<00:02:34.840> is<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
body recovering all the time is the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.010 
body recovering all the time is the
extent<00:02:37.570> now<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.850> extent<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.300> cocktail<00:02:40.840> of

extent now the extent is a cocktail of

extent now the extent is a cocktail of
amino<00:02:41.590> acids<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:42.850> this<00:02:43.270> one<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:43.600> particular

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
amino acids so this one in particular

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.979 
amino acids so this one in particular
has<00:02:44.410> your<00:02:45.070> glue<00:02:45.280> mine<00:02:45.550> you're<00:02:46.120> loosing<00:02:46.660> your

has your glue mine you're loosing your
citrulline<00:02:47.350> malate<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.890> it's<00:02:47.980> very<00:02:48.280> high<00:02:48.550> in

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
citrulline malate and it's very high in

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.840 
citrulline malate and it's very high in
electrolytes<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.870> pop<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.410> skip<00:02:50.770> in<00:02:50.920> my<00:02:51.010> water
