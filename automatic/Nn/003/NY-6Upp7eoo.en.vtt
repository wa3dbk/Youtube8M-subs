lot of moments where I kinda was feeling

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.879 
lot of moments where I kinda was feeling
a<00:00:08.280> little<00:00:08.309> bit<00:00:08.670> like<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:09.000> was<00:00:09.120> slow<00:00:09.480> uh<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.769> was

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
a little bit like it was slow uh it was

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.169 
a little bit like it was slow uh it was
mostly<00:00:11.219> just<00:00:11.400> one<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.700> those<00:00:11.790> like

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
mostly just one of those like

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.419 
mostly just one of those like
experiences<00:00:13.110> like<00:00:13.349> we're<00:00:13.559> going<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.280> Kidd

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
experiences like we're going in Kidd

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.490 
experiences like we're going in Kidd
while<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.759> see<00:00:14.940> them<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.299> guess<00:00:15.750> developing

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
while you see them I guess developing

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.260 
while you see them I guess developing
slowly<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.220> learning<00:00:17.580> more<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.940> game

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
slowly and learning more about the game

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.390 
slowly and learning more about the game
and<00:00:18.300> whatnot<00:00:18.930> also<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> couple<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.189> different

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
and whatnot also a couple of different

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.769 
and whatnot also a couple of different
things<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.150> see<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> troop

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
things going on like you see the troop

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.019 
things going on like you see the troop
and<00:00:22.020> they're<00:00:22.859> advancing<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.640> game<00:00:23.820> as

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
and they're advancing in the game as

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.519 
and they're advancing in the game as
well<00:00:24.240> as<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.539> little<00:00:24.840> girl<00:00:25.080> with<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> blonde

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
well as this little girl with the blonde

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.589 
well as this little girl with the blonde
hair<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.800> guess<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.640> most<00:00:26.880> important<00:00:27.300> part<00:00:27.480> is

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
hair I guess the most important part is

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.089 
hair I guess the most important part is
really<00:00:27.720> seeing<00:00:28.050> her<00:00:28.320> starting<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> get

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
really seeing her starting to get

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.470 
really seeing her starting to get
connected<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.550> them<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:30.210> see<00:00:30.359> that

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
connected with them and you can see that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.880 
connected with them and you can see that
there's<00:00:30.630> something<00:00:30.810> sneaky<00:00:31.170> about<00:00:31.439> her<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
there's something sneaky about her and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.160 
there's something sneaky about her and
also<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.550> uh<00:00:32.579> other<00:00:33.059> group<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.989> they're

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
also that uh other group that they're

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.299 
also that uh other group that they're
planning<00:00:34.590> stuff<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:34.950> there's<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> lot<00:00:35.280> of

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
planning stuff so there's a lot of

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.830 
planning stuff so there's a lot of
things<00:00:35.489> moving<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.180> there's<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.660> lot<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
things moving and there's a lot of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
things going on but at the same time I

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.299 
things going on but at the same time I
felt<00:00:38.370> kind<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.090> slow<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.450> certain<00:00:39.690> aspects<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
felt kind of slow in certain aspects and

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.110 
felt kind of slow in certain aspects and
honestly<00:00:41.309> those<00:00:41.489> parts<00:00:41.790> where<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> was<00:00:42.059> just

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
honestly those parts where I was just

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.660 
honestly those parts where I was just
like<00:00:42.270> flat-out<00:00:42.719> bored<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> definitely<00:00:44.370> not

like flat-out bored so I definitely not

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.029

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.040 
quinoa I like seeing them fighting the
giants<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.120> pretty<00:00:54.270> entertaining<00:00:54.539> and

the<00:00:57.149> freakin<00:00:57.539> leg<00:00:57.690> VII<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.340> whatnot<00:00:59.789> so<00:00:59.820> there

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the freakin leg VII and whatnot so there

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.910 
the freakin leg VII and whatnot so there
was<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> couple<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.660> moments<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.500> that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
was a couple of moments in there that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.229 
was a couple of moments in there that
were<00:01:02.039> enjoyable<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.000> most<00:01:03.120> part

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
were enjoyable but for the most part

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.560 
were enjoyable but for the most part
felt<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.750> um<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.799> they<00:01:05.339> go<00:01:05.850> fast<00:01:06.119> paced

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
felt like um like they go fast paced

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.700 
felt like um like they go fast paced
it's<00:01:06.750> hard<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> describe<00:01:07.200> because<00:01:07.380> they<00:01:07.590> go

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it's hard to describe because they go

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.530 
it's hard to describe because they go
fast<00:01:07.890> pacing<00:01:08.189> from<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> hear<00:01:08.909> they<00:01:09.299> add

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
fast pacing from what I hear they add

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.660 
fast pacing from what I hear they add
like<00:01:09.930> four<00:01:10.229> or<00:01:10.320> five<00:01:10.350> chapters<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.950> manga<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
like four or five chapters of manga at a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.789 
like four or five chapters of manga at a
time<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.119> these<00:01:12.240> hundred<00:01:12.810> episodes<00:01:13.170> but

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
time with these hundred episodes but

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.230 
time with these hundred episodes but
then<00:01:13.950> at<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.100> same<00:01:14.189> time<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.700> feels<00:01:15.000> kind

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
then at the same time it just feels kind

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.999 
then at the same time it just feels kind
of<00:01:15.270> slow<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.869> lot<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.140> uninteresting

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
of slow and like a lot of uninteresting

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.920 
of slow and like a lot of uninteresting
things<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.540> like

in<00:01:29.579> certain<00:01:29.850> aspects<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> most<00:01:30.869> part

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
in certain aspects but for the most part

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020 
in certain aspects but for the most part
I<00:01:31.170> wasn't<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.829> entertain<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:32.880> this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
I wasn't really to entertain with this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.580 
I wasn't really to entertain with this
episode<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.630> honest<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.350> just

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
episode to be honest with you it just

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.460 
episode to be honest with you it just
really<00:01:35.070> felt<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.810> progressing<00:01:36.810> them<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
really felt like progressing them but it

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.969 
really felt like progressing them but it
wasn't<00:01:37.740> really<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:38.040> any<00:01:38.250> danger<00:01:39.060> around<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
wasn't really like any danger around it

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.260 
wasn't really like any danger around it
the<00:01:40.979> most<00:01:41.189> important<00:01:41.610> thing<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.850> guess<00:01:42.030> was

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the most important thing I guess was

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.520 
the most important thing I guess was
again<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> connection<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> little

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
again the connection with the little

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.120 
again the connection with the little
girl<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> long<00:01:44.549> hair<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.119> also<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
girl with the long hair and also the the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.440 
girl with the long hair and also the the
troop<00:01:47.460> seeing<00:01:47.790> them<00:01:47.970> i<00:01:48.119> don't<00:01:48.270> know<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.420> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
troop seeing them i don't know if that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
troop seeing them i don't know if that
how<00:01:48.659> big<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.170> an<00:01:49.380> importance<00:01:49.799> are<00:01:49.920> gonna<00:01:50.009> have

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
how big of an importance are gonna have

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.069 
how big of an importance are gonna have
in<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.850> particular<00:01:51.030> art<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:51.659> seeing<00:01:51.930> them

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
in this particular art but seeing them

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.810 
in this particular art but seeing them
that<00:01:52.290> was<00:01:52.380> pretty<00:01:52.590> exciting<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.220> overall

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that was pretty exciting and overall

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.310

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
yeah that that's really my take on this

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.230 
yeah that that's really my take on this
episode<00:01:55.950> not<00:01:56.310> much<00:01:56.460> really<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.759> say<00:01:57.030> other

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240

now<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.500> really<00:02:22.770> have<00:02:22.800> too<00:02:23.040> much<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.310> say<00:02:23.340> other

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
now I really have too much to say other

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.550 
now I really have too much to say other
then<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.510> was<00:02:24.630> kind<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.870> slow<00:02:25.080> if<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.320> had<00:02:25.440> to

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
then it was kind of slow if I had to

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.840 
then it was kind of slow if I had to
give<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> rating<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.400> would<00:02:26.580> say<00:02:26.790> it's

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
give it a rating I would say it's

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.490 
give it a rating I would say it's
somewhere<00:02:27.240> around<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:28.070> 2.5<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.460> 3<00:02:29.820> out<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.030> 5

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
somewhere around a 2.5 to 3 out of 5

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.720 
somewhere around a 2.5 to 3 out of 5
because<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.860> just<00:02:32.070> there<00:02:32.460> was<00:02:32.580> some

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
because it just there was some

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.190 
because it just there was some
advancements<00:02:33.210> where<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.630> just<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:34.050> all

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
advancements where it just really all

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.170 
advancements where it just really all
over<00:02:34.530> all<00:02:34.650> wasn't<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.550> much<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.820> an

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
over all wasn't that much of an

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.700 
over all wasn't that much of an
entertaining<00:02:36.810> episode<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.440> was<00:02:37.560> just

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
entertaining episode and it was just

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.860 
entertaining episode and it was just
really<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.400> lot<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.730> slow<00:02:39.060> patches<00:02:39.600> in<00:02:39.750> it

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
really like a lot of slow patches in it

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.510 
really like a lot of slow patches in it
