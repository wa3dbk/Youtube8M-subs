any image is in the mid-tone area

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.309 
any image is in the mid-tone area
generally<00:00:35.370> speaking<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.569> I<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.929> simply

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:37.319 
generally speaking so I can simply

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:39.410 
generally speaking so I can simply
increase<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.159> details<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> mid-tones

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
increase the details and the mid-tones

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.899 
increase the details and the mid-tones
or<00:00:39.809> reduce<00:00:40.679> details<00:00:41.159> in<00:00:41.249> the<00:00:41.339> mid-tones

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:41.909 
or reduce details in the mid-tones

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.110 
or reduce details in the mid-tones
thus<00:00:42.479> smoothing<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.379> skin<00:00:43.859> the<00:00:44.309> problem<00:00:44.789> here

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
thus smoothing out skin the problem here

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.819 
thus smoothing out skin the problem here
is<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.269> this<00:00:45.569> effect<00:00:46.019> is<00:00:46.170> being<00:00:46.379> applied<00:00:46.769> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
is that this effect is being applied to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.639
