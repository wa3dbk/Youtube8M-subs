00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.470
 the good old mortal kombat brother is 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.810
 back after several years with games 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.420
 medium and of dubious quality 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.529
 finally subzero scorm returned to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.150
 their origins 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.099
 although there is more than one month left for the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.660
 official launch the demonstration 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.400
 available to users of the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.099
 playstation plus gives us a small 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.100
 what to expect from the great return 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.140
 of series a with only four characters 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.620
 two modes released 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.059
 the demo does not save on the fun so 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.640
 As studio promised. 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.200
 we see the classic gameplay again in 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.059
 the dynamics of the fighting that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.719
 marked the franchise until their third 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.149
 episode without moving in circles 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.920
 and water use if everything gets more agile and 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.289
 easy for those who played the titles 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.340
 earlier this deadly kombat manages to 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.920
 be even better 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.869
 exactly for the nostalgic air all the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 characters and scenarios refer to 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.159
 first games including the famous 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.119
 appearance in the corner after the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.830
 well hooked on the opponent 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.420
 fatalities are also back and 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.000
 even more brutal 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.100
 the highlight is now much more 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.100
 simple and easy to do 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:39.770
 jonny quinn richard other news 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.229
 Edson and even the blow that can 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.479
 see the enemy internal damage wells 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.789
 smashing in slow motion and organ being 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.380
 are just a few examples of the 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.880
 that it is possible to check to make combos 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.409
 it was also simpler and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.619
 mainly due to the movement 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.570
 more rapid and variety of actions 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.549
 it is also possible to use attacks 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.920
 to increase the power of their 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.720
 attacks from the bar located on the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.000
 bottom of the screen 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.750
 this mechanism is very reminiscent of the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.190
 from ex the fighter 4 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.709
 another interesting point in mortal 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.750
 kombat are the superficial injuries 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.790
 the degree of injury increases as the 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.010
 that your character the campaign that is 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.450
 maintained at the end of each round 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.400
 not strange that they charge 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.230
 completely bloody johnny 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.489
 with a swollen face at the end of the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.920
 confrontation 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.590
 on the other hand the demo also brings 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.120
 some rather troublesome failures to which 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.400
 The more it disturbs the intelligence 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.230
 foreseeable artificial nature which makes 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.030
 fights that are easy to beat 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.170
 by identifying the movement pattern of the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.680
 enemy 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.700
 the list of commands is another problem 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.340
 mainly for showing 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.319
 quite confusing the player instead of 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.120
 bring standardized controls 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.190
 the game will display directions based on 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.470
 position of your fighter on the screen 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.269
 so it's easy for you to swap 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.170
 behind and can not perform the 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.850
 apparent that he wanted to put an end to the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.769
 translation into Spanish in the case of 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.170
 playstation 3 is configured for the 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.819
 language as if the exchange is no longer 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.459
 was sufficient or other elements 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.410
 have not yet been edited 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.840
 the message as it appears from the case 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.209
 original text as it is a question of 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.250
 demonstration, it is very likely that these 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.840
 errors are corrected 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.420
 until the launch on April 19 and by then 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.580
 Let's see the nails that have been waiting 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.780
 anxious triumphant return of mortal 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.780
 kombat on the consoles 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.710
 OK 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.769
 our house 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.090
 So
