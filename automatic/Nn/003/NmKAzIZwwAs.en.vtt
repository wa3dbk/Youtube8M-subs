00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.030 
what we have brought home we've brought
home<00:02:25.569> some<00:02:25.930> toys<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.409> cool<00:02:26.500> stuff<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:26.769> that

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
home some toys and cool stuff like that

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.920 
home some toys and cool stuff like that
close<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.970> doors<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.599> looks<00:02:28.720> like<00:02:28.780> the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
close the doors so it looks like the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.289 
close the doors so it looks like the
doors<00:02:29.170> are<00:02:29.319> actually<00:02:29.560> open<00:02:29.799> right<00:02:29.950> here<00:02:30.299> so

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
doors are actually open right here so

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.400 
doors are actually open right here so
looks<00:02:31.450> like<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.660> doors<00:02:31.870> are<00:02:31.989> open<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.260> that

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
looks like the doors are open on that

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.140 
looks like the doors are open on that
side<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.310> doors<00:02:33.489> are<00:02:33.610> open<00:02:33.790> on<00:02:33.879> that<00:02:33.970> side

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
side and the doors are open on that side

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.250 
side and the doors are open on that side
so<00:02:34.239> I'm<00:02:34.299> not<00:02:34.390> sure<00:02:34.450> if<00:02:34.569> we<00:02:34.660> have<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.930> look<00:02:35.140> out

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
so I'm not sure if we have to look out

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.420 
so I'm not sure if we have to look out
through<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.680> doors<00:02:35.890> I'm<00:02:36.069> not<00:02:36.190> sure<00:02:36.280> if<00:02:36.340> we're

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
through the doors I'm not sure if we're

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.710 
through the doors I'm not sure if we're
gonna<00:02:36.489> be<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:36.819> our<00:02:36.940> room<00:02:37.180> if<00:02:37.360> we're<00:02:37.450> gonna<00:02:37.569> have

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
gonna be in our room if we're gonna have

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.119 
gonna be in our room if we're gonna have
cameras<00:02:38.140> or<00:02:38.440> cool<00:02:38.650> stuff<00:02:38.830> like<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.010> maybe

cameras or cool stuff like that maybe

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.440 
cameras or cool stuff like that maybe
we're<00:02:39.250> gonna<00:02:39.340> be<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.519> boy<00:02:39.790> that's<00:02:40.269> what<00:02:40.390> I

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
we're gonna be a boy that's what I

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.089 
we're gonna be a boy that's what I
really<00:02:41.200> think<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.470> this<00:02:41.560> game<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.829> gonna<00:02:41.920> be

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
really think that this game is gonna be

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.140 
really think that this game is gonna be
let's<00:02:42.250> think<00:02:42.370> we're<00:02:42.489> in<00:02:42.549> a<00:02:42.610> kid's<00:02:42.849> room<00:02:43.000> of

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
let's think we're in a kid's room of

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.759 
let's think we're in a kid's room of
some<00:02:43.360> sort<00:02:43.690> looks<00:02:43.870> like<00:02:43.959> we<00:02:44.049> got<00:02:44.170> toys<00:02:44.440> and

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
some sort looks like we got toys and

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:45.930 
some sort looks like we got toys and
cool<00:02:45.159> stuff<00:02:45.400> like<00:02:45.489> that<00:02:45.579> so<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.700> think<00:02:45.790> we're

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
cool stuff like that so I think we're

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.210 
cool stuff like that so I think we're
gonna<00:02:46.030> be<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.209> boy<00:02:46.450> in<00:02:46.690> our<00:02:47.079> bed<00:02:47.349> I'm<00:02:47.620> not<00:02:47.950> sure

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
gonna be a boy in our bed I'm not sure

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.440 
gonna be a boy in our bed I'm not sure
like<00:02:48.400> what<00:02:48.549> type<00:02:48.730> of<00:02:48.760> boy<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.239> gonna<00:02:49.360> be

like what type of boy this is gonna be
or<00:02:49.720> who<00:02:50.019> this<00:02:50.200> boy<00:02:50.379> is<00:02:50.410> gonna<00:02:50.650> be<00:02:50.799> or<00:02:50.920> cool

or who this boy is gonna be or cool
stuff<00:02:51.280> like<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.610> but<00:02:51.940> essentially<00:02:52.150> looks

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
stuff like that but essentially looks

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.550 
stuff like that but essentially looks
like<00:02:52.420> we<00:02:52.540> have<00:02:52.629> toys<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:53.049> looks<00:02:53.170> like<00:02:53.290> we<00:02:53.410> have

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
like we have toys it looks like we have

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.170 
like we have toys it looks like we have
the<00:02:53.739> doors<00:02:53.920> are<00:02:54.069> open<00:02:54.370> right<00:02:54.519> now<00:02:54.549> so<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.090> think

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
the doors are open right now so I think

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.250 
the doors are open right now so I think
we're<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.450> boy<00:02:55.660> we're<00:02:55.840> gonna<00:02:55.900> have<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.109> close

we're a boy we're gonna have to close
the<00:02:56.440> doors<00:02:56.620> not<00:02:56.859> sure<00:02:57.010> if<00:02:57.069> we're<00:02:57.160> gonna<00:02:57.220> be

gonna be nightmare chica these these

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.759 
gonna be nightmare chica these these
that<00:03:15.400> these<00:03:15.549> animatronics<00:03:16.299> look<00:03:17.079> very<00:03:17.470> very

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
that these animatronics look very very

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.020 
that these animatronics look very very
scary<00:03:18.099> much<00:03:18.340> scarier<00:03:18.639> than<00:03:18.880> their

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
scary much scarier than their

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.129 
scary much scarier than their
counterparts<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.599> first<00:03:19.810> three<00:03:20.019> games

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
counterparts in the first three games

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.780 
counterparts in the first three games
this<00:03:20.620> looks<00:03:20.859> very<00:03:21.010> very<00:03:21.130> similar<00:03:21.250> actually<00:03:21.609> to

this looks very very similar actually to

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.370 
this looks very very similar actually to
the<00:03:21.880> first<00:03:22.180> five<00:03:22.660> nights<00:03:22.870> at<00:03:22.959> Freddy's<00:03:23.200> game

not like the the more cartoony ones and
five<00:03:25.569> nights<00:03:25.750> at<00:03:25.840> Freddy's<00:03:26.049> still<00:03:26.109> looks<00:03:26.380> like

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
five nights at Freddy's still looks like

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.839 
five nights at Freddy's still looks like
like<00:03:26.650> more<00:03:27.069> similar<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.519> first<00:03:27.669> time

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
lie this is nightmare chica it looks

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.129 
lie this is nightmare chica it looks
like<00:03:33.940> she's<00:03:34.090> holding<00:03:34.209> a<00:03:34.450> birthday<00:03:34.840> cake<00:03:34.989> or

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
like she's holding a birthday cake or

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.509 
like she's holding a birthday cake or
something<00:03:35.349> of<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.590> sort<00:03:35.889> I'm<00:03:36.040> not<00:03:36.160> too<00:03:36.340> sure

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
something of that sort I'm not too sure

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.339 
something of that sort I'm not too sure
what<00:03:36.700> it<00:03:36.819> is<00:03:36.940> exactly<00:03:37.359> that's<00:03:37.900> in<00:03:38.019> her<00:03:38.109> hand

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
what it is exactly that's in her hand

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.599 
what it is exactly that's in her hand
but<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.799> think<00:03:39.099> it's<00:03:39.220> probably<00:03:39.310> like<00:03:39.579> a

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
but I think it's probably like a

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:40.770 
but I think it's probably like a
birthday<00:03:39.849> cake<00:03:40.060> or<00:03:40.180> something<00:03:40.329> like<00:03:40.599> that<00:03:40.690> it

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
birthday cake or something like that it

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.940 
birthday cake or something like that it
looks<00:03:40.930> like<00:03:40.989> that<00:03:41.230> your<00:03:41.349> your<00:03:41.709> head<00:03:41.859> is

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
looks like that your your head is

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.170 
looks like that your your head is
actually<00:03:42.069> slanted<00:03:42.700> right<00:03:42.819> now<00:03:42.910> so<00:03:43.030> maybe

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
actually slanted right now so maybe

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.460 
actually slanted right now so maybe
you're<00:03:43.359> peeking<00:03:43.720> out<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:44.019> your<00:03:44.139> door<00:03:44.290> that's

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
you're peeking out of your door that's

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.140 
you're peeking out of your door that's
what<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.620> imagine<00:03:45.220> this<00:03:45.310> is<00:03:45.489> if<00:03:45.849> you<00:03:46.000> remember

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
what I imagine this is if you remember

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.789 
what I imagine this is if you remember
in<00:03:46.389> that<00:03:46.480> other<00:03:46.630> shot<00:03:46.930> in<00:03:47.109> your<00:03:47.230> room<00:03:47.440> with<00:03:47.650> the

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
in that other shot in your room with the

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.710 
in that other shot in your room with the
with<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.700> toys<00:03:48.910> in<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.209> front<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.569> think

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
with the toys in the front I think

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.550 
with the toys in the front I think
you're<00:03:49.840> like<00:03:49.930> sitting<00:03:50.109> on<00:03:50.290> your<00:03:50.380> bed<00:03:50.530> but

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
you're like sitting on your bed but

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.960 
you're like sitting on your bed but
maybe<00:03:50.799> you<00:03:50.950> can<00:03:51.069> peek<00:03:51.250> out<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.430> doors<00:03:51.730> I'm<00:03:51.880> not

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
maybe you can peek out the doors I'm not

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.920 
maybe you can peek out the doors I'm not
sure<00:03:52.090> if<00:03:52.150> you're<00:03:52.239> gonna<00:03:52.299> have<00:03:52.510> like<00:03:52.599> a<00:03:52.690> camera

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
sure if you're gonna have like a camera

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.300 
sure if you're gonna have like a camera
or<00:03:53.440> something<00:03:53.470> cool<00:03:53.829> like<00:03:53.889> that<00:03:54.010> but<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.220> think

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
or something cool like that but I think

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.589 
or something cool like that but I think
he's<00:03:54.549> peeking<00:03:54.790> out<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.030> door<00:03:55.239> on<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.419> right

side<00:03:55.840> right<00:03:55.989> now<00:03:56.079> that's<00:03:56.260> why<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.500> looks<00:03:56.650> like

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
side right now that's why it looks like

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.500 
side right now that's why it looks like
it's<00:03:56.889> slanted<00:03:57.370> that's<00:03:57.819> what<00:03:58.000> this<00:03:58.120> could<00:03:58.329> be

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
it's slanted that's what this could be

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.089

go out into the hallways which will be

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.080 
go out into the hallways which will be
very<00:04:35.860> very<00:04:36.070> cool<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.400> don't<00:04:36.490> know<00:04:36.699> how<00:04:36.850> this

very very cool I don't know how this

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.250 
very very cool I don't know how this
game<00:04:37.240> is<00:04:37.270> gonna<00:04:37.479> look<00:04:37.660> like<00:04:37.720> or<00:04:37.990> how<00:04:38.110> it's

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
game is gonna look like or how it's

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260 
game is gonna look like or how it's
gonna<00:04:38.380> gonna<00:04:38.889> gonna<00:04:39.340> be<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:39.639> guess<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:40.060> could

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
gonna gonna gonna be I guess you could

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.300 
gonna gonna gonna be I guess you could
say<00:04:40.300> but<00:04:40.600> essentially<00:04:41.050> Elsa<00:04:41.260> says<00:04:41.410> up<00:04:41.530> here<00:04:41.560> 49

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
say but essentially Elsa says up here 49

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.219 
say but essentially Elsa says up here 49
I'm<00:04:42.520> not<00:04:42.639> sure<00:04:42.790> what<00:04:42.940> that<00:04:42.970> 49<00:04:43.570> does<00:04:43.750> stand<00:04:44.020> for

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
I'm not sure what that 49 does stand for

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:45.719 
I'm not sure what that 49 does stand for
and<00:04:44.470> there's<00:04:44.710> also<00:04:44.860> an<00:04:45.010> X<00:04:45.190> on<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.460> floor<00:04:45.490> as

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
and there's also an X on the floor as

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:46.980 
and there's also an X on the floor as
well<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:46.030> it's<00:04:46.419> definitely<00:04:46.660> something<00:04:46.840> to

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
well so it's definitely something to

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.659 
well so it's definitely something to
keep<00:04:47.080> an<00:04:47.229> eye<00:04:47.320> out<00:04:47.350> for<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:47.830> cool<00:04:48.400> stuff<00:04:48.580> like

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
keep an eye out for and cool stuff like

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:49.590 
keep an eye out for and cool stuff like
that<00:04:48.790> but<00:04:48.880> like<00:04:48.970> if<00:04:49.060> you<00:04:49.150> go<00:04:49.210> back<00:04:49.360> here<00:04:49.479> it

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
that but like if you go back here it

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.420 
that but like if you go back here it
says<00:04:49.750> 12:00<00:04:50.020> a.m.<00:04:50.169> on<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.740> clock<00:04:50.979> over<00:04:51.190> here

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
says 12:00 a.m. on the clock over here

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.550 
says 12:00 a.m. on the clock over here
in<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.669> in<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.120> top<00:04:52.330> right<00:04:52.570> corner<00:04:53.229> I<00:04:53.410> guess

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
in the in the top right corner I guess

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.960 
in the in the top right corner I guess
you<00:04:53.650> could<00:04:53.770> say<00:04:53.889> it<00:04:53.949> says<00:04:54.130> 12:00<00:04:54.430> a.m.<00:04:54.610> but

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
you could say it says 12:00 a.m. but

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.129 
you could say it says 12:00 a.m. but
then<00:04:55.060> if<00:04:55.150> you<00:04:55.210> go<00:04:55.330> over<00:04:55.479> to<00:04:55.510> this<00:04:55.660> other<00:04:55.840> page

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
then if you go over to this other page

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.990 
then if you go over to this other page
on<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.889> other<00:04:57.070> side<00:04:57.310> if<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:57.460> go<00:04:57.580> over<00:04:57.699> here<00:04:57.729> it

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
on the other side if you go over here it

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.430 
on the other side if you go over here it
does<00:04:58.150> say<00:04:58.389> 1:00<00:04:58.600> a.m.<00:04:58.720> on<00:04:58.870> that<00:04:59.020> one<00:04:59.139> but<00:04:59.290> then

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
does say 1:00 a.m. on that one but then

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.409 
does say 1:00 a.m. on that one but then
when<00:04:59.830> you<00:04:59.889> go<00:04:59.979> back<00:05:00.130> to<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.610> absolute<00:05:01.300> thing

when you go back to the absolute thing

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:02.730

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
clip it says watch your back so it looks

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.540 
clip it says watch your back so it looks
like<00:06:17.260> it's<00:06:17.470> 12<00:06:17.740> a.m.<00:06:17.800> again<00:06:18.250> and<00:06:18.430> there's

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
like it's 12 a.m. again and there's

these<00:06:18.820> baby

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
these baby

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.629 
these baby
animatronics<00:06:20.740> baby<00:06:20.889> Freddy's<00:06:21.250> either<00:06:21.400> bed

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
animatronics baby Freddy's either bed

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.640 
animatronics baby Freddy's either bed
that<00:06:21.820> are<00:06:21.940> very<00:06:22.090> very<00:06:22.270> sinister<00:06:23.199> so<00:06:23.410> I<00:06:23.440> think

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
that are very very sinister so I think

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.529 
that are very very sinister so I think
this<00:06:23.919> is<00:06:24.070> actually<00:06:24.340> gonna<00:06:24.430> be<00:06:24.610> in<00:06:24.820> your<00:06:25.180> actual

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
this is actually gonna be in your actual

room if you guys remember in your room

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.960 
room if you guys remember in your room
if<00:06:26.680> you<00:06:26.740> go<00:06:26.830> back<00:06:26.979> over<00:06:27.160> here<00:06:27.190> to<00:06:27.490> when<00:06:27.849> you're

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
if you go back over here to when you're

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.070 
if you go back over here to when you're
in<00:06:28.000> row<00:06:28.180> me<00:06:28.330> go<00:06:28.419> back<00:06:28.539> to<00:06:28.660> the<00:06:28.750> place<00:06:28.870> where<00:06:29.020> I'm

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
in row me go back to the place where I'm

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.600 
in row me go back to the place where I'm
in<00:06:29.169> my<00:06:29.260> room<00:06:29.320> where<00:06:29.770> am<00:06:29.860> I<00:06:29.919> in<00:06:29.949> my<00:06:30.099> room<00:06:30.280> my<00:06:30.550> room

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
in my room where am I in my room my room

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.219 
in my room where am I in my room my room
is<00:06:30.880> up<00:06:31.000> here<00:06:31.150> so<00:06:31.330> my<00:06:31.449> room<00:06:31.599> is<00:06:31.720> over<00:06:31.810> here<00:06:32.050> I

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
is up here so my room is over here I

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:33.839 
is up here so my room is over here I
think<00:06:32.530> that<00:06:32.830> we're<00:06:33.010> set<00:06:33.280> sitting<00:06:33.610> like<00:06:33.729> in

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
think that we're set sitting like in

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.580 
think that we're set sitting like in
front<00:06:34.060> of<00:06:34.120> the<00:06:34.180> baby<00:06:34.300> on<00:06:34.690> the<00:06:34.870> bed<00:06:35.020> but<00:06:35.380> then<00:06:35.500> if

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
front of the baby on the bed but then if

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.630 
front of the baby on the bed but then if
you<00:06:35.680> actually<00:06:35.770> turn<00:06:36.099> around<00:06:36.310> so<00:06:36.400> it<00:06:36.490> says

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:36.640 
you actually turn around so it says

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.800 
you actually turn around so it says
watch<00:06:36.789> for<00:06:37.030> bats<00:06:37.180> maybe<00:06:37.450> we're<00:06:37.539> gonna<00:06:37.630> be

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
watch for bats maybe we're gonna be

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.360 
watch for bats maybe we're gonna be
turning<00:06:38.110> around<00:06:38.200> and<00:06:38.620> then<00:06:39.010> we<00:06:39.099> can<00:06:39.250> actually

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
turning around and then we can actually

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.219 
turning around and then we can actually
see<00:06:39.700> the<00:06:39.849> animatronics<00:06:40.539> on<00:06:40.690> our<00:06:40.840> bed<00:06:40.960> I'm<00:06:41.080> not

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
see the animatronics on our bed I'm not

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:42.170 
see the animatronics on our bed I'm not
sure<00:06:41.440> if<00:06:41.620> that's

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
sure if that's

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.420 
sure if that's
exactly<00:06:42.509> what's<00:06:43.199> in<00:06:43.320> mind<00:06:43.530> for<00:06:43.710> this<00:06:43.800> game<00:06:44.009> but

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
exactly what's in mind for this game but

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.350 
exactly what's in mind for this game but
I<00:06:44.460> think<00:06:44.610> that<00:06:44.699> could<00:06:44.789> definitely<00:06:44.940> be<00:06:45.150> what's

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
I think that could definitely be what's

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.520 
I think that could definitely be what's
gonna<00:06:45.479> happen<00:06:45.780> then<00:06:45.870> we're<00:06:45.960> gonna<00:06:46.080> get<00:06:46.229> on<00:06:46.380> to

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
gonna happen then we're gonna get on to

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.290 
gonna happen then we're gonna get on to
the<00:06:46.650> next<00:06:47.009> part<00:06:47.669> of<00:06:47.699> this<00:06:47.789> game<00:06:47.970> right<00:06:48.090> now<00:06:48.120> so

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
the next part of this game right now so
