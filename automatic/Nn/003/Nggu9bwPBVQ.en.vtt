my security system it's a Honeywell
ademco<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:10.290> guess<00:00:10.920> are<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.160> same<00:00:11.340> company<00:00:11.820> I

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.560 
don't know but it's a link sir Iain it's
got<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.859> wireless<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.130> think<00:00:21.090> 800

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
got it's a wireless I think 800

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.359 
got it's a wireless I think 800
megahertz<00:00:21.779> or<00:00:22.140> something<00:00:22.529> like<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:25.369> it's

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
megahertz or something like that it's

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.689 
megahertz or something like that it's
got<00:00:26.519> voice<00:00:27.380> x10<00:00:28.380> capabilities<00:00:29.130> which<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.460> use

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
got voice x10 capabilities which I use

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.930 
got voice x10 capabilities which I use
but<00:00:30.920> first<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.070> guess<00:00:32.130> I'll<00:00:32.369> start<00:00:32.550> off<00:00:32.700> with

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
but first I guess I'll start off with

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.959 
but first I guess I'll start off with
the<00:00:32.969> panic<00:00:33.420> buttons<00:00:33.719> if<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.649> press<00:00:34.980> star<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the panic buttons if you press star and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:48.400 
the panic buttons if you press star and
one<00:00:36.180> together<00:00:36.420> it'll<00:00:36.930> give<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> fire<00:00:37.469> alarm

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
disarmed ready to arm okay then if you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.380

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
gotta for the system be to actually

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.490 
gotta for the system be to actually
activate<00:04:36.480> in<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:36.720> way<00:04:36.870> mode<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.170> have<00:04:37.200> to<00:04:37.380> open

little arm and home mode which actually

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.170 
little arm and home mode which actually
I<00:04:44.010> guess<00:04:44.280> right<00:04:44.580> now<00:04:44.610> would<00:04:44.850> be<00:04:44.880> ok<00:04:45.150> because

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
I guess right now would be ok because

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
I guess right now would be ok because
that<00:04:45.570> only<00:04:46.640> detects<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:48.540> window<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.020> door

that only detects the window and door

00:04:49.200 --> 00:05:04.670 
that only detects the window and door
sensors<00:04:49.590> no<00:04:49.770> motion<00:04:50.130> detectors<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:52.370> I<00:05:03.500> think<00:05:04.500> I

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
sensors no motion detectors so I think I

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.560 
sensors no motion detectors so I think I
said<00:05:04.890> it's<00:05:05.010> a<00:05:05.070> 25<00:05:05.490> seconds<00:05:06.150> until<00:05:08.150> you<00:05:09.150> have<00:05:09.330> to

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
disarm it now the motion detectors

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:34.680 
disarm it now the motion detectors
