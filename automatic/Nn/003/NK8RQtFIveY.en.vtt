all the most confidence in the world I'd

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.440 
all the most confidence in the world I'd
say<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.340> still<00:00:41.550> need<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> top-quality<00:00:42.120> sent

about the gum in is there one available
doesn't<00:00:44.520> seem<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.870> performance<00:00:46.350> of

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
doesn't seem so but that performance of

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.080 
doesn't seem so but that performance of
Babel<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> me<00:00:47.010> Gomes<00:00:47.309> against<00:00:47.670> our<00:00:47.789> defense

today<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.600> highlights<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> fact<00:00:49.079> that

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
today just highlights the fact that

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.709 
today just highlights the fact that

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
maybe we're just not up to it I don't

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.090
