00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.380 

we<00:02:43.920> also<00:02:44.100> have<00:02:44.310> additional<00:02:44.400> fork<00:02:44.970> length<00:02:45.180> on

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
we also have additional fork length on

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.060 
we also have additional fork length on
these<00:02:45.510> bikes<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.170> forks<00:02:46.470> it's<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.740> longer

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
these bikes so the forks it's a longer

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.490 
these bikes so the forks it's a longer
between<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.820> axle<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.240> crown<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.840> we<00:02:49.350> use<00:02:49.470> a

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
between the axle and crown and we use a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.080 
between the axle and crown and we use a
curved<00:02:49.830> fork<00:02:50.160> laid<00:02:50.340> with<00:02:50.490> additional<00:02:50.880> for

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
curved fork laid with additional for

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.670 
curved fork laid with additional for
process<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.050> it's<00:02:52.140> got<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.320> little<00:02:52.440> bit<00:02:52.650> more

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
process so it's got a little bit more

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.860 
process so it's got a little bit more
compliance<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.150> cyclocross<00:02:54.540> bikes

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
compliance and the cyclocross bikes

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.750 
compliance and the cyclocross bikes
again<00:02:55.230> precise<00:02:55.740> handling<00:02:56.040> isn't<00:02:56.430> really<00:02:56.610> one

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
again precise handling isn't really one

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.690 
again precise handling isn't really one
of<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.940> needs<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.590> movie<00:02:58.590> series<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.490> front

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
of the needs of a movie series the front

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.100 
of the needs of a movie series the front
of<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.820> bikes<00:02:59.970> bouncing<00:03:00.390> all<00:03:00.510> over<00:03:00.540> question

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
of the bikes bouncing all over question

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.450 
of the bikes bouncing all over question
we<00:03:01.410> don't<00:03:01.590> want<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.800> bike<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.950> be<00:03:02.100> skittering

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
we don't want the bike to be skittering

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.950 
we don't want the bike to be skittering
all<00:03:02.640> over<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.940> road<00:03:03.120> right<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:03.570> want<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.780> very

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
all over the road right we want a very

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.710 
all over the road right we want a very
stable<00:03:04.320> very<00:03:05.040> straight<00:03:05.400> line<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.390> effect

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
stable very straight line so the effect

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.230 
stable very straight line so the effect
of<00:03:06.840> moving<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.260> handlebars<00:03:08.090> doesn't<00:03:09.090> really

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
of moving the handlebars doesn't really

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.300 
of moving the handlebars doesn't really
change<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.750> direction<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.320> bicycle<00:03:10.680> okay

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
change the direction of the bicycle okay

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.809 
change the direction of the bicycle okay
it's<00:03:11.490> got<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.640> little<00:03:11.940> bit<00:03:12.030> more

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
it's got a little bit more

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.429 
it's got a little bit more
I<00:03:12.849> don't<00:03:13.569> want<00:03:13.689> to<00:03:13.750> use<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.959> word<00:03:14.080> for<00:03:14.230> sloppy

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
I don't want to use the word for sloppy

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:15.809 
I don't want to use the word for sloppy
that's<00:03:15.010> not<00:03:15.159> really<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.459> best<00:03:15.640> way<00:03:15.790> to

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
that's not really the best way to

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.550 
that's not really the best way to
describe<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.330> but<00:03:16.480> moving<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.110> bars<00:03:17.319> back

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
describe it but moving the bars back

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.750 
describe it but moving the bars back
into<00:03:17.769> fourth<00:03:17.950> we're<00:03:18.099> having<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.400> terrain

bounce<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.360> front<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.599> the<00:03:19.720> bike<00:03:19.870> around<00:03:20.049> and

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
bounce the front of the bike around and

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
move the front of the bike round is it

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:22.949 
move the front of the bike round is it
going<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.030> knock<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.360> off<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.540> line<00:03:22.780> just

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
going to knock you off the line just

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.270 
going to knock you off the line just
gonna<00:03:23.140> be<00:03:23.200> very<00:03:23.379> straight<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:23.890> true<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.250> a
