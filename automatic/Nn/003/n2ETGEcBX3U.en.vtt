00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
not careful I am NOT inspired to have

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.990 
not careful I am NOT inspired to have
they<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.890> i<00:01:02.270> guess<00:01:03.270> i<00:01:04.430> guess<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.700> hasn't

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
they so i guess i guess that hasn't

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
they so i guess i guess that hasn't
happened<00:01:06.420> i<00:01:06.630> guess<00:01:06.960> there's<00:01:07.170> no<00:01:07.860> enemy

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
happened i guess there's no enemy

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.219 
happened i guess there's no enemy
spotted<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.390> they've<00:01:09.510> obviously<00:01:09.689> gone<00:01:10.049> round

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
spotted so they've obviously gone round

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.539 
spotted so they've obviously gone round
the<00:01:10.409> other<00:01:10.439> way<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.100> we're<00:01:11.220> probably<00:01:11.340> gonna

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the other way so we're probably gonna

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.840 
the other way so we're probably gonna
have<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.729> race<00:01:12.000> back<00:01:13.070> or<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.549> race
