00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
professor at the Art Academy completely

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.910 
professor at the Art Academy completely
squashed<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.080> they<00:02:09.170> never<00:02:09.319> picked<00:02:09.649> up<00:02:09.770> a

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
squashed and they never picked up a

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.670 
squashed and they never picked up a
brush<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.220> what<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.550> shame<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.750> just<00:02:12.290> really

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
brush and what a shame so I just really

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.890 
brush and what a shame so I just really
I<00:02:12.709> think<00:02:12.800> that<00:02:13.190> everybody<00:02:13.730> has<00:02:14.000> has<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.390> unique

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
I think that everybody has has a unique

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.530 
I think that everybody has has a unique
expression<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.069> why<00:02:16.790> not<00:02:17.000> encourage

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
expression and and why not encourage

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.650 
expression and and why not encourage
that<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.959> nobody<00:02:18.350> has<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.980> walk<00:02:19.970> away<00:02:20.150> being

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
that and nobody has to walk away being

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.740 
that and nobody has to walk away being
an<00:02:20.840> absolute<00:02:21.430> master<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:22.640> at<00:02:22.760> least<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.510> have

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
an absolute master but at least to have

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.140 
an absolute master but at least to have
that<00:02:23.930> experience<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.920> being<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.520> co-creator

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
that experience of being a co-creator

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.170 
that experience of being a co-creator
that's<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:26.690> important<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:28.100> just<00:02:28.850> really
