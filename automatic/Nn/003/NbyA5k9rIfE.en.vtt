00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.660
 I was sitting at home in the hills of 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.320

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.000
 United States was a cabin in the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.770

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.199
 biblical to an old family 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.039
 an old man came in and came smoking a 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:31.220
 huge pure and while smoking his cigar 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.760
 said praise be god I was healed praised 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.230
 be god I was healed and I kept smoking 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.970
 good as I was young then it was 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.610
 much more curious than I am and I 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.309
 I said sir that he healed he told me 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.860
 young man I cured of cancer six years ago 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.050
 months I went to the doctor and the doctor told me 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.079

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.250

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.960
 its pure 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.570
 I got a little impatient and asked him 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.180
 what about his pure sir as a young man 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.079
 preacher he said you do not know young man 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.940
 that if you have faith and enough faith you can 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.110
 smoke all the huge cigars that 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.260
 you want and cancer will never be able to touch you 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:17.000
 really that is the result of smoking faith 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.670
 cigars is the fruit of faith 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.220
 well the bible says because by grace 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.860
 you are saved through faith and this is not 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.280
 of you because it is a gift of God not for 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.920
 works but the bible keeps saying that 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:38.450
 faith is so good that if faith works not 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.860
 is presumptuous to sin the righteousness by 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.650
 faith is righteousness by faith through 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.810
 Faith is saved through faith 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.540

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.640
 Through faith we accept Jesus as 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.759
