00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
Justin was very passionate about it and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 
I

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.330 
I
when<00:00:22.840> he<00:00:23.020> first<00:00:23.470> started<00:00:23.710> that<00:00:24.040> was<00:00:24.160> one<00:00:24.280> of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
when he first started that was one of

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.610 
when he first started that was one of
the<00:00:24.430> things<00:00:24.550> he<00:00:24.760> talked<00:00:24.940> about<00:00:25.030> was<00:00:25.620> he's

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:26.620 
the things he talked about was he's

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.550 
the things he talked about was he's
going<00:00:26.800> to<00:00:26.860> put<00:00:27.010> it<00:00:27.070> into<00:00:27.190> this<00:00:27.400> nonsense<00:00:28.060> and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
going to put it into this nonsense and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.430 
going to put it into this nonsense and
this<00:00:29.560> is<00:00:29.680> the<00:00:29.770> first<00:00:29.800> step<00:00:30.220> in<00:00:30.370> that<00:00:30.400> direction

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.440 
this is the first step in that direction

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.420 
this is the first step in that direction
one<00:00:32.440> of<00:00:32.560> the<00:00:32.619> soap

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.810

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
I think there's a lot of work to be done

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.340 
I think there's a lot of work to be done

today I think our impacts probably been
11<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.049> think<00:02:55.319> we<00:02:55.439> got<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.010> lot<00:02:56.159> of<00:02:56.189> people<00:02:56.310> who

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
11 I think we got to a lot of people who

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.959 
11 I think we got to a lot of people who
when<00:02:58.409> weren't<00:02:58.890> previously<00:02:59.099> aware<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.730> the

importance of Pluto and the travesty

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.979 
importance of Pluto and the travesty
that<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.250> happened<00:03:02.640> maybe<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.420> definitely

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
that this happened maybe it's definitely

that this happened maybe it's definitely
a<00:03:04.019> 10<00:03:04.290> i<00:03:04.319> mean<00:03:04.620> i<00:03:04.709> think<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:05.040> if<00:03:05.760> anything<00:03:06.120> we

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
a 10 i mean i think it if anything we

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.970 
a 10 i mean i think it if anything we

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
put into the popular consciousness the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.259 
put into the popular consciousness the
thought<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.579> I<00:03:11.700> don't<00:03:11.849> love<00:03:11.939> you<00:03:12.060> people

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
thought of you I don't love you people

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.879 
thought of you I don't love you people
right<00:03:12.659> kind<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.900> take<00:03:13.079> it<00:03:13.200> for<00:03:13.319> granted<00:03:13.349> as<00:03:13.859> a

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
right kind of take it for granted as a

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.280 
right kind of take it for granted as a
planet<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.519> we're<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:15.689> made<00:03:15.870> me<00:03:15.989> not<00:03:16.079> even

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
planet and we're it made me not even

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.229 
planet and we're it made me not even
know<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.889> it's<00:03:17.040> not<00:03:17.219> part<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.700> dreamer

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
know that it's not part of the dreamer

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.910 
know that it's not part of the dreamer
because<00:03:18.569> we<00:03:18.659> just<00:03:18.810> always<00:03:18.959> assumed<00:03:19.349> that<00:03:19.560> we

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
because we just always assumed that we

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.039 
because we just always assumed that we
all<00:03:20.040> were<00:03:20.280> growing<00:03:20.730> up<00:03:20.849> that<00:03:21.090> it's<00:03:21.269> supposed

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
all were growing up that it's supposed

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.920 
all were growing up that it's supposed
to<00:03:22.109> be<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.230> planet<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.620> don't<00:03:22.859> realize<00:03:23.069> yeah

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
to be a planet and don't realize yeah

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.970 
to be a planet and don't realize yeah
and<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:24.959> think<00:03:25.139> it's<00:03:25.260> more<00:03:25.349> than<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.680> know<00:03:25.799> we

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
and I think it's more than you know we

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.589 
and I think it's more than you know we
people<00:03:26.700> walking<00:03:27.419> by<00:03:27.540> driving<00:03:28.230> by<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:29.599> keep

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
people walking by driving by to keep

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.830 
people walking by driving by to keep
Pluto<00:03:30.959> in<00:03:31.200> their<00:03:31.349> minds<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:32.599> would<00:03:33.599> agree<00:03:33.780> with

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
Pluto in their minds I would agree with

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.220 
Pluto in their minds I would agree with
all<00:03:34.049> about<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.439> it's<00:03:34.769> definitely<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:36.230> great
