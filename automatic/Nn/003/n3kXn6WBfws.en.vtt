any<00:00:10.320> new<00:00:10.530> console<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:12.049> look<00:00:13.049> at<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.230> feature

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
any new console is look at the feature

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.470 
any new console is look at the feature
set<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.949> what<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.280> console<00:00:14.670> has<00:00:14.850> and<00:00:15.150> try<00:00:15.420> to

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
set of what the console has and try to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.660 
set of what the console has and try to
take<00:00:15.629> advantage<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.680> with<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
take advantage of that so with the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.939 
take advantage of that so with the
PlayStation<00:00:18.060> Vita<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.960> obviously<00:00:19.170> wanted<00:00:19.830> to

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
PlayStation Vita we obviously wanted to

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.759 
PlayStation Vita we obviously wanted to
take<00:00:20.130> advantage<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.029> touchscreen<00:00:21.679> one<00:00:22.679> of

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
take advantage of the touchscreen one of

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.929 
take advantage of the touchscreen one of
the<00:00:22.830> ways<00:00:23.009> that<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.279> were<00:00:23.400> able<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.640> do<00:00:23.789> that

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the ways that we were able to do that

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.630 
the ways that we were able to do that
was<00:00:24.179> to<00:00:24.570> create<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.199> few<00:00:25.500> new<00:00:25.769> game<00:00:26.039> modes<00:00:26.339> that

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
was to create a few new game modes that

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.130 
was to create a few new game modes that
really<00:00:26.999> took<00:00:27.150> advantage<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.810> touchscreen

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
really took advantage of the touchscreen

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.230 
really took advantage of the touchscreen
functionality<00:00:28.439> with<00:00:29.249> the<00:00:29.369> Vita<00:00:29.550> technology

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
functionality with the Vita technology

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.030 
functionality with the Vita technology
and<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.689> amount<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.050> time<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.410> had<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.829> really

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
and the amount of time we had to really

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.190 
and the amount of time we had to really
focus<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.610> some<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> new<00:00:33.210> challenges<00:00:33.420> we

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
focus on some of the new challenges we

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.050 
focus on some of the new challenges we
got<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.440> really<00:00:34.650> utilize<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.280> vetos<00:00:35.579> features

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
got to really utilize the vetos features

all very familiar with but with mortal

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.910 
all very familiar with but with mortal
combat<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.079> had<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> put<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> mortal<00:00:52.620> kombat

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920

twist<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:54.000> thing<00:00:54.149> with<00:00:54.239> tester<00:00:54.510> slices

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
twist on it one thing with tester slices

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.689 
twist on it one thing with tester slices
is<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.289> there's<00:00:55.440> 15<00:00:55.829> different<00:00:55.859> missions<00:00:56.429> so

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
is that there's 15 different missions so

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.889 
is that there's 15 different missions so
we<00:00:56.820> had<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> make<00:00:57.090> sure<00:00:57.120> there<00:00:57.390> was<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.510> proper

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
we had to make sure there was a proper

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.439 
we had to make sure there was a proper
progression<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.010> game<00:00:59.190> style<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.179> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
progression of the game style so the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.700 
progression of the game style so the
first<00:01:00.629> six<00:01:00.929> missions<00:01:01.109> are<00:01:01.440> more<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.620> an

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
first six missions are more of an

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.680 
first six missions are more of an
introduction<00:01:02.339> to<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.789> new<00:01:02.820> modifiers<00:01:03.420> that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
introduction to the new modifiers that

PlayStation Vita and that detonates

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.300 
PlayStation Vita and that detonates
those<00:01:24.570> bombs<00:01:24.870> so<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.860> continue

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
to your slice counter we wanted to take

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
to your slice counter we wanted to take
advantage<00:01:30.510> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:31.020> numerous<00:01:31.830> features<00:01:32.040> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
advantage of the numerous features that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.250 
advantage of the numerous features that
the<00:01:32.550> PlayStation<00:01:32.790> Vita<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.690> actual<00:01:34.050> arm

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
the PlayStation Vita was the actual arm

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.250 
the PlayStation Vita was the actual arm
we<00:01:34.860> invented<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.940> new<00:01:36.330> mode<00:01:36.540> called<00:01:36.810> test<00:01:37.110> your

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
we invented a new mode called test your

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.840 
we invented a new mode called test your
balance<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.920> purpose<00:01:38.190> of<00:01:38.310> test<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:38.670> balance

favorite<00:02:17.590> missions<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.130> we<00:02:18.280> have<00:02:18.520> would<00:02:19.060> be

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
favorite missions that we have would be

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.570 
favorite missions that we have would be
the<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.720> bloody<00:02:19.930> mask<00:02:20.200> missions<00:02:20.620> because<00:02:21.370> you

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
the the bloody mask missions because you

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.430 
the the bloody mask missions because you
do<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.120> hardcore<00:02:22.570> fighting<00:02:22.960> mechanic

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
do have the hardcore fighting mechanic

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.140 
do have the hardcore fighting mechanic
but<00:02:23.830> then<00:02:23.980> we<00:02:24.070> also<00:02:24.250> put<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.640> blood<00:02:24.970> on<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
but then we also put the blood on the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.180 
but then we also put the blood on the
screen<00:02:25.390> too<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.200> forces<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.710> multitask

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
screen too so it forces you to multitask

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.610
