I<00:00:00.089> just<00:00:01.050> wanted<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.439> make<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.100> video<00:00:02.280> here<00:00:02.730> I

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
I just wanted to make a video here I

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.730 
I just wanted to make a video here I
thought<00:00:03.030> this<00:00:03.210> would<00:00:03.360> be<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.570> little<00:00:04.350> bit<00:00:04.589> more

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
thought this would be a little bit more

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.570 
thought this would be a little bit more
explanatory<00:00:05.370> than<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.200> set<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.290> pictures<00:00:07.529> as<00:00:08.189> to

helmet<00:00:15.980> here<00:00:16.980> are<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.600> original<00:00:18.600> fasteners

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
helmet here are the original fasteners

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.670 
helmet here are the original fasteners
that<00:00:19.170> came<00:00:19.650> with<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.520> helmet<00:00:21.320> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.470> see

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that came with the helmet you can see

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.450 
that came with the helmet you can see
the<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.430> shorter<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:24.300> that

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
the one the shorter one is the one that

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.710 
the one the shorter one is the one that
twisted<00:00:26.460> off<00:00:26.609> when<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> tried<00:00:27.300> removing<00:00:27.539> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
twisted off when I tried removing it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.820 
twisted off when I tried removing it
from<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.260> helmet<00:00:29.779> it<00:00:30.779> was<00:00:31.019> cross<00:00:31.349> threaded

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
from the helmet it was cross threaded

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.610 
from the helmet it was cross threaded
from<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> factory<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:33.059> soon<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.620> tried

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
from the factory so as soon as I tried

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.110 
from the factory so as soon as I tried
done<00:00:34.800> threaded<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.700> started<00:00:36.450> binding<00:00:36.899> I

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
done threaded it started binding I

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
done threaded it started binding I
figured<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.739> wouldn't<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.980> bad<00:00:41.160> but

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
figured that wouldn't be that bad but

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.979 
figured that wouldn't be that bad but
because<00:00:41.760> they're<00:00:41.969> aluminum<00:00:42.210> fasteners<00:00:42.960> I

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
because they're aluminum fasteners I

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.740 
because they're aluminum fasteners I
just<00:00:43.290> twisted<00:00:43.500> right<00:00:43.829> off<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:45.600> original

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
just twisted right off the original

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.580 
just twisted right off the original
brass<00:00:48.750> insert<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> helmet<00:00:49.860> right<00:00:50.039> here

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
brass insert on the helmet right here

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.319 
brass insert on the helmet right here
still<00:00:52.590> threads<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.100> fine<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.090> side

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
still threads in fine so this this side

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.069 
still threads in fine so this this side
is<00:00:54.620> perfectly<00:00:55.620> fine<00:00:56.719> when<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.809> thread<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
is perfectly fine when you thread the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.479 
is perfectly fine when you thread the
fastener<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:59.039> tight<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.579> doesn't<00:00:59.910> move

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
fastener and it's tight it doesn't move

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.020 
fastener and it's tight it doesn't move
on<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> other<00:01:02.760> side<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.600> twisted<00:01:04.530> off<00:01:04.680> I

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
on the other side that twisted off I

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.800 
on the other side that twisted off I
actually<00:01:06.030> took<00:01:08.119> actually<00:01:09.119> took<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> helmet<00:01:09.720> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
actually took actually took a helmet to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.560 
actually took actually took a helmet to
work<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.670> got<00:01:11.670> one<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> machine<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.360> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
work and got one of the machine is to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.530 
work and got one of the machine is to
try<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.780> drill<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:15.060> piece<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
try to drill out the the piece of the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
try to drill out the the piece of the
fastener<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.770> actually<00:01:17.070> broke<00:01:17.280> off

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
fastener that that actually broke off

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.870 
fastener that that actually broke off
once<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.710> drilled<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.430> removed<00:01:20.729> as

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
once we drilled it out and removed as

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.020 
once we drilled it out and removed as
much<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.299> could<00:01:22.009> be<00:01:23.009> tapped<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.430> hole<00:01:23.610> with

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
much as we could be tapped the hole with

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.710 
much as we could be tapped the hole with
an<00:01:24.119> m6<00:01:24.540> tap<00:01:24.780> which<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> exact<00:01:26.009> same<00:01:26.720> tap

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
an m6 tap which is the exact same tap

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.520 
an m6 tap which is the exact same tap
size<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:29.570> what<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> brass<00:01:30.900> inserts<00:01:31.320> were

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
size as what the brass inserts were

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.719 
size as what the brass inserts were
originally<00:01:32.189> an<00:01:33.119> RD<00:01:33.390> idea<00:01:33.900> was<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.439> use<00:01:34.770> an<00:01:35.250> m6

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
originally an RD idea was to use an m6

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.160 
originally an RD idea was to use an m6
socket<00:01:36.240> head<00:01:36.299> cap<00:01:36.360> screw<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:36.960> I've<00:01:37.049> got

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
socket head cap screw what I've got

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530 
socket head cap screw what I've got
right<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:38.850> replace<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.390> broken

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
right here and to replace the broken

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.190 
right here and to replace the broken
aluminum<00:01:40.049> fastener<00:01:41.659> when<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.810> started

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
aluminum fastener when we started

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.710 
aluminum fastener when we started
threading<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:44.119> there<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.270> still<00:01:45.479> some

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
threading this in there was still some

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.710 
threading this in there was still some
aluminum<00:01:46.140> left<00:01:46.380> into<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> brass<00:01:47.009> insert<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
aluminum left into the brass insert and

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.090 
aluminum left into the brass insert and
it<00:01:48.720> got<00:01:48.899> caught<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.070> actual<00:01:50.540> brass<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.100> I

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
it got caught in the actual brass and I

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.359 
it got caught in the actual brass and I
guess<00:01:53.369> from<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.060> process<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.020> trying<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.470> dig

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
guess from the process of trying to dig

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.950 
guess from the process of trying to dig
the<00:01:56.810> aluminum<00:01:57.810> out<00:01:58.070> from<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> brass<00:01:59.960> started

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the aluminum out from the brass started

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.670 
the aluminum out from the brass started
to<00:02:01.140> get<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.100> brass<00:02:02.310> loose<00:02:02.750> in<00:02:03.750> how<00:02:04.020> its<00:02:04.259> press

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
to get the brass loose in how its press

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.039 
to get the brass loose in how its press
fit<00:02:04.890> into<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.159> helmet<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.299> when<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.750> threaded

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
fit into the helmet so when we threaded

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.290 
fit into the helmet so when we threaded
the<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.979> m6<00:02:08.489> socket<00:02:09.030> head<00:02:09.149> cap<00:02:09.209> screw<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:10.069> it

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
the this m6 socket head cap screw in it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.430 
the this m6 socket head cap screw in it
couldn't<00:02:12.300> take<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.480> anymore<00:02:12.810> now<00:02:13.200> it's

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
couldn't take it anymore now it's

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.930 
couldn't take it anymore now it's
started<00:02:13.770> spinning<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.430> can<00:02:14.670> see<00:02:14.820> the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
started spinning so you can see the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.370 
started spinning so you can see the
brass<00:02:15.150> insert<00:02:15.570> is<00:02:16.500> now<00:02:16.710> inside<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.340> helmet

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
brass insert is now inside of the helmet

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.780 
brass insert is now inside of the helmet
and<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.680> fixed<00:02:20.040> right<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.640> can

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
and this is fixed right in like I can

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.900 
and this is fixed right in like I can
