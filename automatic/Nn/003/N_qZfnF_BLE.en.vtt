 Then I would like to explain each part from 1 to 6 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:28.000
 The ceiling of 1 is smooth if the distance between the lock and ribeau 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.000

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.720

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.560

 Ueno Eri is short but the basic collar is long 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:43.299
 The next one is like the plan but contains the pad 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.299
 Let's take a slightly wider shoulder 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.710
 Next is the chest pocket 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:55.180
 It is in Japan left chest 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:58.780
 It may emblem and negotiations embroidery or mounted has been subjected to 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:04.110
 The number of buttons are three from the two basic 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.110
 The same part as the school run has no button 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:13.740
 The blazer has two rows of single type and modern with one row of buttons 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:18.650
 N 2 types of double type 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.650
 Basically single type is common 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.680
 Next is the type of blazer 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.530
 I wrote three kinds 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.530
 Why is the standard blazer from the left 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:37.849
 Next in the middle , I think I will often see how to wear such things in dramas and girl manga etc. 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.719
 I will 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:43.719
 If you check the pattern of the pants, they will be better off 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:54.120
 Finally I tried to change the double type blazer 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.120
 You can add elegance and elitist feel when it comes to love tapes 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.069
 step 3 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:01.069
 We will describe the step 3 in Razz clothing 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:10.380
 The middle illustration is a general way of wearing 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:14.190
 I removed the first button and put the shirt in the pants properly 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.370
 Left of the illustration is the scale of the manner in which the broke 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:24.909
 I often see in bands and anime 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:31.830
 Right of illustrations to the contrary, it is one with a lot dressed honors student type of character 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:31.830
 Wearing style changes depending on the appearance and character of the character like this 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:41.120
 Beppu 4 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:43.129
 Finally, in step 4, we will introduce small items that tend to come out with uniforms 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.660
 At first it is a watch 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:48.400
 Simple design would be good 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.870
 Next is clothing type 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:55.110
 Can represent the personality of the character 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.270
 Next is the bag 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.169
 School back and enamel back as Louis 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:07.189
 There is power 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:07.189
 Next are mobile devices such as smartphones and music players 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:15.900
 Items limited to rooms also have more variations in combination with the government 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.900
 Gorgeousness is added to the illustration 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:27.180
 Finally, it is an illustration of the government and accessories 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:34.220
 In this way, by combining accessories with uniforms, it is possible to express the character's individuality or 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:34.220
 You can also increase variations, so why not combine various Koboro? 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:43.430
 The above is the end of how to draw school uniforms for high school boys 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.430
