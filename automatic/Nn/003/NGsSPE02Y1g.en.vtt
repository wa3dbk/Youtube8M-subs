00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.130 
saying a gigabyte of RAM installed 3.90
and<00:01:02.250> available<00:01:03.170> so<00:01:04.170> here's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.189> fix<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.610> that

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
and available so here's a fix for that

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.130 
and available so here's a fix for that
now<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.470> comes<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.950> mind<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.140> an

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
now it comes to mind that this is an

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.950 
now it comes to mind that this is an
actual<00:01:10.619> problem<00:01:11.479> with<00:01:12.479> your<00:01:12.689> BIOS<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:15.479> BIOS

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
actual problem with your BIOS the BIOS

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.469 
actual problem with your BIOS the BIOS
that<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.920> preset<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.090> your<00:01:18.600> motherboard<00:01:18.900> um

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
that was preset in your motherboard um

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.940 
that was preset in your motherboard um
basically<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.810> out-of-date<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.320> doesn't

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
basically is out-of-date and doesn't

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.810 
basically is out-of-date and doesn't
understand<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.820> point<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.180> more<00:01:24.600> RAM<00:01:25.820> being

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
understand the point of more RAM being

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.760 
understand the point of more RAM being
recognized<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.689> Windows<00:01:28.670> Vista<00:01:29.670> or<00:01:29.939> Windows<00:01:30.030> 7

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
recognized in Windows Vista or Windows 7

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.440 
recognized in Windows Vista or Windows 7
so<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.240> we're<00:01:33.360> going

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
so here we get this so now we're going

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.060 
so here we get this so now we're going
to<00:01:33.509> fix<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.840> we're<00:01:34.560> going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.710> open<00:01:34.799> up<00:01:34.979> an

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
to fix it we're going to open up an

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.609 
to fix it we're going to open up an
internet<00:01:35.220> page<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.110> then<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.259> you'll<00:01:37.439> need

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
internet page and then all you'll need

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.490 
internet page and then all you'll need

to<00:02:52.180> show<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.360> how<00:02:52.570> anyway<00:02:52.959> now<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:53.890> see<00:02:54.280> mine

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
to show you how anyway now you see mine

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.600 
to show you how anyway now you see mine
when<00:02:55.269> I<00:02:55.299> checked<00:02:55.840> mine<00:02:56.260> my<00:02:56.890> motherboard<00:02:57.280> when

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
when I checked mine my motherboard when

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.860 
when I checked mine my motherboard when
I<00:02:57.640> got<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.090> was<00:02:58.239> on<00:02:59.040> 1.20<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.360> as<00:03:01.600> you<00:03:01.720> can

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
I got it was on 1.20 so and as you can

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.539 
I got it was on 1.20 so and as you can
see<00:03:01.930> it's<00:03:02.350> been<00:03:02.500> one<00:03:02.709> point<00:03:02.950> thirty<00:03:03.190> one<00:03:03.400> point

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
see it's been one point thirty one point

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.600 
see it's been one point thirty one point
forty<00:03:03.940> one<00:03:04.090> point<00:03:04.390> sixty<00:03:04.810> which<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.610> somewhat

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
forty one point sixty which is somewhat

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.990 
forty one point sixty which is somewhat
a<00:03:06.640> big<00:03:06.880> jump<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:08.040> but<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.250> know<00:03:09.370> that's<00:03:09.820> just

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
a big jump and but you know that's just

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.890 
a big jump and but you know that's just
the<00:03:10.150> way<00:03:10.239> things<00:03:10.360> up

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
the way things up

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
the way things up
so<00:03:11.440> update<00:03:12.010> boils<00:03:12.790> under<00:03:13.239> now<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.260> two

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
so update boils under now this is two

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.180 
so update boils under now this is two
ways<00:03:15.130> of<00:03:15.400> updating<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:15.940> BIOS<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.890> now<00:03:17.890> my

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
ways of updating the BIOS and now my

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.960 
ways of updating the BIOS and now my
solution<00:03:18.790> would<00:03:18.910> be<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.269> Windows<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:21.610> this<00:03:21.820> is

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
solution would be of Windows so this is

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.250 
solution would be of Windows so this is
the<00:03:22.060> one<00:03:22.150> I'm<00:03:22.269> going<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.450> pick<00:03:22.660> I'm<00:03:22.930> going<00:03:23.200> to

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
the one I'm going to pick I'm going to

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.759 
the one I'm going to pick I'm going to
download<00:03:23.500> from<00:03:24.130> Europe<00:03:25.320> now<00:03:26.320> I'm<00:03:26.410> just<00:03:26.530> going

you<00:05:14.520> this<00:05:14.700> is<00:05:14.880> because<00:05:15.030> there<00:05:15.360> is<00:05:15.419> no<00:05:15.630> set<00:05:16.110> BIOS

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
you this is because there is no set BIOS

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.040 
you this is because there is no set BIOS
because<00:05:16.770> you've<00:05:16.919> just<00:05:16.949> updated<00:05:17.690> so<00:05:18.690> just

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
because you've just updated so just

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.860 
because you've just updated so just
click<00:05:19.320> whatever<00:05:19.590> button<00:05:19.830> it<00:05:20.039> says<00:05:20.250> to<00:05:20.870> update

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
click whatever button it says to update

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.250 
click whatever button it says to update
your<00:05:22.050> BIOS<00:05:22.470> to<00:05:22.680> default<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.690> continue<00:05:24.690> this

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
your BIOS to default and continue this

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.560 
your BIOS to default and continue this
will<00:05:25.470> then<00:05:25.620> obviously<00:05:26.220> put<00:05:27.090> your<00:05:27.240> BIOS<00:05:27.539> to

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
will then obviously put your BIOS to

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.320 
will then obviously put your BIOS to
default<00:05:28.169> load<00:05:28.949> your<00:05:29.190> windows<00:05:29.550> up<00:05:29.760> as<00:05:29.880> normal

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
default load your windows up as normal

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.830 
default load your windows up as normal
and<00:05:30.530> you're<00:05:31.530> done<00:05:31.770> you'll<00:05:32.160> find<00:05:32.490> them<00:05:32.849> when

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
and you're done you'll find them when

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.529 
and you're done you'll find them when
you<00:05:33.870> go<00:05:34.169> up<00:05:34.320> into<00:05:34.560> your<00:05:34.940> start<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.210> go<00:05:36.360> into

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
you go up into your start and go into

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.719 
you go up into your start and go into
your<00:05:36.810> system<00:05:37.169> information<00:05:37.440> they'll<00:05:38.430> then

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
your system information they'll then

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.029 
your system information they'll then
just<00:05:39.000> say<00:05:39.180> a<00:05:39.419> gigabyte<00:05:40.169> and<00:05:40.380> not<00:05:40.680> a<00:05:40.830> gigabyte

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
just say a gigabyte and not a gigabyte

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.350 
just say a gigabyte and not a gigabyte
3.19<00:05:44.039> usable<00:05:44.660> so<00:05:45.660> that<00:05:46.260> will<00:05:46.470> then<00:05:46.680> be<00:05:46.830> fixed

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
3.19 usable so that will then be fixed

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.510 
3.19 usable so that will then be fixed
and<00:05:48.360> when<00:05:49.229> you<00:05:49.380> restart<00:05:49.590> your<00:05:49.889> computer<00:05:50.039> after

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
and when you restart your computer after

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.700 
and when you restart your computer after
this<00:05:51.030> you<00:05:51.960> will<00:05:52.139> find<00:05:52.470> that<00:05:52.740> your<00:05:53.699> will<00:05:54.479> I<00:05:55.289> find

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
this you will find that your will I find

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.760 
this you will find that your will I find
that<00:05:55.830> mine<00:05:56.099> my<00:05:57.090> Start<00:05:57.479> screen<00:05:57.659> changes<00:05:58.440> before

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
that mine my Start screen changes before

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.020 
that mine my Start screen changes before
is<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.250> little<00:05:59.460> man<00:05:59.610> and

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
is the little man and

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.130 
is the little man and
now<00:06:00.120> it's<00:06:00.330> just<00:06:00.600> like<00:06:00.960> a<00:06:01.140> big<00:06:01.440> um<00:06:02.870> field<00:06:03.870> you

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
now it's just like a big um field you

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.930 
now it's just like a big um field you
could<00:06:04.290> say<00:06:04.470> filled<00:06:04.860> with<00:06:05.040> hills<00:06:05.310> in<00:06:05.580> and<00:06:05.730> stuff

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.510 
could say filled with hills in and stuff
like<00:06:06.060> that<00:06:06.240> now<00:06:06.270> so<00:06:07.170> I<00:06:07.200> mean<00:06:07.470> it<00:06:07.530> may<00:06:07.740> change<00:06:08.100> as

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
like that now so I mean it may change as

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.730 
like that now so I mean it may change as
it's<00:06:09.210> not<00:06:09.330> they<00:06:09.510> boys<00:06:09.780> they've<00:06:10.200> updated<00:06:10.350> their

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
option when you start up the Machine you

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.270 
option when you start up the Machine you
will<00:06:16.440> get<00:06:16.740> instant<00:06:17.340> flash<00:06:17.820> and<00:06:18.500> this<00:06:19.500> may<00:06:19.710> not
