00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
would be if you let if you let that

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.360 
would be if you let if you let that
gender<00:04:56.290> dictate<00:04:56.770> how<00:04:56.950> you<00:04:57.010> write<00:04:57.250> the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
gender dictate how you write the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.820 
gender dictate how you write the
character<00:04:57.600> because<00:04:58.600> i<00:04:58.630> think<00:04:58.810> it's<00:04:59.110> i<00:04:59.410> don't

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830

see<00:05:00.220> why<00:05:00.490> a<00:05:00.880> master<00:05:01.570> played<00:05:02.290> by<00:05:02.500> a<00:05:02.530> female

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
see why a master played by a female

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.700 
see why a master played by a female
actor<00:05:03.060> can't<00:05:04.060> be<00:05:04.360> essentially<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.260> same<00:05:05.440> as

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
actor can't be essentially the same as

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.470 
actor can't be essentially the same as
you<00:05:06.490> know<00:05:06.520> i'm<00:05:06.730> asked<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:06.940> play<00:05:07.090> by<00:05:07.240> a<00:05:07.270> male

you know i'm asked to play by a male

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.110 
you know i'm asked to play by a male
actor<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:07.900> i<00:05:07.960> think<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:09.160> little<00:05:09.640> elements<00:05:09.880> in

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
actor and i think the little elements in

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.850 
actor and i think the little elements in
da<00:05:10.210> thwart<00:05:10.450> sort<00:05:10.630> of<00:05:10.690> concerned<00:05:11.020> me<00:05:11.200> where<00:05:11.380> you

to see in the doctor and the Masters

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.730 
to see in the doctor and the Masters
relationship<00:05:21.910> it's<00:05:22.060> always<00:05:22.240> been<00:05:22.330> one<00:05:22.450> of

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
relationship it's always been one of

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.080 
relationship it's always been one of
obsession<00:05:23.740> on<00:05:23.860> the<00:05:23.920> Masters<00:05:24.280> part<00:05:24.520> but<00:05:25.060> I

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
obsession on the Masters part but I

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.580 
obsession on the Masters part but I
never<00:05:25.360> really<00:05:25.690> bought<00:05:25.840> that<00:05:26.050> he<00:05:26.170> was<00:05:26.290> in<00:05:26.530> love

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
never really bought that he was in love

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.990 
never really bought that he was in love
with<00:05:26.920> him<00:05:27.010> and<00:05:27.190> I<00:05:27.250> feel<00:05:27.400> like<00:05:27.430> that's

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
with him and I feel like that's

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.920 
with him and I feel like that's
something<00:05:28.210> they've<00:05:28.540> just<00:05:28.660> brought<00:05:28.750> in

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
something they've just brought in

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.020 
something they've just brought in
because<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.260> matters<00:05:29.500> a<00:05:29.530> woman<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.700> I<00:05:30.820> think

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
because the matters a woman and I think

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.400 
because the matters a woman and I think
I<00:05:31.150> think<00:05:31.420> maybe<00:05:31.690> when<00:05:31.930> you<00:05:32.020> get<00:05:32.170> into<00:05:32.260> that

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
I think maybe when you get into that

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.990 
I think maybe when you get into that
territory<00:05:32.680> its<00:05:33.040> I<00:05:33.250> feel<00:05:33.700> like<00:05:33.820> you're<00:05:33.970> on

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
territory its I feel like you're on

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.780 
territory its I feel like you're on
slightly<00:05:34.770> dicey<00:05:35.770> footing<00:05:36.130> I<00:05:36.280> don't<00:05:36.430> know<00:05:36.490> it

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
slightly dicey footing I don't know it

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.190 
slightly dicey footing I don't know it
was<00:05:36.940> obviously<00:05:37.180> a<00:05:37.240> hugely<00:05:37.480> theatrical

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
was obviously a hugely theatrical

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.320 
was obviously a hugely theatrical
element<00:05:38.320> to<00:05:39.070> her<00:05:39.340> character<00:05:39.550> which<00:05:40.030> I<00:05:40.180> guess

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
element to her character which I guess

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.940 
element to her character which I guess
the<00:05:40.510> words<00:05:40.720> I<00:05:40.900> mean<00:05:41.020> especially<00:05:41.140> in<00:05:41.590> a<00:05:41.710> couple

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
the words I mean especially in a couple

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.380 
the words I mean especially in a couple
of<00:05:41.980> the<00:05:42.130> old<00:05:42.250> masters<00:05:42.460> yeah<00:05:43.060> and<00:05:43.270> it<00:05:43.360> feels

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
of the old masters yeah and it feels

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.930 
of the old masters yeah and it feels
like<00:05:43.780> that<00:05:43.990> is<00:05:44.140> maybe<00:05:44.500> just<00:05:44.800> part<00:05:45.040> of<00:05:45.130> part<00:05:45.880> of

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
like that is maybe just part of part of

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.310 
like that is maybe just part of part of
her<00:05:46.090> character<00:05:46.300> being<00:05:46.720> you<00:05:47.050> know<00:05:47.170> an

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.210 
resemblances to a lot of other female
characters<00:06:20.050> in<00:06:20.200> reason<00:06:20.530> this<00:06:20.740> is<00:06:20.800> also

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
characters in reason this is also

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.820 
characters in reason this is also
hughster<00:06:21.700> II<00:06:21.730> yeah<00:06:21.970> just<00:06:22.330> I<00:06:22.750> guess<00:06:23.410> is<00:06:23.590> where

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
hughster II yeah just I guess is where

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.520 
hughster II yeah just I guess is where
that<00:06:23.980> fits<00:06:24.250> in<00:06:24.520> it<00:06:24.700> if<00:06:25.020> those<00:06:26.020> characters<00:06:26.410> had

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
that fits in it if those characters had

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.470 
that fits in it if those characters had
existed<00:06:26.950> I<00:06:27.040> think<00:06:27.280> you<00:06:27.640> would<00:06:28.120> still<00:06:28.270> have<00:06:28.420> a

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
existed I think you would still have a

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.300 
existed I think you would still have a
point<00:06:28.750> but<00:06:29.050> you<00:06:29.260> which<00:06:29.470> made<00:06:29.740> me<00:06:29.860> feel<00:06:30.100> like

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:44.339 
I think so I you know and yeah it would

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:46.040 
I think so I you know and yeah it would
be<00:07:44.399> ashamed<00:07:44.669> to<00:07:44.729> introduce<00:07:44.789> a<00:07:45.149> new<00:07:45.330> take<00:07:45.930> on

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.050 
be ashamed to introduce a new take on

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.480 
be ashamed to introduce a new take on
this<00:07:46.169> character<00:07:46.499> and<00:07:46.800> then<00:07:46.889> not<00:07:47.099> to<00:07:47.249> give<00:07:47.279> it

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:47.490 
this character and then not to give it

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.360 
this character and then not to give it
some<00:07:47.999> kind<00:07:48.240> of<00:07:48.409> sufficient<00:07:49.409> exploration<00:07:50.189> so<00:07:50.339> I

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.370 
some kind of sufficient exploration so I

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.499
