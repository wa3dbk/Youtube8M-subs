processor<00:01:34.979> oh<00:01:35.130> yeah<00:01:35.429> you<00:01:35.490> want<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.729> make<00:01:35.880> sure

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
processor oh yeah you want to make sure

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.120 
processor oh yeah you want to make sure
you<00:01:36.179> have<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> food<00:01:36.539> processor<00:01:37.109> I<00:01:37.289> think<00:01:37.950> this

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you have a food processor I think this

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.340 
you have a food processor I think this
works<00:01:38.369> better<00:01:38.789> than<00:01:39.090> blending<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.749> can<00:01:40.020> use<00:01:40.319> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
works better than blending you can use a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.919 
works better than blending you can use a
blender<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.069> think<00:01:41.429> the<00:01:41.549> processor<00:01:42.179> makes

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
blender but I think the processor makes

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.300 
blender but I think the processor makes
it<00:01:43.139> more<00:01:43.319> of<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.529> soft<00:01:43.799> serve<00:01:44.039> ice<00:01:44.249> cream

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
