calories<00:01:51.149> during<00:01:51.659> weightlifting<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.470> think

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
calories during weightlifting I think

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.749 
calories during weightlifting I think
it's<00:01:53.070> something<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:54.590> 3<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.740> 4<00:01:55.920> calories<00:01:56.130> per

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
it's something like 3 to 4 calories per

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.679 
it's something like 3 to 4 calories per
a<00:01:56.790> minute<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.240> weight

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
a minute of weight

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.410 
a minute of weight
weightlifting<00:01:58.140> or<00:01:58.409> maybe<00:01:58.619> 4<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.189> 5<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.790> when

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
weightlifting or maybe 4 to 5 and when

shopping<00:02:02.189> you'll<00:02:02.640> burn<00:02:02.790> about<00:02:03.000> 2<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.420> 3

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
losing weight every week if I told you

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.960 
losing weight every week if I told you
the<00:03:12.900> amount<00:03:13.109> of<00:03:13.170> calories<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.829> their<00:03:14.760> gender

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
the amount of calories and their gender

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.870 
the amount of calories and their gender
and<00:03:15.180> stuff<00:03:15.329> you'd<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:15.900> thought<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.410> the

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
and stuff you'd have thought that the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.120 
and stuff you'd have thought that the
that<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.030> one<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.750> was<00:03:19.049> heavier<00:03:19.829> would

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
that the one that was heavier would

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.680 
that the one that was heavier would
obviously<00:03:20.370> be<00:03:20.549> eating<00:03:21.000> more<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.209> be<00:03:21.419> able<00:03:21.510> to

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
obviously be eating more and be able to

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.379 
obviously be eating more and be able to
eat<00:03:21.840> more<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:22.260> if<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.500> put<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.919> the<00:03:23.430> one<00:03:23.579> at<00:03:23.669> 175

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
eat more so if I put the the one at 175

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.599 
eat more so if I put the the one at 175
pounds<00:03:24.419> on<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.470> cut<00:03:25.769> you'd<00:03:26.220> be<00:03:26.280> able<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.459> lose

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
pounds on a cut you'd be able to lose

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.059 
pounds on a cut you'd be able to lose
weight<00:03:26.819> at<00:03:26.910> 4,000<00:03:27.510> calories<00:03:27.599> roughly<00:03:28.169> so<00:03:28.680> just

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
weight at 4,000 calories roughly so just

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.339 
weight at 4,000 calories roughly so just
put<00:03:29.220> m-spec<00:03:29.549> -<00:03:29.669> that's<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:29.880> massive<00:03:30.349> massive

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
put m-spec - that's a massive massive

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.479 
put m-spec - that's a massive massive
difference<00:03:31.560> now<00:03:32.720> they<00:03:33.720> have<00:03:33.930> similar<00:03:34.799> jobs<00:03:35.250> in

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
difference now they have similar jobs in

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.680 
difference now they have similar jobs in
terms<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.349> energy<00:03:37.349> expenditure<00:03:37.919> but<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:39.450> main

terms of energy expenditure but the main

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.140 
terms of energy expenditure but the main
difference<00:03:39.720> they<00:03:40.620> have<00:03:40.650> there<00:03:41.160> is<00:03:41.370> genetics

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
difference they have there is genetics

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.170 
difference they have there is genetics
it<00:03:43.019> does<00:03:43.349> come<00:03:43.709> down<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.980> genetics<00:03:44.819> at<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.030> end

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
it does come down to genetics at the end

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.589 
it does come down to genetics at the end
of<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.359> day<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:46.370> calorie<00:03:47.370> like<00:03:47.880> maintenance

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
of the day it calorie like maintenance

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.379 
of the day it calorie like maintenance
calories<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.230> just<00:03:49.829> how<00:03:50.010> much<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.549> burn<00:03:50.880> your

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
calories and just how much you burn your

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.870 
calories and just how much you burn your
your<00:03:51.690> body<00:03:51.870> itself<00:03:52.380> does<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.889> lot<00:03:53.340> come<00:03:53.579> down<00:03:53.760> to

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
your body itself does a lot come down to

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.490 
your body itself does a lot come down to
genetics<00:03:54.239> but<00:03:54.359> it<00:03:54.780> does<00:03:54.959> get<00:03:55.109> affected

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
genetics but it does get affected

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.699 
genetics but it does get affected
obviously<00:03:55.650> by<00:03:56.370> lifestyle<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.440> you've<00:03:58.590> got

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
obviously by lifestyle and so you've got

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.110 
obviously by lifestyle and so you've got
a<00:03:58.739> pair<00:03:58.919> that<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.129> mind<00:03:59.310> now<00:03:59.459> in<00:03:59.700> terms<00:03:59.970> of

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
a pair that in mind now in terms of

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
who are way way above that all right but

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.520 
who are way way above that all right but
anywhere<00:04:29.360> between<00:04:29.510> nine<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:29.840> twelve<00:04:30.110> so<00:04:30.410> if

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
anywhere between nine and twelve so if

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.620 
anywhere between nine and twelve so if
you<00:04:30.620> take<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:31.070> let<00:04:31.730> me<00:04:31.790> do<00:04:31.910> this<00:04:32.090> on<00:04:32.270> a

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
you take a let me do this on a

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.950 
you take a let me do this on a
calculator<00:04:33.290> if<00:04:33.620> you<00:04:34.160> take<00:04:34.430> a<00:04:34.960> 200-pound

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
calculator if you take a 200-pound

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.680 
calculator if you take a 200-pound
person<00:04:36.640> so<00:04:37.640> let's<00:04:37.730> do<00:04:37.940> that<00:04:37.970> two<00:04:38.270> hundred

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
person so let's do that two hundred

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.990 
person so let's do that two hundred
times<00:04:39.140> nine<00:04:39.740> on<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.100> lower<00:04:40.280> end<00:04:40.550> you're

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
times nine on the lower end you're

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.310 
times nine on the lower end you're
getting<00:04:41.180> eighteen<00:04:41.570> hundred<00:04:41.900> calories<00:04:42.200> so<00:04:42.290> if

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
getting eighteen hundred calories so if

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.350 
getting eighteen hundred calories so if
you<00:04:42.470> take<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.620> 200-pound<00:04:43.220> person<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:43.790> put<00:04:44.240> them

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
you take a 200-pound person and put them

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.150 
you take a 200-pound person and put them
on<00:04:44.450> 1800<00:04:44.810> calories<00:04:45.320> and<00:04:45.470> they<00:04:45.620> lose<00:04:45.830> a<00:04:45.890> nice

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
on 1800 calories and they lose a nice

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160 
on 1800 calories and they lose a nice
amount<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.490> weight<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.610> pound<00:04:46.910> a<00:04:47.000> week<00:04:47.170> there's

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
amount of weight a pound a week there's

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.390 
amount of weight a pound a week there's
nothing<00:04:48.440> there's<00:04:48.620> not<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.860> problem<00:04:49.010> with<00:04:49.220> that

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
nothing there's not a problem with that

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.310 
nothing there's not a problem with that
that<00:04:49.610> is<00:04:49.790> actually<00:04:50.060> they're<00:04:50.900> cutting

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
that is actually they're cutting

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.310 
that is actually they're cutting
calories<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.920> they're<00:04:52.280> on<00:04:52.400> 1800<00:04:53.320> calories

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
calories and they're on 1800 calories

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.500 
calories and they're on 1800 calories
and<00:04:54.440> they<00:04:54.500> weigh<00:04:54.620> 200<00:04:55.040> pounds<00:04:55.070> so<00:04:55.820> that's

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
and they weigh 200 pounds so that's

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.660 
and they weigh 200 pounds so that's
perfectly<00:04:57.050> healthy<00:04:57.380> anywhere<00:04:58.220> between<00:04:58.340> nine

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
perfectly healthy anywhere between nine

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.010 
perfectly healthy anywhere between nine
and<00:04:58.700> twelve<00:04:58.970> guys<00:04:59.300> so<00:04:59.480> let's<00:04:59.630> take<00:04:59.810> it<00:04:59.930> again

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
and twelve guys so let's take it again

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.190 
and twelve guys so let's take it again
200<00:05:00.860> times<00:05:01.580> twelve<00:05:02.680> 2,400<00:05:03.680> on<00:05:03.860> an<00:05:04.700> average

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
200 times twelve 2,400 on an average

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.530 
200 times twelve 2,400 on an average
that's<00:05:06.200> about<00:05:06.590> where<00:05:07.490> most<00:05:07.880> people<00:05:08.060> fall

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
that's about where most people fall

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.350 
that's about where most people fall
between<00:05:08.690> if<00:05:09.110> if<00:05:09.590> they<00:05:09.890> weight<00:05:10.220> 200<00:05:10.640> pounds<00:05:11.180> or

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
between if if they weight 200 pounds or

any<00:05:11.690> sort<00:05:12.350> of<00:05:12.380> weight<00:05:12.590> if<00:05:12.710> you<00:05:12.800> do<00:05:12.920> it<00:05:13.010> between

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
any sort of weight if you do it between
