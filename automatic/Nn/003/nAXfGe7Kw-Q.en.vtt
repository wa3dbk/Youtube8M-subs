is confiscation yes I have some concerns

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.549 
is confiscation yes I have some concerns
about<00:00:31.610> confiscation<00:00:32.610> obviously<00:00:33.559> especially

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
about confiscation obviously especially

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.680 
about confiscation obviously especially
in<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.800> United<00:00:34.920> States<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.880> other<00:00:36.120> countries

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
in the United States in other countries

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.410 
in the United States in other countries
less<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.640> I<00:00:39.410> still<00:00:40.410> think<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.340> over<00:00:42.090> time

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
less and I still think that over time

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.190 
less and I still think that over time
the<00:00:42.480> price<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.440> gold<00:00:43.680> will<00:00:44.160> go<00:00:44.399> up<00:00:44.780> maybe<00:00:45.780> not

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the price of gold will go up maybe not

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.569 
the price of gold will go up maybe not
quite<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.980> much<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:48.059> percentage<00:00:48.840> terms<00:00:48.870> as<00:00:49.649> in

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
quite as much in percentage terms as in

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.340 
quite as much in percentage terms as in
the<00:00:50.789> years<00:00:51.770> 1998<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.699> last<00:00:54.180> year's<00:00:54.690> high<00:00:54.989> at

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
the years 1998 to last year's high at

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.160 
the years 1998 to last year's high at
1921<00:00:58.350> dollars<00:00:58.829> last<00:00:59.399> September<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> think

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
1921 dollars last September but I think

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
1921 dollars last September but I think
the<00:01:01.320> trend<00:01:01.590> will<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.399> there<00:01:02.730> will<00:01:02.850> be

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the trend will be up there will be

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.440 
the trend will be up there will be
fluctuations<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:05.070> bull<00:01:05.519> market<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:06.360> an

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
fluctuations in a bull market for an

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.929 
fluctuations in a bull market for an
asset<00:01:06.930> class<00:01:07.229> say<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.130> bull<00:01:08.369> market<00:01:08.580> in

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
asset class say the bull market in

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.469 
asset class say the bull market in
stocks<00:01:09.860> 1982<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.960> 2007<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.340> 87<00:01:14.340> stocks<00:01:14.729> fell<00:01:15.060> 40

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
stocks 1982 to 2007 in 87 stocks fell 40

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.380 
stocks 1982 to 2007 in 87 stocks fell 40
50<00:01:15.780> percent<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.680> then<00:01:17.310> they<00:01:17.520> went<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:18.030> another

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
50 percent and then they went up another

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.200 
50 percent and then they went up another
eight<00:01:18.930> times<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.909> big

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
eight times so we can have big

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.020 
eight times so we can have big
corrections<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.259> all<00:01:22.619> markets<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.460> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
corrections in all markets and that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.780 
corrections in all markets and that
could<00:01:24.299> also<00:01:24.509> happen<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.020> gold<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.759> happen<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
could also happen to gold I happen to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.940 
could also happen to gold I happen to
think<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.330> probably<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.229> correction<00:01:28.770> which

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
think that probably the correction which

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.660 
think that probably the correction which
began<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> year<00:01:29.579> ago<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:31.159> found<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.460> low

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
began a year ago and found the low

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.280 
began a year ago and found the low
December<00:01:33.450> 29th<00:01:34.430> 2011<00:01:35.430> has<00:01:36.299> probably<00:01:36.780> ended

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
December 29th 2011 has probably ended

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.609 
December 29th 2011 has probably ended
and<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:38.040> are<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.340> trending<00:01:39.150> higher<00:01:39.689> but

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and that we are now trending higher but

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.280 
and that we are now trending higher but
I'd<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.009> see<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> correction<00:01:42.150> now<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.600> gold

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
I'd like to see a correction now of gold

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.060 
I'd like to see a correction now of gold
prices<00:01:43.680> down<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.399> around<00:01:44.509> 1650<00:01:45.509> per<00:01:46.500> ounce<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
prices down to around 1650 per ounce and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.520 
prices down to around 1650 per ounce and
then<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.970> should<00:01:48.270> hold<00:01:48.540> around<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.290> level

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
then it should hold around that level

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.490 
then it should hold around that level
and<00:01:49.829> not<00:01:50.369> move<00:01:50.700> lower<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:52.020> would<00:01:52.290> give<00:01:52.470> me

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
and not move lower that would give me

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.830 
and not move lower that would give me
more<00:01:52.680> confidence<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.759> now<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.090> next<00:01:54.450> leg<00:01:54.810> of

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
more confidence that now the next leg of

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.340 
more confidence that now the next leg of
the<00:01:55.229> bull<00:01:55.439> market<00:01:55.680> has<00:01:56.490> gotten<00:01:56.969> underway

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
the bull market has gotten underway

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.429 
the bull market has gotten underway
because<00:01:58.350> don't<00:01:58.680> forget<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.930> central<00:02:00.930> banks

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
because don't forget the central banks

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.330 
because don't forget the central banks
for<00:02:01.680> sure<00:02:01.860> we'll<00:02:02.100> all<00:02:02.250> print<00:02:02.610> money<00:02:03.350> but<00:02:04.350> asset

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
for sure we'll all print money but asset

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.089 
for sure we'll all print money but asset
markets<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.630> know<00:02:06.719> like<00:02:06.899> they<00:02:07.320> printed<00:02:07.890> money

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
markets you know like they printed money

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.010 
markets you know like they printed money
like<00:02:08.399> crazy<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> real<00:02:09.300> estate<00:02:09.690> still

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
like crazy but the real estate still

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.820 
like crazy but the real estate still
went<00:02:10.289> down<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.300> money<00:02:12.690> printing

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
went down so you can have money printing

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.870 
went down so you can have money printing
and<00:02:13.920> at<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.520> same<00:02:14.760> time<00:02:14.900> negative<00:02:16.880> behavior

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
and at the same time negative behavior
