you can see the VK 200 and epic are
basically<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> same<00:01:00.329> size<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.989> BK<00:01:01.620> 200<00:01:02.129> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
basically the same size the BK 200 is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.090 
basically the same size the BK 200 is
around<00:01:02.520> 15%<00:01:02.969> smaller<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.960> lighter<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.710> not

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
around 15% smaller and lighter but not

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.190 
around 15% smaller and lighter but not
much<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.489> difference<00:01:05.850> overall<00:01:06.240> or

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
much of a difference overall or

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.719 
much of a difference overall or
importantly<00:01:07.740> though<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.159> keyboards<00:01:08.640> are

importantly though the keyboards are

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.760 
importantly though the keyboards are
very<00:01:08.909> different<00:01:09.180> as<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> epic

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
very different as you can see the epic

very different as you can see the epic
keyboard<00:01:11.159> isn't<00:01:11.610> too<00:01:11.790> epic<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.659> only<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.049> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
keyboard isn't too epic not only is it

somewhat<00:01:13.590> blurry<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.490> easy<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.850> see
