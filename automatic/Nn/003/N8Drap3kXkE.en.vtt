 how would the translation be in the language 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.710
 original we are going to enter the application 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.780
 as such remember it is called translator there is 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.340
 handy pro so you'll find the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.620
 application as such will show you what

 it is an icon as it is to all countries 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.480
 let's enter the application 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.040
 and this interface shows you this interface 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.320
 You have two options on the top 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.140
 the text appears that you are going to 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.760
 do where you write if and in the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.770
 bottom part when you already inherit the 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.000
 option to translate tempo in the language in 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.980
 which has been translated from the side 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.479
 left appears in Spanish but I 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.670
 I can put him in a way that I want him to 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.450
 it is translated in which I am going to write 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.150
 or also if I want the language that I 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.840
 I need to learn for example Albanian 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.490
 Czech Korean German to see how it looks in 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.040
 Korean that I really like music 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.990
 Korean 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.460
 so here they describe how they would be 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.050
 Koreans welcome to your best channel 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.520
 technology but it also allows you 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.520
 listen to it build a little 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.220
 that would be in Korean really is a 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.660
 Translation also puts it in Spanish 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.870
 Welcome to a better channel 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.220
 technology if you then have that way 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.080
 of option also marks you in the part 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.130
 from below what is a notebook that 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.870
 notebook has some questions 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.239
 necessary for when you go on a trip 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.950
 can do your basic questions and you 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.840
 can translate them for example you can go 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.280
 where is the nearest hotel you 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.590
 they put the language so that people 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.780
 can read well in addition to handling several 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.490
 languages ​​are we going to put that slice in 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.290
 Greek 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.730
 and since he put it in Greek also what 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.680
 I can put it in case you do not understand it 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.030
 listen to weights I think it's a good 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.130
 option remember that if we get to the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.530
 500 like like each chair video and 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.450
 application we give them that application 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.460
 let's follow me logically it would be two 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.260
 gift applications for users 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.670
 then remember the application is from the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.730
 company 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.260
 of handy if they have developed 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.620
 many applications and you can load them 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.940
 directly from your app store in addition to 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.930
 that you can link it with facebook and 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.239
 twitter so that it will serve you 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.730
 pressures where they are in this case the 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.290
 conversion into translation and we have in the 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.760
 bottom part a clipboard that would be 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.380
 the first button so you can 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.510
 copy in anything else to the best 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.380
 your facebook you can send it by message 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.400
 of text if you mark the text message 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.410
 it also sends you what is a mail 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.489
 electronic you can tweet it like this for 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.470
 that people can find out what 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.910
 are you talking then I think you are 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.280

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.209
 travel and then to have a translation 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.110
 for anything on your device 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.489
