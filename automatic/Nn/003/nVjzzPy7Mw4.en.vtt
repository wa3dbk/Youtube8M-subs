00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.089 

now<00:03:27.060> pretty<00:03:28.049> simple<00:03:28.469> he's<00:03:28.560> place<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:28.950> here

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
now pretty simple he's place it here

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.319 
now pretty simple he's place it here
like<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:32.760> make<00:03:32.909> a<00:03:32.939> sandwich

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
like this and you make a sandwich

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.740 
like this and you make a sandwich
painting<00:03:34.109> sandwich<00:03:35.000> like<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.120> said<00:03:36.329> you<00:03:36.629> have

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
painting sandwich like I said you have

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.509 
painting sandwich like I said you have
to<00:03:36.870> wait<00:03:37.019> until<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.349> painting<00:03:37.650> dries<00:03:37.859> and

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
to wait until the painting dries and

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.420 
to wait until the painting dries and
then<00:03:38.730> this<00:03:39.390> will<00:03:39.540> prevent<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:41.250> know<00:03:41.280> the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
then this will prevent you know the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.410 
then this will prevent you know the
painting<00:03:41.670> from<00:03:41.760> scratching<00:03:42.180> in<00:03:42.299> your

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
painting from scratching in your

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.869 
painting from scratching in your
backpack<00:03:42.870> or<00:03:43.109> getting<00:03:43.739> pierced<00:03:44.189> by<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.370> don't

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.509 
backpack or getting pierced by I don't
know<00:03:44.939> a<00:03:44.970> knife<00:03:45.299> or<00:03:45.659> a<00:03:46.079> red<00:03:46.620> nose<00:03:46.799> hole<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.189> I

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
know a knife or a red nose hole it I

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.020 
know a knife or a red nose hole it I
have<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.180> much<00:03:48.299> stuff<00:03:48.540> on<00:03:48.689> my<00:03:48.810> backpack<00:03:50.030> by

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
have so much stuff on my backpack by

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.099 
have so much stuff on my backpack by
this<00:03:51.620> solid<00:03:52.670> no<00:03:53.670> for<00:03:53.879> the<00:03:53.939> lambo<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:57.750> lock<00:03:57.959> it

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
this solid no for the lambo to lock it

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:17.039 
this solid no for the lambo to lock it
in<00:03:58.230> place<00:04:01.879> it's<00:04:02.879> simple

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.440 

this<00:04:18.049> is<00:04:18.200> actually<00:04:18.530> how<00:04:18.650> I<00:04:19.040> make<00:04:19.940> crates<00:04:20.239> for

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
this is actually how I make crates for

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.090 
this is actually how I make crates for
my<00:04:20.600> paintings<00:04:21.019> but<00:04:21.109> this<00:04:21.290> is<00:04:21.410> a<00:04:21.440> mini<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:21.980> a

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
my paintings but this is a mini and a

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.420 
my paintings but this is a mini and a
lot<00:04:22.310> less<00:04:22.490> material<00:04:23.480> and<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:25.040> would<00:04:25.250> use

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
lot less material and the would use

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.700 
lot less material and the would use
thicker<00:04:25.910> and<00:04:26.300> less<00:04:26.540> would<00:04:26.690> have<00:04:26.840> this<00:04:27.380> much

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
thicker and less would have this much

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:35.430 
thicker and less would have this much
styrofoam<00:04:28.400> five<00:04:28.870> centimetres<00:04:29.870> thick<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:31.520> now

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.360 

sucking<00:04:36.440> up<00:04:36.560> in<00:04:36.710> this<00:04:36.860> easily

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:51.450 

I<00:04:42.449> just<00:04:43.449> fold<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.740> stip<00:04:45.040> here

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.180 

and<00:04:52.000> then<00:04:52.120> it<00:04:52.270> can<00:04:52.570> open<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.080> close<00:04:53.190> quite

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
and then it can open and close quite

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.050 
and then it can open and close quite
easily<00:04:54.660> there<00:04:56.010> doesn't<00:04:57.010> go<00:04:57.070> anywhere<00:04:57.280> the

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
easily there doesn't go anywhere the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.020 
easily there doesn't go anywhere the
wood<00:04:58.240> here<00:04:58.510> is<00:04:58.540> okay<00:04:59.370> don't<00:05:00.370> really<00:05:00.550> need<00:05:00.910> to

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
wood here is okay don't really need to

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.390 
wood here is okay don't really need to
protect<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.480> sides<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:02.230> see<00:05:02.950> once<00:05:03.190> if<00:05:03.370> you

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
protect the sides I see once if you

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.480 
protect the sides I see once if you
wanted<00:05:03.850> them<00:05:04.000> what<00:05:04.390> have<00:05:04.510> you<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.660> don't<00:05:04.840> know

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
wanted them what have you I don't know

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.460 
wanted them what have you I don't know
and<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:07.270> is<00:05:07.330> not<00:05:07.480> really<00:05:08.050> easy<00:05:08.140> to<00:05:08.380> open<00:05:10.470> just

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
and this is not really easy to open just

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.660 
and this is not really easy to open just
