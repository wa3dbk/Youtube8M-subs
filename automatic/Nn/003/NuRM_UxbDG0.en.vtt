00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 so and their to the next play 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.330
 review and today gives the memphis depay 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.030
 informants 80 euros there at 92 86 73 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.690
 fit and 78 46 tall with lava second 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 Right foot 25 stars has even gone me 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.189
 pay for it in three and a half games nine 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.410
 Gates scored here you see again 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.080
 five but disconnect you know so 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.240
 usually me mostly and yes the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.730
 ingame sets are overly fierce for 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.050
 the 80s oval rating player and the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.669
 just very good one must also 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.739
 the same time as in the beginning say 'it is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.260
 even open space is not that bad 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.090
 I agree with the speed I mean 200 m 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.910
 presented to say 20 pace is 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.770
 a defender is running well 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.260
 of it kyle walker already had his 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.399
 had difficulties with him 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.620
 and that is just wonderful on the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.570
 wing with such a player to run 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.300
 to the ball control and the flashing 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.520
 is wonderfully still very moved here 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.289
 a high agility wonderful one can 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.539
 the freezers live out how to be 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.340
 would like to really be the ball guide 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.650
 The next one is perfect 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.290
 I have a positive point in the conclusion 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.869
 thoughts in games test not quite so 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.280
 blatant but does not have public too 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.020
 convinced that not quite so 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.549
 the truth corresponds to one 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.530
 pretty strong shot and baller 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.380
 there usually revealed around the meantime 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.430
 Ears how I can and I do not know 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.750
 I make it a drain a bit 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.909
 but the conclusion came in general 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.320
 Not too bad where you can go 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.180
 good was good with the purest with the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.310
 good dribbling and then you were on 16 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.009
 From a short distance could the ball too 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.409
 really without problems in the gate 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.060
 and the grant comes already mentioned that 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.479
 Passing the solid has no goals 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.610
 made 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.860
 to the tree or cultureless disability 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.009
 In the storm, it also has a strong fight 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.899
 76 physics says everything and mine 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.090
 keeping up with calcium in the body 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.220
 and if they caught up with them again 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.509
 one or the other times the ball 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.770
 simply filed because the body site 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.689
 Feel wing play just right 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.340
 it is violent what the player can show 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.390
 and that is very helpful if you are 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.979
 So that means a bit now 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.210
 you want to get around and you do not like that 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.320
 Quick the ball in front of the positional game 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.570
 is also secretive about work 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.219
 Rathenov of Russian himstedt has 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.509
 good walkways you can send him well 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.789
 and use well that even there 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.459
 next positive aspect and you have to 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.629
 say his hat gets me you can 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.500
 ever his normal just a lot 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.030
 much better 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.530
 he has two stars as left 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.780
 I think I made two goals 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.230
 and I can with left actually 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.510
 not much less so at least 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.210
 three and a half before East Africa already give 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.730
 but well so that's why in quotas 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.550
 positive point must say I have 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.220
 nothing negative is found anyway 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.170
 not from me because of the conclusion 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.209
 is not the fiercest on the world 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.590
 well better than expected, of course, but 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.410
 I would not be ten out of ten 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.000
 now times with a 10 rate 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.530
 then come on the average 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.270
 there are only the new ones out of nine 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.380
 because anything is better than you think to 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.480
 the bad things are better than 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.800
 But you do not think like you do that 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.280
 now at a 10 14 player 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.720
 would like to 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.340
 if you want to think that way 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.630
 everything is fine with him or better would like 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.090
 you can still see in my head 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.350
 my 10 10 give but it was already 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.020
 really good the normal card is 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.940
 really good similar to the car so 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.630
 Generally this team optics he is very 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.480
 have been good 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.400
 and that's why the 99 here at the pi 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.959
 I hope that you have player review 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.970
 like one always in my 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.830
 comments has played like e detailing 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.780
 I think that will be the researchers 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.090
 probably a reboot again and 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.430
 conclusion was already shit so 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.920
 Definitely in the comments in 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.600
 any wise could agree and 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.970
 yes if any commitments try 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.730
 To knock out a review tonight 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.100
 I know all this, but I can do it 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.930
 when it comes when late when comes late 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.090
 but I hope it comes when he bock 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.260
 then it has the video 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.190
 Maybe I'll go with a furniture 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.750
 probably not because of me 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.850
 Shit how much it gets a video 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.690
 but no matter 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.130
 I do not know, I have to have one 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.690
 claim frame of the web has videos 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.030
 Actually, I'm not horny 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.780
 content beautiful day and say then 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.780
 at least follow
