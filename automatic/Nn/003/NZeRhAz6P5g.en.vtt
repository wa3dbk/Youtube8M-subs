00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
chemistry that developed very quickly I

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.640 
chemistry that developed very quickly I
think<00:02:54.449> put<00:02:54.629> us<00:02:54.719> in<00:02:54.870> position<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.409> we<00:02:55.500> are

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
have him shoot a little better from the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.249 
have him shoot a little better from the
floor<00:03:17.340> but<00:03:17.549> he's<00:03:17.729> he's<00:03:18.239> spectacular<00:03:18.509> he's<00:03:19.019> fun

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:19.259 
floor but he's he's spectacular he's fun

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.789

LaMarcus<00:03:19.799> Aldridge<00:03:20.599> it<00:03:21.599> you<00:03:21.959> know<00:03:22.049> is<00:03:22.259> I<00:03:22.530> think

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
LaMarcus Aldridge it you know is I think

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.339 
LaMarcus Aldridge it you know is I think
the<00:03:23.040> national<00:03:23.579> media<00:03:24.359> now<00:03:24.569> maybe<00:03:24.930> getting<00:03:25.199> a

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
the national media now maybe getting a

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.839 
the national media now maybe getting a
chance<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.799> see<00:03:26.009> him<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.370> putting<00:03:26.549> up<00:03:26.729> numbers

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
chance to see him and putting up numbers

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.999 
chance to see him and putting up numbers
rebounding<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.629> little<00:03:27.840> bit<00:03:27.989> more<00:03:28.259> it's<00:03:28.799> just

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:29.009 
rebounding a little bit more it's just

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.039 
rebounding a little bit more it's just
hard<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> be<00:03:29.519> a<00:03:29.549> great<00:03:29.849> jump<00:03:30.299> shooting<00:03:30.359> team<00:03:31.019> I

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
hard to be a great jump shooting team I

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.199 
hard to be a great jump shooting team I
think<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:32.280> went<00:03:32.489> once<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:32.879> get<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
think it went once you get to the

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.240 
think it went once you get to the
postseason<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:34.019> just<00:03:34.259> feels<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:34.650> can<00:03:35.220> you

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
postseason it just feels like can you

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.159 
postseason it just feels like can you
live<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.669> die<00:03:35.819> by<00:03:35.849> that<00:03:36.329> jump<00:03:36.689> shot<00:03:36.750> your

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
live and die by that jump shot your

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.659

thoughts<00:03:37.409> on<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:37.650> build<00:03:38.159> for<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.430> long<00:03:38.639> haul

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
thoughts on this build for the long haul

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.069 
thoughts on this build for the long haul
and<00:03:39.120> maybe<00:03:39.299> once<00:03:39.569> you<00:03:39.689> get<00:03:39.810> into<00:03:39.930> the

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
and maybe once you get into the

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.830 
and maybe once you get into the
postseason<00:03:40.609> well<00:03:41.609> I<00:03:41.879> think<00:03:42.239> those<00:03:42.569> are<00:03:42.599> all

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
postseason well I think those are all

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.309 
postseason well I think those are all
legitimate<00:03:43.400> observations<00:03:44.400> yard<00:03:45.090> defense<00:03:45.509> is

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
legitimate observations yard defense is

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.300 
legitimate observations yard defense is
is<00:03:46.680> not<00:03:46.919> where<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.159> needs<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.430> be<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.759> be<00:03:47.909> a<00:03:47.939> a

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
is not where it needs to be to be a a

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.429 
is not where it needs to be to be a a
contending<00:03:50.310> playoff<00:03:50.639> team<00:03:51.049> it's<00:03:52.049> going<00:03:52.349> in

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
contending playoff team it's going in

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.259 
contending playoff team it's going in
the<00:03:52.470> right<00:03:52.650> direction<00:03:52.859> but<00:03:53.519> we've<00:03:53.909> had<00:03:54.060> some

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
the right direction but we've had some

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.179 
the right direction but we've had some
slippage<00:03:54.629> lately<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.199> I<00:03:55.290> think<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.829> loss<00:03:56.009> of

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
slippage lately and I think the loss of

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.559 
slippage lately and I think the loss of
Minnesota<00:03:56.639> will<00:03:56.849> kind<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.090> get<00:03:57.239> us<00:03:57.359> back<00:03:57.540> on

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
Minnesota will kind of get us back on

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.219 
Minnesota will kind of get us back on
track<00:03:57.810> with<00:03:58.709> our<00:03:58.769> focus<00:03:59.250> on<00:03:59.400> defense<00:04:00.169> you<00:04:01.169> know

the paint the best defensive teams take

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.319 
the paint the best defensive teams take
away<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.019> rim<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:16.469> take<00:04:17.310> away<00:04:17.489> easy<00:04:17.729> baskets

so<00:04:18.719> the<00:04:19.469> fact<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.829> uh<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.969> know<00:04:21.090> if<00:04:21.359> you're

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
so the fact that uh you know if you're

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:23.279 
able to shoot and I was part of a

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:24.680 
able to shoot and I was part of a
championship<00:04:23.460> team<00:04:23.849> that<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.389> was<00:04:24.570> our

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
championship team that that was our

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.950 
championship team that that was our
strength<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.139> Dallas

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
strength in Dallas

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.050 
strength in Dallas
um<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.800> know<00:04:26.860> with<00:04:26.949> conventional<00:04:27.490> its

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
um you know with conventional its

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.550 
um you know with conventional its
conventional<00:04:28.569> wisdom<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:28.990> jump<00:04:29.350> shooting

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
conventional wisdom that jump shooting

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.580 
conventional wisdom that jump shooting
teams<00:04:30.370> don't<00:04:30.639> do<00:04:31.210> well<00:04:31.419> but<00:04:31.600> not<00:04:32.169> all<00:04:32.319> teams

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
teams don't do well but not all teams

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.159 
teams don't do well but not all teams
are<00:04:32.710> good<00:04:32.860> jump<00:04:33.069> shooting<00:04:33.310> teams<00:04:33.550> so<00:04:34.000> I<00:04:34.660> think

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
are good jump shooting teams so I think

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.180 
are good jump shooting teams so I think
it's<00:04:35.289> important<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.770> play<00:04:36.009> To<00:04:36.069> Your

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
it's important that you play To Your

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.249 
it's important that you play To Your
Strengths<00:04:36.669> and<00:04:36.789> and<00:04:37.120> shooting<00:04:37.870> perimeter

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
Strengths and and shooting perimeter

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.610 
Strengths and and shooting perimeter
shots<00:04:38.470> like<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.830> said<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.330> strength<00:04:40.780> in<00:04:41.020> you

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
shots like I said is a strength in you

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.330 
shots like I said is a strength in you
know<00:04:41.710> Indiana<00:04:42.069> and<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:42.729> in<00:04:43.680> San<00:04:44.680> Antonio<00:04:45.069> take

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
know Indiana and and in San Antonio take

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.830 
know Indiana and and in San Antonio take
away<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.729> rim<00:04:45.940> they<00:04:46.210> take<00:04:46.419> away<00:04:46.630> all<00:04:46.660> that

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
away the rim they take away all that

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.089 
away the rim they take away all that
stuff<00:04:47.229> so<00:04:47.259> you<00:04:47.470> have<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.740> be<00:04:47.830> able<00:04:47.889> to<00:04:48.039> make

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
stuff so you have to be able to make

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.100 
stuff so you have to be able to make
jump<00:04:48.370> shots<00:04:48.610> Miami<00:04:49.479> takes<00:04:49.690> away<00:04:49.990> the
