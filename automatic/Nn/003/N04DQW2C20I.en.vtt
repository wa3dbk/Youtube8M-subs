00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.680
 some directors who were taken in 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.810
 account to direct the movie the man 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.020

 robert zemeckis ben affleck darren 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.130
 aronovsky among some others but 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.780
 finally zack snyder would be 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.180
 selected to direct the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.860

 manganello was considered for 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.670
 play superman but he had to 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.020
 decline the opportunity because of your car 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.430
 work in true blood 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.440
 henrik abel who finally 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.540
 I would interpret the steel man had 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.430
 been chosen as superman for years 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.199
 back for the superman returns tape 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.510
 but at the end of accounts 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.559
 Bryan Singer would choose Brandon Rush for 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.239
 paper 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.220
 henrik abel will have to wait a couple of 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.379
 years more to play superman 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.450
 viggo mortensen was thought to 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.430
 interpret the general shot but michael 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.620
 Shannon would keep the paper 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.690
 amy adams who plays luÃ­s lane in 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.150
 the tape had already had its duties with 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.530
 superman auditioning for luis lane in 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.540
 the previous superman returns tape 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.580
 has a superman production that 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.159
 never took place but you knew that 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.350
 amy adams smallville appearance in this one 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.540
 Emmy wore a fat suit for 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.860
 interpret a journalist who could 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.410
 absorb fat 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.810
 we love amy but really to whom 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.760
 it occurred to him that another expected path is 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.490
 that of mckenzie great who plays the 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.140
 Kryptonian jacques an extractor had 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.520
 played in the smallville series a 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.010
 a clone of the former club 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.080
 the production hired a specialist 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.840
 in language to develop the language 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.820
 exclusive kryptonian for this tape in 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.890
 one of the first sequences we see in 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.420
 the krypton senate written in that 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.610
 tongue on the walls that actually 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.920
 are sentences translated from English the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.320
 few kryptonian language can say 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.360
 who have a father to robin hood but 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.610
 clark can say he has two robin 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.560
 hood as parents both kevin costner 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.360
 who interprets with honor people like 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.370
 russell crowe who played your the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.500
 they have interpreted the character of robin 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.270
 hood ever in his career 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.070
 by the way henry cavill books or the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.080
 cloud they met in the year 2000 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.540
 when cavill was still a young 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.970
 unknown henri they ask is then 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.190
 a rosell advice about acting 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.620
 what rosell crowe told him they treat you 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.750
 pretty bad but they pay you well it seems 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.560
 that both like the bad life and the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.750
 money 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.640
 the superman layer in most 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.700
 sequences is actually made 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.340
 computer yes I'm sorry that cool coat 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.930

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.480
 of the scenes were taken with henry 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.430
 cavill without a cape and if that disappointed you 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.319
 you do not want to know then that the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.569
 General shot armor is made 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.430
 computer also the actor alone 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.280
 he wore pajamas when filming his scenes 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.890
 yes I know cinema magic hurts sometimes 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.500
 the creators based on the tape the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.569
 day live the young carpenter to achieve 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.630
 the scenes where of course a child is and 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.489
 discover your x- ray vision for the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.100
 creation of the superman costume was devised 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.870
 an alien texture that simple view 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.000
 it seems that on earth I could not 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.890
 having been created by the way that zack 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.180
 snyder director of the movie said 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.730
 have tried that man of steel 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.099
 use his clothes inside out but 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.290
 more than I tried he could not afford it 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.000
 when we see the clark pictures as a 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.220
 child in one we observe the name of 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.440

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.330

 the different versions of the 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.290
 Kryptonite and the choice of superheroes 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.480
 when clark discovers his origins 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.880
 Visit Kryptonian ship that 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.860

 Kryptonian died in a capsule but 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.880
 there is another capsule that is open could 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.580
 this make reference to a possible 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.890
 appearance of supergirl the scene where 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.690

 by brian azzarello and jim lee and talking 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.470
 of religious references 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.870
 zack snyder struggled until the 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.270
 fatigue of putting superman in poses 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.820
 of Jesus Christ 'placing him in more than one 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.530
 occasion in divine positions if this 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.270
 excellence we understood we already understood that 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.150
 superman is Jesus Christ and he stops 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.400
 blaspheme twice we can see 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.260
 references to bruce wayne and batman 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.450
 both are when superman is 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.060
 fighting in a department you see the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.670

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.380

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.070
 the companies that we see in repeated 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.720
 occasions and it is not for less since 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.300
 the sequel to man of steel ' the ex of 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.340

 smiling the watchers were labs 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.710

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.020
 lapse in the comics is an organization 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.940
 of research that has recently 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.220
 been home of Seibert another of the 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.010

 the ghost booster character appears 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.390
 Another quick nod is the utopia casino 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.030
 this casino in the comics belongs to 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.830

 Many kryptonite complain about death 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.220
 from soft to superman hands at the end of 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.170
 the movie but few remember that 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.120
 Superman also kills or from the previous 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.430
 saga starring Christopher Reeve 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.140
 in comics superman has also opted 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.730
 to annihilate all who thought 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.130
 occasions has shown that his 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:50.150
 madness can only be stopped with a 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.150
 good neck twist 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.900
