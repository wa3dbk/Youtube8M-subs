maybe it's just that one life come cuz i
was<00:03:15.930> kind<00:03:16.079> of<00:03:16.109> a<00:03:16.200> funny<00:03:16.409> one<00:03:16.650> but<00:03:16.919> i<00:03:16.950> don't<00:03:17.250> know

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
was kind of a funny one but i don't know

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.710 
was kind of a funny one but i don't know
we'll<00:03:17.489> see<00:03:17.519> i'll<00:03:17.909> have<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.299> see<00:03:18.449> how<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.690> goes

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
we'll see i'll have to see how that goes

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.479 
we'll see i'll have to see how that goes
but<00:03:19.530> i<00:03:19.620> think<00:03:19.799> people<00:03:19.979> like<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.159> see<00:03:20.310> like<00:03:20.400> the

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
but i think people like to see like the

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.270 
but i think people like to see like the
call-outs<00:03:20.879> and<00:03:21.150> all<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.449> type<00:03:21.599> of<00:03:21.629> stuff<00:03:21.750> and

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
call-outs and all that type of stuff and

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.229 
call-outs and all that type of stuff and
gives<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.370> better<00:03:23.489> idea<00:03:23.609> of<00:03:23.970> what<00:03:24.150> i'm

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
gives you a better idea of what i'm

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.430 
gives you a better idea of what i'm
thinking<00:03:24.629> when<00:03:24.780> I'm<00:03:24.870> playing<00:03:24.989> stuff<00:03:25.290> like

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
thinking when I'm playing stuff like

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.460 
thinking when I'm playing stuff like
that<00:03:25.940> but<00:03:26.940> as<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.329> right<00:03:27.540> here<00:03:27.659> we're<00:03:28.290> up<00:03:28.440> by

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
that but as you right here we're up by

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.159 
that but as you right here we're up by
like<00:03:28.769> 50<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.609> then<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.750> don't<00:03:30.959> know<00:03:31.019> what

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
like 50 and then I don't know what

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.270 
like 50 and then I don't know what
happens<00:03:31.409> i<00:03:31.470> think<00:03:31.620> is<00:03:31.709> pretty<00:03:31.799> much<00:03:31.979> when<00:03:32.190> our

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
happens i think is pretty much when our

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.890 
happens i think is pretty much when our
teammate<00:03:32.669> quits<00:03:33.030> then<00:03:33.389> they<00:03:33.510> have<00:03:33.629> a<00:03:33.690> full

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
teammate quits then they have a full

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.930 
teammate quits then they have a full
team<00:03:33.930> obviously<00:03:34.340> it's<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.459> full<00:03:35.669> team<00:03:35.790> before

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
team obviously it's a full team before

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.780 
team obviously it's a full team before
verse<00:03:36.329> me<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.870> two<00:03:37.829> randoms<00:03:38.370> who<00:03:38.519> i<00:03:38.579> don't

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
verse me and two randoms who i don't

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.430 
verse me and two randoms who i don't
think<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:38.970> bigger<00:03:39.180> right<00:03:39.690> here<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.079> this<00:03:40.229> it<00:03:40.409> i

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
think a bigger right here is this it i

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.050 
think a bigger right here is this it i
think<00:03:40.709> this<00:03:40.799> is<00:03:40.859> it<00:03:41.040> look<00:03:41.280> what<00:03:41.489> this<00:03:41.639> kid<00:03:41.699> is

that<00:04:52.770> goes<00:04:52.920> many<00:04:53.430> ways<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:54.270> game<00:04:54.540> plays

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720

see<00:04:56.460> her<00:04:56.610> in<00:04:56.700> your<00:04:56.730> word<00:04:56.910> what<00:04:57.180> really<00:04:57.570> up<00:04:57.750> by

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
see her in your word what really up by

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.390 
see her in your word what really up by
like<00:04:58.340> six<00:04:59.480> so<00:05:00.480> they<00:05:01.290> came<00:05:01.500> back<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.220> think<00:05:02.370> I

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
like six so they came back and I think I

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.950 
like six so they came back and I think I
just<00:05:02.430> mainly<00:05:02.820> due<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.090> us<00:05:03.300> having<00:05:03.510> one<00:05:03.750> less

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
just mainly due to us having one less

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.750 
just mainly due to us having one less
player<00:05:04.170> I<00:05:04.530> think<00:05:05.220> much<00:05:05.340> I<00:05:05.430> could<00:05:05.580> do<00:05:05.670> about

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
player I think much I could do about

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.580 
player I think much I could do about
that<00:05:05.910> I<00:05:06.540> think<00:05:06.930> right<00:05:07.020> here's<00:05:07.170> my<00:05:07.260> turn<00:05:07.470> on

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
that I think right here's my turn on

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.660 
that I think right here's my turn on
this<00:05:07.680> kid<00:05:07.860> yup<00:05:08.850> he's<00:05:09.270> mad<00:05:09.540> oh<00:05:09.990> my<00:05:10.410> goodness<00:05:10.680> but

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
this kid yup he's mad oh my goodness but

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.370 
this kid yup he's mad oh my goodness but
i<00:05:11.940> think<00:05:12.150> i<00:05:12.390> heard<00:05:12.600> him<00:05:12.720> if<00:05:12.840> i<00:05:12.930> remember<00:05:13.140> back

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
i think i heard him if i remember back

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.040 
i think i heard him if i remember back
to<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.800> game<00:05:14.610> i<00:05:14.640> most<00:05:15.300> likely<00:05:15.420> heard<00:05:15.930> him

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
to the game i most likely heard him

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.690 
to the game i most likely heard him
coming<00:05:16.230> behind<00:05:16.440> me<00:05:16.710> that's<00:05:17.430> why<00:05:17.580> I<00:05:17.610> turned

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
coming behind me that's why I turned

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.950 
coming behind me that's why I turned
around<00:05:17.970> cuz<00:05:18.270> otherwise<00:05:18.360> I'd<00:05:18.660> be<00:05:18.750> like<00:05:18.870> no

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
around cuz otherwise I'd be like no

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.030 
around cuz otherwise I'd be like no
reason<00:05:19.200> for<00:05:19.350> your<00:05:19.440> turn<00:05:19.590> around<00:05:19.800> right<00:05:19.860> there

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
reason for your turn around right there

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.380 
reason for your turn around right there
but<00:05:20.520> anyways<00:05:20.730> that's<00:05:20.940> pretty<00:05:21.090> much<00:05:21.150> wrapping

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
but anyways that's pretty much wrapping

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.550 
but anyways that's pretty much wrapping
up<00:05:21.570> with<00:05:21.660> a<00:05:21.690> game<00:05:21.840> plan<00:05:21.930> is<00:05:22.140> like<00:05:22.290> a<00:05:22.320> minute
