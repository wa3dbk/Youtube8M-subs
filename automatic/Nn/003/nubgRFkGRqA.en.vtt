subtly and also change tunings so the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.279 
subtly and also change tunings so the

the guitar and Roland took off one to
the<00:01:44.399> tone<00:01:44.610> knob<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.179> we<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.539> one<00:01:45.780> master

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
and this is the guitar model so if we

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.130 
and this is the guitar model so if we
listen<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.140> guitar<00:01:59.360> that's<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.720> real
