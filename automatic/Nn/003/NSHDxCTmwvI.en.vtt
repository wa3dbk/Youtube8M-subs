Windows<00:02:41.340> Phone<00:02:41.550> 8<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.990> mean<00:02:43.530> it's<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.070> little

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
Windows Phone 8 is I mean it's a little

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.550 
Windows Phone 8 is I mean it's a little
bit<00:02:44.400> behind<00:02:44.580> but<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:46.020> course<00:02:46.350> that's

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
bit behind but of course that's

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.410 
bit behind but of course that's
something<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.220> kind<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.730> should<00:02:48.000> expect

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
something that we kind of should expect

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.570 
something that we kind of should expect
with<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:50.690> lower-priced<00:02:51.690> phone<00:02:52.200> they're
