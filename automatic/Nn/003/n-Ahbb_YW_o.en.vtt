00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
the early 1960s this guy which I don't

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.480 
the early 1960s this guy which I don't
think<00:01:16.390> ever<00:01:16.690> had<00:01:17.050> a<00:01:17.080> proper<00:01:17.619> name<00:01:17.800> he<00:01:18.160> doesn't

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
think ever had a proper name he doesn't

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.340 
think ever had a proper name he doesn't
think<00:01:18.610> so<00:01:18.700> either<00:01:19.000> but<00:01:19.179> at<00:01:19.450> his<00:01:19.600> age<00:01:19.780> he<00:01:20.140> just

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
think so either but at his age he just

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.779 
think so either but at his age he just
might<00:01:20.530> not<00:01:20.710> remember<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.220> just<00:01:21.399> look<00:01:21.610> at<00:01:21.700> him

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
might not remember it just look at him

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.960 
might not remember it just look at him
this<00:01:22.479> guy<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:22.810> think<00:01:23.440> was<00:01:23.649> just<00:01:23.679> called<00:01:24.250> alien

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
this guy I think was just called alien

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.620 
this guy I think was just called alien
or<00:01:25.500> Martian<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.880> I<00:01:27.970> don't<00:01:28.030> think<00:01:28.210> he<00:01:28.420> had<00:01:28.600> a

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
or Martian and I don't think he had a

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.389 
or Martian and I don't think he had a
proper<00:01:29.020> name<00:01:29.140> well<00:01:29.500> it<00:01:29.740> could<00:01:29.890> be<00:01:30.009> argued<00:01:30.369> that

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
proper name well it could be argued that

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.940 
proper name well it could be argued that
alien<00:01:30.970> and<00:01:31.149> Martian<00:01:31.539> are<00:01:31.690> names<00:01:32.350> for<00:01:32.679> a<00:01:32.710> mask

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
alien and Martian are names for a mask

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.290 
alien and Martian are names for a mask
but<00:01:33.340> I<00:01:33.369> mean<00:01:33.550> I<00:01:33.580> don't<00:01:33.700> think<00:01:33.940> he<00:01:34.090> had<00:01:34.270> a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
but I mean I don't think he had a

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.690 
but I mean I don't think he had a
specific<00:01:35.259> character<00:01:35.619> name<00:01:35.800> like<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.579> know
