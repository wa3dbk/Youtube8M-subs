 vision skilled scheme and many others 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.920
 in short, there are 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.020
 each with different requirements I am 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.260
 here with this I arrived here to 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.820
 build something and then talk about 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.820
 build what is a home 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.360
 this country I must say that the 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.640
 the impression they are giving me up 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.840
 now he is happier in a certain 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.700
 meaning people smile that it is not one 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.850
 criticism towards Italy obviously not 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.740
 I'm going to go to Italy a shit no 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.710
 I'm not not here to tell this 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.900
 indeed I am here to say that it can be taken 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.610
 always something positive from that 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.170
 that the experience from what is the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.930
 travel and from what that too 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.369
 blog wants to tell you the fact that I 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.290
 I'm telling you about my experience 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.240
 personal I 'm explaining maybe 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.209
 technically something but they are all 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.370
 how many my personal experiences I am 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.989
 trying to share with you and 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.659
 rediscover a little this word of 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.730
 share those that are 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:23.480
 experiences that are experiences 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:26.489
 that is my round one let me know and 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.709
 so this is what I think 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.420
 it also means home means finding 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:37.080
 a point where I feel at home even though 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.120
 I am far from my real home a 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.900
 place like this gives me so much is me 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.670

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.230

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.400
 really many new people among 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.230
 the other a few days have passed 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.670
 or not as you see more hair 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.890
 They had the conversation face 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.519
 cut but still I have known many 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.200
 people of the Italian community here that 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.430
 they gave me so much they also gave me 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.049
 simply a word with which one 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.790
 word known in short a way to 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.280
 exchange opinions a way to 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.579
 giving yourself support and a way to share 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.890
 the experience that is here in australia 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.540
 so what is from the point of view 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.430
 emotional a little veil explained now 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.930
 let's move on to the technical side 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.389
 What am I doing on a bus'm 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.329
 simply by returning home from the place 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.220
 work from one of the workplaces 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.680

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.459

 my little house that she found 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.860
 together with thulium that everett is before or 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.870
 then as soon as I can catch him to do it 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.580
 a mini interview could be 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.400
 nice to do an interview with him and 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:01.489
 in short, to know him and here we are 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.120
 now let's go home 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.890
 here there is just right a christ 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.160
 taking the secondary route in reality 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.050
 because there is a main one but it is a 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.019
 bit longer but I'm taking the road 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.829
 secondary directly in my new 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.829

 incredible as you can see there and it is 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.270
 one of the reasons why I chose this 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.430
 home no joke but of course it is 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.280
