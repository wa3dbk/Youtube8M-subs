the<00:02:23.519> problem<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.940> course<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.360> whenever<00:02:24.630> I

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
the problem of course is that whenever I

the problem of course is that whenever I

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
want to look at my older pictures I'm

want to look at my older pictures I'm
going<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.459> have<00:02:26.549> to<00:02:26.640> locate<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.150> load<00:02:27.299> that

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
going to have to locate and load that

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.240 
going to have to locate and load that
older<00:02:27.720> library<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.799> if<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:28.950> want<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.160> keep

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
older library so if I want to keep

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.460 
older library so if I want to keep
everything<00:02:29.459> in<00:02:29.880> one<00:02:30.030> location<00:02:30.420> then<00:02:31.320> I'm

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
everything in one location then I'm

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.240 
everything in one location then I'm
going<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.650> need<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:31.890> start<00:02:32.070> working

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250

chronologically<00:04:50.650> like<00:04:50.979> that<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:51.460> find<00:04:52.360> this

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
chronologically like that I find this

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.360 
chronologically like that I find this
method<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.780> be<00:04:52.870> very<00:04:53.050> sensible<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.710> do<00:04:53.950> shoot<00:04:54.280> a

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
method to be very sensible I do shoot a

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.010 
method to be very sensible I do shoot a
lot<00:04:54.520> of<00:04:54.640> photos<00:04:54.970> so<00:04:55.150> this<00:04:55.450> helps<00:04:55.690> me<00:04:55.810> to<00:04:55.840> keep
