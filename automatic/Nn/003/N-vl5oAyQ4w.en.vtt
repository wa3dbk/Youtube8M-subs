00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 Hello friends with you Benders 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.390
 today i would like to tell you brom 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.970
 awesome mod that will add 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.490
 mycroft mascots yes yes those 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.860
 talismans which talismans many will ask 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.379
 the same talismans from the cartoon about jacks 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.690
 what about it was a cool cartoon 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.210
 honestly in childhood I almost waited 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.859
 every episode in general was cool and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.050
 let's see how these talismans 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.570
 Maykraft for those who are in the tank 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.099
 or just did not watch this cartoon 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.130
 mascot work as follows 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.230
 there are a few pool talismans in total 12 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.960
 days of tender and each symbolizes 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.120
 some animal bull sheep cow and so 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.120
 further and every talisman will give you 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.270
 certain superpowers and let's start 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.110
 perhaps in order by the way 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.559
 there are some superpowers here 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.690
 highly 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.670
 any description of them is in english but 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.890
 I will try to tell you in Russian 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.719
 how it works and let's see 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.300
 the first mascot who would like you 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.160
 show this talisman to the burg and when you 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.960
 Activate it by the way I will immediately say that 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.120
 most 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.150
 talismans don't work on creative 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.890
 mode that is sure to take place in 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.920
 normal mode and there you can them 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.409
 use the same I will say that I am all 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.600
 I will divide into two parts in the first part to you 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.520
 I will tell about almost all talismans 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.890
 from both in one I will not tell in the second 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.020
 parts will tell about mobs enemies and more 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.790
 all sorts of cool things that are in it 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.159
 fashion and so mascot bk 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.920
 if you activate it, it will give us strength 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.650
 To get power what power you can kill 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.900
 Two shots slime and defense meaning you 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.770
 become a very cool warrior with this 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.930
 mascot I do not remember which series but 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.729
 cartoon Jackie Chan with mascots he 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.189
 just like all these talismans were there 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.170
 look further on we have a mascot 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.210
 tiger and if you activate right 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.149
 click it will create your 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.040
 evil twin ode who has 20 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.720
 units of hearts and you can it in 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.149
 principle kill me this evil twin 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.280
 will be first flood in chat like 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.710
 see that is give everything flood and 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.390
 attack all sorts of monsters and you he will 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.870
 attack so let's hurry this 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.750
 quite 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.820
 in play and overwhelm him in a quick way from he 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.220
 frankly already starting to bother 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.250
 under the annoying shorter in general how 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.660
 only you kill him you fall out 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.220
 half half of this mascot 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.500
 the second half you will have after 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.300
 how do you activate this very talisman and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.130
 next with the help of these two halves and 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.960
 one diamond you can make again 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.300
 imagine such a talisman like this 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.400
 works further on next with us 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.590
 mascot if you take in hand will give you 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.480
 super super super speed like most 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.580
 this rabbit well that's what it is 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.640
 mascot bunny rabbit quibble us not 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.250
 you will be very fast cool talisman 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.260
 next we have the dragon mascot and honestly 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.150
 saying let's see what it gives 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.460
 if you right- click then 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.250
 the place where you are going to explode 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.840
 see and to be more precise then 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.640
 let's use a horse mascot 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.500
 because the horse mascot gives 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.630
 regeneration but more on that later 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.550
 here 's the dragon mascot lets you 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.590
 run and such small bombs 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.960
 which blow up and strictly speaking 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.030
 cause damage as you eat but weird 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.100
 why they do not break wood and break 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.050
 just land and be careful with these 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.470
 bombs i'll tell you and then neatly 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.209
 can 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.860
 sloppy myself somewhere and and 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.870
 zapulunut but nevertheless enough 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.670
 cool let 's quick from 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.530
 We are the horse mascot and how are you 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.870
 understood the horse mascot to this very 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.820
 good regeneration is generally very straight 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.459
 very fast and that's cool enough 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.830
 the following talisman we have the talisman of the media and 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.480
 while we hold it in hand we don't see and 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.880
 that is, we donâ€™t see at all by the way 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.040
 cool all talismans here pictures to me 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.320
 generally like the next talisman 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.310
 sheep mascot and he lets you 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.860
 pass through 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.440
 blocks and damn it mom 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.459
 allows but unfortunately besides that he 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.640
 imposes on you 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.739
 the effect of temptation which means that with 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.110
 this mascot you will get yourself 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.160
 damage done and it's sad enough 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.110
 I will tell you 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.120
 but in no case pass through the blocks and 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.250
 even practically fly opening and 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.739
 much can fly up to them mascot 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.630
 messing jump it is possible enough 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.480
 and in general it is enough riveting therefore 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.690
 better to have these two talismans mascot 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.610
 horse fleece poured 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.710
 and with this mascots came to someone and 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.200
 the territory is generally quite funny 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.360
 the next talisman will let you crawl 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.239
 on the walls like the real marches from 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.590
 monkey monkey yes general calm 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.750
 you can like any batman 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.340
 spiderman crawling on the walls and this 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.050
 audible cool we have three 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.810
 talisman let's watch what they can 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.910
 and so the first mascot who wanted 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.130
 show this pig talismans 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.660
 he will throw the will of people like that 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.220
 fireballs and not just people in general 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.090
 anywhere will run such 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.220
 comfortable balls 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.480
 it looks like a dragon mascot 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.190
 weaker to be honest 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.010
 let's look further also us 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.390
 talisman doctor mascot and he will 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.010
 give you the opportunity 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.500
 actually and what gives us 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.380
 let's see so this talisman 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.360
 will give you strength as I read and understand it 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.850
 will give you infinite power and you yourself with 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.890
 im very cool but odd somehow honest 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.600
 they say this is most likely not working 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.880
 the mascot does not work or I donâ€™t 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.400
 understood but the last talisman will allow 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.230
 you oh, damn it we are now very 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.510
 flew quickly because this talisman 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.820
 in theory gives you the opportunity to just 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.770
 a little bit like that guy, but if these 2 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.260
 3 cm she combine namely mascot 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.630
 rabbit and bird mascot then you will be able 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.580
 fly almost at the speed of light in 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.590
 in general friends here are talismans to find 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.250
 they can be chests dancing is me you 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.800
 just saying 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.660
 either buy merchants and proper 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.260
 saying talismans are all friends so 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.510
 let's go 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.760
 wait for the next part in the meantime, put 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.800
