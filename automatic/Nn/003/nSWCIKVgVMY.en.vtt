it here pretty well sometimes the light
reflects<00:00:54.429> off<00:00:54.579> there<00:00:54.879> let<00:00:55.510> me<00:00:55.539> get<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.809> little

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
reflects off there let me get a little

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.810 
reflects off there let me get a little
bit<00:00:56.260> closer<00:00:56.500> so<00:00:56.739> they<00:00:56.890> can<00:00:57.070> see<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:58.059> actual

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
bit closer so they can see the actual

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
translucent effect here you can really

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.320 
translucent effect here you can really
see<00:01:02.710> it<00:01:02.829> with<00:01:02.979> the<00:01:03.100> naked<00:01:03.280> eye<00:01:03.609> but<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.969> camera

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
see it with the naked eye but the camera

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.670 
see it with the naked eye but the camera
doesn't<00:01:04.509> always<00:01:04.750> pick<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.229> up

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
doesn't always pick it up

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.560 
doesn't always pick it up
check<00:01:06.009> out<00:01:06.190> that<00:01:06.250> piece<00:01:06.520> over<00:01:06.729> there<00:01:07.000> too<00:01:07.240> with

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
check out that piece over there too with

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.999 
check out that piece over there too with
all<00:01:07.899> that<00:01:08.229> texture<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:08.979> was<00:01:09.190> okay<00:01:10.799> which<00:01:11.799> one

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
all that texture that was okay which one

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.940 
all that texture that was okay which one
would<00:01:12.189> you<00:01:12.250> like<00:01:13.149> to<00:01:13.299> tell<00:01:13.509> us<00:01:13.539> about<00:01:13.810> this<00:01:14.770> is

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
would you like to tell us about this is

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.590 
would you like to tell us about this is
a<00:01:14.979> little<00:01:15.340> more<00:01:15.430> obvious<00:01:15.640> it's<00:01:16.210> a<00:01:16.360> good

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
a little more obvious it's a good

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.919 
a little more obvious it's a good
example<00:01:17.289> of<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.850> seeing<00:01:19.149> all<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.450> texture

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
example of really seeing all the texture

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.440 
example of really seeing all the texture
from<00:01:19.990> getting<00:01:20.440> close<00:01:20.740> here<00:01:21.039> and<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:25.090> wax

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
from getting close here and the the wax

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.719 
from getting close here and the the wax
enables<00:01:26.080> me<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.289> not<00:01:26.530> only<00:01:26.560> build<00:01:26.920> up<00:01:27.159> texture

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
enables me to not only build up texture

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.149 
enables me to not only build up texture
but<00:01:27.909> also<00:01:27.970> carve<00:01:28.509> into<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.080> work<00:01:29.259> ha<00:01:29.770> ha<00:01:29.979> I

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
but also carve into the work ha ha I

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.120 
but also carve into the work ha ha I
combined<00:01:30.610> it<00:01:30.759> with<00:01:30.789> oil<00:01:31.179> paint<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:32.130> other

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
mixed-media elements so this one wasn't

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.120
