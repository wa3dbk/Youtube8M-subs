00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello everyone welcome in this channel 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.580
 I am selling / not a new battle 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.860
 Pokemon of the sixth generation this time 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.959
 I'm loading a cargo team 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.670
 to a great goal which is forgotten in this 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.890
 generation but you also have to analyze 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.510
 what mission in the super powerful mega 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.210
 chahristani still defensive wise 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.890
 special to union with the expert the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.300
 this object that allow me to find the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.460
 opponent making him think that miguel 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.080
 you have your set you are not and now 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.820
 he can now surprise him by changing the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.469
 movement does not arrive that pokemon use 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.050
 how is character so I decided on 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.850
 the powerful edited this by ham that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.800
 Can copy any little instant 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.570
 monet opponent and with the cloth chosen by 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.769
 it turns out to be faster than the pokemon 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.480
 original which I have a great 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.070
 advantage also loading a fan of 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.769
 physical pension that removes rocks and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.019
 puts with his big movements is 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.289
 physical defense the opponent's team 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.850
 just say the rain charge a mouse was a 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.429
 an art chassis that probably means 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.559
 evolve to a viewer to a line tells a 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.359
 a club and a heel in front of a team 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.550
 that appears to be sunny but 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.920
 we are going to see that this one unfolds this 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.060
 battle I will start with my don juan ' 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.220
 which one 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.780
 it's pretty good since I predicted this 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.100
 full start and since it's the pokemon 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.229
 that you see most of the time as 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.759
 starter I know that I will put traits by 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.470
 that's that I'm going to go directly so 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.850
 which is an earthquake to leave it in a 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.490
 life range pretty low I leave it a 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.289
 11% I almost got this annoyance 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.310
 one stroke later we go to what it is 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.290
 Sunny day 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.240
 not then object will probably load the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.490
 rock that lengthens the shifts of the day 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.530
 sunny I went for it I'm going to go here so 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.970
 that the quick turn to remove their vats 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.950
 but it seems that the forces want them 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.170
 put was for the rocks because since 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.549
 I saw the team from the beginning that its 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.289
 team was really vulnerable what 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.299
 what is this class in you to marry 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.189
 lack of bats will affect you a lot 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.229
 mind files and also to talos lemos is 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.610
 why the rocks in the field of 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.649
 component are going to leave at the best of 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.360
 the positions so I had one time 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.039
 corrected quickly that the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.210
 last time I make this move 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.250
 if I 'm going to launch what are the 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.990
 I'm going to destroy it 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.630
 was because this pokemon impossible to 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.069
 prankster is almost almost impossible not to 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.869
 you can borrow the field with a class 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.549
 of post but he has already achieved a 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.440
 mud fortunately I got rid of this 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.150
 great annoyance fast so now that 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.530
 can they are going to throw their lives for that 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.610
 I ought to arm themselves against anything 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.440
 that little bit more so he's going to do a 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.440
 change to my toads which can 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.459
 make bleue find this pokemon 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.549
 because it is a tension set 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.319
 special but here they other 30 lives and 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.900
 will use what is the dust of the dream 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.239
 to fall asleep and the one that has slept 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.890
 this pokemon really is bad since the 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.780
 better control I had money 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.150
 I'm going to save, I'm going to change one 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.650
 will pull me off to copy that wine 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.390
 only proponent change in my shot his 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.040
 mouse stuff that is not so bad since if 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.590
 your route month a choice escarp then 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.300
 you could know it from this moment but 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.400
 here it reveals to me that it loads what the 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.350
 remains which leaves me sure that it is 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.730
 a mouse walkie already when I saw the move set 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.290
 as for the hits with the milestone I 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.120
 I convinced that it was a broken multi more than 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.459
 see by the bag change predicting that 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.630
 is in the mega use a volt change or 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.580
 any movement of electric type 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.870
 I'm going to change that friend since 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.819
 they absorb movements of type 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.010
 electric with your ball skill 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.750
 lapse I get the prediction right the 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.489
 voltio change me cures what got me down 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.410
 the barbs which gives me a good 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.820
 position and how do I know it's a multi mouse 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.170
 I know that a water pump is not going to add me 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.570
 so I'm going so the ray is for 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.100
 download a lot of life there is the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.930
 that I was going to go for what is the / pain 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.840
 knowing that I was going to use this movement 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.330
 and then recover life for the same time 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.920
 me down all the truth does not bother me 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.260
 too much is that I can keep pulling 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.510
 rays and try to weaken us take out the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.980
 19 percent of hp come back use again 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.019
 / pain if it had been me 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.400
 I would have only here, and I'm sure that if 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.450
 would have already had in that range of 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.580
 life even if it's a while 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.540
 each one in his plays equal with another 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.920
 I'm going to weaken the discomfort that 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.950
 it is the broken a bump also easily 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.080
 with a goal now has a strip to his bin 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.510
 ashur maybe thinking that I'm stuck 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.730
 of that ray movement thinking that 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.650
 maybe I do not have a sector or I do not like 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.510
 they also saw sound movements of 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.760
 ice cargo what the expert tape well 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.620
 which is to achieve a low amount 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.510
 really of life but reveals that it is a 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.250
 physical set of wines has long since 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.349
 I did not run into some really works 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.849
 very well since whiplash goes down a lot and you 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.049
 come to put earthquakes in the case of 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.750
 the gypsies also ours to a 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.130
 just blow I will throw to militarize what 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.840
 I'm going to use it with a slash to see I do not 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.400
 returns because if it gave me evolution 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.959
 I'm not going to invoke the sun and I'm going to 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.760
 increase to twice the speed of 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.130
 sevina on that would be that let it 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.870
 hit me for free so here I am going to 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.790
 say my revolutionary with the result 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.320
 a play because I want to take it with a 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.270
 movement type you can be sure that 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.740
 I 'm going to destroy it, besides not 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.600
 I was sure if being a charles bow 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.580
 of arsys jerk cheer so better 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.110
 I said let's revolutionize this way if 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.330
 defenses to mediate hoisting are higher 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.740
 than normal but still nissan 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.660
 get to resist it with a flare 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.400
 under ground in the range 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.530
 to be able to destroy a strip here 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.250
 socialize which is also going to 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.170
 evolve in its form and I will win 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.300
 the speed maybe they gave him the spigot 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.400
 and never help from that or maybe it's a 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.750
 set you are escarp but I'm not sure is 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.760
 so I'm going to throw a nest for 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.870
 secure me since with the milestone you can see 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.640
 the movements that the pokemon loads 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.920
 of the opponent when copying it and you realize 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.050
 from his set here I realized he was carrying 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.700
 obviously substitute for the facts like this 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.470
 that I am going to destroy with an air 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.810
 because milito is faster than it is 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.250
 realistic but alicia changes national is 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.840
 an agent I do not know why it was true 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.090
 rocks are in the field and with 96 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.830
 savage weakened I'm going to make you a 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.210
 good damage another cut see me and I would have 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.250
 been sufficient to weaken the 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.020
 minds but at 15 and meet I do not know 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.610
 why every battle that I have all will 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.470
 they put in the truth that's why they do not 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.880
 I've brought so many battles because everything 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.890
 surrender me I do not know if my teams are very 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.930
 good to me are my opponents are the 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.700
 losers but well everything is me 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.080
 they perform but well this was the robe 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.730
 I hope you liked many 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.960
