00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
so a second Manhattan terminal means

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.960 
so a second Manhattan terminal means
more<00:00:59.050> service<00:00:59.500> more<00:00:59.860> options<00:01:00.399> and<00:01:00.670> higher

more service more options and higher

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.389 
more service more options and higher
ridership<00:01:01.450> which<00:01:02.380> means<00:01:02.649> the<00:01:02.770> Li<00:01:02.980> double<00:01:03.250> arm

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
ridership which means the Li double arm

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.730 
ridership which means the Li double arm
must<00:01:03.700> purchase<00:01:04.000> additional<00:01:04.869> electric<00:01:05.379> trains

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740

which of course have to go somewhere

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.530 
which of course have to go somewhere
therefore<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.250> railroad<00:01:09.640> must<00:01:10.000> increase

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
therefore the railroad must increase

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.690 
therefore the railroad must increase
