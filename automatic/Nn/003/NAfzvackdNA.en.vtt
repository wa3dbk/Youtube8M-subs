first time a tournament like this has

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.880 
first time a tournament like this has
been<00:01:04.799> out<00:01:05.010> there<00:01:06.020> was<00:01:07.020> also<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.500> tournament

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890

like<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.640> while<00:01:09.030> ago<00:01:09.090> where<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
like this a while ago where the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
like this a while ago where the
requirements<00:01:10.560> are<00:01:10.650> basically<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> same<00:01:11.369> but

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
requirements are basically the same but

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.160

instead<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.180> whole<00:01:12.360> squad<00:01:12.689> had<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.080> be

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
instead your whole squad had to be

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.020 
instead your whole squad had to be
Spanish<00:01:13.530> league<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.670> wouldn't<00:01:14.939> surprise

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
Spanish league so it wouldn't surprise
