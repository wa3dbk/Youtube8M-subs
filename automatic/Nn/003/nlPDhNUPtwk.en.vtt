00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
fixed and I think that's one of the

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.180 
fixed and I think that's one of the
reasons<00:03:46.069> why<00:03:46.419> halo<00:03:47.419> 3<00:03:47.810> lasted<00:03:48.319> for<00:03:48.530> so<00:03:48.709> long<00:03:48.919> it

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
reasons why halo 3 lasted for so long it
