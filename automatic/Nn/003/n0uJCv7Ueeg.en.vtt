surfing<00:00:35.579> technique<00:00:36.000> what<00:00:36.780> I've<00:00:36.899> noticed<00:00:37.200> most

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
surfing technique what I've noticed most

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.799 
surfing technique what I've noticed most
was<00:00:37.890> Taylor's<00:00:38.280> paddling<00:00:39.059> technique<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
was Taylor's paddling technique in the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.630 
was Taylor's paddling technique in the
contest<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.500> over<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> years<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.250> Seaside

contest and over the years at Seaside
and<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.690> wanted<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.140> see<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.890> see<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and I wanted to see if you can see the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.540 
and I wanted to see if you can see the
same<00:00:44.399> things<00:00:44.730> than<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.539> now<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.950> two<00:00:47.309> main

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
same things than I do now the two main

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.819 
same things than I do now the two main
reasons<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.270> wanted<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> post<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.140> analysis

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
reasons I wanted to post this analysis

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.060 
reasons I wanted to post this analysis
are<00:00:50.039> one<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.940> help<00:00:51.120> wqs<00:00:51.930> surfers<00:00:52.410> especially

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
are one to help wqs surfers especially

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.029 
are one to help wqs surfers especially
younger<00:00:53.539> wqs<00:00:54.539> surfers<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:55.320> increasing

younger wqs surfers with increasing

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.860 
younger wqs surfers with increasing
their<00:00:56.219> stroke<00:00:56.489> efficiency<00:00:57.120> early<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.719> their

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
their stroke efficiency early in their

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.619 
their stroke efficiency early in their
careers<00:00:58.260> rather<00:00:58.980> than<00:00:59.219> later<00:00:59.430> when<00:01:00.180> fatigue

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
careers rather than later when fatigue

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.920 
careers rather than later when fatigue
comes<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.170> faster<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.090> to<00:01:03.090> help<00:01:03.660> more

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
comes on faster and to help more

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.509 
comes on faster and to help more
experienced<00:01:04.439> surfers<00:01:04.799> who<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.100> already<00:01:05.280> hit

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
experienced surfers who have already hit

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.060 
experienced surfers who have already hit
that<00:01:05.549> fatigue<00:01:06.119> level<00:01:06.540> help<00:01:07.140> them<00:01:07.350> surf<00:01:07.619> longer

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that fatigue level help them surf longer

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
that fatigue level help them surf longer
through<00:01:08.340> increased<00:01:08.880> efficiencies<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.990> their

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
through increased efficiencies in their

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.660 
through increased efficiencies in their
stroke<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.420> let's<00:01:12.600> take<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> quick<00:01:13.020> look<00:01:13.260> at

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
stroke so let's take a quick look at

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.429 
stroke so let's take a quick look at
first<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.880> side<00:01:15.119> by<00:01:15.299> side<00:01:15.330> view<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.990> Kelly<00:01:16.320> and

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.219 
yawning motion you see here watch
Taylor's<00:02:08.430> body<00:02:08.640> go<00:02:08.940> left<00:02:09.210> and<00:02:09.690> his<00:02:09.810> feet<00:02:10.080> go

Taylor's body go left and his feet go

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.110 
Taylor's body go left and his feet go
right<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.649> then<00:02:10.710> vice<00:02:11.160> versa<00:02:11.280> his<00:02:11.640> feet<00:02:11.910> go

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
right and then vice versa his feet go

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.740 
right and then vice versa his feet go

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
left and body goes right that's yelling

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.930 
left and body goes right that's yelling
that<00:02:15.990> side-to-side<00:02:16.500> motion<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.730> term

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
that side-to-side motion it's a term

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.450 
that side-to-side motion it's a term
that<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.180> referenced<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> other<00:02:18.990> video

another<00:02:38.990> when<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.020> saw<00:02:40.290> Taylor<00:02:40.620> out<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:40.890> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
another when I saw Taylor out in the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.500 
another when I saw Taylor out in the
lineup<00:02:41.100> at<00:02:41.340> Seaside<00:02:41.760> when<00:02:42.000> he<00:02:42.120> was<00:02:42.240> younger

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
lineup at Seaside when he was younger

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.900 
lineup at Seaside when he was younger
doing<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.290> just<00:02:43.950> thought<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.430> might<00:02:44.459> be<00:02:44.640> an

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
doing this I just thought it might be an

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.600 
doing this I just thought it might be an
age<00:02:45.090> thing<00:02:45.390> or<00:02:45.630> generational<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.560> thought<00:02:47.490> he

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
age thing or generational I thought he

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.330 
age thing or generational I thought he
might<00:02:47.790> grow<00:02:47.940> out<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.240> any<00:02:48.510> he<00:02:48.959> may<00:02:49.140> still<00:02:49.440> still

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
might grow out of any he may still still

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.940 
might grow out of any he may still still
grow<00:02:50.760> out<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.209> but<00:02:51.780> then<00:02:51.990> I<00:02:52.020> saw<00:02:52.380> John<00:02:52.709> John

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
grow out of it but then I saw John John

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.550 
grow out of it but then I saw John John
forms<00:02:53.340> who<00:02:53.490> granted<00:02:54.020> they<00:02:55.020> aren't<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.350> same

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
forms who granted they aren't the same

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.340 
forms who granted they aren't the same
age<00:02:55.740> but<00:02:56.010> fairly<00:02:56.250> close<00:02:56.690> take<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> look<00:02:57.989> at<00:02:58.110> John

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
age but fairly close take a look at John

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.640 
age but fairly close take a look at John
John's<00:02:58.650> technique<00:02:59.959> looks<00:03:00.959> similar<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.440> Kelley

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
John's technique looks similar to Kelley

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.910 
John's technique looks similar to Kelley
and<00:03:02.750> then<00:03:03.750> take<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.019> look<00:03:04.200> at<00:03:04.320> two<00:03:04.500> other<00:03:04.650> world

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
and then take a look at two other world

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.990 
and then take a look at two other world
champions<00:03:05.489> Mick<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.510> parco<00:03:07.700> both<00:03:08.700> with

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
champions Mick and parco both with

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.550 
champions Mick and parco both with
similar<00:03:09.390> technique<00:03:11.300> so<00:03:12.300> these<00:03:13.290> techniques

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
similar technique so these techniques

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.280 
similar technique so these techniques
can<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.160> fixed<00:03:14.489> it's<00:03:15.330> all<00:03:15.600> about<00:03:15.840> muscle

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
can be fixed it's all about muscle

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.640 
can be fixed it's all about muscle
memory

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
memory

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.740 
memory
Taylor's<00:03:17.280> muscle<00:03:17.640> memory<00:03:17.910> for<00:03:17.970> surfing<00:03:18.540> is

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
Taylor's muscle memory for surfing is

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.140 
Taylor's muscle memory for surfing is
absolutely<00:03:19.709> incredible<00:03:20.010> he's<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> great

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
absolutely incredible he's a great

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150 
absolutely incredible he's a great
surfer<00:03:21.600> but<00:03:22.140> his<00:03:22.230> paddling<00:03:22.620> technique<00:03:22.980> can

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
surfer but his paddling technique can

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.310 
surfer but his paddling technique can
certainly<00:03:23.790> improve<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.480> help<00:03:25.019> him<00:03:25.140> catch

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
certainly improve and help him catch

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.240 
certainly improve and help him catch
more<00:03:25.590> waves<00:03:26.480> more<00:03:27.480> efficiently<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:29.040> take<00:03:29.220> a

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
more waves more efficiently and take a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.479 
more waves more efficiently and take a
look<00:03:29.459> at<00:03:29.550> this<00:03:29.640> clip<00:03:29.940> from<00:03:30.830> those<00:03:31.830> heats<00:03:32.190> I

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
look at this clip from those heats I

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.070 
look at this clip from those heats I
noticed<00:03:32.970> if<00:03:33.120> Taylor<00:03:33.450> was<00:03:33.480> not<00:03:33.780> in<00:03:33.989> the

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
noticed if Taylor was not in the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.259 
noticed if Taylor was not in the
absolute<00:03:34.769> best<00:03:35.190> position<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.820> catch<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.120> wave

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
absolute best position to catch a wave

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.630 
absolute best position to catch a wave
he<00:03:36.600> struggled<00:03:37.080> a<00:03:37.170> little<00:03:37.290> bit<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:38.310> can<00:03:38.459> see

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
he struggled a little bit you can see

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.970 
he struggled a little bit you can see
her<00:03:38.700> see<00:03:39.060> here<00:03:39.300> he<00:03:39.450> bogged<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.989> little<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.410> take

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
her see here he bogged a little a take

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.100 
her see here he bogged a little a take
off<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.370> needs<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.610> work<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:42.090> bit<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.420> get<00:03:42.660> into

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
off and needs to work a bit to get into

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.170 
off and needs to work a bit to get into
the<00:03:43.200> wave<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.709> didn't<00:03:44.580> see<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:44.760> with<00:03:45.030> his

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
the wave I didn't see that with his

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.680 
the wave I didn't see that with his
other<00:03:45.300> competitors<00:03:45.959> in<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.260> same<00:03:46.560> heat<00:03:46.890> that

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
other competitors in the same heat that

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.370 
other competitors in the same heat that
may<00:03:48.690> be<00:03:48.750> due<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:50.130> paddling<00:03:50.489> stroke<00:03:51.380> when

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
may be due to the paddling stroke when

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.130 
may be due to the paddling stroke when
paddling<00:03:52.950> into<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.280> wave<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:54.570> increase<00:03:54.959> your

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
paddling into a wave you increase your

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.100 
paddling into a wave you increase your
stroke<00:03:55.380> rate<00:03:55.620> goes<00:03:56.340> faster<00:03:56.790> but<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.840> use<00:03:58.080> the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
stroke rate goes faster but you use the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.990 
stroke rate goes faster but you use the
same<00:03:58.290> techniques<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.519> would<00:03:59.730> for

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
same techniques that you would for

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.780 
same techniques that you would for
regular<00:04:00.420> paddling<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:02.010> when<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.459> get<00:04:02.670> it

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
regular paddling so when you get it

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.240 
regular paddling so when you get it
right<00:04:03.030> during<00:04:03.270> regular<00:04:03.569> strokes<00:04:04.250> regular

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
right during regular strokes regular

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.340 
right during regular strokes regular
paddling<00:04:05.730> you'll<00:04:06.030> get<00:04:06.240> it<00:04:06.330> right<00:04:06.510> when<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.900> in

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
paddling you'll get it right when you in

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.810
