februari<00:02:20.290> up<00:02:20.560> 2002<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.610> mean<00:02:21.760> what<00:02:21.940> if<00:02:22.030> those

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
februari up 2002 I mean what if those

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.630 
februari up 2002 I mean what if those
guys<00:02:22.390> were<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.410> Alliance<00:02:23.770> storyline<00:02:24.400> I

match<00:02:29.770> at<00:02:30.070> Survivor<00:02:30.370> Series<00:02:31.500> would<00:02:32.500> have<00:02:32.590> made

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710
