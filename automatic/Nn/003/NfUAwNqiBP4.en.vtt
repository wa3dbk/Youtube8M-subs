00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
tabs next to it maybe you'll have a

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.740 
tabs next to it maybe you'll have a

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
days you go back and forth so maybe you

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.459 
days you go back and forth so maybe you
had<00:05:31.550> an<00:05:31.669> online<00:05:32.000> calendar<00:05:32.330> to<00:05:32.930> keep<00:05:33.110> track<00:05:33.409> of
