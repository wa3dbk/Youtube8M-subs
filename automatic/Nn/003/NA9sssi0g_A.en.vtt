description below in this video I will
show<00:00:19.869> you<00:00:19.900> how<00:00:20.349> they<00:00:20.560> work<00:00:20.830> and<00:00:21.070> what<00:00:21.820> you<00:00:22.000> can

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
show you how they work and what you can

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.509 
show you how they work and what you can
use<00:00:22.300> them<00:00:22.510> for<00:00:22.560> okay<00:00:23.560> first<00:00:24.070> I'll<00:00:24.310> show<00:00:24.340> you

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
use them for okay first I'll show you

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.349 
use them for okay first I'll show you
how<00:00:24.760> they<00:00:24.939> work<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:27.070> cannot<00:00:27.310> push<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:27.730> button

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
how they work we cannot push the button

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.990 
how they work we cannot push the button
because<00:00:28.869> it's<00:00:29.199> locked<00:00:29.500> this<00:00:30.009> bar<00:00:30.730> right<00:00:30.939> here

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
because it's locked this bar right here

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.840 
because it's locked this bar right here
has<00:00:31.570> to<00:00:31.779> be<00:00:31.810> flipped<00:00:32.200> up<00:00:32.349> before<00:00:33.010> we<00:00:33.460> can<00:00:33.610> push

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
has to be flipped up before we can push

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.720 
has to be flipped up before we can push
and<00:00:34.149> we<00:00:34.780> need<00:00:34.930> a<00:00:35.020> coin<00:00:35.320> for<00:00:35.590> that<00:00:35.770> in<00:00:36.309> this<00:00:36.489> case

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
and we need a coin for that in this case

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.690 
and we need a coin for that in this case
we<00:00:36.969> need<00:00:37.090> a<00:00:37.149> nickel<00:00:37.540> so<00:00:37.989> what<00:00:38.800> a<00:00:38.829> nickel<00:00:39.160> falls

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
we need a nickel so what a nickel falls

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.380 
we need a nickel so what a nickel falls
in<00:00:39.879> here<00:00:40.289> the<00:00:41.289> bar<00:00:41.500> goes<00:00:41.800> up<00:00:41.829> which<00:00:42.520> allows<00:00:43.120> us

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
in here the bar goes up which allows us

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.850 
in here the bar goes up which allows us
to<00:00:43.539> push<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:46.000> nickel<00:00:46.360> drops<00:00:46.719> down<00:00:46.930> and<00:00:47.199> a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
to push the nickel drops down and a

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.299 
to push the nickel drops down and a
couple<00:00:48.570> drops<00:00:49.570> into<00:00:49.809> this<00:00:50.110> holder<00:00:50.500> then<00:00:51.100> you

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
couple drops into this holder then you

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:58.259 
couple drops into this holder then you
pull<00:00:51.579> the<00:00:51.789> button<00:00:52.090> back<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:57.129> gum<00:00:57.460> ball<00:00:57.640> drops

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
pull the button back the gum ball drops

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.410 
pull the button back the gum ball drops
down<00:00:58.480> and<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:59.379> bar<00:00:59.739> locks<00:01:00.579> again<00:01:00.820> this

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
down and the bar locks again this

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.750 
down and the bar locks again this
mechanism<00:01:01.899> also<00:01:02.410> features<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.250> coin

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
mechanism also features a coin

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.270 
mechanism also features a coin
projection<00:01:04.420> which<00:01:05.110> means<00:01:05.440> it<00:01:05.650> only<00:01:05.770> accepts

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
projection which means it only accepts

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.460 
projection which means it only accepts
linkle's<00:01:06.910> but<00:01:07.300> rejects<00:01:07.810> dimes<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:08.410> pennies

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
linkle's but rejects dimes and pennies

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.050 
linkle's but rejects dimes and pennies
so<00:01:09.280> I'll<00:01:09.550> just<00:01:09.790> add<00:01:10.000> this<00:01:10.410> part<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.520> you<00:01:12.550> can

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
so I'll just add this part so you can

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.840 
so I'll just add this part so you can
see<00:01:13.410> how<00:01:14.410> it<00:01:14.590> works<00:01:14.770> in<00:01:15.130> action<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:18.070> when<00:01:18.820> a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
see how it works in action so when a

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.670 
see how it works in action so when a
penny<00:01:19.600> goes<00:01:19.900> in<00:01:21.690> it<00:01:22.690> goes<00:01:22.750> directly<00:01:23.140> free

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
penny goes in it goes directly free

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.470 
penny goes in it goes directly free
however<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.760> nickel<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:27.250> stuck<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:28.240> cool

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
however a nickel get stuck the cool

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.690 
however a nickel get stuck the cool
thing<00:01:28.660> about<00:01:28.690> these<00:01:29.170> two<00:01:29.470> parts<00:01:30.010> is<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:30.310> you

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
thing about these two parts is that you

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.240 
thing about these two parts is that you
can<00:01:30.820> fit<00:01:31.120> up<00:01:31.150> into<00:01:31.420> almost<00:01:32.070> anything

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
can fit up into almost anything

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.890 
can fit up into almost anything
for<00:01:33.520> example<00:01:33.970> a<00:01:34.230> 10<00:01:35.230> by<00:01:35.410> 8<00:01:35.920> studs<00:01:36.900> baseplate

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
for example a 10 by 8 studs baseplate

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.200 
for example a 10 by 8 studs baseplate
you<00:01:38.170> can't<00:01:38.440> just<00:01:38.650> place<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.100> surface<00:01:39.850> right

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
you can't just place the surface right

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.930 
you can't just place the surface right
on<00:01:40.360> top<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.960> base<00:01:41.410> plate<00:01:41.590> we<00:01:42.520> need<00:01:42.670> some

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
on top of the base plate we need some

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.730 
on top of the base plate we need some
bricks<00:01:43.420> of<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.840> leaf<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.140> need<00:01:44.290> two<00:01:44.500> layers

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
bricks of the leaf you need two layers

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.120 
bricks of the leaf you need two layers
of<00:01:45.160> basic<00:01:46.090> bricks<00:01:46.330> don't<00:01:46.990> fill<00:01:47.470> this<00:01:47.680> part<00:01:47.980> up

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
of basic bricks don't fill this part up

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.040 
of basic bricks don't fill this part up
because<00:01:48.550> you're<00:01:48.880> going<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.210> need<00:01:49.420> this<00:01:49.690> space

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
because you're going to need this space

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.560 
because you're going to need this space
for<00:01:50.500> coin<00:01:51.100> tree<00:01:51.430> it's<00:01:51.700> like<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.030> place<00:01:52.330> where

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
for coin tree it's like a place where

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.780 
for coin tree it's like a place where
your<00:01:52.690> take<00:01:52.900> out<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.260> coins<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:54.280> when<00:01:54.640> you're

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
your take out the coins so when you're

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.140 
your take out the coins so when you're
done<00:01:55.030> place<00:01:55.720> it

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.780 

there<00:02:01.150> we<00:02:01.270> go<00:02:01.450> maybe<00:02:02.049> add<00:02:02.439> a<00:02:02.470> few<00:02:03.189> ramps<00:02:04.290> and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
there we go maybe add a few ramps and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.570 
there we go maybe add a few ramps and
then<00:02:06.790> start<00:02:07.360> building<00:02:07.690> up<00:02:08.100> some<00:02:09.100> layers<00:02:09.399> of

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
then start building up some layers of

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.479 
then start building up some layers of
bricks<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.780> course<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.739> need<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:11.920> make<00:02:12.069> a<00:02:12.220> hole

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
bricks of course you need to make a hole

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.820 
bricks of course you need to make a hole
here<00:02:12.850> for<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.239> candy<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.959> whole<00:02:14.140> ear<00:02:14.500> for<00:02:14.800> the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
here for the candy the whole ear for the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.190 
here for the candy the whole ear for the
button<00:02:15.190> hole<00:02:15.370> here<00:02:15.730> for<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.030> coin<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.600> a<00:02:17.020> hole

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
button hole here for the coin and a hole

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.680 
button hole here for the coin and a hole
