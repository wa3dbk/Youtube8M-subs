00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.950
 for those who population 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.710
 we are with you 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.019
 at the construction site 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.169
 on construction 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.269
 apartment house 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:14.409
 and as a person 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:17.419
 now we are with you 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:19.769
 observed ceiling binder 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.140
 i am 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.140
 about 150 meters above sea level 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:29.939
 we are with you 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.000
 and made the installation of beams 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.020
 after we visited 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.020
 frame racks main 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.810
 laid them floor beams 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.630
 tightened on 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.770
 two heels 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.390
 twelfth 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.100
 he will chat eyebrows 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.540
 washers 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.690
 so I will 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.450
 reliable 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.450
 and 153rd language 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.200
 this piece is the amount of overlap points 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.730
 the second 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.010
 between themselves 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.450
 we have a ceiling overlap 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.230
 top shelves lying on 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.900
 basically the frame and the lower binder they have 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.670
 us 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 here is the result 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.610
 which allows us 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.610
 what to do 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.550
 where are the constructions 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.600
 from golkin mousse will be on each node 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.330
 intersection 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.120
 padva seven drilled in Russian 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120
 screwed bukhari 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.300
 interferes 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.300
 at each intersection 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.480
 That's the way we got monolithic 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.640
 construction 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.950
 which we have 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.240
 unites 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.880
 independence 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 so let's say span upper and lower 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.389
 we get 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.389
 one common firm 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.779
 With regards to the floor beams clear 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:20.569
 With regards to the ceiling 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.569
 Vyuhin hanging chandelier Chizhevskogo 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:26.909
 made 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.539
 the same 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:29.999
 the board 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:31.349
 how are we used on 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.509
 frame 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:35.080
 and why are they ceiling 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.659
 using at the same time 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.009
 scenes 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:40.869
 people showed themselves very well 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.039
 which already 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:44.319
 demonstrated 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.929
 photo constructively 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:48.269
 fit 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.779
 boards 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.429
 motogp festival is very simple 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.389
 actually girder beams 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.219
 bcc sip very well 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.829
 on one side they tap with 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:00.729
 the side 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:02.629
 us in the direction 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.279
 elephants 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:06.439
 array 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.079
 win demand lie 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.559
 so screws on the other hand 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.069
 did the same with the mallet all this 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.379
 losses actually what is boston out 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.219
 so we get them 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.049
 very good 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.749
 so let's say as a food 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:22.629
 the readings 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.629
 from the ceiling 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.959
 the ceiling of her work is monolith 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.249
 very good 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:31.669
 the fact that he is registered 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.069
 happening 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.309
 strip of screws and very aesthetically pleasing 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.529
 well it turns out 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.139
 is that fronted ceiling 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.489
 here, too, in principle, the question is less 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.569
 yasin for many 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.779
 the ceiling came up 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:50.779
 sections installation of the stove that brought 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:53.309
 baby 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.449
 brewed 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:57.929
 big so 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:58.850
 pinchuk st 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.229
 and begin 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:02.489
 everywhere pipe mounting 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.229
 exactly what to heat buildings 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.689
 so we have a good one here 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.309
 plus so you can dry if 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:11.899
 he then put further walls 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:13.489
 foam torture then the loss was 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.059
 are minimal 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:16.789
 made racks kidon audition 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.099
 flies because we have one item left 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.599
 now top priority 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.620
 because music is already late 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.099
 per month 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.099
 for victory 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.870
 principle 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.070
 With regards to the construction stages 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.229
 which occurred 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.129
 more or less 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.129
 we have prepared 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.809
 from here they put the nbu should dry up 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:49.809
 and producers act 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.199
 he himself was Sergei from the city of Tomsk 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:01.759
 yet 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.409
 it's not 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.199
 talking about pe 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.800
 I liked it very well 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.680
 rigidity 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.789
 boldina turned out 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.249
 so at designers 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:17.249
 would stand 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.000
 meeting additional 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.480
 break through the site govindom 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.699
 canaryikin 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.710
 use for fastening 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.639
 20 m with hfs 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.279
 everything is the very table 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.279
 thousands of articles of cartoons 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.199
 but made watering 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.689
 decorating the garden 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.460
 Of course it would be good to help 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.860
 goodbye
