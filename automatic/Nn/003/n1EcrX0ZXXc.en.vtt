00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.749 
now spinach you know spinach kale celery
very<00:02:01.659> alkaline<00:02:02.140> of<00:02:02.619> high<00:02:03.159> levels<00:02:03.460> of<00:02:03.550> minerals

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
very alkaline of high levels of minerals

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.380 
very alkaline of high levels of minerals
magnesium<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:05.020> calcium<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.149> I<00:02:07.179> just

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
magnesium and calcium I think and I just

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.979 
magnesium and calcium I think and I just
think<00:02:07.569> you<00:02:09.149> don't<00:02:10.149> get<00:02:10.299> much<00:02:10.450> juice<00:02:10.750> out<00:02:10.959> of

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
think you don't get much juice out of

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.170 
think you don't get much juice out of
this<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.440> that's<00:02:11.709> kind<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.069> what<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.090> me

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
this and that's kind of what to me

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.949 
this and that's kind of what to me
about<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.390> juicer<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.080> all<00:02:14.230> Jews<00:02:14.920> fiber

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
about a juicer is that all Jews fiber

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.300 
about a juicer is that all Jews fiber
it's<00:02:16.959> not<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.140> good<00:02:17.319> ratio<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.920> like<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.190> put

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
it's not a good ratio so I like to put

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.340 
it's not a good ratio so I like to put
the<00:02:18.519> fiber<00:02:18.760> back<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.209> my<00:02:19.299> smoothies

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
the fiber back in my smoothies

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.130 
the fiber back in my smoothies
just<00:02:20.799> shove<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.040> in

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
just shove it in

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.870 
just shove it in
the<00:02:22.560> first<00:02:22.770> time<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.980> use<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> juicer<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.670> kind

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
the first time I use the juicer I kind

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.400 
the first time I use the juicer I kind
of<00:02:23.940> jammed<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.360> up<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:24.630> some<00:02:24.780> feminine<00:02:25.110> skin

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
of jammed it up with some feminine skin

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.140 
of jammed it up with some feminine skin
you're<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:26.430> gonna<00:02:26.520> be<00:02:26.670> careful<00:02:26.910> bit<00:02:27.300> by<00:02:27.420> bit

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
you're just gonna be careful bit by bit

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.910 
you're just gonna be careful bit by bit
there's<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> big<00:02:30.360> handful<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.870> spinach<00:02:31.200> big

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
there's a big handful of spinach big

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.870 
there's a big handful of spinach big
handful<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.340> kale<00:02:33.920> look<00:02:34.920> i<00:02:35.010> dark<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.460> juices

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
handful of kale look i dark the juices

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.180 
handful of kale look i dark the juices
so<00:02:36.510> that's<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.840> chlorophyll<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.710> liquid

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
so that's that chlorophyll the liquid

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.900 
so that's that chlorophyll the liquid
sunlight<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:39.530> fuel<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.650> winning<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.790> our

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910

bodies<00:02:42.180> look<00:02:42.390> at<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.570> is<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.930> fiber<00:02:43.200> again

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
bodies look at this is the fiber again

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.010 
bodies look at this is the fiber again
right<00:02:44.550> looks<00:02:44.940> amazing<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.690> little<00:02:45.930> bit

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.840 
right looks amazing it's a little bit
squishy<00:02:46.320> but<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.770> not<00:02:47.130> much<00:02:47.220> juice<00:02:47.550> comes<00:02:47.790> out

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
squishy but you not much juice comes out

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.850 
squishy but you not much juice comes out
of<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:50.450> that's<00:02:51.450> all<00:02:51.540> right<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:51.930> kale<00:02:52.080> some

of that that's all right just kale some
celery<00:02:53.510> chuck<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.630> puppy<00:02:54.960> in<00:02:55.050> there

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
celery chuck this puppy in there

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.280 
celery chuck this puppy in there
leaves<00:02:56.670> everything<00:02:57.090> sometimes<00:02:57.750> what<00:02:58.050> I'll<00:02:58.140> do

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
leaves everything sometimes what I'll do

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.710 
leaves everything sometimes what I'll do
is<00:02:58.380> I'll<00:02:58.500> leave<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.800> leaves<00:02:59.010> off<00:02:59.600> take<00:03:00.600> all

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
is I'll leave the leaves off take all

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.690 
is I'll leave the leaves off take all
these<00:03:00.810> leaves<00:03:01.020> out<00:03:01.200> put<00:03:01.830> them<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.130> my

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
these leaves out put them in my

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.070 
these leaves out put them in my
smoothies<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.570> there's<00:03:03.720> actually<00:03:03.959> more

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
smoothies so there's actually more

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.400 
smoothies so there's actually more
nutrition<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:05.430> leaves<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:05.910> stalks

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
nutrition in the leaves and the stalks

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.830 
nutrition in the leaves and the stalks
because<00:03:07.410> for<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.800> Stork<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.400> grow<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.630> Sun

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
because for the Stork to grow the Sun

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.810 
because for the Stork to grow the Sun
comes<00:03:10.110> down<00:03:10.200> makes<00:03:11.070> all<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.280> nutrition<00:03:11.730> in

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
comes down makes all the nutrition in

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.430 
comes down makes all the nutrition in
the<00:03:11.910> leaves<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.450> then<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.810> filters<00:03:13.140> its<00:03:13.260> way

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
the leaves and then it filters its way

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.860 
the leaves and then it filters its way
down<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:14.580> bottom<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.970> celery<00:03:15.270> so

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
down to the bottom of the celery so

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.240 
down to the bottom of the celery so
there's<00:03:16.080> more<00:03:16.200> concentration<00:03:16.830> of<00:03:17.040> all<00:03:17.160> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
there's more concentration of all the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.230 
there's more concentration of all the
good<00:03:17.400> stuff<00:03:17.610> in<00:03:17.730> here<00:03:17.760> that's<00:03:18.030> where<00:03:18.150> you

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
good stuff in here that's where you

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.420 
good stuff in here that's where you
notice<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.570> these<00:03:18.720> are<00:03:18.870> quite<00:03:19.020> bitter<00:03:19.430> but

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
notice that these are quite bitter but

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.290 
notice that these are quite bitter but
the<00:03:20.520> leaves<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.770> celery<00:03:22.770> or<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.850> be<00:03:24.000> true
