way<00:00:49.890> i<00:00:50.250> am<00:00:50.820> doing<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.899> style<00:00:52.199> before<00:00:52.440> I

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
way i am doing this style before I

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.650 
way i am doing this style before I
wasn't<00:00:53.100> using<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> hair<00:00:53.670> tie<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.390> putting

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
wasn't using a hair tie was just putting

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
wasn't using a hair tie was just putting
a<00:00:54.899> bunt<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.920> then<00:00:56.100> putting<00:00:57.199> bobby<00:00:58.199> pins<00:00:58.500> in

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
a bunt and then putting bobby pins in

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.830 
a bunt and then putting bobby pins in
but<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.039> doesn't<00:00:59.309> help<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.600> tie

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
but that doesn't help I think if I tie

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.380 
but that doesn't help I think if I tie
it<00:01:00.899> off<00:01:01.170> first<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> high<00:01:02.579> ponytail<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.270> then

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it off first as a high ponytail and then

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.260 
it off first as a high ponytail and then
tease<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.830> ponytail<00:01:05.000> then<00:01:06.000> wrap<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
tease it in a ponytail then wrap it

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.940 
tease it in a ponytail then wrap it
around<00:01:06.510> then<00:01:07.140> that's<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.680> look<00:01:07.770> better

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
around then that's going to look better

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.929 
around then that's going to look better
so<00:01:08.400> hence<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> second<00:01:11.310> go<00:01:11.729> at

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.490 
it's a lot easier in the first way I was
doing<00:02:28.550> here<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:29.390> now<00:02:30.050> that<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.290> have<00:02:30.320> your

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
doing here so now that you have your

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.470 
doing here so now that you have your
hair<00:02:30.740> in<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.860> ponytail<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:32.150> go<00:02:32.270> ahead<00:02:32.360> and

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
hair in a ponytail just go ahead and

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.350 
hair in a ponytail just go ahead and
tease<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.680> if<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:34.490> have<00:02:34.670> thin<00:02:34.940> hair<00:02:34.970> like

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
tease it and if you have thin hair like

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:56.970 
tease it and if you have thin hair like
me<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.690> may<00:02:35.900> have<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.260> use<00:02:36.290> hairspray<00:02:36.680> just
