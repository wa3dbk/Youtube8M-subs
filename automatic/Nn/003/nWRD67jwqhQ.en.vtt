and if you live in japan um you could

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.020 
and if you live in japan um you could
get<00:05:13.650> this<00:05:13.830> explored<00:05:14.280> it's<00:05:14.460> pretty<00:05:14.850> expensive

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
get this explored it's pretty expensive

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.740 
get this explored it's pretty expensive
like<00:05:15.690> four<00:05:16.080> thousand<00:05:16.650> seven<00:05:16.950> hundred<00:05:16.980> yen<00:05:17.750> but

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
like four thousand seven hundred yen but

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.080 
like four thousand seven hundred yen but
it's<00:05:19.050> a<00:05:19.140> good<00:05:19.260> exploit<00:05:19.680> it<00:05:19.950> has<00:05:20.400> very<00:05:21.000> high

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
it's a good exploit it has very high
