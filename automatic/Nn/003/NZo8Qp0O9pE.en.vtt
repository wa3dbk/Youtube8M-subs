 Yes 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.320
 yes earlier 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.320
 but 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.300
 Yes 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.660
 Yes 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.660
 yes earlier 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.439
 continue with you to learn the songs of the group 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.750
 metallica master of puppets 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.970
 this is the fourth part and here i will show you 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.649
 no longer entry joining we 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.409
 sorted out with you in the first three parts 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:26.159
 my videos here we 'll figure out how 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:34.369
 play the verse so let's continue it 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:37.679
 quarter we will use 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.560
 quint slide here this is when we do 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.209
 slide application needs and immediately coventry 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.420
 Well, roughly speaking there will be two two notes 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:50.220
 stories we will need to confuse that is 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.080
 go and go boston already going two 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.350
 strings and that is leaves two fingers and 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.509
 perezzhat them closer you pressed 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.140
 fingers go urge 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:07.640
 so we start with 6 strings and we first 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.500
 drown staccato press and stand 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.840
 we will need to play here not 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.230
 ultra low up down down up down 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:24.870
 there are supporters means equally stroke 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:27.390
 I think it is better to take alternately 5 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:34.170
 so we will read once more how much 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.940
 beats one two three four five times means four 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.280
 times in a row outdoor gas street by 2 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.180
 strike and at the end of you and on the water and so on 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.239
 times down up down up down up 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.370
 way down 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.030
 it turned out 9 blows on the muffled 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.030
 sixth string 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.950
 further 1 3 to 6 string 3 frets 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.650
 we pinch point fingers sixth on 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.890
 the third and fifth strings will live on the fifth 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:11.130
 so it turned out quick met 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.130
 dive down and video on 5 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:20.620
 One mind hit and to Windows met from 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:24.040
 6 strings and gave and met up to 5 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:30.129
 the valley will need to play queen and already 6 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:34.030
 to the sixth string and here it is to send 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:38.340
 do so let's first we played 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.950
 view from 3 waters and made a slide on 5 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.319
 sliders when we are not dropping the strings 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.920
 hold them we clamp make an effort and in 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.670
 same time we go on the strings to the right to 5 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.670
 one more time 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.019
 Further 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.430
 6 we will play 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:08.609
 stress then you do slide 6 lada 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.609
 club on 5 God forbid luxury 3 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.849
 need to hit her 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.660
 and again lead slides to 5 okay here 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.729
 you can hit 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.199
 so I offer you two options you 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:35.350
 can remove on 3 fret 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:38.169
 Now tell me again beginning, I think there 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:42.230
 no strike on the version so once more we 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.210
 hit fifth on the sixth string with 3 frets 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.350
 pirelli hands and got it I am ready 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.690
 frets motor 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.680
 we take to the screw clamping already on the sixth fret 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.300
 on the sixth string 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:56.170
 hitting the slides we carry up to the 5th fret then 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:04.540
 video from 5 3 and met we carry again on 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:04.540
 one more time and so 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.890
 all together play matrix times 2 200 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.580
 this will be sarah part ends at 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:40.400
 We have such quints with a slide 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:43.009
 met on 5 and continue again from the beginning 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:06:15.680
 that is, we have this part divided by 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:06:17.539
 two halves and second half chorus 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.729
 it will already be with us all the same 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:21.729
 only there will be other fruits 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:53.849
 wait for tarologist with a grin 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:53.849
 the sixth string 2 to 6 we clamp pressed 

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:03.279
 from 5 to 7 

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:06.129
 read will be exactly the same touches 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:21.509
 just the same frets will be others begin 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:21.509
 already for 2 to 6 salts and he became 

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:41.110
 so remember how we all mean 

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:43.479
 divided by parts remember the rhythm 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.219
 you will succeed if you like 

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:49.889
 Like it was the fourth part 

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:49.889
 songs of metallica master of puppets
