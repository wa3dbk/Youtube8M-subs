00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.950
 currently costs us 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.590
 naturally like 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.830
 No 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.000
 Jaffe 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.000
 one thing stands 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.750
 st 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.559
 dinslaken 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.470
 as a traffic policeman 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:42.260
 what is a break 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.260
 cover 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
 the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.649
 I am 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.360
 singles 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.360
 only one 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.920
 I can 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.130
 So it really is that way you have to 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.170
 Do not put yourself in a position 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.700
 have given outside and know that 90 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:51.049
 percent of people the songs better 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.399
 sing when I had myself down 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.799
 The feeling is now such a 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.990
 There are lots of sports out there 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.460
 who just my mouth open and shut 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.909
 have and then think that comes with it 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.560
 by 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.390
 and I think we have the here today 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.819
 time to settle what 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.560
 actually behind it is when people in 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.660
 Call the first row passionately 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.380
 I have a boy completely neutral here 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.760
 I saw a pretty cool shirt 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.230
 I think that's just beautiful 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.980
 do not know exactly what it says but 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.140
 I think that speaks also a sensitive 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.540
 artist that anyway can only be one 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.390
 quite sensitive man achieves the text 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.190
 is and if you are worse the question 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.569
 is he is from Minden is from Bielefeld 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:37.480
 somehow maybe I found out about it 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:40.350
 you hold another, I would have been here 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:46.890
 that starts well 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:55.230
 what is your tango list from here and there 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:57.180
 You are not not follow the appliance 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.310
 only forbidden but over the second 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.840
 catastrophe if you do not you do you will 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.650
 tarred and sprung and out of town 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.650
 thrown okay 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.099
 when people are welding things 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.349
 hides behind the tripod we 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.150
 Just lose it so I'll get it 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.470
 the mission service the shit to the end 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.530
 the audience does not arrive ok 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.530
 sweaty hands 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.909
 approximately 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.620
 the action 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.010
 small 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.669
 Yes 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.880
 on 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.080
