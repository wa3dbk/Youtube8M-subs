00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.759 
fibers nice and even just like that and
I<00:03:15.280> place<00:03:15.609> it<00:03:15.640> on<00:03:16.060> top<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.660> fly<00:03:16.900> well<00:03:17.410> just

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
I place it on top of the fly well just

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.560 
I place it on top of the fly well just
about<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.609> length<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:18.970> fly<00:03:19.180> may<00:03:19.420> be<00:03:19.480> a

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
about the length of the fly may be a

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.890 
about the length of the fly may be a
hair<00:03:19.930> longer<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:21.430> like<00:03:21.489> that<00:03:21.790> pinch<00:03:22.630> it<00:03:22.780> off

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
hair longer just like that pinch it off

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.490 
hair longer just like that pinch it off
at<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.230> back<00:03:24.780> I'm<00:03:25.780> gonna<00:03:25.930> do<00:03:26.140> is<00:03:26.260> I'm<00:03:26.350> going<00:03:26.440> to

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
at the back I'm gonna do is I'm going to

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.130 
at the back I'm gonna do is I'm going to
take<00:03:26.650> two<00:03:26.859> very<00:03:27.100> loose<00:03:27.459> wraps<00:03:30.660> over<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.989> elk

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
take two very loose wraps over the elk

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.410 
take two very loose wraps over the elk
hair<00:03:32.410> just<00:03:32.980> like<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.609> kind<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.120> torque

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
hair just like that and kind of torque

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.000 
hair just like that and kind of torque
down<00:03:34.600> on<00:03:34.780> them<00:03:34.900> just<00:03:35.019> a<00:03:35.170> little<00:03:35.200> bit<00:03:35.410> and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
down on them just a little bit and

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.190 
down on them just a little bit and
that's<00:03:36.880> not<00:03:37.090> enough<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.450> seat<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:37.959> so<00:03:38.019> what<00:03:38.140> I'm

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
that's not enough to seat it so what I'm

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.699 
that's not enough to seat it so what I'm
gonna<00:03:38.319> do<00:03:38.500> is<00:03:38.620> I'm<00:03:38.709> going<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:38.859> take<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.040> chunk

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
gonna do is I'm going to take a chunk

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.789 
gonna do is I'm going to take a chunk
peel<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:41.829> back<00:03:42.420> take<00:03:43.420> a<00:03:43.480> wrap<00:03:43.720> underneath<00:03:44.079> take

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
peel it back take a wrap underneath take

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.410 
peel it back take a wrap underneath take
another<00:03:45.069> chunk<00:03:45.400> peel<00:03:46.389> it<00:03:46.540> back

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
another chunk peel it back

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.870 
another chunk peel it back
take<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.230> wrap<00:03:48.530> underneath<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.340> take<00:03:49.520> another

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
take a wrap underneath and take another

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.699 
take a wrap underneath and take another
chunk<00:03:50.180> so<00:03:50.569> I've<00:03:50.750> basically<00:03:51.050> taken<00:03:51.530> three

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
chunk so I've basically taken three

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.240 
chunk so I've basically taken three
chunks<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.250> wrapped<00:03:52.520> below<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.720> just<00:03:54.250> like

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
chunks and wrapped below it just like

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.210 
chunks and wrapped below it just like
that<00:03:55.489> kind<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.030> makes<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.300> mess<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.950> then<00:03:58.099> the

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
that kind of makes a mess and then the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.320 
that kind of makes a mess and then the
last<00:03:58.430> piece<00:03:58.819> a<00:03:59.590> fold<00:04:00.590> back<00:04:00.860> so<00:04:01.489> it's<00:04:01.730> just<00:04:01.880> got

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
last piece a fold back so it's just got

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.449 
last piece a fold back so it's just got
some<00:04:02.540> hackers<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:03.020> I<00:04:03.140> trap<00:04:03.410> there<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:07.220> that

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
some hackers that I trap there so that

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.090 
some hackers that I trap there so that
the<00:04:07.819> last<00:04:08.090> point<00:04:08.480> I'm<00:04:09.380> just<00:04:09.440> wrapping<00:04:09.709> under

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
the last point I'm just wrapping under

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:18.360 
the last point I'm just wrapping under
everything<00:04:10.370> we'll<00:04:10.970> leave<00:04:11.120> some<00:04:11.239> wraps<00:04:11.510> down

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:32.970 

I'm<00:04:19.370> gonna<00:04:19.639> whip<00:04:19.820> finish<00:04:20.120> under<00:04:20.359> there

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.470 

and<00:04:33.980> then<00:04:34.100> you're<00:04:34.220> gonna<00:04:34.310> push<00:04:35.240> everybody

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
and then you're gonna push everybody

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.510 
and then you're gonna push everybody
back<00:04:35.780> forward<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:36.440> separate<00:04:36.890> them<00:04:37.010> out<00:04:37.190> from

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
back forward and separate them out from

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.740 
back forward and separate them out from
your<00:04:37.700> your<00:04:38.480> Wang<00:04:40.270> what<00:04:41.270> you're<00:04:41.390> gonna<00:04:41.480> do<00:04:41.720> then

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
your your Wang what you're gonna do then

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.410 
your your Wang what you're gonna do then
is<00:04:42.100> cut<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.250> kind<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:43.520> at<00:04:43.610> an<00:04:43.700> angle<00:04:44.060> just<00:04:44.090> like

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
is cut it kind of at an angle just like

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.420 
is cut it kind of at an angle just like
an<00:04:44.540> El<00:04:44.660> Kheir<00:04:44.870> caddis<00:04:45.290> give<00:04:46.010> it<00:04:46.100> a<00:04:46.160> bit<00:04:46.280> of<00:04:46.310> a

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
an El Kheir caddis give it a bit of a

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:57.930 
an El Kheir caddis give it a bit of a
head<00:04:53.350> just<00:04:54.350> like<00:04:54.500> down<00:04:55.450> and<00:04:56.450> then<00:04:56.780> cement

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
head just like down and then cement

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.560 
head just like down and then cement
underneath<00:04:58.940> there<00:04:59.360> to<00:05:00.280> hold<00:05:01.280> it<00:05:01.490> all<00:05:01.640> secure

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.340 

it's<00:05:05.570> all<00:05:05.690> there<00:05:05.810> is<00:05:05.900> to<00:05:06.050> it<00:05:06.140> and<00:05:06.200> this

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
it's all there is to it and this

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.630 
it's all there is to it and this
basically<00:05:06.740> floats<00:05:07.070> a<00:05:07.190> little<00:05:07.220> bit<00:05:07.490> better

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
basically floats a little bit better

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.510 
basically floats a little bit better
than<00:05:07.820> normal<00:05:07.940> El<00:05:08.240> Kheir<00:05:08.450> caddis<00:05:09.370> because<00:05:10.370> of

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
than normal El Kheir caddis because of

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.920 
than normal El Kheir caddis because of
that<00:05:10.640> that<00:05:11.360> foam<00:05:11.630> body<00:05:11.930> under<00:05:12.260> there<00:05:13.930> also

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
that that foam body under there also

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.460 
that that foam body under there also
gives<00:05:15.260> it<00:05:15.380> a<00:05:15.440> bit<00:05:15.590> I<00:05:15.650> think<00:05:15.770> more<00:05:16.130> lifelike

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
gives it a bit I think more lifelike

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.890 
gives it a bit I think more lifelike
look<00:05:18.470> as<00:05:18.680> well
