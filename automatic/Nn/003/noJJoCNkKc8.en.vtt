tech basically works one team is all

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.920 
tech basically works one team is all
infinite<00:00:18.029> hard<00:00:18.180> light<00:00:18.300> shields<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> other

infinite hard light shields the other

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.410 
infinite hard light shields the other
team<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.320> bottom<00:00:19.770> limb<00:00:19.890> bottomless<00:00:20.609> clip<00:00:20.850> saws

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
team is bottom limb bottomless clip saws

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.540 
team is bottom limb bottomless clip saws
there<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> hill<00:00:22.320> covering<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> entire<00:00:23.160> map

see is now that they've split up our
formation<00:01:18.570> we're<00:01:18.780> forced<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> run<00:01:19.350> around<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
formation we're forced to run around and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.370 
formation we're forced to run around and
run<00:01:20.340> away<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:21.570> you'll<00:01:21.720> see<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.020> that

run away and what you'll see is that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.539 
run away and what you'll see is that
even<00:01:22.530> though<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.890> happens<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.400> good

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
even though that happens with good

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.830 
even though that happens with good
coordination<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.420> call<00:01:24.630> for

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
coordination you can call for

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.270 
coordination you can call for
reformation<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.710> line<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.040> that's<00:01:26.100> what

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
reformation of the line so that's what

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.380 
reformation of the line so that's what
we<00:01:26.369> did<00:01:26.490> right<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:26.700> even<00:01:27.000> though<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.240> broke

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
we did right here even though we broke

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.480 
we did right here even though we broke
apart<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:28.080> decide<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.470> reform<00:01:28.860> over<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
apart we decide to reform over here and

flinging from the side hoping to help
out<00:02:52.200> these<00:02:52.319> guys<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:52.889> the<00:02:53.459> saw<00:02:54.269> team<00:02:54.540> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.270 
out these guys but the saw team is
putting<00:02:55.319> on<00:02:55.410> some<00:02:55.590> pressure<00:02:55.799> so<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.160> see

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
putting on some pressure so you can see

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.949 
putting on some pressure so you can see
here<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.459> break<00:02:56.700> my<00:02:56.730> shield<00:02:57.120> out<00:02:57.269> just<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.840> get

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
here I break my shield out just to get

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.090 
here I break my shield out just to get
off<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.079> punch<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.500> then<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.650> have<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:58.859> fall<00:02:59.069> back

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
off a punch and then I have to fall back

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.069 
off a punch and then I have to fall back
because<00:02:59.549> I<00:02:59.670> took<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.910> lot<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.180> damage<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:00.840> it's

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
because I took a lot of damage so it's

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:01.849

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
coordinate over here we've isolated the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.089 
coordinate over here we've isolated the
final<00:04:10.639> players<00:04:11.599> on<00:04:11.810> this<00:04:11.900> team<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.500> over<00:04:12.920> here

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
final players on this team and over here

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.129 
final players on this team and over here
once<00:04:13.519> you<00:04:13.639> get<00:04:13.730> around<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.120> sides<00:04:14.329> get<00:04:14.659> a<00:04:14.690> good

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
once you get around the sides get a good

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.719 
once you get around the sides get a good
angles<00:04:15.470> that's<00:04:15.709> when<00:04:15.859> the<00:04:15.950> assassinations<00:04:16.639> to

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
angles that's when the assassinations to

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.009 
angles that's when the assassinations to
start<00:04:16.940> rolling<00:04:17.090> you'll<00:04:17.600> be<00:04:17.720> able<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:17.900> knock

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
start rolling you'll be able to knock

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.029 
start rolling you'll be able to knock
these<00:04:18.139> players<00:04:18.380> out

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
these players out

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.279 
these players out
so<00:04:19.549> over<00:04:19.669> here<00:04:19.820> we<00:04:19.970> score<00:04:20.239> a<00:04:20.479> double<00:04:20.780> accession

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
so over here we score a double accession

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.050 
so over here we score a double accession
at<00:04:21.500> assassination<00:04:21.829> right<00:04:22.370> there<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.789> that

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
at assassination right there and that

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.550 
at assassination right there and that
about<00:04:23.210> wraps<00:04:23.419> it<00:04:23.539> up<00:04:23.660> keep<00:04:24.139> in<00:04:24.260> mind<00:04:24.440> though

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
about wraps it up keep in mind though

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.930 
about wraps it up keep in mind though

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
strategy so let's go ahead and look at

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.159 
strategy so let's go ahead and look at
this<00:04:33.740> side<00:04:33.979> this<00:04:34.610> is<00:04:34.699> gonna<00:04:34.820> be<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.539> saw<00:04:35.900> team

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
this side this is gonna be the saw team

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.330 
this side this is gonna be the saw team
so<00:04:36.349> make<00:04:36.470> sure<00:04:36.500> when<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:36.800> smile<00:04:37.039> and<00:04:37.099> you<00:04:37.190> pick

so make sure when you smile and you pick

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.129 
so make sure when you smile and you pick
up<00:04:37.430> soft<00:04:37.760> before<00:04:37.910> heading<00:04:38.210> out<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.389> door<00:04:38.419> this

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
up soft before heading out the door this

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.770 
up soft before heading out the door this
team<00:04:39.410> you<00:04:40.400> do<00:04:40.610> have<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.030> ability<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.389> sprint

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
team you do have the ability to sprint

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.050 
team you do have the ability to sprint
but<00:04:42.470> overall<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.160> move<00:04:43.340> slower<00:04:43.669> than<00:04:44.000> the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
but overall you move slower than the

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.129 
but overall you move slower than the
other<00:04:44.210> team<00:04:44.389> and<00:04:44.570> that's<00:04:44.630> just<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:44.930> compensate

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
other team and that's just to compensate

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.810 
other team and that's just to compensate
for<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.530> fact<00:04:45.650> that<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:45.949> have<00:04:46.070> these<00:04:46.220> huge

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
for the fact that you have these huge

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.610 
for the fact that you have these huge
weapons<00:04:47.270> that<00:04:47.419> you're<00:04:47.570> carrying<00:04:47.930> so<00:04:48.380> you<00:04:48.440> want
