00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
garden cart

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.150 
garden cart
we<00:00:18.600> will<00:00:18.720> also<00:00:18.990> compare<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> wheelbarrow

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
we will also compare it to a wheelbarrow

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.790 
we will also compare it to a wheelbarrow
and<00:00:20.520> then<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.720> decide<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.439> best<00:00:22.680> for

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
and then you can decide what is best for

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.849 
and then you can decide what is best for
you<00:00:23.420> so<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> garden<00:00:24.840> cart<00:00:25.050> will<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.350> taking<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
you so the garden cart will be taking a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.150 
you so the garden cart will be taking a
look<00:00:26.010> at<00:00:26.189> today<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.880> garden<00:00:27.720> dump<00:00:28.019> cart<00:00:28.410> by

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
look at today is a garden dump cart by

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160 
look at today is a garden dump cart by
gorilla<00:00:29.640> carts<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.750> actually<00:00:31.140> very

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
gorilla carts and it's actually very

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.260 
gorilla carts and it's actually very
decently<00:00:31.830> priced<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> video

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270

decently priced see the video
description<00:00:33.480> for<00:00:33.960> more<00:00:34.079> details<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:43.440> let's

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
description for more details so let's

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.270 
description for more details so let's
start<00:00:43.829> unboxing<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.670> garden<00:00:45.030> cart<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:46.280> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
start unboxing this garden cart and it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.100 
start unboxing this garden cart and it
wasn't<00:00:47.579> really<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.090> heavy<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.079> thought

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
wasn't really that heavy as I thought

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.069 
wasn't really that heavy as I thought
it's<00:00:49.739> actually<00:00:50.010> pretty<00:00:50.460> light<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.149> easy<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
it's actually pretty light and easy to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.380 
it's actually pretty light and easy to
carry<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:54.110> this<00:00:55.110> has<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> plastic<00:00:55.800> base<00:00:56.010> it's

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
carry and this has a plastic base it's

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
carry and this has a plastic base it's
the<00:00:57.390> lower<00:00:57.809> end<00:00:58.109> version<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> garden<00:00:58.949> cart

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the lower end version of the garden cart

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.340 
the lower end version of the garden cart
the<00:00:59.940> there<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> higher<00:01:00.510> end<00:01:00.750> version<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the there is a higher end version that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.969 
the there is a higher end version that
comes<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:03.149> much<00:01:03.989> more<00:01:04.199> sturdy<00:01:05.990> base<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.950> I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
comes with a much more sturdy base but I

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.469 
comes with a much more sturdy base but I
guess<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.400> most<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.790> most<00:01:09.060> practical

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
guess for most of most practical

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.080 
guess for most of most practical
purposes<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:11.040> plastic<00:01:11.490> card<00:01:11.610> should<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:11.880> good

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
purposes the plastic card should be good

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.109 
purposes the plastic card should be good
enough<00:01:12.229> it's<00:01:13.229> got<00:01:13.380> some<00:01:13.560> nice<00:01:13.710> wheels<00:01:14.070> four<00:01:14.970> of

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
enough it's got some nice wheels four of

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.380 
enough it's got some nice wheels four of
them

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.480 

screw<00:01:20.050> your<00:01:20.290> instructions<00:01:20.800> on<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.070> assembly

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
screw your instructions on the assembly

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.820 
screw your instructions on the assembly
and<00:01:22.300> all<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.600> parts<00:01:22.900> are<00:01:23.110> pretty<00:01:23.590> well

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
and all the parts are pretty well

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:45.820 
and all the parts are pretty well
packaged

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.920 

compared<00:01:46.830> to<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.979> wheelbarrow<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.970> garden<00:01:48.720> cart

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
compared to a wheelbarrow a garden cart

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.109 
compared to a wheelbarrow a garden cart
has<00:01:49.170> four<00:01:49.500> wheels<00:01:49.860> which<00:01:50.220> makes<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.670> easy<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
has four wheels which makes it easy to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.960 
has four wheels which makes it easy to
maneuver<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.780> cart<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:53.130> also<00:01:53.310> has<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.580> dump

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
maneuver the cart and it also has a dump

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.460 
maneuver the cart and it also has a dump
feature<00:01:54.299> which<00:01:54.869> makes<00:01:55.140> emptying<00:01:55.680> very<00:01:56.009> easy

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
feature which makes emptying very easy

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.859 
feature which makes emptying very easy
so<00:01:58.470> we<00:01:58.710> have<00:01:58.830> all<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.250> parts<00:01:59.490> laid<00:02:00.330> out<00:02:00.539> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
so we have all the parts laid out and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.520 
so we have all the parts laid out and
the<00:02:01.860> cart<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.220> now<00:02:02.369> ready<00:02:02.580> for<00:02:02.820> assembly

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.169 

now<00:02:07.530> assembling<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.039> cart<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.519> moderately

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
now assembling the cart was moderately

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.190 
now assembling the cart was moderately
difficult<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:10.790> most<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.330> difficulty<00:02:12.870> was

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
difficult and most of the difficulty was

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.440 
difficult and most of the difficulty was
because<00:02:13.860> there<00:02:14.099> were<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> lot<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.640> bolts<00:02:15.300> that

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
because there were a lot of bolts that

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.990 
because there were a lot of bolts that
needed<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.810> be<00:02:15.989> tightened<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.880> although<00:02:17.880> I

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
needed to be tightened and although I

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.970 
needed to be tightened and although I
tightened<00:02:18.510> most<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.900> these<00:02:19.050> by<00:02:19.319> hand

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
tightened most of these by hand

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.360 
tightened most of these by hand
I<00:02:20.010> realized<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.269> had<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> power<00:02:21.780> drill

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
I realized that if you had a power drill

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.860 
I realized that if you had a power drill
it<00:02:23.370> would<00:02:23.580> have<00:02:23.700> been<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.880> lot<00:02:24.180> easier<00:02:24.690> to

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
it would have been a lot easier to

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.559 
it would have been a lot easier to
complete<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.440> assembly<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.120> could<00:02:27.360> use<00:02:27.540> a

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
complete the assembly so you could use a

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.620 
complete the assembly so you could use a
power<00:02:27.870> drill<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:29.040> tighten<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.549> bolts<00:02:30.000> while

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
power drill to tighten the bolts while

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.080 
power drill to tighten the bolts while
holding<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.410> hex<00:02:31.680> nut<00:02:32.040> from<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.580> other<00:02:32.700> side

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
holding the hex nut from the other side

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.620 
holding the hex nut from the other side
and<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.420> makes<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.530> assembly<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> lot<00:02:35.370> faster

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.789 

but<00:02:39.630> as<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.870> said<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.200> should<00:02:40.230> take<00:02:40.590> you

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
but as I said it should take you

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.340 
but as I said it should take you
probably<00:02:41.250> about<00:02:41.850> an<00:02:42.030> hour<00:02:42.180> or<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.900> assemble

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
probably about an hour or so to assemble

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.229 
probably about an hour or so to assemble
everything<00:02:44.340> if<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.930> power<00:02:46.260> tool<00:02:47.239> if

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
everything if you have a power tool if

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.550 
everything if you have a power tool if
you're<00:02:48.390> doing<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.660> by<00:02:48.780> hand<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:49.170> might<00:02:49.350> take

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
you're doing it by hand it might take

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.890 
you're doing it by hand it might take
you<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.739> bit<00:02:49.769> longer<00:02:50.359> because<00:02:51.359> it's<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.600> little

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
you a bit longer because it's a little

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.310 
you a bit longer because it's a little
exhausting<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.680> tighten<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.250> those<00:02:53.640> not

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
exhausting to tighten all those not

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
exhausting to tighten all those not
thing<00:02:55.320> I'm<00:02:55.410> guessing<00:02:55.739> there<00:02:55.890> are<00:02:55.920> like<00:02:56.100> about

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
thing I'm guessing there are like about

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:17.900 
thing I'm guessing there are like about
15<00:02:56.730> or<00:02:56.910> 20<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.239> them

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.700 

so<00:03:18.910> we've<00:03:19.060> almost<00:03:19.510> assembled<00:03:19.780> our<00:03:20.170> dump<00:03:20.620> cart

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
so we've almost assembled our dump cart

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:32.900 
so we've almost assembled our dump cart
we<00:03:23.710> now<00:03:23.830> need<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.070> assemble<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.490> wheels

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.750 

and<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:35.080> wheels<00:03:35.319> feel<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.650> little<00:03:35.980> flimsy<00:03:36.250> but

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
and the wheels feel a little flimsy but

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.850 
and the wheels feel a little flimsy but
I<00:03:37.000> think<00:03:37.870> they<00:03:37.959> did<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.170> good<00:03:38.379> job<00:03:38.440> when<00:03:38.830> I

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
I think they did a good job when I

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.770 
I think they did a good job when I
eventually<00:03:39.160> tested<00:03:39.760> them<00:03:40.000> with<00:03:40.900> some<00:03:41.110> weight

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.240 

now<00:03:46.780> one<00:03:46.989> important<00:03:47.440> step<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.830> wanted<00:03:48.160> to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
now one important step that I wanted to

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.000 
now one important step that I wanted to
show<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:48.489> here<00:03:48.940> was<00:03:49.269> how<00:03:49.989> to<00:03:50.019> use<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.470> cotter

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
show you here was how to use a cotter

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.820 
show you here was how to use a cotter
pin<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.730> cotter<00:03:52.450> pin<00:03:52.810> as<00:03:53.080> something<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.560> will

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
pin a cotter pin as something that will

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.339 
pin a cotter pin as something that will
keep<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.280> wheels<00:03:54.550> in<00:03:54.760> place<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.330> this<00:03:56.200> is<00:03:56.260> a

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
keep the wheels in place and this is a

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.809 
keep the wheels in place and this is a
general<00:03:56.709> instruction<00:03:56.920> on<00:03:57.310> how<00:03:57.340> to<00:03:57.489> use<00:03:57.790> a

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
general instruction on how to use a

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.390 
general instruction on how to use a
cotter<00:03:58.150> pin<00:03:58.480> so<00:03:59.349> you<00:03:59.440> basically<00:03:59.620> take<00:04:00.040> pliers

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
cotter pin so you basically take pliers

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.979 
cotter pin so you basically take pliers
and<00:04:01.000> bend<00:04:01.989> them<00:04:02.230> over<00:04:02.410> on<00:04:02.739> both<00:04:02.950> sides<00:04:03.370> and

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
and bend them over on both sides and

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.020 
and bend them over on both sides and
that<00:04:04.989> should<00:04:05.200> do<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.560> job<00:04:05.860> of<00:04:05.890> setting<00:04:06.880> up

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
that should do the job of setting up

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.809 
that should do the job of setting up
that<00:04:07.150> cotter<00:04:07.420> pin<00:04:07.660> on<00:04:07.810> your<00:04:07.930> wheel<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:08.819> when

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
that cotter pin on your wheel and when

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.160 
that cotter pin on your wheel and when
you<00:04:09.940> notice<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:12.010> cotter<00:04:12.220> pin<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:12.610> what<00:04:13.170> keeps

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
you notice the cotter pin is what keeps

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.629 
you notice the cotter pin is what keeps
the<00:04:14.410> wheels<00:04:14.620> in<00:04:14.769> place<00:04:16.950> so<00:04:17.950> here<00:04:18.190> we<00:04:18.340> are

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
the wheels in place so here we are

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.230 
the wheels in place so here we are
that's<00:04:18.790> our<00:04:18.970> assembled<00:04:19.540> cart<00:04:19.900> or<00:04:20.200> garden<00:04:20.739> cart

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.240 
that's our assembled cart or garden cart

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.180 
that's our assembled cart or garden cart
now<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.270> garden<00:04:22.720> cart<00:04:22.870> is<00:04:23.050> actually<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.470> modern

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
now a garden cart is actually a modern

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.700 
now a garden cart is actually a modern
version<00:04:24.460> of<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.940> wheelbarrow<00:04:25.450> it's<00:04:26.410> much

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
version of the wheelbarrow it's much

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.550 
version of the wheelbarrow it's much
more<00:04:26.919> easy<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.340> maneuver<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:29.080> best<00:04:29.320> part

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
more easy to maneuver and the best part

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.680 
more easy to maneuver and the best part
as<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:29.860> will<00:04:29.950> see<00:04:30.190> here<00:04:30.580> is<00:04:30.850> its

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
as you will see here is its

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.279 
as you will see here is its
maneuverability<00:04:32.500> so<00:04:33.690> here<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:34.810> can<00:04:34.930> see<00:04:35.080> that

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
maneuverability so here you can see that

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.379 
maneuverability so here you can see that
I<00:04:35.320> have<00:04:35.500> added<00:04:35.680> a<00:04:35.860> lot<00:04:36.070> of<00:04:36.190> weight<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.820> this

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
I have added a lot of weight to this

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.540 
I have added a lot of weight to this
garden<00:04:37.750> cart<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.800> was<00:04:38.919> actually<00:04:39.250> easy<00:04:39.430> to

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
garden cart and it was actually easy to

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.010 
garden cart and it was actually easy to
move<00:04:39.789> it<00:04:40.030> with<00:04:40.210> all<00:04:40.330> this<00:04:40.479> weight<00:04:40.750> I'm

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
move it with all this weight I'm

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.440 
move it with all this weight I'm
guessing<00:04:41.919> this<00:04:42.010> would<00:04:42.160> be<00:04:42.310> about<00:04:42.550> 75<00:04:43.180> pounds

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
guessing this would be about 75 pounds

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.610 
guessing this would be about 75 pounds
or<00:04:43.810> so<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.380> look<00:04:45.310> at<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.700> profile<00:04:46.539> you<00:04:47.470> can

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
or so and look at the profile you can

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.590 
or so and look at the profile you can
easily<00:04:48.070> navigate<00:04:48.250> this<00:04:48.760> card<00:04:49.060> between<00:04:49.330> the

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
easily navigate this card between the

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.350 
easily navigate this card between the
raised<00:04:49.810> beds<00:04:50.520> now<00:04:51.520> I<00:04:51.550> know<00:04:51.700> I<00:04:51.820> haven't<00:04:52.060> shown

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
raised beds now I know I haven't shown

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.300 
raised beds now I know I haven't shown
you<00:04:52.479> my<00:04:52.510> raised<00:04:52.870> beds<00:04:53.169> yet<00:04:53.470> that's<00:04:54.070> going<00:04:54.250> to

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
you my raised beds yet that's going to

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.790 
you my raised beds yet that's going to
be<00:04:54.430> one<00:04:54.610> of<00:04:54.729> my<00:04:54.880> future<00:04:55.240> videos<00:04:55.620> but<00:04:56.620> if<00:04:56.710> you

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
be one of my future videos but if you

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.680 
be one of my future videos but if you
look<00:04:56.919> at<00:04:57.039> how<00:04:57.130> easy<00:04:57.370> it<00:04:57.610> is<00:04:57.729> to<00:04:57.940> maneuver<00:04:58.419> this

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
look at how easy it is to maneuver this

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.950 
look at how easy it is to maneuver this
cart<00:04:59.080> along<00:04:59.979> raised<00:05:00.250> beds<00:05:00.550> so<00:05:00.789> if<00:05:01.600> you<00:05:01.690> do<00:05:01.810> have

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
cart along raised beds so if you do have

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.469 
cart along raised beds so if you do have
raised<00:05:02.200> beds<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:02.889> have<00:05:03.430> about<00:05:03.639> two<00:05:04.030> feet<00:05:04.240> or

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
raised beds and have about two feet or

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.440 
raised beds and have about two feet or
so<00:05:04.690> between<00:05:04.960> them<00:05:05.289> a<00:05:05.550> garden<00:05:06.550> cart<00:05:06.729> will<00:05:07.090> work

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
so between them a garden cart will work

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.450 
so between them a garden cart will work
much<00:05:07.720> better<00:05:08.050> than<00:05:08.260> a<00:05:08.289> wheelbarrow

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.249 

so<00:05:13.460> this<00:05:13.639> is<00:05:13.789> a<00:05:13.819> dump<00:05:14.210> feature<00:05:14.599> of<00:05:14.839> the<00:05:14.960> cart

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
so this is a dump feature of the cart

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.249 
so this is a dump feature of the cart
and<00:05:16.210> this<00:05:17.210> is<00:05:17.360> something<00:05:17.599> that<00:05:17.629> you<00:05:17.839> cannot<00:05:18.080> do

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
and this is something that you cannot do

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.939 
and this is something that you cannot do
with<00:05:18.289> the<00:05:18.529> wheelbarrow<00:05:19.539> so<00:05:20.539> you<00:05:20.629> just<00:05:20.949> lift

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
with the wheelbarrow so you just lift

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.820

a<00:06:09.860> wheelbarrow<00:06:10.459> is<00:06:10.610> a<00:06:10.639> good<00:06:10.849> option

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:11.059 
a wheelbarrow is a good option

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:13.029 
a wheelbarrow is a good option
especially<00:06:11.449> if<00:06:12.379> you<00:06:12.559> are<00:06:12.619> used<00:06:12.889> to

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
especially if you are used to

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.219 
especially if you are used to
maneuvering<00:06:13.699> it<00:06:13.879> but<00:06:14.629> when<00:06:14.779> I<00:06:14.869> used<00:06:15.080> a

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
maneuvering it but when I used a

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.929 
maneuvering it but when I used a
wheelbarrow<00:06:15.589> I<00:06:15.949> just<00:06:16.159> found<00:06:16.370> that<00:06:16.519> it<00:06:16.699> was<00:06:16.909> a

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:16.939 
wheelbarrow I just found that it was a

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.389 
wheelbarrow I just found that it was a
little<00:06:17.529> inconvenient<00:06:18.529> compared<00:06:18.889> to<00:06:19.009> a<00:06:19.069> garden

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:19.399 
little inconvenient compared to a garden

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:22.029 
little inconvenient compared to a garden
cart<00:06:19.639> I've<00:06:20.389> used<00:06:20.629> wheelbarrows<00:06:21.289> for<00:06:21.469> a<00:06:21.499> while

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
cart I've used wheelbarrows for a while

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.889 
cart I've used wheelbarrows for a while
but<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:22.610> garden<00:06:22.879> cart<00:06:23.120> is<00:06:23.269> just<00:06:23.539> a<00:06:23.629> little

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:23.899 
but the garden cart is just a little

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:26.469 
but the garden cart is just a little
more<00:06:24.169> comfortable<00:06:24.889> to<00:06:25.039> use<00:06:25.479> another

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
more comfortable to use another

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.719 
more comfortable to use another
disadvantage<00:06:27.019> of<00:06:27.589> a<00:06:27.740> wheelbarrow<00:06:28.129> is<00:06:28.519> that

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
disadvantage of a wheelbarrow is that

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:31.629 
disadvantage of a wheelbarrow is that
it's<00:06:29.029> a<00:06:29.240> little<00:06:29.479> wide<00:06:30.039> so<00:06:31.039> if<00:06:31.159> you<00:06:31.279> have<00:06:31.399> raised

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
it's a little wide so if you have raised

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.179 
it's a little wide so if you have raised
beds<00:06:31.999> and<00:06:32.330> narrow<00:06:32.809> paths<00:06:33.199> in<00:06:33.469> your<00:06:33.620> garden<00:06:33.979> a

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:34.189
