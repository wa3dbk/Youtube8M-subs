00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.530
 Bernardo accepts the champion 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.560
 when you first started and you said why it is 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.479
 that you have decided to dedicate yourself to this sport 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.569

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.899
 after the date of the debut in competitions 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:44.599
 I was extension in the interior sense of são paulo in the season the championship 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.659
 Coast 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.849
 it was a sequence 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.670
 details by tel known merchant your relatives here 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.739
 You know practically a good part of the world, right? 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:58.109
 it's a fancy 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.549
 reese if memory does not fail me 31 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.749
 in an interview with the magazine 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:08.079
 someone else because that way you have is that we have the magazines 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:08.680
 on here 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.459
 What do you do to cut 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.009
 the main factor is genetics and the pre-disposition stop to develop 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.109
 the taxis well balanced and knit me 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.069
 an equal proportional goal in all groups 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.359
 after that I believe that it is not 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.030
 is a determining factor 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.919

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.009
 training supplementation

 disciplining and living a differentiated life is one of the few 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:07.319
 that it was absurdly necessary for the athlete not to be weight factors and that 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.369
