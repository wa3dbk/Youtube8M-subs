00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.650
 site that accompanies it quite 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.069
 sony is to put the search panel 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.370
 court you pull that by the side it 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.140
 April will or not being what was 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.290
 wanting to implement the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.079
 their research but if you 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:10.950
 leaving from mogi home so much go now 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:12.959
 the lounge will be locked and not yet 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.220
 I know if they will fix this because 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.389
 channels and nagle every day and update 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.030
 different from the front expects 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:24.329
 updated once every week 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.340
 You can rest assured of the day, you go. 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.269
 have an update with bug fix 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.690
 new and especially every day you go 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.019
 have a new update more update 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.380
 of all information 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:43.230
 especially if the search tab 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.739
 another thing that was very important 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.970
 so it is not so much but the cell phone has released 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.829
 10 MB of memory has improved a lot 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.880
 had previously here in memory of the street as 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:59.519
 if you can see it was 804 m free now 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.440
 there are 14 there is not much but it helps 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.440
 enough in the performance of your home 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.530
 apparently it's just that one more of the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.400
 things that fred expects and does not 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:18.180
 is based on it is based on a code 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.849
 clear source source but it is made a 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:26.170
 of some other devices such as the 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:28.720
 rock that is the sp 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.770

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.080

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.230
 practically this here is one there was a 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.150
 class could only say that and this 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.050
 program that is not working for 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.270
 game 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.550

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.400

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.960
