00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
you have a curvature towards the back

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.280 
you have a curvature towards the back
and<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.129> cutout<00:03:09.400> for<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.209> headphone<00:03:10.810> jack<00:03:10.840> that

headphone jack will work in here because

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.740 
headphone jack will work in here because
it's<00:03:14.739> a<00:03:14.799> nice<00:03:14.980> ample<00:03:15.459> cut<00:03:15.640> out<00:03:15.760> then<00:03:16.510> same

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
it whatsoever now try ideas building

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.059 
it whatsoever now try ideas building
this<00:03:24.910> as<00:03:25.120> an<00:03:25.239> ultra<00:03:25.660> slim<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.109> light<00:03:26.380> GPU<00:03:26.829> case

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
this as an ultra slim and light GPU case

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.220 
this as an ultra slim and light GPU case
which<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.370> exactly<00:03:27.519> what<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.780> benefits

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
which is exactly what it is the benefits

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.809 
which is exactly what it is the benefits
of<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.349> is<00:03:29.500> obviously<00:03:29.950> it's<00:03:30.190> nice<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.579> slim

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
of that is obviously it's nice and slim

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.220 
of that is obviously it's nice and slim
it's<00:03:31.000> minimalistic<00:03:31.419> and<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:31.900> fits<00:03:32.079> in<00:03:32.200> your

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
it's minimalistic and it fits in your

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.930 
it's minimalistic and it fits in your
pocket<00:03:32.349> very<00:03:32.769> easily<00:03:32.980> no<00:03:33.340> problems<00:03:33.760> with<00:03:33.879> that

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
pocket very easily no problems with that

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.449 
pocket very easily no problems with that
but<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.750> downside<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:35.319> a<00:03:35.410> protection<00:03:35.769> you'll

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
but the downside is a protection you'll

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.129 
but the downside is a protection you'll
get<00:03:36.609> little<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.060> no<00:03:37.209> drop<00:03:37.480> protection<00:03:37.660> because

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
get little to no drop protection because

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.809 
get little to no drop protection because
the<00:03:38.440> corners<00:03:38.889> and<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:39.190> sides<00:03:39.400> are<00:03:39.579> basically

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
the corners and the sides are basically

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.879 
the corners and the sides are basically
yoli<00:03:40.150> that<00:03:40.359> are<00:03:40.450> protected<00:03:40.989> but<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.650> front

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
yoli that are protected but the front

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.619 
yoli that are protected but the front
and<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.069> back<00:03:42.099> are<00:03:42.459> left<00:03:42.639> highly<00:03:43.000> exposed<00:03:43.329> so

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
and the back are left highly exposed so

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.030 
and the back are left highly exposed so
that's<00:03:43.870> why<00:03:44.079> I<00:03:44.109> recommended<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.739> screen

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
that's why I recommended a screen

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.920 
that's why I recommended a screen
protector<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.639> also<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.209> back<00:03:46.449> protector

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
protector and also a back protector

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.750 
protector and also a back protector
because<00:03:47.079> one<00:03:47.889> drop<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.639> could

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
because one drop and that could

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.339 
because one drop and that could
basically<00:03:49.000> be<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.449> end<00:03:49.569> of<00:03:49.690> your<00:03:49.780> Galaxy<00:03:50.169> s3

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
basically be the end of your Galaxy s3

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.379 
basically be the end of your Galaxy s3
now<00:03:51.129> in<00:03:51.250> terms<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.519> scratch<00:03:51.760> protection<00:03:52.120> you

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
now in terms of scratch protection you

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:53.670 
now in terms of scratch protection you
will<00:03:52.540> get<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.750> little<00:03:53.019> bit<00:03:53.139> better<00:03:53.290> scratch

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
will get a little bit better scratch

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.650 
will get a little bit better scratch
protection<00:03:54.069> I<00:03:54.370> still<00:03:54.849> consider<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.269> minimal

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
protection I still consider it minimal

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.270 
protection I still consider it minimal
though<00:03:55.780> because<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.590> can<00:03:56.739> pair<00:03:56.889> this<00:03:57.010> up<00:03:57.129> like

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
though because you can pair this up like

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.680 
though because you can pair this up like
I<00:03:57.310> mentioned<00:03:57.549> with<00:03:57.790> front<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.150> back<00:03:58.329> screen

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
I mentioned with front and back screen

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.659 
I mentioned with front and back screen
protectors<00:03:59.139> and<00:03:59.379> you'll<00:03:59.829> have<00:03:59.980> coverage<00:04:00.459> all

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
protectors and you'll have coverage all

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.640 
protectors and you'll have coverage all
around<00:04:01.090> which<00:04:01.359> is<00:04:01.540> good<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.079> if<00:04:02.379> you're

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
around which is good so if you're

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.259 
around which is good so if you're
someone<00:04:02.949> that<00:04:03.010> drops<00:04:03.519> your<00:04:03.669> phone<00:04:03.849> in<00:04:04.000> law<00:04:04.090> or

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
someone that drops your phone in law or

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.339 
someone that drops your phone in law or
needs<00:04:04.449> a<00:04:04.480> lot<00:04:04.629> of<00:04:04.660> protection<00:04:04.810> this<00:04:05.199> is

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
needs a lot of protection this is

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:06.960 
needs a lot of protection this is
definitely<00:04:05.859> not<00:04:05.919> the<00:04:06.129> way<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.280> go<00:04:06.489> and<00:04:06.639> I<00:04:06.699> don't

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
definitely not the way to go and I don't

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.520 
definitely not the way to go and I don't
recommend<00:04:07.359> it<00:04:07.480> to<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.780> but<00:04:08.319> if<00:04:08.410> you're

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
recommend it to you but if you're

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.839 
recommend it to you but if you're
someone<00:04:08.799> that's<00:04:08.859> very<00:04:09.069> careful<00:04:09.639> with<00:04:09.699> your

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
someone that's very careful with your

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.909 
someone that's very careful with your
phone<00:04:10.060> maybe<00:04:10.569> put<00:04:10.840> it<00:04:10.900> in<00:04:10.989> a<00:04:11.019> purse<00:04:11.260> or<00:04:11.560> inside

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
phone maybe put it in a purse or inside

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.129 
phone maybe put it in a purse or inside
a<00:04:11.949> little<00:04:12.310> bag<00:04:12.489> every<00:04:13.180> time<00:04:13.329> you<00:04:13.449> use<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.629> this

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
a little bag every time you use it this

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.839 
a little bag every time you use it this
is<00:04:14.260> probably<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.650> way<00:04:14.829> to<00:04:14.859> go<00:04:14.980> because<00:04:15.250> the

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
is probably the way to go because the

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.699 
is probably the way to go because the
case<00:04:16.000> itself<00:04:16.329> adds<00:04:16.599> little<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.049> no<00:04:17.169> bulk<00:04:17.470> or

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
case itself adds little to no bulk or

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.310 
case itself adds little to no bulk or
weight<00:04:18.030> nice<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.209> slim<00:04:19.449> and<00:04:19.599> streamlined<00:04:20.139> and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
weight nice and slim and streamlined and

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.959 
weight nice and slim and streamlined and
like<00:04:20.829> i<00:04:20.859> said<00:04:21.010> before<00:04:21.219> even<00:04:21.579> though<00:04:21.789> I<00:04:21.820> wasn't

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
like i said before even though I wasn't

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.940
