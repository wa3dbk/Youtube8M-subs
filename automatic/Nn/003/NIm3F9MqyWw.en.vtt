00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:28.880
 Although become the kind of impression to the person who you say is could do that song is not closed well

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:16.730
 1 actually 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.730
 It is surprisingly physiologically difficult to make the movement unrelated to the pronunciation 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.730
 Hmm 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:28.030

 Isn't the area of ​​the tip small? 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:39.140
 The other finger is going to land something like this noodle bowl

 It's been quite a while, but the forefinger is pretty pointed with your index finger

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:53.490
 There is also a cause that forefinger is close to the thumb compared to long fingers or such fingers 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:59.690
