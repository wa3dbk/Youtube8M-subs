00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.690
Eric: Today, we're talking about the most
important clothing item that has separated

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.740
mankind from caveman for hundreds of years.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.259
The undershirt.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:19.360
Hey guys, welcome back to Style Tips for the
Everyday Guy from Cladwell, where you can

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.350
get your personal roadmap to dress better.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.350
I'm Eric.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.350
Chris: I'm Chris.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.370
Eric: Today we're talking about undershirts.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.370
Chris: Yeah.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.420
Eric: Maybe not the fanciest of topics, but
some important questions to answer nonetheless.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.420
Chris: Yeah.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.420
Eric: Let's jump right in.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.520
First of all, I want to know how do we define
an undershirt?

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.699
Specifically separating an undershirt from
a T-shirt.

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.300
Chris: Yeah, that's a good question.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.090
Usually they're thinner, lighter weight.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.809
They're meant to be layered under other things.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.530
That's one of the ways you can tell.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.339
Also, you buy them in a bag.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.611
Most guys don't buy their T-shirts in a bag.

00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:50.611
Eric: That's true.

00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:52.780
Chris: That's another good way to tell if
you're at the store and you're wondering if

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.780
it's appropriate for that.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.499
They're usually a little less expensive than
a T-shirt because they're thinner material,

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:57.499
lighter weight.

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:58.499
Eric: What about color?

00:00:58.499 --> 00:00:59.499
Chris: Yeah, they're white.

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:00.499
Almost always.

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:03.730
You can buy grey undershirts, black undershirts
even, but almost always they're white.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.730
Eric: Okay.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.620
What are the main reasons I'm wearing an undershirt?

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.620
Chris: Sure.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.799
I think the two best reasons to wear an undershirt
are that it actually will keep you a little

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.310
warmer, like I said, meant for layering.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.310
That's nice.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.549
You get the close layer nice and tight to
the body.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.750
Also, it actually will prevent you from getting
stains on your outer layer.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.789
If you have nicer things that you don't want
to wash as much, like a dress shirt or a sweater

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.539
something like that, you can wear that close
to the body.

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.040
That'll absorb all your sweat.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.219
Eric: In order to do a little bit less laundry
and help your nicer items last a bit longer.

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:34.219
Chris: Yeah.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.450
Eric: If you're wearing an undershirt, throw
those in the laundry.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.450
That's not as big of a deal.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.450
Chris: Yeah, easier to replace, inexpensive.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.899
Like I said, you don't have to worry about
those.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.079
You can keep your nicer things nice.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.079
Eric: Okay.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.990
Maybe the most important question centering
around an undershirt is is it a fashion mistake

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.829
to let my undershirt show?

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:50.829
To have it seen?

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.570
Chris: Yeah, we've had some good debates about
this in the office.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.649
As a general rule, don't show your undershirt.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.649
Eric: Okay.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:58.649
Chris: That's a general rule.

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.649
Eric: General rule.

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.750
Chris: I will say for some guys, that's probably
less of a fashion faux pas than for other

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.750
guys.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.869
If you're a more formal guy or a trendier
guy, you're probably going to want to pay

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.150
more attention to whether your undershirt
shows when you're putting together your outfit.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.590
If you're a casual guy, you got other things
to worry about.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.590
Eric: Yes.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.590
Chris: You don't have to consider it as much.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.080
Eric: You guys don't know who you are, go
check out your style analytics at Cladwell.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.209
If you're in that lower left quadrant ...
Chris: Yes, that's the casual [crosstalk 00:02:23].

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.760
Eric: That's the casual guy.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.400
For you, it might not be as big of a deal
to let your undershirt show.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.400
Chris: Yeah.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.489
Eric: I think that's kind of cool about Cladwell
itself.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.310
We know that different guys have different
style personalities.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.650
Chris: Yeah, you're going to want to pay attention
to different things in order to complete your

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.650
looks.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.599
Eric: We did talk about there are some hard
lines, where you never want ... Even if you're

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.599
a casual guy.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.599
Chris: Yeah, for everybody.

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.599
Yeah, including casual guy.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.519
If you're wearing a dress shirt, that's the
best example.

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.840
Never let your undershirt show, whether you're
wearing it with a tie or without.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.840
Eric: Okay.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.879
On Cladwell, while we don't make personal
recommendations for undershirts, you guys

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.700
are on your own for that, we do make recommendations
for T-shirts.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.700
Chris: Yeah.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.350
Eric: Just to clarify this a little bit further,
when is it okay ... We said it's not okay

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.350
to let your undershirt show.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.659
It is okay, obviously if we're recommending
T-shirts as part of your wardrobe, to let

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:12.659
your T-shirt show.

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.659
Chris: Definitely.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:14.659
Eric: When is that okay?

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.390
Chris: Of course you can wear a T-shirt by
itself, with jeans, [inaudible 00:03:17],

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.390
whatever.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.390
That's fine.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.390
You can wear it under a blazer.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.230
That's a great, great look.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.340
You could wear it under a sweatshirt or a
sweater as part of a layered look.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.340
Eric: Yes.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.360
Chris: You can even wear it like you've got
on right now.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.849
He's got this light blue v-neck T-shirt and
the shirt on top of it ... The reason this

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.340
works so well, I think, is that you've got
three buttons it look ... Yeah, three buttons

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.340
undone.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.110
You're showing the T-shirt.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.640
If you were buttoned up all the way to the
top and your T-shirt was just peeking out,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.930
that might look a little weird, but because
you're really showing it off ...

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.840
Eric: If I'm half way unbuttoned or all the
way unbuttoned, it's okay because that's a

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.959
look ...
Chris: Exactly.

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.870
Eric: If you're buttoning up, trying not to
let it show essentially.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.870
Chris: Right.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.870
Eric: Okay.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.819
If you're going for the look to not let your
undershirt show, what are the options we have

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.730
to actually get that done, to execute that?

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.430
Chris: Of course, you could not wear one,
but then you lose benefits that we already

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.439
talked about.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:11.030
Of course, the second option is to wear a
v-neck undershirt.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.320
There are varying lengths of these, so you
might have to try a couple on to find one

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.489
that doesn't actually show.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.489
Eric: Yeah.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.491
You could go with the [inaudible 00:04:20].

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.491
Chris: The [inaudible 00:04:19].

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:20.491
You could do that.

00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:22.310
Eric: Some of you guys might know that.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.070
We'll link below.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.630
One last question I have is the length of
the undershirt.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.890
Sometimes because they're a little less expensive,
they shrink up.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.890
Chris: Yeah.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.030
Eric: If you're wearing it under a shirt,
it can ... There's a line you can ...

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.440
Chris: Oh yeah, it bunches up around the waist
line.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.440
Eric: It bunches up.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.580
Yeah, what do I do about the length or is
there something I can do to fix that problem?

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.780
Chris: Thanks to my eighth grade teacher,
Ms. Han, I have a solution for you.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.430
I still do this, you'll be happy to know Ms.
Han.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.729
You can actually tuck your undershirt into
your underwear.

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.850
Use that elastic band around your underwear,
around your waist, keep it nice, in place.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.400
It gives you a slim profile.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.400
Eric: That's creative.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.400
I've done that once or twice.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.280
It feels a little weird at first, but you
get over that really quickly because you do

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.139
have that nice slim look and it stays in place.

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.850
Chris: Yeah, it actually ... A lot less fussing
during the day.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.850
Eric: Cool.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.500
All right guys, hopefully this was helpful
for your.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.289
If it was, give it a thumbs up.

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.740
Hopefully we've answered everything you've
ever wanted to know about undershirts or need

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.740
to know.
