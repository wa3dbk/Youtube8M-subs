we've introduced I want to look at a

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.100 
we've introduced I want to look at a
couple<00:00:14.059> of<00:00:14.119> the<00:00:14.240> features<00:00:14.419> before<00:00:14.749> we<00:00:14.990> get

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
couple of the features before we get

you to actually cut some of the roots a
lot<00:00:46.520> of<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.790> stump<00:00:47.540> buckets<00:00:47.930> that<00:00:48.020> you<00:00:48.170> may

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
lot of the stump buckets that you may

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.430 
lot of the stump buckets that you may
see<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:48.950> with<00:00:49.130> the<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.730> half-inch<00:00:50.510> wide<00:00:50.720> hot

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
see it with the the half-inch wide hot

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.139 
see it with the the half-inch wide hot
rolled<00:00:51.710> steel<00:00:51.800> teeth<00:00:52.250> are<00:00:52.790> gonna<00:00:52.970> have

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
rolled steel teeth are gonna have

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.210 
rolled steel teeth are gonna have
difficulty<00:00:53.780> driving<00:00:54.290> under<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.649> roots<00:00:54.980> and

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
difficulty driving under the roots and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.220 
difficulty driving under the roots and
actually<00:00:55.550> cutting<00:00:55.910> as<00:00:56.030> they<00:00:56.180> go<00:00:56.360> through<00:00:56.690> now

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
actually cutting as they go through now

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.750 
actually cutting as they go through now
these<00:00:57.380> will<00:00:57.590> get<00:00:57.680> a<00:00:57.739> bite<00:00:57.980> as<00:00:58.190> you<00:00:58.309> come<00:00:58.550> out

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
these will get a bite as you come out

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.549 
these will get a bite as you come out
but<00:00:59.000> having<00:00:59.329> a<00:00:59.390> bevel<00:00:59.750> tooth<00:00:59.989> that<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:00.320> high

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
but having a bevel tooth that a high

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.139 
but having a bevel tooth that a high
carbon<00:01:00.950> steel<00:01:01.160> should<00:01:01.370> allow<00:01:01.579> it<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.850> cut

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
carbon steel should allow it to cut

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.350 
carbon steel should allow it to cut
better<00:01:03.070> just<00:01:04.070> a<00:01:04.159> couple<00:01:04.370> other<00:01:04.519> things<00:01:04.729> before

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
better just a couple other things before

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.990 
better just a couple other things before
we<00:01:05.479> get<00:01:05.630> started<00:01:06.170> we've<00:01:07.070> moved<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.580> cylinder

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
we get started we've moved the cylinder

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.120 
we get started we've moved the cylinder
on<00:01:08.030> this<00:01:08.390> unit<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.960> give<00:01:09.260> it<00:01:09.380> enough<00:01:09.590> angle<00:01:09.979> so

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
on this unit to give it enough angle so

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.219 
on this unit to give it enough angle so
we<00:01:10.310> can<00:01:10.460> maximize<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.330> amount<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:11.630> force<00:01:11.930> on

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
we can maximize the amount of force on

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.160 
we can maximize the amount of force on
our<00:01:12.590> on<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:12.979> grapple<00:01:13.520> arm<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.030> in<00:01:14.810> doing<00:01:14.990> that

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
our on a grapple arm and in doing that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.380 
our on a grapple arm and in doing that
of<00:01:15.500> course<00:01:15.710> we<00:01:16.159> put<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.400> lot<00:01:16.580> of<00:01:16.760> load<00:01:16.909> into<00:01:17.299> the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
of course we put a lot of load into the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.660 
of course we put a lot of load into the
hitch<00:01:17.600> plate<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.770> is<00:01:18.950> one<00:01:19.130> thing<00:01:19.369> that<00:01:19.640> I

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
hitch plate this is one thing that I

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.520 
hitch plate this is one thing that I
don't<00:01:20.000> think<00:01:20.360> you'll<00:01:20.479> find<00:01:20.510> on<00:01:20.900> another<00:01:21.200> stunt

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
don't think you'll find on another stunt

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.010 
don't think you'll find on another stunt
bucket<00:01:21.890> we<00:01:22.369> have<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.549> three-eighths<00:01:23.119> broken

out to load transfer plate that we call

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.539 
out to load transfer plate that we call
it<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.420> ties<00:01:26.600> all<00:01:26.930> of<00:01:27.140> your<00:01:27.350> lid<00:01:27.560> hinges<00:01:28.070> as

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
it it ties all of your lid hinges as

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.340 
it it ties all of your lid hinges as
well<00:01:28.820> as<00:01:28.970> you're<00:01:29.119> selling<00:01:29.450> them<00:01:29.600> out<00:01:29.689> down<00:01:30.290> to

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
well as you're selling them out down to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.990 
well as you're selling them out down to
the<00:01:30.560> center<00:01:31.010> of<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.159> hitch<00:01:31.340> where<00:01:31.670> you've<00:01:31.820> got

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
the center of the hitch where you've got

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.520 
the center of the hitch where you've got
the<00:01:32.150> most<00:01:32.360> strength<00:01:32.720> anyway<00:01:34.390> but<00:01:35.390> I<00:01:35.810> think

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
the most strength anyway but I think

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.750 
the most strength anyway but I think
we're<00:01:36.680> going<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:36.890> do<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.159> little<00:01:37.280> cut<00:01:37.490> here<00:01:37.700> you

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
we're going to do a little cut here you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.550 
we're going to do a little cut here you
can<00:01:37.880> see<00:01:38.090> now<00:01:38.270> with<00:01:38.479> it<00:01:38.630> wide<00:01:38.810> open<00:01:38.840> we've<00:01:39.380> got
