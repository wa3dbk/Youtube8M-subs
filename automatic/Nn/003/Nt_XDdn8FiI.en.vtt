the circuit which we are working on now
you<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.440> I'm<00:00:58.680> putting<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.070> pretty

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
you can see I'm putting a pretty

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220 
you can see I'm putting a pretty
cool-looking<00:00:59.489> round<00:01:00.329> here<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.870> get<00:01:01.050> some

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
cool-looking round here you get some

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.990 
cool-looking round here you get some
pretty<00:01:01.410> nice<00:01:01.680> illness<00:01:02.280> try<00:01:02.609> not<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.879> hit<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
pretty nice illness try not to hit a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.329 
pretty nice illness try not to hit a
cactus<00:01:03.449> or<00:01:03.690> Birds<00:01:04.170> that's<00:01:04.379> happened<00:01:04.769> before

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
cactus or Birds that's happened before

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.520 
cactus or Birds that's happened before
probably<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> corner<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.229> tires

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
probably on the corner we have tires

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.140 
probably on the corner we have tires
because<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> always<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.310> them<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.490> any<00:01:08.820> form

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
because you always have them in any form

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.850 
because you always have them in any form
for<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.360> circuit<00:01:09.840> actually<00:01:10.260> simply<00:01:10.619> world

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
for a circuit actually simply world

for a circuit actually simply world
flying<00:01:11.189> bars<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.970> copper<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.450> what<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.840> use<00:01:12.960> on

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
flying bars and copper so what we use on

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
flying bars and copper so what we use on
that<00:01:13.170> I'm<00:01:13.830> use<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> birch<00:01:14.400> wood<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.939> make<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
that I'm use the birch wood to make the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.539 
that I'm use the birch wood to make the
actual<00:01:15.570> track<00:01:15.900> layout<00:01:16.350> here<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.340> sounds

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
actual track layout here now it sounds

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.679 
actual track layout here now it sounds
so<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.970> see<00:01:18.119> I'm<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.270> adding<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> bit

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
so you can see I'm just adding a bit

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.539 
so you can see I'm just adding a bit
more<00:01:18.869> detail<00:01:19.290> that's<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.920> being<00:01:20.070> dependent

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
more detail that's not being dependent

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.580 
pretty good air on on this one the outer
line<00:01:51.880> comes<00:01:52.359> out<00:01:52.539> a<00:01:52.569> lot<00:01:52.899> further<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.409> has<00:01:53.439> a

larger low kite and the rest of track on
the<00:01:55.719> corner<00:01:56.079> that's<00:01:56.289> because<00:01:56.590> I<00:01:56.649> want<00:01:56.799> the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
the corner that's because I want the

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.859 
the corner that's because I want the
track<00:01:57.369> just<00:01:57.579> to<00:01:57.700> open<00:01:58.090> up<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.450> bit<00:01:58.689> on<00:01:58.810> the

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
track just to open up a bit on the

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.539 
track just to open up a bit on the
corners<00:01:59.200> there's<00:01:59.469> a<00:01:59.500> bit<00:01:59.740> more<00:01:59.920> room<00:02:00.159> and<00:02:00.399> so

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
corners there's a bit more room and so

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.090 
corners there's a bit more room and so
it's<00:02:00.939> so<00:02:01.090> tight<00:02:01.450> until<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:02.409> make<00:02:02.530> eye<00:02:02.829> water

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
it's so tight until you make eye water

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.429 
it's so tight until you make eye water
water<00:02:03.579> way<00:02:03.789> around<00:02:04.090> now<00:02:04.929> average<00:02:05.109> track<00:02:05.319> is

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
water way around now average track is

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.260 
water way around now average track is
going<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.649> be<00:02:05.799> crossing<00:02:06.459> over<00:02:06.670> itself<00:02:07.090> so<00:02:07.179> if

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
going to be crossing over itself so if

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.910 
going to be crossing over itself so if
I've<00:02:07.390> been<00:02:07.539> a<00:02:07.569> bit<00:02:07.750> of<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:07.869> crossroad<00:02:08.349> here<00:02:08.619> see

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
I've been a bit of a crossroad here see

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.529 
I've been a bit of a crossroad here see
you're<00:02:09.039> coming<00:02:09.220> from<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.610> top<00:02:09.879> and<00:02:10.149> coming

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
you're coming from that top and coming

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.050 
you're coming from that top and coming
down<00:02:10.780> in<00:02:11.500> front<00:02:11.799> of<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.099> Stargate<00:02:12.549> on<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.910> this

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
down in front of the Stargate on to this

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.270 
down in front of the Stargate on to this
little<00:02:13.390> zigzag<00:02:13.840> section<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.680> track<00:02:14.920> which<00:02:15.160> is

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
little zigzag section of track which is

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.740 
little zigzag section of track which is
where<00:02:15.430> finish<00:02:15.760> lines<00:02:15.970> don't<00:02:16.180> speak

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
where finish lines don't speak

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.569 
where finish lines don't speak
but<00:02:17.200> course<00:02:17.620> it's<00:02:17.799> tough<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.130> be<00:02:18.190> adapted

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
but course it's tough to be adapted

but course it's tough to be adapted
finish<00:02:18.819> line<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.090> can<00:02:19.239> maybe<00:02:19.420> since<00:02:19.720> roller

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
finish line you can maybe since roller

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.289 
finish line you can maybe since roller
