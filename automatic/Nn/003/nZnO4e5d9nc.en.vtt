have enough yarn to it you know around
the<00:03:16.630> edge<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:20.460> find<00:03:21.460> your<00:03:21.640> way<00:03:21.730> through

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:43.110 

like<00:03:31.360> that<00:03:33.030> now<00:03:34.030> in<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.209> sec<00:03:34.420> there<00:03:35.049> we<00:03:35.079> go

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.750 

and<00:03:43.660> then<00:03:43.810> when<00:03:43.959> you're<00:03:44.080> done<00:03:44.349> with<00:03:45.160> going<00:03:45.670> to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
and then when you're done with going to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.000 
and then when you're done with going to
the<00:03:45.879> end<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.950> say<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:48.459> is<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.849> last<00:03:49.030> stitch

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.580 

you're<00:03:54.010> going<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.220> go<00:03:54.340> around<00:03:54.489> once<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:56.530> then

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
you're going to go around once and then

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.990 
you're going to go around once and then
you're<00:03:56.830> actually<00:03:57.129> going<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.280> go<00:03:57.489> around<00:03:57.760> again

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
you're actually going to go around again

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.660 
you're actually going to go around again
and<00:03:59.010> then<00:04:01.049> there<00:04:02.049> will<00:04:02.110> be<00:04:02.170> this<00:04:02.440> loop<00:04:02.799> like

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
and then there will be this loop like

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.490 
and then there will be this loop like
this<00:04:03.910> loop<00:04:04.120> right<00:04:04.239> here<00:04:04.569> and<00:04:05.319> you're<00:04:05.410> gonna

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
this loop right here and you're gonna

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.020 
this loop right here and you're gonna
stick<00:04:05.799> it<00:04:05.920> through<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.160> loop<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.670> make<00:04:06.700> a

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
stick it through the loop and make a

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.059 
stick it through the loop and make a
slipknot<00:04:07.360> and<00:04:07.720> do<00:04:07.840> that<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:08.019> couple<00:04:08.110> times<00:04:08.680> and

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
slipknot and do that a couple times and

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.890 
slipknot and do that a couple times and
then<00:04:09.129> cut<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:11.080> off<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.590> then<00:04:11.650> you're<00:04:11.860> gonna

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
then cut it off and then you're gonna

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.300 
then cut it off and then you're gonna
weave<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:15.250> tail<00:04:17.010> into<00:04:18.930> your<00:04:19.930> work<00:04:20.169> so<00:04:21.130> just

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
weave the tail into your work so just

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.710 
weave the tail into your work so just
weave<00:04:21.430> it<00:04:21.609> back<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:21.940> forth<00:04:22.120> into<00:04:22.419> your<00:04:22.540> work

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
weave it back and forth into your work

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.090 
weave it back and forth into your work
around<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.110> edge<00:04:23.229> because<00:04:23.530> nobody's<00:04:23.950> gonna

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
around the edge because nobody's gonna

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.719 
around the edge because nobody's gonna
see<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:24.580> around<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.940> edge<00:04:26.100> make<00:04:27.100> sure<00:04:27.280> that

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
see it around the edge make sure that

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.150 
see it around the edge make sure that
your<00:04:28.030> tails<00:04:28.300> are<00:04:28.479> on<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.720> inside<00:04:29.820> any<00:04:32.160> spots

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
your tails are on the inside any spots

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.129 
your tails are on the inside any spots
where<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:33.550> actually<00:04:33.729> have<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.120> like<00:04:34.960> right

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
where you actually have to like right

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.190 
where you actually have to like right
here<00:04:35.380> where<00:04:36.250> you<00:04:36.340> had<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.120> tie<00:04:37.419> new<00:04:37.930> pieces

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
here where you had to tie new pieces

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.580 
here where you had to tie new pieces
together<00:04:39.930> make<00:04:40.930> sure<00:04:40.960> those<00:04:41.260> are<00:04:41.289> on<00:04:41.560> the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
together make sure those are on the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.040 
together make sure those are on the
inside<00:04:41.800> it's<00:04:42.490> okay<00:04:42.789> if<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.690> know<00:04:43.780> it<00:04:43.900> doesn't

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
inside it's okay if you know it doesn't

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.659 
inside it's okay if you know it doesn't
all<00:04:44.229> have<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:44.470> be<00:04:44.590> one<00:04:44.830> piece<00:04:45.130> but<00:04:45.430> make<00:04:45.639> sure

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
all have to be one piece but make sure

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.560 
all have to be one piece but make sure
that<00:04:45.940> you<00:04:46.060> do<00:04:47.910> tie<00:04:48.910> them<00:04:49.060> together<00:04:49.180> really

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
that you do tie them together really

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.969 
that you do tie them together really
tight<00:04:49.870> double<00:04:50.260> knot<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.710> um<00:04:51.539> whatever<00:04:52.830> so<00:04:53.830> yeah
