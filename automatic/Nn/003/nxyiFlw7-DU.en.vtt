00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.330
 also because I found out that there is a 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.820
 reason to two that was the one that gave them a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.680
 very special talk to the players of 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.410
 the selection and that's why they have that 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.800
 attitude let's know who is 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.800
 about 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.790
 well I do not know how it is that the thing that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.790
 Question 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.539
 I think they 're going to give him a microphone 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.440
 good afternoon 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.440
 6 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.530
 positions here today because you are a 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.940
 person who has cattle and who does not 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.589
 I understand very well that I have nothing 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.350
 not selected livestock do not have 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.969
 nothing at all here lists the things that 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.250
 they come to win to win with a 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.039
 positive attitude that's what I come 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.270
 to converse with them and I am the how 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:15.250
 If you're clearly a ball has 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.069
 ever played soccer you for 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.929
 motivate the selected this that I 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:22.040
 I have almost clear but I do know what 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.780
 is to dominate beasts 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.090
 and I believe that here what I come 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.180
 to bring to the boys is that everything 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.040
 it costs in life 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.160
 and that sometimes there are beasts that are stubborn 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.070
 but yes once constant can achieve 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.440
 many things 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.940
 what is the relationship between your 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.710
 specialty also what is the 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:49.330
 won and football that is the relationship 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.180

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.340
 start from below that every fight is 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.410
 to be persistent and there 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.710
 circumstances in life that one 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.150

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.340
 at once as well as to help 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.009

 agility have the talent they have 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.000
