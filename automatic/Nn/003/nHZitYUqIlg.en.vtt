well looks like table for white he can
say<00:02:00.710> both<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:02.390> he<00:02:02.570> doesn't<00:02:02.930> try<00:02:03.170> he<00:02:04.009> played<00:02:04.310> the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
say both so he doesn't try he played the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.540 
say both so he doesn't try he played the
Queen<00:02:04.640> f3<00:02:05.650> attacking<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.740> rook<00:02:06.830> on<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:08.000> eight

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
Queen f3 attacking the rook on a eight

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.520 
Queen f3 attacking the rook on a eight
looks<00:02:10.550> like<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:10.940> Queen<00:02:11.270> e5<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.320> best

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
looks like that Queen e5 is the best

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.260 
looks like that Queen e5 is the best
move<00:02:12.800> for<00:02:13.100> black<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:14.600> position<00:02:15.910> but<00:02:16.910> he

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
move for black in this position but he

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.810 
move for black in this position but he
didn't<00:02:17.510> find<00:02:17.690> this<00:02:17.930> move<00:02:18.610> instead<00:02:19.610> he

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
didn't find this move instead he

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.930 
didn't find this move instead he
captured<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:21.709> night<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.130> he<00:02:22.459> looks<00:02:22.700> good

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
captured the night and he looks good

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.740 
captured the night and he looks good
because<00:02:23.170> he's<00:02:24.170> threatening<00:02:24.700> C<00:02:25.700> takes<00:02:26.000> P<00:02:26.330> 2<00:02:26.570> and

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
because he's threatening C takes P 2 and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.090 
because he's threatening C takes P 2 and
also<00:02:26.959> he<00:02:27.739> can<00:02:27.950> capture<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.430> bishop<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:30.100> so

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
also he can capture the bishop and so

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.440 
also he can capture the bishop and so
looks<00:02:31.580> like<00:02:31.959> white<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:33.320> trouble<00:02:34.269> if<00:02:35.269> he

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
looks like white is in trouble if he

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.759 
looks like white is in trouble if he
says<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.900> bishop<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.980> going<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.489> lose<00:02:37.640> here

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
says the bishop is going to lose here

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.350 
says the bishop is going to lose here
but<00:02:39.790> he<00:02:40.790> found<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.269> more<00:02:41.709> Queen<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:43.040> c6<00:02:43.940> check

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
but he found this more Queen to c6 check

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.970 
but he found this more Queen to c6 check
and<00:02:45.489> if<00:02:47.320> blacks<00:02:48.640> black<00:02:49.640> blocks<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.239> bishop

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
and if blacks black blocks to the bishop

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.759 
and if blacks black blocks to the bishop
then<00:02:51.980> white<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.549> winning<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:52.970> way

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
then white is winning this way

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.660 
then white is winning this way
that's<00:02:54.769> why<00:02:54.950> after<00:02:55.070> Queen<00:02:55.970> six<00:02:57.400> black<00:02:58.400> paid
