00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
there there are some representations of

did<00:00:30.690> one<00:00:30.900> there's<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.529> couple<00:00:31.710> of

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
did one there's a couple of

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.410 
did one there's a couple of
representations<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.760> this<00:00:32.910> ship<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.239> there's

not<00:00:33.600> really<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.650> that<00:00:34.830> I<00:00:34.890> would<00:00:34.980> say<00:00:35.220> is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
not really one that I would say is

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.520 
not really one that I would say is
really<00:00:35.580> good<00:00:35.970> so<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.629> was<00:00:36.840> really<00:00:37.020> hopeful<00:00:37.500> that

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
really good so I was really hopeful that

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.990 
really good so I was really hopeful that
this<00:00:37.710> would<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> really<00:00:38.670> really<00:00:38.850> good

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
this would be a really really good

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.969 
this would be a really really good
representation<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.900> the<00:00:40.019> 2009<00:00:40.559> enterprise

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:40.979 
representation of the 2009 enterprise

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:42.979 
representation of the 2009 enterprise
and<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.909> pretty<00:00:42.180> good<00:00:42.330> one<00:00:42.479> I<00:00:42.510> am<00:00:42.720> very

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and it is a pretty good one I am very

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.469 
and it is a pretty good one I am very
very<00:00:43.440> happy<00:00:43.769> with<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.040> ship<00:00:44.330> there<00:00:45.330> are<00:00:45.449> a

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:45.479

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.310 
couple things I wish was done a bit
better<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:48.239> overall<00:00:48.420> I'd<00:00:48.839> say<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.199> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
better but overall I'd say this is a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.079 
better but overall I'd say this is a
really<00:00:49.830> really<00:00:49.949> good<00:00:50.280> version<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> ship

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
to have the nacelles are kind of messed

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.580 
to have the nacelles are kind of messed
up<00:01:42.270> when<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> cells<00:01:42.810> higher<00:01:43.110> than<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.440> other

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
up when the cells higher than the other

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.910 
up when the cells higher than the other
I<00:01:43.860> don't<00:01:44.340> think<00:01:45.000> mine<00:01:45.390> has<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.990> same<00:01:46.290> problem

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
I don't think mine has that same problem

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.830 
I don't think mine has that same problem
just<00:01:47.790> from<00:01:47.940> looking<00:01:48.120> at<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.600> don't<00:01:48.780> think

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
just from looking at it I don't think

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.530 
just from looking at it I don't think
mine<00:01:49.170> has<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.590> same<00:01:49.830> issue<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.550> think<00:01:51.060> -<00:01:51.240> cells

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
mine has the same issue I think - cells

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.260 
mine has the same issue I think - cells
are<00:01:51.750> pretty<00:01:52.140> even<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.790> looking<00:01:54.030> down<00:01:54.150> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
are pretty even and looking down the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.580 
are pretty even and looking down the
side<00:01:54.480> here<00:01:54.780> again<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.050> can<00:01:55.170> see<00:01:55.290> some<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
side here again you can see some of the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.290 
side here again you can see some of the
nice<00:01:55.740> details<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.520> pylons

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
nice details on the pylons

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.480 
nice details on the pylons
in<00:01:57.420> here<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.620> again<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:58.980> see<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.250> Aztec

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
in here and again you can see that Aztec

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.230 
in here and again you can see that Aztec
pattern<00:02:00.150> on<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> ship<00:02:01.490> one<00:02:02.490> thing<00:02:02.760> I<00:02:02.909> feel

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
pattern on the ship one thing I feel

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.660 
pattern on the ship one thing I feel
that<00:02:03.510> it's<00:02:03.780> lacking<00:02:04.050> is<00:02:04.470> there's<00:02:04.680> no<00:02:04.860> real

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
that it's lacking is there's no real

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.479 
that it's lacking is there's no real
details<00:02:06.270> along<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.020> edge<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.650> saucer<00:02:08.099> I

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
details along the edge of the saucer I

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.520 
details along the edge of the saucer I
think<00:02:09.269> there<00:02:09.390> should<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.569> some<00:02:09.840> sensor<00:02:10.289> lines

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
think there should be some sensor lines

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.830 
think there should be some sensor lines
or<00:02:11.009> some<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> window<00:02:11.970> details<00:02:12.420> or

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
or some of the window details or

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.380 
or some of the window details or
something<00:02:13.800> on<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.040> side<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.489> sauce<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
something on the side of the sauce the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.030 
something on the side of the sauce the
saucer<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:16.049> there<00:02:16.290> there<00:02:16.439> isn't<00:02:16.769> which<00:02:16.920> is

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
saucer but there there isn't which is

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.530 
saucer but there there isn't which is
kind<00:02:17.219> of<00:02:17.280> one<00:02:17.549> of<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:17.700> places<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.180> feel<00:02:18.389> is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
kind of one of the places I feel is

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.590 
kind of one of the places I feel is
lacking

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
lacking

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.570 
lacking
from<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.140> front<00:02:20.440> here<00:02:20.680> we'll<00:02:20.890> take<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.130> look<00:02:21.459> at

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
from the front here we'll take a look at

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.090 
from the front here we'll take a look at
it<00:02:21.730> from<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.060> front<00:02:22.500> -<00:02:23.500> I'll<00:02:23.650> look<00:02:23.860> pretty

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
it from the front - I'll look pretty

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.600 
it from the front - I'll look pretty
even<00:02:24.520> from<00:02:24.790> here<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.090> don't<00:02:25.330> think<00:02:25.569> -<00:02:25.870> ELLs<00:02:26.610> have

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
even from here I don't think - ELLs have

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.500 
even from here I don't think - ELLs have
that<00:02:28.060> uneven<00:02:28.750> issue<00:02:29.340> maybe<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.459> tiny<00:02:30.880> bit<00:02:31.240> you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
that uneven issue maybe a tiny bit you

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.059 
that uneven issue maybe a tiny bit you
can<00:02:31.750> kind<00:02:31.959> of<00:02:32.020> see<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.350> there<00:02:32.530> there<00:02:32.709> may<00:02:32.890> be<00:02:32.920> a

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
can kind of see it there there may be a

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.430 
can kind of see it there there may be a
tiny<00:02:33.340> little<00:02:33.490> bit<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:34.060> an<00:02:34.840> unevenness<00:02:35.380> and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
tiny little bit of an unevenness and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.340 
tiny little bit of an unevenness and
then<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.739> cells<00:02:35.950> but<00:02:36.130> nothing<00:02:36.489> too<00:02:36.760> bad

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
then the cells but nothing too bad

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.150 
then the cells but nothing too bad
bollocks<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.380> I've<00:02:38.560> heard<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:38.860> from

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
bollocks that I've heard that from

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.100 
bollocks that I've heard that from
various<00:02:39.550> people<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.090> internet<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
various people on the internet that the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.260 
various people on the internet that the
cells<00:02:41.470> are<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.680> bit<00:02:41.800> off<00:02:41.980> bottom<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.120> saw

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
cells are a bit off bottom of the saw

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.600 
cells are a bit off bottom of the saw
see<00:02:43.450> here<00:02:43.660> again<00:02:43.870> nice<00:02:44.560> as<00:02:44.800> teching<00:02:45.220> pattern

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
see here again nice as teching pattern

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.400 
see here again nice as teching pattern
no<00:02:46.150> registry<00:02:46.630> but<00:02:46.780> I'm<00:02:46.870> pretty<00:02:47.080> sure<00:02:47.170> it

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
no registry but I'm pretty sure it

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.930 
no registry but I'm pretty sure it
doesn't<00:02:47.650> have<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:47.800> registry<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.640> movie

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
doesn't have a registry in the movie

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.210 
doesn't have a registry in the movie
either<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:50.140> can<00:02:50.260> see<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.530> sensor<00:02:50.709> dome<00:02:50.950> here

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
either you can see the sensor dome here

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.130 
either you can see the sensor dome here
is<00:02:51.310> pretty<00:02:51.489> nice-looking<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.390> deflector<00:02:52.900> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
is pretty nice-looking the deflector a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.280 
is pretty nice-looking the deflector a

think<00:03:23.769> is<00:03:23.890> all<00:03:24.040> plastic<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.730> don't<00:03:24.910> think

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
think is all plastic I don't think

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.430 
think is all plastic I don't think
there's<00:03:25.209> much<00:03:25.360> vodcast<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.019> this<00:03:26.140> one<00:03:26.320> I<00:03:26.350> think

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
there's much vodcast to this one I think

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.160 
there's much vodcast to this one I think
it's<00:03:26.680> just<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:28.030> top<00:03:28.269> of<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.540> saucer<00:03:28.959> here

loose but again that couldn't that might

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.890 
loose but again that couldn't that might
not<00:03:35.530> be<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.680> universal<00:03:36.549> issue<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:37.570> could<00:03:37.750> just

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
not be a universal issue that could just

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.600 
not be a universal issue that could just
be<00:03:37.930> one<00:03:38.200> that's<00:03:38.410> with<00:03:38.739> certain<00:03:39.280> ones<00:03:39.430> like

I'm gonna cut here I'm gonna do some
size<00:03:42.850> comparisons<00:03:43.510> with<00:03:43.750> some<00:03:43.930> of<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.079> other

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
size comparisons with some of the other

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.610 
size comparisons with some of the other
2009<00:03:45.510> versions<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.690> ship<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:47.019> I<00:03:47.110> have<00:03:47.290> as

here with some size comparisons I'll run
through<00:04:02.859> what<00:04:03.130> we<00:04:03.250> have<00:04:03.459> here<00:04:03.959> this<00:04:04.959> guy<00:04:05.290> is

discrepancy<00:04:19.959> between<00:04:20.049> em<00:04:20.320> let<00:04:20.410> me<00:04:20.500> just<00:04:20.680> pull

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
discrepancy between em let me just pull

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.080 
discrepancy between em let me just pull
them<00:04:21.010> out<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:21.160> you<00:04:21.340> can<00:04:21.549> kind<00:04:21.700> of<00:04:21.760> see<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.060> bit

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
them out so you can kind of see it a bit

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.930 
them out so you can kind of see it a bit
better<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:23.560> is<00:04:23.680> quite<00:04:23.950> a<00:04:23.979> bit<00:04:24.220> larger<00:04:24.400> than<00:04:24.789> the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
better it is quite a bit larger than the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.700 
better it is quite a bit larger than the
normal<00:04:25.270> issues<00:04:25.630> are<00:04:25.840> which<00:04:26.050> is<00:04:26.200> really<00:04:26.500> nice

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
normal issues are which is really nice

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.649 
normal issues are which is really nice
so<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.700> refit<00:04:28.000> is<00:04:28.090> horrible

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
so the refit is horrible

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.970
