hi I'm speaking to you from a
Plantronics<00:00:03.659> 6:55<00:00:04.620> computer<00:00:05.160> headset<00:00:05.580> when<00:00:06.509> I

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
Plantronics 6:55 computer headset when I

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.660 
Plantronics 6:55 computer headset when I
plugged<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.080> headset<00:00:07.440> into<00:00:07.649> my<00:00:08.010> Windows<00:00:08.460> 7

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
plugged this headset into my Windows 7

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.570 
plugged this headset into my Windows 7
64<00:00:09.059> bit<00:00:09.450> computer<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.530> immediately<00:00:10.860> ran<00:00:11.219> into<00:00:11.550> a

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
64 bit computer I immediately ran into a

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.299 
64 bit computer I immediately ran into a
few<00:00:12.000> issues<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.690> found<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.500> lot<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:13.980> people

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
few issues that I found a lot of people

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.630 
few issues that I found a lot of people
were<00:00:14.370> having<00:00:15.139> the<00:00:16.139> first<00:00:16.379> issue<00:00:16.680> was<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.430> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
were having the first issue was that of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.599 
were having the first issue was that of
the<00:00:17.850> microphone<00:00:18.330> quality<00:00:18.890> so<00:00:19.890> while<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.490> hit

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the microphone quality so while you hit

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.130 
the microphone quality so while you hit
is<00:00:20.760> now<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.029> probably<00:00:21.449> are<00:00:21.570> thinking<00:00:21.750> to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
is now you probably are thinking to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.120 
is now you probably are thinking to
yourself<00:00:22.500> it's<00:00:22.680> not<00:00:22.710> really<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.980> best

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
yourself it's not really the best

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.130 
yourself it's not really the best
quality<00:00:23.640> but<00:00:23.820> at<00:00:23.939> least<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.240> understand<00:00:24.720> they

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
quality but at least you understand they

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.179 
quality but at least you understand they
can<00:00:25.320> hear<00:00:25.529> what<00:00:25.650> I'm<00:00:25.740> saying

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
can hear what I'm saying

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.609 
can hear what I'm saying
when<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:26.970> first<00:00:27.269> plugged<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.380> was<00:00:28.560> very

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
when I first plugged it in it was very

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.740 
when I first plugged it in it was very
very<00:00:29.039> difficult<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.609> make<00:00:30.000> out<00:00:30.119> any<00:00:30.449> type<00:00:30.720> of

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
very difficult to make out any type of

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.610 
very difficult to make out any type of
audio<00:00:31.439> whatsoever<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:33.660> issue<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
audio whatsoever the issue is that a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.430 
audio whatsoever the issue is that a
noise<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.670> very<00:00:35.730> present<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.690> prominent<00:00:37.290> on

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
noise is very present and prominent on

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.470 
noise is very present and prominent on
the<00:00:37.739> signal<00:00:38.160> coming<00:00:38.430> from<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.000> microphone

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the signal coming from the microphone

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.010 
the signal coming from the microphone
and<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.500> wasn't<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:40.950> typical<00:00:41.270> mains<00:00:42.270> hum<00:00:42.719> or

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and it wasn't your typical mains hum or

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.920 
and it wasn't your typical mains hum or
60<00:00:43.469> Hertz<00:00:43.730> ground<00:00:44.730> loop<00:00:45.059> types<00:00:45.390> down<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.809> get

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
60 Hertz ground loop types down you get

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.959 
60 Hertz ground loop types down you get
from<00:00:46.079> cheap<00:00:46.379> computer<00:00:46.800> or<00:00:46.950> Hardware<00:00:47.280> audio

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
from cheap computer or Hardware audio

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:48.440 
from cheap computer or Hardware audio
stuff

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
stuff

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.850 
stuff
it<00:00:49.260> was<00:00:49.440> definitely<00:00:51.110> cyclical<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.289> nature<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
it was definitely cyclical in nature and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.100 
it was definitely cyclical in nature and
sounded<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.190> an<00:00:53.399> oscillator<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.629> you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
sounded like an oscillator like up you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.779 
sounded like an oscillator like up you
know<00:00:55.199> pulsation<00:00:55.980> sounds<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> immediately

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
know pulsation sounds so I immediately

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.560 
know pulsation sounds so I immediately
thought<00:00:57.480> my<00:00:58.289> port<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.829> bad<00:00:59.070> my<00:00:59.789> USB<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.270> fried

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
thought my port is bad my USB is fried

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.439 
thought my port is bad my USB is fried
so<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.280> built<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.399> computer<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.000> naturally<00:01:03.420> I

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
so I built this computer so naturally I

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.479 
so I built this computer so naturally I
just<00:01:03.600> assume<00:01:03.840> everything's<00:01:04.170> wrong<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.739> plug<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
just assume everything's wrong I plug it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.149 
just assume everything's wrong I plug it
into<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.820> new<00:01:06.119> USB<00:01:06.450> port<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.409> noise<00:01:07.590> was

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
into a new USB port and the noise was

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.560 
into a new USB port and the noise was
actually<00:01:08.909> still<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.680> too<00:01:10.680> much<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.100> my<00:01:11.570> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
actually still there too much of my you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.289 
actually still there too much of my you
know<00:01:12.659> amazement<00:01:14.119> anyway

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
know amazement anyway

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.210 
know amazement anyway
I<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.630> tried<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.930> USB<00:01:16.500> 3.0<00:01:17.310> port<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:18.150> doing<00:01:18.780> so

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
I then tried a USB 3.0 port in doing so

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.090 
I then tried a USB 3.0 port in doing so
two<00:01:20.220> things<00:01:20.490> happen<00:01:20.990> first<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.200> all<00:01:22.380> for

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
two things happen first of all for

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.039 
two things happen first of all for
whatever<00:01:23.310> reason<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.060> computer<00:01:24.210> started<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
whatever reason the computer started to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.469 
whatever reason the computer started to
reinstall<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> software<00:01:26.270> reinstall<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
reinstall the software reinstall the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.140 
reinstall the software reinstall the
drivers<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.610> don't<00:01:29.610> know<00:01:29.759> why<00:01:29.939> that

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
drivers for this I don't know why that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.510 
drivers for this I don't know why that
is<00:01:30.390> maybe<00:01:31.320> had<00:01:31.530> something<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
is maybe had something to do with it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
is maybe had something to do with it
but<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.540> second<00:01:33.960> thing<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.439> noise

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
but the second thing is that the noise

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.740 
but the second thing is that the noise
actually<00:01:35.130> went<00:01:35.340> significantly<00:01:36.090> lower<00:01:36.390> in

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
actually went significantly lower in

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.020 
actually went significantly lower in
volume<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.829> still<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> little<00:01:38.640> bit<00:01:38.850> I'm

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
volume it's still there a little bit I'm

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.880 
volume it's still there a little bit I'm
actually<00:01:39.180> using<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.659> now<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> lot

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
actually using it now but it's a lot

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.340 
actually using it now but it's a lot
better

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
better

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.679 
better
apparently<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.799> issue<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.520> present<00:01:45.090> only<00:01:45.570> on

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
apparently this issue is present only on

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.639 
apparently this issue is present only on
the<00:01:45.840> 64-bit<00:01:46.649> version<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:47.369> Windows<00:01:47.430> 7<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.649> they

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the 64-bit version of Windows 7 and they

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.310 
the 64-bit version of Windows 7 and they
have<00:01:49.799> traced<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.310> back<00:01:50.340> through<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.320> don't

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
have traced it back through the I don't

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.499 
have traced it back through the I don't
know<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> DSP<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.130> whatnot<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.180> actual

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
know the DSP or whatnot on the actual

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.050 
know the DSP or whatnot on the actual
chipset<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.350> thing<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.700> deep

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
chipset for this thing so it's this deep

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.870 
chipset for this thing so it's this deep
ingrained<00:01:57.299> problem<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.469> headset<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
ingrained problem with this headset the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.969 
ingrained problem with this headset the
good<00:02:00.060> news<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.659> said<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.079> used<00:02:01.320> USB
