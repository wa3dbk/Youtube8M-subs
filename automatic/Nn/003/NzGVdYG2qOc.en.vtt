00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
quite a few more let's see here if I

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.270 
quite a few more let's see here if I
could<00:00:56.629> get<00:00:56.749> the<00:00:56.870> bubble<00:00:57.289> wrap<00:00:57.440> now<00:00:58.100> they

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
could get the bubble wrap now they

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.559 
could get the bubble wrap now they
didn't<00:00:58.489> need<00:00:58.609> those<00:00:58.819> to<00:00:59.030> protect<00:00:59.449> them

00:00:59.559 --> 00:00:59.569 
didn't need those to protect them

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:01.149 
didn't need those to protect them
obviously<00:00:59.719> but<00:01:00.260> pretty<00:01:00.679> sure<00:01:00.710> they<00:01:00.920> put<00:01:01.039> them

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
obviously but pretty sure they put them

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.810 
obviously but pretty sure they put them
in<00:01:01.280> bubble<00:01:01.550> wrap<00:01:01.579> just<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:02.269> they<00:01:02.449> don't

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
in bubble wrap just so that they don't

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.850 
in bubble wrap just so that they don't
fall<00:01:04.820> out<00:01:04.850> or<00:01:05.300> get<00:01:05.479> lost<00:01:05.870> and<00:01:06.170> shipping<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:09.770> I

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
fall out or get lost and shipping and I

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.580 
fall out or get lost and shipping and I
got<00:01:10.010> it<00:01:10.130> set<00:01:10.310> of<00:01:10.400> gold<00:01:10.640> ones<00:01:10.940> just<00:01:11.930> set<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.260> black

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
got it set of gold ones just set a black

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.850 
got it set of gold ones just set a black
one<00:01:12.860> instead<00:01:13.729> of<00:01:13.850> light<00:01:14.300> ones<00:01:14.650> which<00:01:15.650> I'm

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
one instead of light ones which I'm

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.950 
one instead of light ones which I'm
hoping<00:01:16.070> are<00:01:16.400> not<00:01:16.610> quite<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.090> same<00:01:17.270> colors<00:01:17.659> and

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
hoping are not quite the same colors and

hoping are not quite the same colors and
silver<00:01:18.380> ones<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:20.060> they<00:01:20.240> pretty<00:01:20.509> much<00:01:20.689> are<00:01:20.960> so

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
silver ones that they pretty much are so

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.889 
silver ones that they pretty much are so
these<00:01:23.210> are<00:01:23.390> like<00:01:23.649> $13<00:01:24.649> a<00:01:24.680> set<00:01:25.100> for<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.060> $30<00:01:26.719> at

some different colors so that when I put
a<00:01:53.750> pattern<00:01:53.990> together<00:01:54.439> you<00:01:54.649> know<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:54.770> can<00:01:54.950> see

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
a pattern together you know I can see

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.590 
a pattern together you know I can see
the<00:01:55.189> different<00:01:55.549> patterns<00:01:55.820> or<00:01:56.119> whatever<00:01:56.359> so

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
the different patterns or whatever so

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.630 
the different patterns or whatever so
we'll<00:01:57.200> see<00:01:57.380> I<00:01:57.530> guess<00:01:58.009> if<00:01:58.250> you're<00:01:58.399> not
