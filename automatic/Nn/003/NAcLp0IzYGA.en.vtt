reasons<00:02:01.390> one<00:02:01.990> it's<00:02:02.560> going<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.770> hit<00:02:02.890> you<00:02:03.009> a<00:02:03.040> lot

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
reasons one it's going to hit you a lot

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.430 
reasons one it's going to hit you a lot
harder<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.670> faster<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.750> secondly<00:02:05.170> at<00:02:05.350> the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
harder and faster and secondly at the

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.719 
harder and faster and secondly at the
end<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.650> your<00:02:05.740> workout<00:02:06.100> you're<00:02:06.430> not<00:02:06.550> going<00:02:06.670> to

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
crash it'll slowly taper off because the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.830 
crash it'll slowly taper off because the
three<00:02:09.490> different<00:02:09.759> types<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.090> caffeine<00:02:10.540> kind

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
three different types of caffeine kind

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.140 
three different types of caffeine kind
of<00:02:10.959> they'll<00:02:11.770> work<00:02:12.070> out<00:02:12.280> differently<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:13.000> most

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
of they'll work out differently so most

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.640 
of they'll work out differently so most
