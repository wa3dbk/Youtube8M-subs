 10% jean-michel baylet the bottom of the recourse to this caravan between the two 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.120
 cities the opportunity for us to approach the size organizations it rests 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.040
 essentially 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.820
 about the father and mother of jean-michel 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.559
 and christian palka 30 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.239
 a quality family environment that is probably no stranger to 

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:19.759
 the success of jean-michel 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.060
 even though he is now licensed for the United States 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.489

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.649
 not on the circumstances in the present while the liberal leader in 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.130
 point the problem will continue until Saturday 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.430
 we are fortunate to be in the organization of the omra and to approach 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.489
 a long enough career chart in retirement is a black-blooded affair 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.180
 with an 80-year salary by giving up the reservations in his place while that 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.770
 is not there 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.670
 on the other hand she opened the door Monday night at home the parties have 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.730
 interest to review in the voice 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.010
 the ben ali system is necessary to add the effectiveness of the team Morocco 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.280
 and understand why jean-michel is already leading the world championship 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.710
 for his first season in 2 5% 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.200
 but for now after the cramps and the abandonment in the first inning the 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.290
 French are preparing for the second 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.370
 but she special code to avoid a region version this old 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.590
 responsible 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.310
 yet after some great prices including 250 in our opinion very well if we 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.020
 had to say the biggest difference with the 125 parallel launch 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.950
 with that of last year and as driving 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.500
 anna hazare was placed in custody before we began our ascent 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.090

 funding this pilot phase with the problem here it's like that one 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.350
 has known for a long time to earn less expensive 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.350
 the recent case concerning the 3 valleys 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.940
 while the 30,000 spectators will return to the edge of the circuit to close 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.210
 jean-michel baylet makes his calculations 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.619
 the five points of the winner of the first run and distribution are not 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.330
 not gone to outsiders only the wind of freedom and the Finnish 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.810
 messing around announced the right operation by finishing third respectively 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.360
 and fourth 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.619
 in the second run that just left bayle will have to squeeze the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.619
