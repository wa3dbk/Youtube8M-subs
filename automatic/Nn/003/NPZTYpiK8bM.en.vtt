00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.439
 in the last week 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.429
 finish 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.970
 hello friends welcome to our sep program and portal tips 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:30.640
 brother 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.040
 in this space we will approach the world the plants in an easy and 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.620
 affordable and sometimes from home you can follow it without any problem the only thing 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.200
 that you have to pay a little attention 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.970
 we will talk about something as basic as a network how to solve the problem of 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.820
 watering when we are absent at home 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.240
 the primordial do not leave me the plants any place with direct light nor london 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.940
 of alternating currents apart is a little indirect light and assumption but 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.000
 well let's solve the wheat problem 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.250
 three tips 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.640
 first of all we take a bottle 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.940
 an agreement we introduce it inside the bottle and with this aim I do not fear 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.330
 inside the earth 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.370
 In this way the water will flow through our plant to capillarity 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.340
 another very simple advice to choose another bottle 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.580
 we do it a little little holes you see how I 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.180
 we turn it kiko tango such water will flow to our land that summer 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.060
 we cover 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.930
 and the third council and for me the most infallible of all is its owner 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.970
 avon sherry 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.970
 we took before we were a little bit the plant with water we removed the lid and 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.900
 we put on top of it this way we will have the plant watered for 15 to 30 days without 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.180
 No problem has been clear to have 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.450
 let's go over 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.299
 support tricks labor washed with the rope the bottle ugeraga and the most infallible 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.990
 of all its owner 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.350
 good friend hope to see you soon our program of the clash with the 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.190
 gardens 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.930

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.930
