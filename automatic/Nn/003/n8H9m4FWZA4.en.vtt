be cool to have a guitar like that and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.740 
be cool to have a guitar like that and
finally<00:00:20.520> after<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.910> while<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.180> thought<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.689> would

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
finally after a while I thought it would

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.050 
finally after a while I thought it would
be<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.380> know<00:00:22.470> having<00:00:22.800> done<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> couple<00:00:23.250> /<00:00:23.640> model

be you know having done a couple / model

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
be you know having done a couple / model
Les<00:00:24.210> Paul's<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.779> would<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:25.080> fitting<00:00:25.410> at<00:00:25.830> this

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
Les Paul's it would be fitting at this

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.460 
Les Paul's it would be fitting at this
particular<00:00:26.580> point<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.180> time<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.750> do<00:00:27.960> an<00:00:28.170> actual

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
particular point in time to do an actual

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.880 
particular point in time to do an actual
Appetite<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.210> Destruction<00:00:30.289> Les<00:00:31.289> Paul<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.830> it

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
Appetite for Destruction Les Paul so it

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.270 
Appetite for Destruction Les Paul so it
was<00:00:31.980> basically<00:00:32.809> an<00:00:33.809> effort<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.440> was<00:00:34.860> really

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
was basically an effort that was really

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.459 
was basically an effort that was really
for<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.790> fans<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.600> something<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.110> them<00:00:37.230> I

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
for the fans to do something for them I

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.430 
for the fans to do something for them I
think<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.520> probably<00:00:38.850> about<00:00:39.140> it's<00:00:40.140> probably

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
think it's probably about it's probably

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.160

about<00:00:40.590> six<00:00:41.100> years<00:00:41.399> an<00:00:41.790> idea<00:00:42.180> that's<00:00:42.480> been<00:00:42.690> sort

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
about six years an idea that's been sort

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.209 
about six years an idea that's been sort
of<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> back<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.770> my<00:00:43.800> head<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:46.010> it's<00:00:47.010> funny

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
of in the back of my head and it's funny

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.750 
of in the back of my head and it's funny

original pickups that I used in the 80s
which<00:01:20.549> surprisingly<00:01:21.450> enough<00:01:21.720> there's<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
which surprisingly enough there's a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.510 
which surprisingly enough there's a
pretty<00:01:22.229> big<00:01:22.439> difference<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> way<00:01:23.369> they

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
pretty big difference but the way they

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.510 
pretty big difference but the way they
were<00:01:23.580> they're<00:01:24.390> wrapped<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.229> also<00:01:26.189> some<00:01:26.490> of

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
were they're wrapped and also some of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.030 
were they're wrapped and also some of
the<00:01:26.990> material<00:01:27.990> that's<00:01:28.170> used<00:01:28.290> sort<00:01:28.950> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the material that's used sort of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.890 
the material that's used sort of
advanced<00:01:29.610> over<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> years<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.570> these<00:01:30.720> are

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
advanced over the years and so these are

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.520 
advanced over the years and so these are
like<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.049> originals<00:01:31.880> old<00:01:32.880> old<00:01:33.360> style<00:01:33.810> speed

we're<00:01:47.880> actually<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.509> bit<00:01:48.720> hard<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> find

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
we're actually a little bit hard to find

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.600 
we're actually a little bit hard to find
in<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.799> thing<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.570> jumbo<00:01:51.899> frets<00:01:52.170> and

possibility is available abilities on

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.879 
possibility is available abilities on
these<00:05:27.639> things<00:05:27.850> it<00:05:28.810> became<00:05:29.260> a<00:05:29.320> great<00:05:29.620> way<00:05:29.830> to

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
these things it became a great way to

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.029 
these things it became a great way to
sort<00:05:30.220> of<00:05:30.370> reach<00:05:30.520> out<00:05:30.760> and<00:05:30.940> be<00:05:31.060> able<00:05:31.120> to<00:05:32.039> get

and I think it's great you can do your

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.490 
and I think it's great you can do your
own<00:05:37.930> updates<00:05:38.530> you<00:05:38.860> can<00:05:38.889> obviously<00:05:40.320> find<00:05:41.320> out

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
own updates you can obviously find out

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.589 
own updates you can obviously find out
in<00:05:41.800> real<00:05:42.130> time<00:05:42.400> what<00:05:42.700> people<00:05:43.240> think<00:05:43.419> about

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
in real time what people think about

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.600 
in real time what people think about
whatever<00:05:44.410> it<00:05:44.620> is<00:05:44.710> that<00:05:44.889> you've<00:05:45.010> got<00:05:45.039> going<00:05:45.160> on

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
whatever it is that you've got going on

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.279 
whatever it is that you've got going on
and<00:05:45.940> you<00:05:46.000> can<00:05:46.180> sort<00:05:46.330> of<00:05:46.450> just<00:05:46.630> interact<00:05:47.080> with

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
and you can sort of just interact with

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:53.180 
and you can sort of just interact with
them<00:05:47.940> a<00:05:48.940> lot<00:05:49.599> easier<00:05:49.930> than<00:05:50.440> you<00:05:50.620> can<00:05:50.729> by<00:05:51.729> using

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
them a lot easier than you can by using

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.950 
them a lot easier than you can by using
you<00:05:54.190> know<00:05:54.400> press<00:05:54.700> updates<00:05:55.210> and<00:05:55.540> stuff<00:05:55.810> like

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
you know press updates and stuff like

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.530 
you know press updates and stuff like
that<00:05:56.020> so<00:05:56.410> I<00:05:56.440> think<00:05:56.560> it's<00:05:56.800> a<00:05:56.950> huge<00:05:57.190> benefit<00:05:57.670> well

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
that so I think it's a huge benefit well

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.630 
that so I think it's a huge benefit well
