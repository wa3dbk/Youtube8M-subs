00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.339
 what a peaceful picture and the 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.130
 Bees are busy again 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.900
 happiness because we would be our environment and 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.450
 our menu without the bees 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.670
 appearance 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.490
 Without the pollination by bees there would be 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.220
 hardly any fruit vegetables wild plants 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.710
 plant seeds the birds and smallest 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.439
 to serve as source of food 80 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.779
 percent of our crops are on 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.119
 the pollination by bees instructed 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.489
 without them our food would become 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.149
 dramatically reduce the range and the 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.350
 nature would impoverish scientists 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.989
 beat alarm 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.750
 There is a mass extinction of birds 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.870
 amphibians and insects instead 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.910
 It always gets quiet on our fields 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.760
 more often studies suggest that 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.680
 chemical pesticides 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.850
 so-called pesticide essential 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.970
 influence on this frightening 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.800
 decline in biodiversity 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.800
 Pesticides are toxic to them 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.040
 The most detrimental are those that are developed 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.649
 so-called neonicotinoids highly effective 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.500
 Nerve toxins that also bumble bees 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:15.100
 Kill butterflies and other insects 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.469
 poisoning waters make amphibians 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.609
 barren and accumulate in the 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.999
 food chain 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:25.679
 with sustainable dangerous consequences for 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:28.569
 animal and human about 46,000 tons 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:31.209
 highly toxic pesticides are being used each year 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:32.759
 Only in Germany does this time sell 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:36.249
 madness to stop 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.189
 But like in Germany there are only 109 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:41.679
 Checkers for pesticide use in 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.889
 over 300,000 agricultural 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.229
 We had to supervise the operation 

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:48.549
 thousands of checkers the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.270
 Track pesticides immediately 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:55.389
 utopian priceless impossible no the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.009
 bees can save us we make them 

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:58.859
 to lock environment 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.840
 a completely new procedure 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.939
 Enables environmental information from 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.250
 bees through a measuring station in the 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.350
 register hive 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.200
 in real time via the internet further 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.260
 Lead a bee colony with thousands 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.000
 can control flying environment 30 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.010
 square kilometer monitor 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.740
 the environmental spear is being developed 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.720
 procedure by the neurobiologist 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.500
 Professor Randolf Menzel von der Fau 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.620
 Berlin 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.560
 the ecological beekeeper association military iv 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.630
 has now taken the initiative and 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.600
 started a crowd funding action 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.970
 so that the environmental spear measuring stations can participate 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.489
 your help 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.320
 initially ten bee colonies are said to be involved 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.600
 the highly sensitive measuring technology 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.500
 be equipped 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.959
 long-term goal is one 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.790
 Germany-wide network of independent 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:54.409
 to build up environmental taxes 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.450
 a measuring station costs 2350 euro 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:00.340
 ten bee colonies with stations 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.810
 to equip therefore 23.500 euro 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.700
 Every little contribution comes together 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.609
 helps to fill the pot 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.769
 comes together more mellifera ev 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:15.280
 even more for the protection of the bee 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:18.290
 Mensch natur do at www.medi.de 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.480
 slash environmentally spear can you 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.010
 help fill the pot 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.010
 every contribution counts
