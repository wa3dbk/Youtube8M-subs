first of all it shows that there's a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:45.819 
but actually a genetic predisposition

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.950 
but actually a genetic predisposition
for<00:00:46.569> it<00:00:46.899> the<00:00:47.559> exciting<00:00:48.100> thing<00:00:48.370> is<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:49.539> can<00:00:49.719> if

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
for it the exciting thing is we can if

for it the exciting thing is we can if
we<00:00:49.989> know<00:00:50.260> that<00:00:50.440> there's<00:00:50.620> a<00:00:50.679> genetic

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.069 
we know that there's a genetic

we know that there's a genetic
predisposition<00:00:51.249> for<00:00:51.940> this<00:00:52.149> we<00:00:52.269> can<00:00:52.449> start<00:00:52.690> to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
predisposition for this we can start to

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.110 
predisposition for this we can start to

to<00:00:58.780> reduce<00:00:59.109> it<00:00:59.350> and<00:00:59.440> eventually<00:00:59.679> be<00:01:00.129> able<00:01:00.219> to

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
to reduce it and eventually be able to

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.329 
to reduce it and eventually be able to
test<00:01:00.760> for<00:01:01.030> that<00:01:01.179> before<00:01:01.449> we<00:01:01.929> breed<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:03.249> the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
test for that before we breed and the

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.130 
test for that before we breed and the
other<00:01:03.489> thing<00:01:03.639> I<00:01:03.699> think<00:01:03.909> it<00:01:04.059> validates<00:01:04.629> is<00:01:04.870> for

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
other thing I think it validates is for
