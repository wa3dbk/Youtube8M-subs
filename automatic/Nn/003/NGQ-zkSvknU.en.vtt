in<00:00:00.420> this<00:00:00.570> video<00:00:00.870> I'm<00:00:01.050> going<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.350> show<00:00:01.560> you<00:00:01.589> how

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.730 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.030> measure<00:00:03.030> valve<00:00:03.449> installed<00:00:03.929> height<00:00:04.290> you

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
to measure valve installed height you

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.980 
to measure valve installed height you
use<00:00:04.920> this<00:00:05.100> tool<00:00:05.430> right<00:00:05.670> here<00:00:05.870> there<00:00:06.870> are

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
use this tool right here there are

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.680 
use this tool right here there are
different<00:00:07.350> different<00:00:08.099> fittings<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.730> fit

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
different different fittings that fit

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.320 
different different fittings that fit
different<00:00:10.080> cylinder<00:00:10.410> heads<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.179> you<00:00:12.179> have

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
different cylinder heads and you have

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.930 
different cylinder heads and you have
two<00:00:12.570> options<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:13.469> how<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.650> do<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.849> course

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
two options of how to do that of course

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.580 
two options of how to do that of course
a<00:00:15.240> dial<00:00:15.450> indicator<00:00:15.540> can't<00:00:16.139> measure<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
a dial indicator can't measure the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.730 
a dial indicator can't measure the
height<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:17.010> anything<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.490> only<00:00:17.609> compares

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
height of anything it only compares

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.560 
height of anything it only compares
Heights<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.980> two<00:00:20.130> things<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.359> have<00:00:21.390> to

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
Heights of two things so you have to

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.939 
Heights of two things so you have to
zero<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.990> one<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.410> can<00:00:22.500> bring<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.890> down

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
zero it one is we can bring this down

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.800 
zero it one is we can bring this down
until<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.490> just<00:00:23.730> sticks<00:00:23.939> below<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.600> surface

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
until it just sticks below the surface

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.980 
until it just sticks below the surface
of<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.230> blue<00:00:25.529> piece<00:00:26.010> there<00:00:26.869> tighten<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
of that blue piece there tighten that

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.439 
of that blue piece there tighten that
allen<00:00:28.349> wrench<00:00:28.760> and<00:00:29.760> now<00:00:29.939> when<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.269> come<00:00:30.390> down

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
allen wrench and now when we come down

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.440 
allen wrench and now when we come down
here<00:00:31.099> put<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> flat<00:00:32.520> surface<00:00:32.700> it'll<00:00:33.360> move

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
here put on a flat surface it'll move

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
here put on a flat surface it'll move
that<00:00:33.630> needle<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.489> we<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.640> zero<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:37.309> and<00:00:38.309> now

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
that needle and we can zero it and now

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.860 
that needle and we can zero it and now
we<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.790> compare<00:00:39.059> everything<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.450> measure<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
we can compare everything we measure to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.410 
we can compare everything we measure to
that<00:00:39.899> right<00:00:40.260> there<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.520> other<00:00:41.640> option<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.149> if

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
that right there the other option is if

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.540 
that right there the other option is if
the<00:00:42.870> valve<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.230> taller<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.129> tall<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.399> this

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the valve is taller so tall that this

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.340 
the valve is taller so tall that this
won't<00:00:44.670> work<00:00:47.690> we'll<00:00:48.690> use<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.020> inch

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
won't work we'll use this one inch

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.810 
won't work we'll use this one inch
standard<00:00:49.620> right<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> one-inch

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
standard right here this is a one-inch

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.380 
standard right here this is a one-inch
piece<00:00:52.340> we'll<00:00:53.340> put<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> violin<00:00:53.940> feeder<00:00:54.210> right

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
piece we'll put the violin feeder right

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.760 
piece we'll put the violin feeder right
there<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.899> move<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.170> down<00:00:55.289> until<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.680> just

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
there and move it down until it just

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.660 
there and move it down until it just
barely<00:00:55.890> touches

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.320 

like<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:06.540> tighten<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.720> allen<00:01:08.140> wrench<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
like that tighten the allen wrench the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.270 
like that tighten the allen wrench the
allen<00:01:10.570> nut<00:01:13.320> bring<00:01:14.320> down<00:01:14.500> there<00:01:14.650> and<00:01:14.830> zero<00:01:15.040> it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
allen nut bring down there and zero it

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.490 
allen nut bring down there and zero it
and<00:01:16.150> we'll<00:01:16.270> just<00:01:16.300> add<00:01:16.540> one<00:01:16.780> inch<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.229> whatever

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
and we'll just add one inch to whatever

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.320 
and we'll just add one inch to whatever
we<00:01:17.680> measure<00:01:17.890> now<00:01:18.130> because<00:01:18.700> we<00:01:18.850> have<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.180> one

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
we measure now because we have that one

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.219 
we measure now because we have that one
inch<00:01:19.510> standard<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.160> zero<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:22.050> we<00:01:23.050> come

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
inch standard so a zero that we come

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.890 
inch standard so a zero that we come
over<00:01:23.259> to<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.650> cylinder<00:01:24.100> head<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:25.570> put<00:01:25.600> the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
over to the cylinder head we put the

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.340 
over to the cylinder head we put the
valve<00:01:26.110> back<00:01:26.380> in<00:01:27.990> make<00:01:28.990> sure<00:01:29.110> it's<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.320> same

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
valve back in make sure it's the same

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.670 
valve back in make sure it's the same
valve<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:29.860> came<00:01:30.040> out<00:01:30.190> of<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.490> same<00:01:30.940> hole

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
valve that came out of the same hole

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.410 
valve that came out of the same hole
push<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:32.800> in<00:01:32.920> tight<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.640> hold<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.000> up<00:01:37.119> with<00:01:37.240> one

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
push it in tight and hold it up with one

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.950 
push it in tight and hold it up with one
hand<00:01:38.009> while<00:01:39.009> you<00:01:39.160> place<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:39.520> tool<00:01:39.729> on<00:01:40.000> the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
hand while you place the tool on the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.990 
hand while you place the tool on the
valve<00:01:41.170> at<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.410> other<00:01:41.530> hand<00:01:41.800> now<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.610> secret

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
valve at the other hand now the secret

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.219 
valve at the other hand now the secret
here<00:01:43.149> is<00:01:43.180> you're<00:01:43.420> going<00:01:43.539> to<00:01:43.690> have<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.020> count

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
here is you're going to have to count

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.160 
here is you're going to have to count
the<00:01:44.350> revolutions<00:01:44.920> on<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.160> first<00:01:45.369> valve<00:01:46.170> so

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
the revolutions on the first valve so

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.529 
the revolutions on the first valve so
we'll<00:01:47.320> count<00:01:47.530> right<00:01:48.280> there's<00:01:48.520> zero<00:01:49.390> and

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
we'll count right there's zero and

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:55.200 
we'll count right there's zero and
there's<00:01:49.690> one<00:01:50.200> revolution<00:01:50.770> two<00:01:51.119> three<00:01:54.210> four

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
there's one revolution two three four

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:04.710 
there's one revolution two three four
five<00:01:56.020> six<00:01:56.800> seven<00:01:57.610> eight<00:01:58.450> nine<00:01:59.970> ten<00:02:03.720> eleven

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
five six seven eight nine ten eleven

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.300 
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve<00:02:05.200> thirteen<00:02:08.610> thirteen<00:02:09.610> revolutions<00:02:10.269> and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
twelve thirteen thirteen revolutions and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.699 
twelve thirteen thirteen revolutions and
so<00:02:12.310> we<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:12.670> ten<00:02:13.450> revolutions<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:14.079> one<00:02:14.230> inch<00:02:14.440> so

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
so we and ten revolutions is one inch so

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.800 
so we and ten revolutions is one inch so
we<00:02:14.739> say<00:02:14.980> one<00:02:15.910> inch<00:02:16.090> plus<00:02:16.329> thirteen

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
we say one inch plus thirteen

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.819 
we say one inch plus thirteen
revolutions<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.620> makes<00:02:17.829> two<00:02:18.250> inches<00:02:19.829> two

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
revolutions so that makes two inches two

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.960 
revolutions so that makes two inches two
point<00:02:21.190> three<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.829> then<00:02:23.829> four<00:02:24.130> zero<00:02:24.459> so<00:02:24.850> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
point three and then four zero so the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.440 
point three and then four zero so the
height<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.299> valve<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:25.900> two<00:02:26.200> point<00:02:26.590> three

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
height of that valve is two point three

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.900

four zero now on the rest of these
valves<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.390> won't<00:02:31.540> have<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.810> count<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
valves you won't have to count the

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.449 
valves you won't have to count the
revolutions<00:02:32.590> again<00:02:32.860> because<00:02:33.130> we<00:02:33.220> know<00:02:33.340> that

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
revolutions again because we know that

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.670 
revolutions again because we know that
they'll<00:02:33.579> be<00:02:33.640> very<00:02:33.700> close

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
they'll be very close

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.810 
they'll be very close
but<00:02:35.680> we<00:02:35.739> just<00:02:35.829> want<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.130> find<00:02:36.310> out<00:02:36.459> what<00:02:36.700> the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
but we just want to find out what the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.060 
but we just want to find out what the
installed<00:02:37.510> height<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.769> very

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
installed height is this is a very

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.430 
installed height is this is a very
important<00:02:39.519> measurement<00:02:40.260> especially<00:02:41.260> if<00:02:41.320> you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
important measurement especially if you

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.729 
important measurement especially if you
have<00:02:41.560> an<00:02:41.799> import<00:02:42.190> car<00:02:42.489> with<00:02:43.380> bucket<00:02:44.380> lifters

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
have an import car with bucket lifters

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.360 
have an import car with bucket lifters
where<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.340> only<00:02:45.549> way<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:45.910> adjust<00:02:46.120> valve<00:02:47.370> lash

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
where the only way to adjust valve lash

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.630 
where the only way to adjust valve lash
is<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:49.269> grind<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.750> tip<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.079> valve<00:02:50.640> having

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
is to grind the tip of the valve having

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.920 
is to grind the tip of the valve having
the<00:02:51.730> measurement<00:02:52.150> beforehand<00:02:52.780> and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
the measurement beforehand and

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.900 
the measurement beforehand and
afterwards<00:02:53.410> will<00:02:53.620> help<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:54.040> grind<00:02:54.700> that

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
afterwards will help you to grind that

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.610 
afterwards will help you to grind that
valve<00:02:55.120> without<00:02:55.780> putting<00:02:56.079> the<00:02:56.230> head<00:02:56.380> together

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
valve without putting the head together

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.250 
valve without putting the head together
so<00:02:56.829> many<00:02:56.950> times
