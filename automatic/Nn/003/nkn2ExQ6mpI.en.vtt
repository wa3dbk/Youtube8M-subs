00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.380
 a very nice design of princess like 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.840
 since she is the one you like 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.689
 princesses and well then let's start 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.180
 to do it we will need pink 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.039
 first I know that we are going to apply for 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.580
 do what is the crown of the princess 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.189
 and we are going to use our brush the one 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.900
 is in the form of petal the silver and 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.320
 let's load it very well of paint 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.320
 [Music] 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.660
 and let's start by making a line in 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.440
 this part of the forehead like this 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.180
 [Music] 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.350
 good 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.350
 [Music] 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.610
 now let's do like a triangle in 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.620
 this part we climb up 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.960
 [Music] 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.780
 and we are going to fill it 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.090
 [Music] 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.740
 and nothing else here we run a little bit more 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.350
 to give it better the shape of the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.560
 crown 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.540
 [Music] 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.600
 and good here has already been applied 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.990
 what is the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.259
 part that goes pink now with a 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.049
 sponge we are going to put a little bit of 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.740
 pink too but the shortest one for 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.140
 put what is on the cheeks 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.840
 [Music] 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.690
 and also previously I put a little 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.720
 of blue if we did not eat it like that to put 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.990
 a little in this part of the eyelids 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.990
 color blue 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.430
 [Music] 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.560
 now nothing else with our brush 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.030
 and we are going to occupy the brush number 6 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.219
 round 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.750
 let's load it with white paint to 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.380
 start doing the details of the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.380
 food 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.390
 we load very well of paint I'm 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.390
 using white effects damon 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.690
 and well let's start making some 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.690
 little dots around the crown 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:46.870
 [Music] 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.110
 here in this part we are going to draw you 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.520
 well in a line 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.840
 and we do it down it will be logical 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.150
 [Music] 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.790
 following what is the bread also 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.220
 we go down we make a land and then 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.130
 here we are going to make him nothing more than three 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.260
 chips 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.450
 [Music] 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.260
 so that we stay like this and the same 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.260
 we do the other side 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.180
 and we put three dots 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.990
 here on the cheeks let's draw him 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.220
 some stars 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.370
 [Music] 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.069
 and we still lack some types in what 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.950
 what is the crown 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:37.330
 let's also draw some tips 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.330
 to be noticed 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:53.199
 [Music] 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.410
 let's put other but in shape 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.050
 found from bottom to top 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.840
 [Music] 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.960
 let's close here with the points 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.660
 [Music] 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.660
 let's do two other filters here 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:23.280
 [Music] 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.370
 and in this part it is optional they can 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.740
 Do some words or you can do it 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.310
 simply other titles and good will be 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.140
 easier to make the times 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.140
 as I said they can do it 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:57.070
 here as a chinito 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:05:00.010
 [Music] 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.440
 and in the middle part if they do not have to 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.840
 put what is the acrylic gem 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.730
 I'm going to put this acrylic sprig if 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.440
 they do not have you can draw a 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.860
 little heart and you will also see them very 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.860
 beautiful 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.439
 [Music] 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.930
 [Music]

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.900
 [Music] 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.570
 if we have a little more time 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.250
 we can add some details about 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.030
 dots more here that will give you a 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.030
 enhance the design 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.620
