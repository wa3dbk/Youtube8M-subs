position<00:01:03.970> uh-huh<00:01:04.540> arms<00:01:04.989> up<00:01:05.080> front<00:01:05.410> kind<00:01:06.250> of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
position uh-huh arms up front kind of

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.100 
position uh-huh arms up front kind of
squared<00:01:06.670> there<00:01:06.910> and<00:01:07.120> all<00:01:07.720> we're<00:01:07.810> going<00:01:07.900> to<00:01:07.960> do

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
squared there and all we're going to do

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.830 
squared there and all we're going to do
is<00:01:08.229> just<00:01:08.350> put<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.620> blade<00:01:08.830> in<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.010> water<00:01:09.220> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
is just put the blade in the water and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.120 
is just put the blade in the water and
rotate<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:14.350> great<00:01:14.500> it's<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:14.860> great<00:01:14.890> way

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
rotate so this is great it's a great way

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.070 
rotate so this is great it's a great way
to<00:01:15.190> start<00:01:15.520> just<00:01:16.210> pulling<00:01:16.509> some<00:01:16.690> water<00:01:16.869> back

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
to start just pulling some water back

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.630 
to start just pulling some water back
and<00:01:17.320> forth<00:01:17.560> we're<00:01:17.950> going<00:01:18.100> forward<00:01:18.430> that's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
and forth we're going forward that's

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.820 
and forth we're going forward that's
wonderful<00:01:18.970> when<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:19.930> go<00:01:20.080> backwards<00:01:20.290> we<00:01:20.650> just

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
wonderful when you go backwards we just

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.680 
wonderful when you go backwards we just
reverse<00:01:21.160> the<00:01:21.220> direction<00:01:21.550> now<00:01:22.270> we're<00:01:22.420> pushing

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
reverse the direction now we're pushing

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.960 
reverse the direction now we're pushing
water<00:01:22.930> away<00:01:23.170> from<00:01:23.259> us<00:01:23.560> that's<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.610> yeah

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
water away from us that's it yeah

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.150 
water away from us that's it yeah
exactly<00:01:25.479> so<00:01:26.229> in<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:26.350> turn<00:01:26.590> we're<00:01:26.890> just<00:01:26.950> going<00:01:27.100> to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
exactly so in a turn we're just going to

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.620 
exactly so in a turn we're just going to
alternate<00:01:27.550> between<00:01:27.580> that<00:01:28.060> forward<00:01:28.479> and

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
alternate between that forward and

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.630 
alternate between that forward and
reverse<00:01:29.140> stroke<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:29.890> we<00:01:29.950> can<00:01:30.070> go<00:01:30.160> forward

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
reverse stroke so we can go forward

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.700 
reverse stroke so we can go forward
stroke<00:01:30.940> on<00:01:31.060> one<00:01:31.180> side<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.720> then<00:01:32.350> we<00:01:32.440> can<00:01:32.590> go

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
stroke on one side and then we can go

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.260 
stroke on one side and then we can go
reverse<00:01:33.369> on<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.240> other<00:01:34.650> forward<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:36.270> reverse

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
reverse on the other forward and reverse

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.870 
reverse on the other forward and reverse
and<00:01:37.860> eventually<00:01:38.860> we<00:01:39.040> do<00:01:39.220> thing<00:01:39.490> called<00:01:39.759> a

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
and eventually we do thing called a

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.820 
and eventually we do thing called a
pivot<00:01:40.210> here's<00:01:40.479> my<00:01:40.540> most<00:01:40.869> important<00:01:41.410> question

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
pivot here's my most important question

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.190 
pivot here's my most important question
yes<00:01:42.040> how<00:01:42.369> easy<00:01:42.759> is<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.270> turn<00:01:43.570> this<00:01:43.750> over<00:01:43.960> and

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
yes how easy is it to turn this over and

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.990 
yes how easy is it to turn this over and
proving<00:01:44.440> your<00:01:44.560> fall<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:44.979> water<00:01:45.160> you<00:01:45.820> have

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
proving your fall in the water you have

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.850 
proving your fall in the water you have
to<00:01:46.210> try<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.509> turn<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.780> over<00:01:46.930> so<00:01:47.290> if<00:01:47.410> you<00:01:47.560> SAT

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
to try to turn it over so if you SAT

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.010 
to try to turn it over so if you SAT
there<00:01:47.890> nice<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.280> straight<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:48.760> stable<00:01:49.120> it's

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
there nice and straight and stable it's

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.810 
there nice and straight and stable it's
fine<00:01:50.320> all<00:01:50.710> right<00:01:50.890> Mary<00:01:51.070> what<00:01:51.430> do<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.610> say

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
fine all right Mary what do you say

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.250 
fine all right Mary what do you say
we've<00:01:52.090> learned<00:01:52.330> some<00:01:52.570> of<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.720> basics<00:01:53.080> here

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
we've learned some of the basics here

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.600 
we've learned some of the basics here
we've<00:01:53.440> learned<00:01:53.620> some<00:01:53.800> control<00:01:54.190> we've<00:01:54.430> learned

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
we've learned some control we've learned

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.810 
we've learned some control we've learned
some<00:01:54.790> avoidance<00:01:55.240> well<00:01:56.229> we<00:01:56.380> put<00:01:56.680> it<00:01:56.800> to<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.610> some

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
some avoidance well we put it to to some

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.340 
some avoidance well we put it to to some
