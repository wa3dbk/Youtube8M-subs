00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.000
Four years of undergraduate, two years of grad school, thirty-seven days.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.060
So we are in the final stretch till graduation.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.900
The stress has hit, I repeat. The stress has hit.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:50.040
Seven big projects, that are either not started, or ... very ... not started.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.580
I mean everyone comes up to me and says: "You must be so excited, case your almost done".

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.800
Their partially right.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.260
Everything from the last four years it's kind of accommodating

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.200
in this event that's happening six weeks, well five weeks from tomorrow.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.840
I mean, I am really excited. This is a huge accomplishment is such a big step in our lives.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.340
So, we should be excited, but its also really really stressful and kind of scary.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.760
First of all, I am beyond stress.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.600
And honestly sometimes it doesn't like
there's enough time, to get everything done .

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:33.880
I've been doing my entire schooling, college school. In five-and-a-half years. It's being hectic.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.560
I read a quote, recently, actually that said: "It always seems impossible until, it's done."

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.600
Calculus test, homework assignments, 
meetings with professors.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.820
But I have to remind myself it always gets done.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.440
And that really helps me wake up with purpose, each morning.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.260
I have work full time, under my construction company. Have two beautiful kids, loves them to death,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.490
Moved, think four times. And I am ready to graduate.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.170
Honestly it's kind of a big relief to be at this final stretch.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.520
At the beginning of this journey. My freshman year it seemed impossible to get,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.180
four years of undergrad completed. Like it was going to take for ever.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.820
School has essentially been, pretty much what I've done my entire life.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.700
So, I'm gonna be really sad when this chapter ends.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.960
And now we're here, at the final final stretch.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.650
Almost done, almost graduated and I can't believe it's actually happening.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.540
Holy cow, it's kind of just hitting me that this is like the final, final, stretch.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.940
So I think everybody needs to just breathe in.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:52.340
I'm thinking to myself that this kind of, we called a journey, is just perpetual and never ends.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.860
It's pretty crazy to think about how fast this all went by.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.640
But it doesn't. And when I think about that,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.200
it doesn't register in my head.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.740
And breathe out.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.560
It's really just a joy, to be able to take on a lot of the stuff that I've learned about over the last four years,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.760
and really be able to put it into practice and see how it gone.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.920
ISU is being such incredible place for me.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.760
And it's really hard to think that my time here, is about to end.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.370
Keep focusing, finish out the rest of this year, strong,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.459
cause is certain not all yet, there 's a lot of work left to be done.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.580
So I am sitting here studying, which is going to be my life up until graduation and that's okay.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.560
Gotta finish this project, this project, and this project.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.220
As well as these assignments, and tests and everything else.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.170
But you know there's kind of like a light
at the end of the tunnel now.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.560
Well I should probably actually go to my class. And not just sit outside talking about it.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:00.700
Overall I'm still optimistic and super excited that we're almost there. Just can't wait to walk across that stage.
