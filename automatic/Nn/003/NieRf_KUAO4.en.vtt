00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:03.910
Hello and welcome to my YouTube channel.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.389
I haven’t done a nice sit and chat type
of video like this in a very long time.

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:11.670
I think the last one I did was probably the
one I did in January about my sexuality.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.570
Which I still get messages about from people
going oh my gosh you helped me so much I didn’t

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.380
know what I was going through and now I understand.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.980
And that's the greatest thing because it was
just a personal video about my experiences

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.289
and to know that I've had a positive impact
on so many of your lives is so amazing to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.289
know.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.579
And to be honest, I wanna do more stuff like
that.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.419
I wanna be more open, more honest of a YouTuber.

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.180
I think I used to have a second channel where
I used to do that, but now that's dedicated

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.180
to travel.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.170
I have a snapchat, but that's limited to 10
second clips.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.350
Tumblr is probably the closest thing, but
even then it's just text.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.610
And I don't really think you can really understand
someone via just text because I could spend

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.330
an hour typing up that paragraph.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.820
You don't know how long those words have been
crafted to say exactly what I want to say.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.010
But I feel like you get to know someone a
lot more when they're talking openly.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.340
And that's why I like that I'm able to do
these videos sortof in one take, and by sortof

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.120
I mean... they are.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.180
But that way you know.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.180
There's nothing I'm really hiding.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.180
I'm not memorising anything.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.530
This is all coming off of the top of my head.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.090
That's why I'm trying to do live shows every
Tuesday.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.159
People ask me, Evan, how different are you
via online VS real life.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.670
Do you have an online personality?

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.929
That's a big chat that's going around.

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.409
I think Dodie did a reply to Olan Rogers and
crabstickz.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.299
And they're all talking about this type of
thing.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.859
I don't really have one?

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.820
I think the main difference between who I
am online and who I am in real life is that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.079
I'm a bit louder online.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.639
It's like: Hey how's it goin?

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.210
*pull out the camera*
HEY HOW'S IT GOIN?

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.409
Like my voice just amplifies just a little
bit and I don't know why, but I've noticed

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.409
that; friends have noticed that.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.979
I'm like okay, if that's the one difference...
that's it.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.700
I mean people know who I am because even in
my travel vlogs and such I still do puns.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.009
I'm terrible with it.

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.109
I do them all my friggin life.

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:45.429
All throughout work.

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:46.429
Everything.

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:47.429
(...)

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:48.429
Many puns.

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.619
Honestly, this week I got one of the coolest
packages I've ever received in my entire life.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.749
And that is this silver plaque commemorating
that I got 100,000 subscribers on my YouTube

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:57.749
channel.

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:58.749
And that's literally because of all of you.

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.840
Every single one of you watching this is the
reason that I have this.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.889
And I just wanted to say thank you SO much.

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:09.630
When I started making videos 5, 6 years ago,
I didn't ever, ever, ever think I'd get anywhere

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.630
near this.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.890
I didn't know what I was doing really.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.980
I was talking to a camera.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.310
Because that was what I wanted to do.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.310
I was bored.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.310
I wanted to get over my ex-girlfriend.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.000
I had many reasons.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.370
I was like: this is like a podcast with a
video.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.480
I can do it!

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.990
I can just make friends.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.990
And you know what.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.770
I wouldn't be living in London with my best
friend.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.061
I wouldn't have the job that I have.

00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:31.670
I wouldn't have gone to America last week,
I probably wouldn't have gone to Australia,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.900
and I might not even be in England if I had
not started making YouTube videos.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.640
And to me that's really crazy!

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.310
That this little website has changed my life
so much.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.560
Last night I was at a work party, and by that
I mean that I was actually editing a travel

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.110
vlog for 4 hours and people kept going why
aren't you drinking?!

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.610
Why aren't you having fun?!

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.010
I've got stuff to do.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.500
And you know what?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.010
I don't hate it; I love it.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.490
The reason that I make these videos is because
I love making videos.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.210
Why would someone put themselves through doing
all this to get famous?

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.700
To make money?

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.700
I don't know.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.970
That can be someone else's prerogative.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.880
But personally, I just love making videos.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.260
I love making travel vlogs.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.530
I love sharing my life with you guys.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.530
Because it's me.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.900
If you see me collab with someone it's because
I like them.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.150
It's because I'm friends with them.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.010
It's not because I'm trying to game the system
or get views, or any of that.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.920
I'm just trying to have a fun time with a
friend.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.340
And ya know, there's so many other YouTubers
out there in the world that you could be watching,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.980
but you are right now taking the time out
to watch me.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.060
And for that, I'm just saying thank you.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.730
I know this isn't a standard video.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.080
I haven't made any puns yet.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.310
That might not be your cup of tea!

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.690
Ya know what, like I said this wasn't scripted.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.040
And that was also really bad, but I just wanted
to take the time out of your day, my day to

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.170
say thank you.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.870
I appreciate you and I hope to make more content,
more videos that you like.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.210
I wanna make more personal stuff.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.210
I have a couple things I've been working on.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.600
I'm working on a song.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.480
I'm working on a poem.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.640
Because poems.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.620
There's a lot of like, personal stuff that
I kinda hint at I wanna share with you.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.940
But I wanna make sure I word it right because
you know, you don't wanna say the wrong thing

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.940
on the Internet.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.190
And I dunno.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.190
That's it.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.190
That's it.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.190
That's it.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.190
It's a nice chill video.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.190
I hope you've enjoyed this nice sit and chat.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.111
Please tell me how you're doing; I like doing
these videos every once in a while and I want

00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:15.390
to actually know how you're doing.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.750
I'm going to try and respond to every single
comment today in this comment section.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.980
So please, let's have a chat.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.370
Let's have a banter (lol).

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.370
Li'l cheeky nandos.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.430
And also chat with yourselves down there.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.020
I honestly want to have a nice li'l community
that I already have.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.760
I wanna build you guys up and be good friends.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.440
So thank you so much for watching.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.940
And I hope that you guys have an amazing rest
of your week.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:47.470
The summertime is here in England so I'm gonna
go outside and have a walk in the park (no

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.730
seriously).

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:55.060
*cue catchy whistling outro*
*swoosh*

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.200
Oh man, you don't know how much I've been
wanting to drink this tea the entire video,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.600
but you can't really drink after you start
a one-take video.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.440
You have to start it and just keep going.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.640
I love earl grey so much.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.240
It is earl greyt.
