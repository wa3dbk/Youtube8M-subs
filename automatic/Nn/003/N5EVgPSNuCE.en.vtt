00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
extended clip either one works fast mag

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.679 
extended clip either one works fast mag
you<00:01:31.740> reload<00:01:32.009> faster<00:01:32.220> extended<00:01:32.880> clip<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> just

throughout a lot of my classes this

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.390 
throughout a lot of my classes this
combination<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.290> really<00:02:19.590> good<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:20.010> prevents

from any explosive damage and it lessens

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.100 
from any explosive damage and it lessens
it<00:02:29.010> or<00:02:29.580> decreases<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.300> by<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.480> lot<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.020> you're

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
it or decreases it by a lot so you're

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.270 
it or decreases it by a lot so you're
not<00:02:31.230> going<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.440> be<00:02:31.500> dying<00:02:31.710> as<00:02:31.920> much<00:02:32.100> by

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
not going to be dying as much by

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.460 
not going to be dying as much by
explosives<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.150> those<00:02:33.780> are<00:02:33.900> my<00:02:33.990> one<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.230> two

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
explosives so those are my one and two

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.250 
explosives so those are my one and two
pretty<00:02:34.830> much<00:02:34.980> those<00:02:35.160> are<00:02:35.280> my<00:02:35.370> one-two<00:02:35.700> combo

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
pretty much those are my one-two combo

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.480 
pretty much those are my one-two combo
for<00:02:37.260> number<00:02:37.500> one<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:37.890> you'll<00:02:37.980> see<00:02:38.130> those<00:02:38.310> on

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
for number one and you'll see those on

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.370 
for number one and you'll see those on
every<00:02:38.760> single<00:02:39.030> class<00:02:39.270> next<00:02:39.990> you're<00:02:40.200> going<00:02:40.320> to

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
every single class next you're going to

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.290 
every single class next you're going to
have<00:02:40.500> toughness<00:02:40.920> obviously<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.880> reduces

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
have toughness obviously so it reduces

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.640 
have toughness obviously so it reduces
the<00:02:42.480> kick<00:02:42.690> while<00:02:42.900> you're<00:02:43.020> being<00:02:43.200> shot<00:02:43.470> at

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
the kick while you're being shot at

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.010 
the kick while you're being shot at
pretty<00:02:43.950> much<00:02:44.100> like<00:02:44.310> focus<00:02:44.730> attachment<00:02:45.420> back

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
pretty much like focus attachment back

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.660 
pretty much like focus attachment back
in<00:02:46.170> mw3<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:48.230> then<00:02:49.230> for<00:02:49.680> my<00:02:49.860> third<00:02:50.130> perk<00:02:50.460> you're

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
in mw3 and then for my third perk you're

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.640 
in mw3 and then for my third perk you're
going<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.850> want<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.060> throw<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.630> dexterity<00:02:52.470> and

for<00:03:27.360> this<00:03:27.450> one<00:03:27.660> because<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.960> reload<00:03:28.230> time

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
for this one because the reload time

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.000 
for this one because the reload time
isn't<00:03:28.740> that<00:03:28.890> isn't<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.970> slow<00:03:30.240> for<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:30.720> gun

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
isn't that isn't that slow for this gun

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
isn't that isn't that slow for this gun
so<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.910> gun<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.300> really<00:03:33.570> good<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.410> foregrip

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
so this gun is really good the foregrip

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.160 
so this gun is really good the foregrip
obviously<00:03:36.030> reduces<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.510> recoil<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.960> little

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
obviously reduces the recoil a little

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.260 
obviously reduces the recoil a little
bit<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:38.070> makes<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.460> lot<00:03:38.610> more<00:03:38.790> accurate

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
bit and it makes it a lot more accurate

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.210 
bit and it makes it a lot more accurate
from<00:03:39.540> medium<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:39.960> long<00:03:40.230> range<00:03:40.500> which<00:03:40.800> I<00:03:40.920> really

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
from medium to long range which I really

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.680 
from medium to long range which I really
enjoy<00:03:41.490> because<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.910> can<00:03:42.090> actually<00:03:42.300> pick

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
enjoy because you can actually pick

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.260 
enjoy because you can actually pick
people<00:03:42.870> off<00:03:43.140> with<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.440> steady<00:03:44.280> fire<00:03:45.000> rate

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
people off with a steady fire rate

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.000 
people off with a steady fire rate
holding<00:03:45.870> down<00:03:45.990> the<00:03:46.140> trigger<00:03:46.290> with<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:46.770> gun

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
holding down the trigger with this gun

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.330 
holding down the trigger with this gun
from<00:03:47.430> medium<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.120> long<00:03:48.270> range<00:03:48.950> your<00:03:49.950> extended

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
from medium to long range your extended

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.130 
from medium to long range your extended
bag<00:03:50.490> you<00:03:50.700> get<00:03:50.880> 40<00:03:51.240> bullets<00:03:51.540> per<00:03:51.750> clip<00:03:51.990> I

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
bag you get 40 bullets per clip I

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.600 
bag you get 40 bullets per clip I
believe<00:03:52.440> with<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.800> extended<00:03:53.160> mag<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.520> then

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
believe with the extended mag and then

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.310 
believe with the extended mag and then
the<00:03:53.700> silencer<00:03:54.150> obviously<00:03:54.630> against<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.140> don't

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
the silencer obviously against you don't

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.910 
the silencer obviously against you don't
show<00:03:55.500> up

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
show up

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.820 
show up
ghost<00:03:56.730> flak<00:03:57.030> jacket<00:03:57.510> toughness<00:03:57.959> dead<00:03:58.320> silence

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
ghost flak jacket toughness dead silence

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.230 
ghost flak jacket toughness dead silence
that's<00:03:59.160> not<00:03:59.400> supposed<00:03:59.640> to<00:03:59.790> be<00:03:59.880> on<00:04:00.000> their

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
that's not supposed to be on their

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.020 
that's not supposed to be on their
dexterity<00:04:00.840> again<00:04:01.440> dexterity<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.400> does<00:04:02.580> what

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
dexterity again dexterity it does what

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.160 
dexterity again dexterity it does what
it<00:04:03.150> does<00:04:03.270> is<00:04:03.390> aim<00:04:03.540> faster<00:04:03.900> after<00:04:03.990> sprinting

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
it does is aim faster after sprinting

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.500 
it does is aim faster after sprinting
and<00:04:04.590> Mahlon<00:04:04.890> climb<00:04:05.160> faster<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.790> really<00:04:06.090> use

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
and Mahlon climb faster and I really use

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.540 
and Mahlon climb faster and I really use
it<00:04:06.630> for<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.840> mantle<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.320> climb<00:04:07.620> faster<00:04:08.130> part

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
it for the mantle and climb faster part

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.400 
it for the mantle and climb faster part
of<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.700> ability<00:04:08.910> just<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:10.050> I<00:04:10.110> don't<00:04:10.290> get

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
of the ability just so I don't get

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.930 
of the ability just so I don't get
caught<00:04:10.650> while<00:04:10.890> I'm<00:04:10.980> trying<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.370> climb<00:04:11.580> up<00:04:11.790> on

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
caught while I'm trying to climb up on

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.240 
caught while I'm trying to climb up on
things<00:04:12.240> so<00:04:12.510> now<00:04:13.080> you<00:04:13.140> see<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.620> know<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:13.950> see<00:04:14.220> a

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
things so now you see you know you see a

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.729 
things so now you see you know you see a
pattern<00:04:14.640> between<00:04:14.790> my<00:04:15.120> class<00:04:15.510> setups<00:04:15.900> usually

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
pattern between my class setups usually

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.080 
pattern between my class setups usually
going<00:04:16.830> to<00:04:16.890> have<00:04:16.950> three<00:04:17.310> attachments<00:04:17.820> on<00:04:17.940> there

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
going to have three attachments on there

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.570 
going to have three attachments on there
using<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:18.510> primary<00:04:18.930> gunfighter<00:04:19.170> and<00:04:19.680> then<00:04:20.220> my

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
using the primary gunfighter and then my

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.180 
using the primary gunfighter and then my
perks<00:04:20.910> pretty<00:04:21.209> much<00:04:21.359> stay<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.750> same<00:04:22.010> so<00:04:23.010> next

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
perks pretty much stay the same so next

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.490 
perks pretty much stay the same so next
we're<00:04:23.400> going<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.580> move<00:04:23.760> into

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
we're going to move into

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.850 
we're going to move into
the<00:04:25.370> next<00:04:26.090> submachine<00:04:26.630> gun<00:04:26.840> which<00:04:27.020> is<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.230> PDW

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
the next submachine gun which is the PDW

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.270 
the next submachine gun which is the PDW
again<00:04:28.220> throwing<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.640> silencer<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:30.070> I'm<00:04:31.070> not

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
again throwing the silencer and I'm not

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.830 
again throwing the silencer and I'm not
really<00:04:31.430> sure<00:04:31.670> what<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:31.880> used<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.180> use<00:04:32.480> with<00:04:32.630> this

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
really sure what I used to use with this

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.090 
really sure what I used to use with this
because<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.080> don't<00:04:33.230> really<00:04:33.320> use<00:04:33.560> this<00:04:33.710> as<00:04:33.770> much

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
because I don't really use this as much

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.410 
because I don't really use this as much
anymore<00:04:34.370> in<00:04:34.550> public<00:04:34.910> matches<00:04:36.580> but<00:04:37.580> for<00:04:37.940> grip<00:04:38.180> I

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
anymore in public matches but for grip I

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.070 
anymore in public matches but for grip I
would<00:04:38.690> always<00:04:38.810> use<00:04:38.930> on<00:04:39.260> it<00:04:39.410> take<00:04:40.070> these<00:04:40.280> away

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
would always use on it take these away

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.840 
would always use on it take these away
throw<00:04:42.080> on<00:04:42.230> that<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:43.160> we're<00:04:43.430> gonna<00:04:43.580> throw<00:04:43.850> on

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
throw on that and we're gonna throw on

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.100 
throw on that and we're gonna throw on
I'm<00:04:46.850> not<00:04:47.150> really<00:04:47.270> sure<00:04:47.510> what's<00:04:47.720> that<00:04:47.900> good

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
I'm not really sure what's that good

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.040 
I'm not really sure what's that good
what's<00:04:48.440> good<00:04:48.530> on<00:04:48.770> this<00:04:48.950> I<00:04:49.420> like<00:04:50.420> a<00:04:50.450> laser<00:04:50.720> sight

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
what's good on this I like a laser sight

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
what's good on this I like a laser sight
on<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:52.000> but<00:04:53.470> yeah<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.500> would<00:04:54.770> just<00:04:54.860> throw<00:04:55.010> a

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
on it but yeah I would just throw a

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.070 
on it but yeah I would just throw a
laser<00:04:55.310> sight<00:04:55.580> on<00:04:55.640> it<00:04:55.790> a<00:04:56.030> because<00:04:56.360> fast<00:04:56.630> mag<00:04:56.870> you

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
laser sight on it a because fast mag you

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.020 
laser sight on it a because fast mag you
don't<00:04:57.230> need<00:04:57.410> it<00:04:57.560> this<00:04:57.950> gun<00:04:58.160> is<00:04:58.190> 50<00:04:58.610> bullets<00:04:58.790> at

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
don't need it this gun is 50 bullets at

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.550 
don't need it this gun is 50 bullets at
the<00:04:59.120> start<00:04:59.390> of<00:04:59.480> its<00:04:59.600> clip<00:04:59.810> and<00:04:59.990> extended<00:05:00.380> mags

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
the start of its clip and extended mags

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.800 
the start of its clip and extended mags
it<00:05:00.800> only<00:05:00.920> increases<00:05:01.490> your<00:05:01.640> ammo<00:05:02.030> by<00:05:02.210> like<00:05:02.390> 15

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
it only increases your ammo by like 15

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.420 
it only increases your ammo by like 15
bullets<00:05:03.170> I<00:05:03.260> think<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:03.980> it's<00:05:04.100> not<00:05:04.190> really<00:05:04.400> that

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
bullets I think so it's not really that

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.830 
bullets I think so it's not really that
beneficial<00:05:05.060> so<00:05:05.180> I<00:05:05.210> would<00:05:05.390> throw<00:05:05.480> on<00:05:05.630> laser

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
beneficial so I would throw on laser

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.380 
beneficial so I would throw on laser
sight<00:05:06.230> and<00:05:06.470> or<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:06.650> quick-draw<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.340> or<00:05:07.940> stock

is absolutely positively Oh P now this

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.490 
is absolutely positively Oh P now this
thing<00:05:58.520> when<00:05:58.790> it's<00:05:58.910> automatic<00:05:59.540> doesn't<00:06:00.320> move

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
thing when it's automatic doesn't move

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.860 
thing when it's automatic doesn't move
it's<00:06:00.770> pretty<00:06:01.010> much<00:06:01.160> like<00:06:01.220> an<00:06:01.520> ACR<00:06:01.880> and<00:06:02.240> then

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
it's pretty much like an ACR and then

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.310 
it's pretty much like an ACR and then
the<00:06:02.990> foregrip<00:06:03.470> and<00:06:03.770> reflex<00:06:04.640> just<00:06:05.510> help<00:06:05.750> it<00:06:05.930> to

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
the foregrip and reflex just help it to

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.440 
the foregrip and reflex just help it to
not<00:06:06.800> recoil<00:06:07.460> and<00:06:07.640> how<00:06:07.790> it<00:06:08.000> lets<00:06:08.210> you<00:06:08.300> have<00:06:08.330> a

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
not recoil and how it lets you have a

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.780 
not recoil and how it lets you have a
little<00:06:08.720> bit<00:06:08.810> more<00:06:08.990> control<00:06:09.350> over<00:06:09.380> your<00:06:09.680> gun<00:06:09.950> so

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
little bit more control over your gun so

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.810 
little bit more control over your gun so
this<00:06:11.390> is<00:06:11.600> really<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:11.870> opportune<00:06:12.440> class<00:06:13.370> setup

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
this is really the opportune class setup

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
this is really the opportune class setup
