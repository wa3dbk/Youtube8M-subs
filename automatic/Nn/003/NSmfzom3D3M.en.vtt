can actually create a little I'm fine

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.609 
can actually create a little I'm fine
with<00:01:03.149> negative<00:01:03.539> space<00:01:03.629> essentially<00:01:04.199> what

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
with negative space essentially what

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.200 
with negative space essentially what
I've<00:01:04.710> done<00:01:04.949> around<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.339> edge<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.700> Roses

is<00:01:06.770> earlier<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.979> particular<00:01:08.369> Rose<00:01:08.790> I'm

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
is earlier this particular Rose I'm

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.350 
is earlier this particular Rose I'm
leaving<00:01:09.770> open<00:01:10.770> areas<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.549> leaving<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
leaving open areas and leaving the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.240 
leaving open areas and leaving the
negative<00:01:12.720> space<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.799> add<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
negative space there but when I add the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.800 
negative space there but when I add the
white<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.939> create<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.210> dull<00:01:15.479> shine

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
white it's going to create a dull shine

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.210 
white it's going to create a dull shine
a<00:01:15.840> lot<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.170> people<00:01:16.439> don't<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.680> understand

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
a lot of people don't really understand

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.850 
a lot of people don't really understand
that<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:18.479> don't<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.020> use<00:01:19.200> pure<00:01:19.619> white

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
that you don't have to use pure white

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
that you don't have to use pure white
this<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.280> actually<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.000> radiant<00:01:21.630> white<00:01:21.780> that's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this is actually a radiant white that's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.539 
this is actually a radiant white that's
been<00:01:22.140> broken<00:01:22.409> down<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.100> creating<00:01:23.430> kind

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
been broken down so it's creating kind

just feels more natural it creates a

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.340 
just feels more natural it creates a
more<00:04:18.130> natural<00:04:18.549> look<00:04:18.760> where<00:04:19.600> I<00:04:19.630> could<00:04:19.930> just<00:04:20.140> use

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
more natural look where I could just use

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.870 
more natural look where I could just use
the<00:04:20.530> balance<00:04:20.950> like<00:04:21.100> with<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.340> negative<00:04:21.700> space

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880
