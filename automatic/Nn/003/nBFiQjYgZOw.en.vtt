00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
actually a button it's literally just a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.939 
actually a button it's literally just a
fingerprint<00:01:00.629> scanner<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.890> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
fingerprint scanner but it's at so it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.850

doesn't<00:01:02.190> click<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> phone<00:01:03.539> itself<00:01:03.870> on

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
doesn't click in to the phone itself on

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.950 
doesn't click in to the phone itself on
the<00:01:05.339> right<00:01:05.549> hand<00:01:05.790> side<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.570> see<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.930> the

got the volume up and down buttons and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.850 
got the volume up and down buttons and
then<00:01:12.330> we've<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> power<00:01:12.840> button<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.380> just

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
then we've got the power button and just

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
then we've got the power button and just
as<00:01:13.950> I've<00:01:14.100> said<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> past<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.150> like

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
as I've said in the past I really like

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.120 
as I've said in the past I really like
how<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> Motorola<00:01:16.939> Nexus<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.360> example<00:01:18.840> 6<00:01:19.740> has

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
how the Motorola Nexus for example 6 has

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.609 
how the Motorola Nexus for example 6 has
a<00:01:20.549> textured<00:01:21.150> button<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.750> yes<00:01:22.229> they've<00:01:22.380> given

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
a textured button and yes they've given

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.840 
a textured button and yes they've given
us<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> textured<00:01:23.070> button<00:01:23.310> over<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.729> well

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
us a textured button over here as well

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.730 
us a textured button over here as well
so<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.030> makes<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.240> easier<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.380> know<00:01:25.470> that's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
so it makes it easier to you know that's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.560 
so it makes it easier to you know that's
just<00:01:25.979> by<00:01:26.100> feeling<00:01:26.490> knowing<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
just by feeling knowing that this is the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.300 
just by feeling knowing that this is the
power<00:01:28.170> button<00:01:28.320> rather<00:01:28.619> than<00:01:28.799> touching<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
power button rather than touching the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.429 
power button rather than touching the
volume<00:01:29.759> button<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.180> yes<00:01:30.659> thumbs<00:01:30.960> up<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.229> really

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
top you've got a 1c a secondary camera

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.510 
top you've got a 1c a secondary camera
and<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.150> used<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> help<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.020> focus<00:01:40.619> on

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
and this is used to help you to focus on

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.660 
and this is used to help you to focus on
on<00:01:42.299> photos<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.470> know

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
on photos and to have that you know

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.649 
on photos and to have that you know
bouquet<00:01:44.670> effect<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.149> actually<00:01:45.240> choose

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
bouquet effect you can actually choose

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.170 
bouquet effect you can actually choose
to<00:01:45.930> focus<00:01:46.290> after<00:01:47.189> you've<00:01:47.369> taken<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.850> photo<00:01:48.030> so

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to focus after you've taken the photo so

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
to focus after you've taken the photo so
you<00:01:48.270> might<00:01:48.420> select<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> background<00:01:49.079> rather

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
you might select the background rather

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.359 
you might select the background rather
than<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> foreground<00:01:49.470> we'll<00:01:50.130> talk<00:01:50.250> about

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
than the foreground we'll talk about

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.020 
than the foreground we'll talk about
that<00:01:50.579> later<00:01:50.640> on

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
that later on

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.060 
that later on
we've<00:01:51.630> got<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> noise<00:01:52.070> cancellation

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
we've got the noise cancellation

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.340 
we've got the noise cancellation
microphone<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:54.060> over<00:01:54.240> here<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.630> then

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
microphone right over here and then

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.039 
microphone right over here and then
we've<00:01:55.500> got<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.950> main<00:01:56.280> camera<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.000> then<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
we've got that main camera and then to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.929 
we've got that main camera and then to
the<00:01:58.229> left<00:01:58.500> we'll<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.399> we've<00:01:59.549> got<00:01:59.729> the

the left we'll see that we've got the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.600 
the left we'll see that we've got the
cold<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.659> warm<00:02:01.020> tone<00:02:01.380> flashes<00:02:01.920> we've<00:02:02.340> still

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
cold and warm tone flashes we've still

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.670 
cold and warm tone flashes we've still
got<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.090> plastic<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> top<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.530> at<00:02:04.649> the

this and the m9 as well now on the very
top<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.620> where<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:34.950> got<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.130> plastic<00:02:36.680> space

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
top is where we got that plastic space

control<00:02:39.720> actually<00:02:40.200> your<00:02:40.380> television<00:02:40.800> can<00:02:40.890> you

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
control actually your television can you

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.980 
control actually your television can you
get<00:02:41.130> an<00:02:41.220> IR<00:02:41.490> blaster<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.970> I'm<00:02:42.540> actually<00:02:42.750> not

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
get an IR blaster and I'm actually not

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.540 
get an IR blaster and I'm actually not
entirely<00:02:43.260> sure<00:02:43.380> why<00:02:43.740> they've<00:02:43.950> decided<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.430> go

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
entirely sure why they've decided to go

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.110 
entirely sure why they've decided to go
with<00:02:44.700> such<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> big<00:02:46.310> plastic<00:02:47.310> finish<00:02:47.550> but<00:02:47.880> maybe

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
with such a big plastic finish but maybe

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.180 
with such a big plastic finish but maybe
just<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.350> be<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.500> little<00:02:49.710> bit<00:02:49.800> different<00:02:49.980> just

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
just to be a little bit different just

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.890 
just to be a little bit different just
maybe<00:02:50.760> be<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> little<00:02:51.000> bit<00:02:51.210> more<00:02:51.390> symmetrical

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
maybe be a little bit more symmetrical

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.300 
maybe be a little bit more symmetrical
although<00:02:52.290> I'm<00:02:52.380> gonna<00:02:52.530> talk<00:02:52.740> about<00:02:52.860> symmetry

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
although I'm gonna talk about symmetry

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.760 
although I'm gonna talk about symmetry
later<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.180> as<00:02:54.330> well<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.750> anyway

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
later on as well so anyway

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.620 
later on as well so anyway
let's<00:02:55.980> get<00:02:56.130> started<00:02:56.640> with<00:02:56.880> talking<00:02:57.090> about<00:02:57.270> the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
let's get started with talking about the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.110 
let's get started with talking about the
differences<00:02:58.140> between<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.770> m9<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.850> m9

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
differences between the m9 and the m9

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.870 
differences between the m9 and the m9
plus<00:03:00.560> obviously<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.710> first<00:03:02.010> key<00:03:02.430> difference

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
plus obviously the first key difference

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.040 
plus obviously the first key difference
is<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.120> fact<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:03.420> we've<00:03:03.600> now<00:03:03.780> got<00:03:04.020> a

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
is the fact that we've now got a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.800 
is the fact that we've now got a
fingerprint<00:03:04.860> sensor<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.360> lot<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.570> people

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
fingerprint sensor so a lot of people

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.520 
fingerprint sensor so a lot of people
have<00:03:07.230> wanted<00:03:07.740> this<00:03:08.280> on<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:09.000> HTC<00:03:09.600> One<00:03:09.900> series

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
have wanted this on the HTC One series

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.420 
have wanted this on the HTC One series
of<00:03:10.920> devices<00:03:11.430> obviously<00:03:11.820> we<00:03:11.910> have<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.270> on<00:03:12.420> the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
of devices obviously we have this on the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.840 
of devices obviously we have this on the
iPhone<00:03:14.430> we<00:03:14.700> now<00:03:14.820> have<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.210> on<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.690> Galaxy<00:03:16.850> s6

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
and s6 edge and we've got on a number of

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.880 
and s6 edge and we've got on a number of
other<00:03:20.790> manufacturers<00:03:21.480> as<00:03:21.660> well<00:03:21.740> one<00:03:22.740> of<00:03:22.830> the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
other manufacturers as well one of the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.010 
other manufacturers as well one of the
things<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.220> hated<00:03:23.610> in<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.910> past<00:03:24.180> with<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
things that I hated in the past with the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.470 
things that I hated in the past with the
Samsung<00:03:25.620> Galaxy<00:03:26.000> series<00:03:27.000> was<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.150> fact<00:03:27.390> that

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
Samsung Galaxy series was the fact that

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.600 
Samsung Galaxy series was the fact that
the<00:03:27.570> way<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.780> use<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.380> scanned<00:03:29.100> your

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
the way that use you scanned your

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.140 
the way that use you scanned your
fingerprint<00:03:30.209> was<00:03:30.450> by<00:03:30.690> swiping<00:03:31.310> they<00:03:32.310> have<00:03:32.850> not

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
fingerprint was by swiping they have not

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.470 
fingerprint was by swiping they have not
repeated<00:03:33.570> that<00:03:33.990> mistake<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:34.950> basically<00:03:35.790> you

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
repeated that mistake so basically you

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.270 
repeated that mistake so basically you
can<00:03:36.630> actually<00:03:36.900> touch<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.440> phone<00:03:37.680> or<00:03:38.040> just

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
can actually touch the phone or just

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.550 
can actually touch the phone or just
touch<00:03:38.490> that<00:03:38.550> really<00:03:39.090> quickly<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:40.320> then<00:03:40.470> you

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
touch that really quickly and then you

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.170 
touch that really quickly and then you
can<00:03:40.709> unlock<00:03:40.980> your<00:03:41.040> phone<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.520> let's<00:03:41.970> give<00:03:42.150> that

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
can unlock your phone so let's give that

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.050 
can unlock your phone so let's give that
a<00:03:42.330> quick<00:03:42.600> sample<00:03:43.250> there<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.370> go<00:03:44.490> just<00:03:44.760> unlock

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
a quick sample there you go just unlock

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.480 
a quick sample there you go just unlock
the<00:03:45.090> phone<00:03:45.330> and<00:03:45.690> it's<00:03:46.380> actually<00:03:46.709> quite<00:03:46.890> quick

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
the phone and it's actually quite quick

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.480 
the phone and it's actually quite quick
in<00:03:47.730> my<00:03:47.970> opinion<00:03:48.590> as<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.770> mentioned<00:03:50.130> this<00:03:50.190> isn't

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
in my opinion as I mentioned this isn't

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.170 
in my opinion as I mentioned this isn't
a<00:03:50.580> click<00:03:50.880> button<00:03:51.300> this<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:51.990> actually<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:53.180> solid

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
a click button this is actually a solid

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.820 
a click button this is actually a solid
fingerprint<00:03:54.720> sensor<00:03:54.959> however<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.380> can<00:03:55.590> use

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
fingerprint sensor however you can use

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.650 
fingerprint sensor however you can use
this<00:03:56.010> as<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.250> home<00:03:56.580> button<00:03:56.880> as<00:03:57.000> well<00:03:57.180> simply<00:03:57.390> by

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
this as a home button as well simply by

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.690 
this as a home button as well simply by
touching<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:58.500> that's<00:03:59.310> something<00:03:59.580> that's

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
touching it so that's something that's

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.070 
touching it so that's something that's
really<00:03:59.820> great<00:04:00.180> one<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.840> other

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
really great one of the other

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.960 
really great one of the other
differences<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.830> fact<00:04:02.070> that<00:04:02.340> we<00:04:02.550> now<00:04:02.730> have<00:04:02.940> a

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
differences the fact that we now have a

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.390 
differences the fact that we now have a
5.2<00:04:03.840> inch<00:04:03.870> screen<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.650> we<00:04:04.680> compare<00:04:05.070> it<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.220> the

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
5.2 inch screen if we compare it to the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.150 
5.2 inch screen if we compare it to the
m9<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.570> m9<00:04:06.840> had<00:04:07.020> a<00:04:07.080> 5<00:04:07.350> inch<00:04:07.380> screen<00:04:07.770> but<00:04:08.040> it's

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
m9 the m9 had a 5 inch screen but it's

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.370 
m9 the m9 had a 5 inch screen but it's
not<00:04:08.280> only<00:04:08.700> just<00:04:08.910> bigger<00:04:09.480> we<00:04:09.959> also<00:04:10.140> have<00:04:10.350> a

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
not only just bigger we also have a

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.110 
not only just bigger we also have a
higher<00:04:10.709> resolution<00:04:11.040> at<00:04:12.110> 1440<00:04:13.110> by<00:04:13.880> 2560<00:04:14.880> pixels

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
higher resolution at 1440 by 2560 pixels

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.020 
higher resolution at 1440 by 2560 pixels
which<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:15.720> pretty<00:04:15.959> cool<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.380> gives<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:17.040> 534

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
which is pretty cool that gives it a 534

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.780 
which is pretty cool that gives it a 534
pixel<00:04:18.810> density<00:04:19.280> good<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:20.430> far

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
pixel density good so far

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.270 
pixel density good so far
cool<00:04:21.180> if<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.780> compare<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.140> to<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.350> m9<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.919> m9

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
cool if I compare it to the m9 the m9

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.030 
cool if I compare it to the m9 the m9
actually<00:04:23.610> had<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.970> 1080<00:04:24.419> by<00:04:24.540> 9<00:04:24.840> 20<00:04:25.380> pixels<00:04:25.710> and

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
actually had a 1080 by 9 20 pixels and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.640 
actually had a 1080 by 9 20 pixels and
gave<00:04:26.460> it

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
gave it

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.240 
gave it
a 441<00:04:27.490> pixel<00:04:28.270> our<00:04:28.570> pixel<00:04:29.290> density<00:04:29.710> pixels<00:04:30.130> per

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
a 441 pixel our pixel density pixels per

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.090 
a 441 pixel our pixel density pixels per
inch<00:04:30.280> now<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:31.389> was<00:04:32.080> really<00:04:32.320> pleased<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.860> see

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
inch now I was really pleased to see

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.560 
inch now I was really pleased to see
that<00:04:33.130> because<00:04:33.550> usually<00:04:33.729> some<00:04:34.090> manufacturer

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
that because usually some manufacturer

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.850 
that because usually some manufacturer
just<00:04:34.600> gave<00:04:34.870> you<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:34.990> slightly<00:04:35.259> bigger<00:04:35.560> screen

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
just gave you a slightly bigger screen

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.230 
just gave you a slightly bigger screen
and<00:04:35.889> then<00:04:36.130> they<00:04:36.220> keep<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.520> same<00:04:36.669> resolution

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
and then they keep the same resolution

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.240 
and then they keep the same resolution
then<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.449> have<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.600> lower<00:04:37.840> pixel<00:04:38.080> density<00:04:38.590> no

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
then you have a lower pixel density no

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.950 
then you have a lower pixel density no
they're<00:04:39.610> giving<00:04:39.820> a<00:04:39.880> bigger<00:04:40.090> screen<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:40.570> a

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
they're giving a bigger screen and a

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.670 
they're giving a bigger screen and a
better<00:04:41.080> resolution<00:04:41.440> so<00:04:41.919> thumbs<00:04:42.699> up<00:04:42.940> there<00:04:43.680> one

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
better resolution so thumbs up there one

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.990 
better resolution so thumbs up there one
of<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.860> other<00:04:44.979> things<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.370> mention<00:04:45.699> these<00:04:45.820> are

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
of the other things to mention these are

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.120 
of the other things to mention these are
small<00:04:46.479> little<00:04:46.810> differences<00:04:47.440> is<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.830> fact

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
small little differences is the fact

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.790 
small little differences is the fact
that<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.340> m9<00:04:48.729> plus<00:04:49.090> is<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.780> little<00:04:50.289> bit<00:04:50.500> taller

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
that the m9 plus is a little bit taller

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.379 
that the m9 plus is a little bit taller
it's<00:04:51.310> at<00:04:51.690> 151<00:04:52.800> millimeters<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.270> it's<00:04:55.270> a

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
it's at 151 millimeters and it's a

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.540 
it's at 151 millimeters and it's a
little<00:04:55.660> bit<00:04:55.840> wider<00:04:56.050> as<00:04:56.289> well<00:04:56.530> at<00:04:56.770> 72

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
little bit wider as well at 72

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.430 
little bit wider as well at 72
millimeters<00:04:58.030> you'll<00:04:58.330> see<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.750> specs<00:04:59.110> between

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
millimeters you'll see the specs between

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.600 
millimeters you'll see the specs between
the<00:04:59.560> two<00:04:59.680> of<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.860> differences<00:05:00.220> you<00:05:00.340> know<00:05:00.430> on

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
the two of the differences you know on

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.150 
the two of the differences you know on
screen<00:05:01.060> as<00:05:01.210> well<00:05:01.389> in<00:05:01.780> regards<00:05:02.169> to<00:05:02.560> weight<00:05:02.860> it's

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
screen as well in regards to weight it's

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.510 
screen as well in regards to weight it's
actually<00:05:03.520> 11<00:05:03.970> grams<00:05:04.240> heavier<00:05:04.750> at<00:05:05.280> 168<00:05:06.280> grams

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
actually 11 grams heavier at 168 grams

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.540 
actually 11 grams heavier at 168 grams
compared<00:05:06.910> to<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.120> 157<00:05:07.900> grams<00:05:07.930> of<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.440> m9<00:05:09.130> so

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
compared to the 157 grams of the m9 so

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.540 
compared to the 157 grams of the m9 so
there<00:05:10.300> you<00:05:10.389> go<00:05:10.539> in<00:05:10.800> regards<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.889> the<00:05:12.070> camera

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
there you go in regards to the camera

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.670 
there you go in regards to the camera
let's<00:05:12.729> talk<00:05:12.910> about<00:05:13.060> this<00:05:13.360> for<00:05:13.660> just<00:05:13.690> a<00:05:14.169> second

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
let's talk about this for just a second

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.640 
let's talk about this for just a second
right<00:05:14.770> we<00:05:15.760> now<00:05:15.910> have<00:05:16.120> a<00:05:16.150> 20<00:05:16.510> megapixel<00:05:17.080> camera

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
right we now have a 20 megapixel camera

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.920 
right we now have a 20 megapixel camera
if<00:05:17.979> I<00:05:18.160> compared<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.669> the<00:05:18.760> m9<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.360> m9<00:05:19.570> also<00:05:19.840> had

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
if I compared to the m9 the m9 also had

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.990 
if I compared to the m9 the m9 also had
a<00:05:19.990> 20<00:05:20.199> megapixel<00:05:20.710> camera<00:05:21.039> but<00:05:21.310> we<00:05:21.400> also<00:05:21.580> have

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
a 20 megapixel camera but we also have

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.480 
a 20 megapixel camera but we also have
the<00:05:22.300> return<00:05:22.690> of<00:05:22.720> this<00:05:23.320> on<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.919> top<00:05:24.160> this<00:05:24.340> is<00:05:24.400> a

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
the return of this on the top this is a

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.420 
the return of this on the top this is a
2.1<00:05:25.330> megapixel<00:05:25.509> camera<00:05:26.169> on<00:05:26.199> the<00:05:26.259> top<00:05:26.470> and<00:05:26.680> it

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
2.1 megapixel camera on the top and it

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.909 
2.1 megapixel camera on the top and it
just<00:05:27.669> gives<00:05:27.910> you<00:05:28.440> faster<00:05:29.440> focus<00:05:30.039> it<00:05:30.400> gives<00:05:30.849> you

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
just gives you faster focus it gives you

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.439 
just gives you faster focus it gives you
the<00:05:32.919> opportunity<00:05:33.190> as<00:05:33.580> I<00:05:33.669> mentioned<00:05:33.940> before<00:05:34.000> to

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
the opportunity as I mentioned before to

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.080 
the opportunity as I mentioned before to
choose<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.169> focus<00:05:35.470> or<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.800> subject<00:05:36.280> of<00:05:36.430> the

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
choose the focus or the subject of the

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.760 
choose the focus or the subject of the
photo<00:05:37.300> later<00:05:37.630> on<00:05:37.810> it's<00:05:38.260> a<00:05:38.410> really<00:05:38.620> cool

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
photo later on it's a really cool

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.939 
photo later on it's a really cool
feature<00:05:39.010> I<00:05:39.130> like<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:40.260> physically<00:05:41.260> one<00:05:41.770> of<00:05:41.860> the

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
feature I like it physically one of the

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.640 
feature I like it physically one of the
differences<00:05:42.340> between<00:05:42.400> an<00:05:42.940> m9<00:05:43.270> +<00:05:43.419> m9<00:05:43.720> +<00:05:44.020> and<00:05:44.530> I

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
differences between an m9 + m9 + and I

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.740 
differences between an m9 + m9 + and I
guess<00:05:44.949> besides<00:05:45.699> you<00:05:45.880> know<00:05:46.000> that<00:05:46.180> top<00:05:46.449> camera

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
guess besides you know that top camera

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.540 
guess besides you know that top camera
is<00:05:47.199> the<00:05:47.349> fact<00:05:47.530> that<00:05:47.560> this<00:05:47.710> is<00:05:47.860> round<00:05:48.190> now

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
is the fact that this is round now

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.600 
is the fact that this is round now
compared<00:05:49.210> to<00:05:49.510> the<00:05:49.900> m9<00:05:50.380> which<00:05:50.620> was<00:05:50.860> more<00:05:51.370> of<00:05:51.490> a

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
compared to the m9 which was more of a

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.360 
compared to the m9 which was more of a
squarish<00:05:52.090> with<00:05:52.389> curved<00:05:52.720> edges<00:05:53.370> obviously

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
squarish with curved edges obviously

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.310 
squarish with curved edges obviously
with<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:54.550> bigger<00:05:54.909> screen<00:05:55.389> and<00:05:55.810> you've<00:05:56.139> got

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
with that bigger screen and you've got

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.230 
with that bigger screen and you've got
that<00:05:56.470> secondary<00:05:56.830> camera<00:05:57.430> and<00:05:57.729> all<00:05:57.970> of<00:05:58.090> the

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
that secondary camera and all of the

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.120 
that secondary camera and all of the
really<00:05:58.419> cool<00:05:58.659> new<00:05:58.840> features<00:05:59.260> you're<00:05:59.830> probably

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
really cool new features you're probably

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.420 
really cool new features you're probably
gonna<00:06:00.430> want<00:06:00.699> a<00:06:00.909> little<00:06:01.240> bit<00:06:01.570> better<00:06:01.960> of

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
gonna want a little bit better of

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.620 
gonna want a little bit better of
processor<00:06:03.430> as<00:06:03.550> well<00:06:03.789> since<00:06:04.000> it<00:06:04.150> is<00:06:04.270> called<00:06:04.510> the

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
processor as well since it is called the

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.510 
processor as well since it is called the
m9<00:06:04.930> +<00:06:05.080> well<00:06:05.650> what's<00:06:05.889> the<00:06:06.010> difference<00:06:06.340> here

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
m9 + well what's the difference here

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.839 
m9 + well what's the difference here
first<00:06:07.150> of<00:06:07.300> all<00:06:07.419> we've<00:06:07.570> got<00:06:07.750> an<00:06:07.930> octa-core<00:06:08.849> 2.2

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
first of all we've got an octa-core 2.2

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.820 
first of all we've got an octa-core 2.2
gigahertz<00:06:10.360> processor<00:06:10.720> in<00:06:11.409> here<00:06:11.590> that's

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
gigahertz processor in here that's

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.800 
gigahertz processor in here that's
octa-core<00:06:12.250> it's<00:06:12.460> like<00:06:12.669> octa<00:06:13.060> octa-core<00:06:13.419> in

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
octa-core it's like octa octa-core in

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.939 
octa-core it's like octa octa-core in
the<00:06:14.590> other<00:06:15.270> version<00:06:16.270> and<00:06:16.479> the<00:06:16.599> m9<00:06:17.050> we<00:06:17.560> have<00:06:17.770> a

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
the other version and the m9 we have a

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:21.330 
the other version and the m9 we have a
quad-core<00:06:18.280> 1.5<00:06:19.000> gigahertz<00:06:19.300> cortex<00:06:19.960> a53<00:06:20.440> and<00:06:20.770> a

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
quad-core 1.5 gigahertz cortex a53 and a

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.390 
quad-core 1.5 gigahertz cortex a53 and a
quad<00:06:21.789> core<00:06:22.060> 2<00:06:22.449> gigahertz<00:06:22.750> cortex<00:06:23.289> a57<00:06:23.830> so<00:06:24.190> I

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
quad core 2 gigahertz cortex a57 so I

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.610 
quad core 2 gigahertz cortex a57 so I
thought<00:06:24.970> that<00:06:25.180> was<00:06:25.270> pretty<00:06:25.419> cool<00:06:25.630> one<00:06:26.409> of<00:06:26.530> the

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
thought that was pretty cool one of the

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.140 
thought that was pretty cool one of the
other<00:06:26.770> key<00:06:26.979> differences<00:06:27.400> is<00:06:27.550> to<00:06:27.669> mention<00:06:28.000> is

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
other key differences is to mention is

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.310 
other key differences is to mention is
that<00:06:28.360> this<00:06:28.690> has<00:06:29.050> micro<00:06:29.770> USB<00:06:30.490> 3.0<00:06:31.229> compared<00:06:32.229> to

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
that this has micro USB 3.0 compared to

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.490 
that this has micro USB 3.0 compared to
the<00:06:32.380> m9<00:06:32.680> which<00:06:32.889> has<00:06:33.099> micro<00:06:33.760> USB<00:06:34.090> version<00:06:34.900> 2.0

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
the m9 which has micro USB version 2.0

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.610 
the m9 which has micro USB version 2.0
so<00:06:35.919> yeah<00:06:36.219> we've<00:06:36.430> even<00:06:36.669> got<00:06:36.849> my<00:06:37.300> Korea

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
so yeah we've even got my Korea

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.129 
so yeah we've even got my Korea
you<00:06:37.710> point<00:06:38.520> out<00:06:38.639> so<00:06:39.090> that's<00:06:39.270> it<00:06:39.510> for<00:06:39.720> all<00:06:39.900> of

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
you point out so that's it for all of

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.310 
you point out so that's it for all of
the<00:06:40.260> differences<00:06:40.860> that<00:06:40.919> we<00:06:41.220> have<00:06:41.580> it's<00:06:41.910> as<00:06:42.320> you

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
the differences that we have it's as you

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.510 
the differences that we have it's as you
know<00:06:43.410> there's<00:06:43.650> quite<00:06:43.889> a<00:06:43.919> significant

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
know there's quite a significant

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.040 
know there's quite a significant
difference<00:06:44.760> between<00:06:44.850> the<00:06:45.090> m9<00:06:45.419> and<00:06:45.449> the<00:06:45.810> m9

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
difference between the m9 and the m9

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.930 
difference between the m9 and the m9
plus<00:06:46.260> Nile<00:06:46.590> understand<00:06:46.979> that<00:06:47.130> I<00:06:47.400> said<00:06:47.820> that

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
plus Nile understand that I said that

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.040 
plus Nile understand that I said that
some<00:06:48.090> people<00:06:48.300> might<00:06:48.510> be<00:06:48.690> a<00:06:48.720> little<00:06:48.960> bit

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
some people might be a little bit

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.629 
some people might be a little bit
annoyed<00:06:49.350> if<00:06:49.560> they've<00:06:49.710> already<00:06:49.800> bought<00:06:50.130> an<00:06:50.250> m9

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 
annoyed if they've already bought an m9

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.820 
annoyed if they've already bought an m9
the<00:06:51.389> m9<00:06:51.660> plus<00:06:51.930> as<00:06:52.139> I<00:06:52.229> understand<00:06:52.650> isn't

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
the m9 plus as I understand isn't

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.920 
the m9 plus as I understand isn't
