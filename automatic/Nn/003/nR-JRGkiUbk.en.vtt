hey<00:00:12.360> guys<00:00:12.570> one<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.750> my<00:00:12.840> co-workers<00:00:13.080> found

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
hey guys one of my co-workers found

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.080 
hey guys one of my co-workers found
these<00:00:13.740> downtown<00:00:14.219> today<00:00:14.429> there<00:00:14.760> are<00:00:14.879> two

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
these downtown today there are two

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.269 
these downtown today there are two
identical<00:00:15.299> locks<00:00:16.020> one<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:17.010> slightly

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
identical locks one is just slightly

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.359 
identical locks one is just slightly
larger<00:00:17.789> than<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.689> other<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:19.189> they<00:00:20.189> are

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
larger than the other one they are

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.880 
larger than the other one they are
Chinese<00:00:20.820> obviously<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.050> if<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.529> can't<00:00:22.740> read

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
Chinese obviously and if you can't read

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.519 
Chinese obviously and if you can't read
Chinese<00:00:23.810> I'll<00:00:24.810> read<00:00:25.020> it<00:00:25.080> for<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.380> says

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
Chinese I'll read it for you it says

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.150 
Chinese I'll read it for you it says
globe<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.730> they're<00:00:26.880> Glo<00:00:27.150> blocks<00:00:28.010> they<00:00:29.010> both

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
globe so they're Glo blocks they both

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.529 
globe so they're Glo blocks they both
come<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.400> three<00:00:29.699> keys<00:00:29.910> they're<00:00:30.150> both<00:00:30.300> keyed

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
come with three keys they're both keyed

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.900 
come with three keys they're both keyed
pretty<00:00:30.810> much<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.199> same<00:00:31.380> I'll<00:00:32.250> use<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.699> one

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
pretty much the same I'll use this one

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.030 
pretty much the same I'll use this one
because<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.570> fits<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.470> my<00:00:34.500> hand<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.920> little

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
because it fits in my hand a little

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.009 
because it fits in my hand a little
better<00:00:35.250> by<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.489> way<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.600> can't<00:00:36.840> read

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
better by the way if you can't read

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.140 
better by the way if you can't read
Chinese<00:00:37.070> if<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.190> can't<00:00:38.370> read<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:38.879> globe

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
Chinese if you can't read that as globe

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.540 
Chinese if you can't read that as globe
then<00:00:39.449> you<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.780> simply<00:00:40.080> turn<00:00:40.949> it<00:00:41.070> over<00:00:41.190> says

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
then you just simply turn it over says

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.240 
then you just simply turn it over says
in<00:00:41.670> English<00:00:41.790> right<00:00:42.180> there<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.540> anyway

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
in English right there but anyway

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.600 
in English right there but anyway
there's<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.430> thick<00:00:44.549> bidding<00:00:44.760> looks<00:00:44.940> like<00:00:46.610> so

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
there's what thick bidding looks like so

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.950 
there's what thick bidding looks like so
it's<00:00:47.729> pretty<00:00:47.879> challenging<00:00:48.180> bidding<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
it's pretty challenging bidding you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.850 
it's pretty challenging bidding you
would<00:00:49.140> think<00:00:49.470> you<00:00:50.129> would<00:00:50.250> think<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:52.559> keys

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
would think you would think and the keys

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.009 
would think you would think and the keys
a<00:00:52.890> little<00:00:53.309> bit<00:00:53.460> picky<00:00:54.059> sometimes<00:00:54.269> or<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.930> we

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
a little bit picky sometimes or can we

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.090 
a little bit picky sometimes or can we
move<00:00:55.140> him<00:00:55.199> out<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.530> way<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.739> we're<00:00:55.979> moving

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
move him out of the way so we're moving

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.820 
move him out of the way so we're moving
back<00:00:56.369> to<00:00:56.549> it<00:00:56.869> sometimes<00:00:57.869> it<00:00:58.080> turns<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.799> that

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
back to it sometimes it turns like that

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.649 
back to it sometimes it turns like that
it<00:00:59.129> turned<00:00:59.339> very<00:00:59.549> easily<00:00:59.879> at<00:01:00.119> the<00:01:00.210> times<00:01:00.449> it

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
it turned very easily at the times it

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.450 
it turned very easily at the times it
gets<00:01:00.750> jammed<00:01:01.080> up<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.710> course<00:01:01.949> now<00:01:02.159> that<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
gets jammed up of course now that the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.640 
gets jammed up of course now that the
cameras<00:01:02.850> are<00:01:03.089> going<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.750> won't<00:01:03.839> jam<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.530> me

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
cameras are going it won't jam up for me

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.980 
cameras are going it won't jam up for me
but<00:01:04.909> every<00:01:05.909> once<00:01:06.060> awhile<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.450> won't<00:01:06.720> open

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
but every once awhile it just won't open

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.570 
but every once awhile it just won't open
you<00:01:07.140> got<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.320> kind<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.530> jiggle<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.159> lot<00:01:08.369> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
you got to kind of jiggle it a lot to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.969 
you got to kind of jiggle it a lot to
get<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.939> function<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> precision<00:01:10.830> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
get it to function so the precision is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.190 
get it to function so the precision is
not<00:01:11.159> quite<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:11.909> something<00:01:12.330> not<00:01:13.020> quite

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
not quite there something not quite

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.260 
not quite there something not quite
right<00:01:13.320> about<00:01:13.680> these<00:01:13.950> keys<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.640> think<00:01:14.909> but

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
right about these keys I think but

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.749 
right about these keys I think but
anyway<00:01:16.200> let's<00:01:16.409> see<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.649> we<00:01:16.770> can't<00:01:17.070> exploit

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
anyway let's see if we can't exploit

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.910 
anyway let's see if we can't exploit
these<00:01:18.149> glow<00:01:18.869> blocks<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.679> a<00:01:20.009> little<00:01:20.280> bit<00:01:21.920> so

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
these glow blocks just a little bit so

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.429 
these glow blocks just a little bit so
you'll<00:01:23.039> get<00:01:23.130> usable<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.789> key<00:01:23.969> way<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:25.170> let's

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you'll get usable the key way and let's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.789 
you'll get usable the key way and let's
first<00:01:25.679> try<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.009> SPP<00:01:26.789> this<00:01:27.060> thing<00:01:27.710> I'm<00:01:28.710> gonna

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
first try to SPP this thing I'm gonna

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.709 
first try to SPP this thing I'm gonna
put<00:01:29.039> moderate<00:01:29.490> tension<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:30.179> I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.420> we

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
put moderate tension because I think we

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.109 
put moderate tension because I think we
can<00:01:30.869> pretty<00:01:31.109> much<00:01:31.200> force<00:01:31.770> these<00:01:32.219> pins<00:01:32.700> into

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
can pretty much force these pins into

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.730 
can pretty much force these pins into
place

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:53.330 

he<00:01:39.340> says

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.510 

only<00:01:54.030> five<00:01:54.240> pins

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.210 

and<00:01:58.509> it's<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.780> little<00:01:59.020> bit<00:01:59.140> gritty<00:01:59.500> as<00:01:59.799> you<00:02:00.100> can

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
and it's a little bit gritty as you can

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.940 
and it's a little bit gritty as you can
imagine<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.479> whole<00:02:01.750> lot<00:02:01.960> of<00:02:01.990> quality

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
imagine not a whole lot of quality

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.760 
imagine not a whole lot of quality
controlled<00:02:03.369> one<00:02:03.579> of<00:02:03.759> these<00:02:03.909> things<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:08.440> I

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
controlled one of these things and I

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.620 
controlled one of these things and I
think<00:02:08.979> it's<00:02:09.069> like<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.340> might<00:02:09.700> have<00:02:10.149> over<00:02:10.390> said

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
think it's like I might have over said

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.699 
think it's like I might have over said
something<00:02:11.170> there<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.930> let's<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:14.260> give<00:02:14.590> it

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
something there so let's just give it

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.199 
something there so let's just give it
one<00:02:14.739> more<00:02:15.010> shot<00:02:15.069> this<00:02:15.459> believe<00:02:15.940> me

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
one more shot this believe me

one more shot this believe me

locks<00:02:19.390> is<00:02:19.599> probably<00:02:20.470> one<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.800> hardest

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190

picks you're gonna get but there are
other<00:02:22.900> ways<00:02:23.190> which<00:02:24.190> will<00:02:24.430> exploit<00:02:24.849> in<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.569> a

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
other ways which will exploit in just a

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.390 
other ways which will exploit in just a
minute<00:02:26.080> let's<00:02:26.260> just<00:02:26.410> prove<00:02:26.680> we<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.040> get<00:02:27.220> into

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
minute let's just prove we can get into

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:40.250 
minute let's just prove we can get into
this<00:02:27.580> thing<00:02:27.959> without<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.290> key

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.300 

and<00:02:41.220> there<00:02:41.550> we<00:02:41.640> go<00:02:42.140> okay<00:02:43.140> SPP<00:02:43.709> that's<00:02:43.950> that

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
and there we go okay SPP that's that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.449 
and there we go okay SPP that's that
believe<00:02:44.790> me<00:02:44.970> is<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.480> slow<00:02:45.780> way<00:02:46.160> miss<00:02:47.160> if<00:02:47.340> we

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
believe me is the slow way miss if we

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.009 
believe me is the slow way miss if we
can<00:02:47.610> get<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:47.910> cooperate<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.569> walk<00:02:48.750> back<00:02:48.989> up

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
can get it to cooperate and walk back up

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.460 
can get it to cooperate and walk back up
there<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.620> go<00:02:49.819> alright<00:02:50.819> now<00:02:51.170> let's<00:02:52.170> go<00:02:52.349> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
there we go alright now let's go the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.890 
there we go alright now let's go the
fast<00:02:52.709> way<00:02:53.300> because<00:02:54.300> we<00:02:54.420> know<00:02:54.540> these<00:02:54.690> aren't

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
fast way because we know these aren't

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.870 
fast way because we know these aren't
security<00:02:55.290> pins<00:02:55.530> no<00:02:55.890> precision<00:02:56.280> whatsoever

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
security pins no precision whatsoever

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.280 
security pins no precision whatsoever
I'm<00:02:57.030> gonna<00:02:57.150> put<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.420> picking<00:02:57.720> backwards<00:02:58.170> and

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
I'm gonna put the picking backwards and

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.620 
I'm gonna put the picking backwards and
we're<00:02:58.410> just<00:02:58.500> going<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.709> rock<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.370> place<00:02:59.670> so

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
we're just going to rock it in place so

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.970 
we're just going to rock it in place so
all<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:00.989> way<00:03:01.080> in<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.440> little<00:03:01.620> bit<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.800> tension

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
all the way in a little bit of tension

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.000 
all the way in a little bit of tension
and<00:03:02.340> there<00:03:02.519> we<00:03:02.610> go<00:03:02.730> that's<00:03:03.000> how<00:03:03.180> quick<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.540> is

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
and there we go that's how quick it is

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.050 
and there we go that's how quick it is
try<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.069> one<00:03:05.190> more<00:03:05.250> time<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.180> locked<00:03:08.060> slide

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
try it one more time it is locked slide

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.309 
try it one more time it is locked slide
in<00:03:09.299> there<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.750> just<00:03:10.410> rock<00:03:10.739> them<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.069> place<00:03:11.310> and

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
in there and just rock them in place and

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.620 
in there and just rock them in place and
that's<00:03:13.319> how<00:03:13.590> quick<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:14.940> can<00:03:15.090> zip<00:03:15.360> this

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
that's how quick that is we can zip this

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.589 
that's how quick that is we can zip this
open<00:03:16.049> as<00:03:16.230> well<00:03:16.819> put<00:03:17.819> it<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.180> correct<00:03:18.480> way

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
open as well put it in the correct way

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.910 
open as well put it in the correct way
all<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.200> way<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.440> bottom

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
all the way to the bottom

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.580 
all the way to the bottom
a<00:03:19.950> little<00:03:20.340> bit<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.519> tension<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.989> we<00:03:22.200> can<00:03:22.380> zip

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
a little bit of tension and we can zip

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
a little bit of tension and we can zip
her<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:22.890> there<00:03:23.130> get<00:03:23.579> down<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:24.000> there<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.239> devil

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.059 

if<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:29.940> hit<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.209> hole<00:03:30.390> we<00:03:31.079> can<00:03:31.200> zip<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:34.069> he

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
if I can hit the hole we can zip it he

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.380 
if I can hit the hole we can zip it he
says

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.759 

of<00:03:41.390> course<00:03:41.599> cameras<00:03:42.049> going<00:03:42.230> no<00:03:42.500> telling

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
of course cameras going no telling

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.179 
of course cameras going no telling
what's<00:03:42.920> gonna<00:03:43.040> happen<00:03:43.370> here<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:45.769> there<00:03:46.069> we

what's gonna happen here and there we
have<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.489> got<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.640> zip<00:03:46.879> open<00:03:47.269> so<00:03:48.049> globe<00:03:48.890> locks

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
have you got a zip open so globe locks

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.479 
have you got a zip open so globe locks
probably<00:03:50.060> not<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.450> best<00:03:50.480> choice<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.500> seeing

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
probably not the best choice but seeing

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.390 
probably not the best choice but seeing
as<00:03:52.640> how<00:03:52.760> this<00:03:53.030> one<00:03:53.239> cost<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.840> dollar<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.739> this

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
as how this one cost a dollar and this

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.449 
as how this one cost a dollar and this
one<00:03:55.579> cost<00:03:55.849> a<00:03:56.090> dollar<00:03:56.299> 25<00:03:57.049> I<00:03:57.530> didn't<00:03:58.250> really

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
one cost a dollar 25 I didn't really

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.250 
one cost a dollar 25 I didn't really
expect<00:03:58.879> a<00:03:59.060> whole<00:03:59.180> lot<00:03:59.239> but<00:03:59.750> there<00:03:59.870> you<00:03:59.959> go
