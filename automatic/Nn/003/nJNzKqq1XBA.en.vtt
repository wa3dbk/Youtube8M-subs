00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi how are you and technologies 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.210
 Spring has already spent the holidays 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.350
 we are back where always already 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.929
 you know that during the holidays 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.110
 we usually eat a lot of things pizza 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.400
 gominola torrijas fried milk 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.119
 burgers tacos chocolate eggs 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.000
 ice cream straw lasagna french fries 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.529
 sandwiches cake things that are very 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.990
 good but they do not end up being 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.880
 good for our acid body so 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.470
 in this video I bring you three proposals 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.119
 to learn to eat fruits of a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.070
 funniest way this has a 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.739
 explanation to me I have a hard time eating 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.050
 fruits then looked for many ways 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.579
 different from being able to eat it without me 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.559
 cost so much what I've done has been 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.300
 gather some favorite drinks and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.379
 bring talk in today's video is very 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.690
 good they are very cheap they are very easy and 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.610
 They are healthy and I think we do not need more 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.289
 reasons to enjoy a lot of 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.090
 these recipes and as always I want 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.460
 try not to entertain me a lot we're going to 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.090
 see how the mess is done for the first 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.410
 idea we're going to need an orange 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.560
 to you 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.200
 olive oil 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.790
 and balsamic vinegar of Modena this one 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.600
 reduction but if you do not have you can use 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.600
 normal vinegar 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.340
 let's remove all the shell 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.570
 orange making sure not to leave the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.570
 white part because bitter 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.380
 this must be done very carefully 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.780
 now we split the orange in half and 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:35.330
 We're cutting it into slices of thickness 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.550
 that you like me I like finitas 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.970
 on a large plate we will put all the 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.500
 orange 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.330
 let's add a little salt 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 and let's go back and be a little bit of 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.500
 olive oil on top 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.000
 now we place the tuna on the orange 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.930
 and finally we put reduction of 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.490
 balsamic vinegar of Modena but ya os 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.900
 I say that if you do not have this vinegar 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.900
 normal also goes great 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.120
 and ready this salad is great is 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.290
 very easy to prepare and it's something 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.290
 different to eat fruits 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.400
 for the second idea we're going to need 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.750
 natural pineapple or if you have it from a boat and 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.750
 cheese of the type that you like 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.790
 let's cut half of different 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.790
 cheeses 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.439
 and then let's cut the pineapple are more 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.439
 little ones 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.069
 we place it in a tray 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.860
 with a little order, do not be so 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.100
 disordered as I here I am 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.100
 bundling 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.490
 and now we only have to put the cheese 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.490
 over 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.120
 I know this is so easy that it seems like a 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.470
 joke but assured that it is delicious 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.569
 and for our third idea we are going to 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.300
 need kiwi 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.680
 Strawberry 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.680
 and skewer sticks 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.450
 let's go cutting slices of strawberries 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.490
 that we have previously washed them very 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.510
 well a little bit thicker than what 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.510
 I'm doing here, it's worth 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.260
 then we are going to remove the skin from the kiwi 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.260
 ah 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.930
 and just like with the orange to take it 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.930
 the ends and let's start slices 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.780
 also a little bit thicker than 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.780
 I'm doing it here 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.229
 Now we just have to go painting one 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:19.280
 strawberry a kiwi a strawberry a king 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:19.280
 and so they end 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.990
 and I said a little bit more 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.889
 mine because I have been split 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.169
 pricking 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.180
 and this is very good and a very 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.409
 fun to eat fruits especially 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.030
 for those people who do not 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:41.610
 like to take it in a funny way 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.240
 makes the difference and these are our 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.159
 brought you have to try it and this has 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.900

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:51.240
