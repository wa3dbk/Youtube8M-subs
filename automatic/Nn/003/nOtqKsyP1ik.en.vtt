00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.719
 hello everyone today I'm going to make a chicken 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.969
 the beer the ingredients that 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.270
 we need are a split chicken 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.369
 pieces the shoulders of that size a 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.770
 beer bottle a little pepper 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.349
 ground black half split onion 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:31.369
 finite olive oil flour parsley 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.369
 salt and a garlic 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.730
 The first thing we are going to do is take the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.730
 oil in our pan 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.320
 what happened in the background 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.499
 and we're going to put him to leave 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.499
 warming up 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.680
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.380
 pepper the chicken I like to throw 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.400
 directly the pepper in the flour 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.400
 where are we going to pass 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.330
 because if it stays more distributed all the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.330
 pepper all over the chicken 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.720
 talk we eat all these chicken 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.410
 we talk to you 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.410
 and what we think 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.130
 by the sand 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.490
 we remove the excess flour as 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.490
 forever 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.900
 and we're reserving it 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.080
 when we already have the hot oil 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.650
 let's throw the chicken so he leaves 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.570
 cooling 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.290
 until it is given a golden color by 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.290
 all sides 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.520
 the considerate we take 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.909
 We remove a little excess fat 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:59.740
 with this is enough and about him 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.550
 we miss 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.550
 the onion 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.590
 a little bit transparent 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.810
 we incorporate the garlic that we have 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.810
 Crushed 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.700
 you can not choose 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.010
 and a little bit of flour from which 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.050
 we had before where we have lowered the 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.050
 neck to thicken the sauce 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.440
 then we go a little to remove the flavor 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.440
 of flour flour 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.040
 and the only thing that remains for us to incorporate 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.040
 It's our beer bottle 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.120
 we splash a little water 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.230
 and now we introduce the chicken that 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.230
 we had fried 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.809
 we already have all the chicken we are going to 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.529
 throw a little more water so that 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:40.529
 cover a little 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.050
 a little salt 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.230
 and we let it cook 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.840
 about 20 minutes on medium heat half 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.840
 of cooking try it to taste it from 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.170
 salt and if not then rectify is a 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.170
 bit 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.300
 well, after 20 minutes 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.430
