00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:15.470 

I<00:00:07.620> think<00:00:09.630> some<00:00:10.630> stuff<00:00:10.809> on<00:00:10.929> the<00:00:10.990> defensive<00:00:11.380> end

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.950 

I<00:00:16.480> think<00:00:17.289> this<00:00:18.189> doesn't<00:00:18.640> one<00:00:18.789> where<00:00:19.000> we<00:00:19.119> had

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
I think this doesn't one where we had

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.009 
I think this doesn't one where we had
constructed<00:00:20.759> maintaining<00:00:21.759> and<00:00:22.720> I<00:00:22.779> think

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.019 
constructed maintaining and I think

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.380 
constructed maintaining and I think
that's<00:00:23.230> a<00:00:23.579> some<00:00:24.579> of<00:00:24.699> the<00:00:24.849> coaches<00:00:25.029> really

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
that's a some of the coaches really

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.880 
that's a some of the coaches really
talked<00:00:25.570> about<00:00:25.839> or<00:00:26.079> just<00:00:26.109> communicating<00:00:26.800> on

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
talked about or just communicating on

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.399 
talked about or just communicating on
the<00:00:27.039> offense<00:00:27.279> in<00:00:27.429> America<00:00:27.789> we<00:00:27.999> gave<00:00:28.380> really<00:00:29.380> a

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:29.409 
the offense in America we gave really a

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.190 
the offense in America we gave really a
lot<00:00:29.800> of<00:00:29.980> layups<00:00:30.339> downs<00:00:30.819> and<00:00:31.119> you<00:00:31.630> know<00:00:31.720> high

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
lot of layups downs and you know high

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.040 
lot of layups downs and you know high
percentage<00:00:32.590> shots<00:00:33.690> something<00:00:34.690> a<00:00:34.870> little

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
percentage shots something a little

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:42.930 
percentage shots something a little
different<00:00:35.320> i<00:00:35.769> think<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:41.609> almost<00:00:42.609> the<00:00:42.760> same

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
different i think it's almost the same

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.490 
different i think it's almost the same
that's<00:00:43.359> just<00:00:43.629> a<00:00:43.690> little<00:00:43.899> different<00:00:44.230> just<00:00:44.289> try

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
that's just a little different just try

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.650 
that's just a little different just try
to<00:00:44.559> keep<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.190> little<00:00:45.370> motion<00:00:45.670> but<00:00:46.390> nothing

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
to keep a little motion but nothing

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.590 
to keep a little motion but nothing
major<00:00:46.809> i<00:00:47.199> think<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.969> biggest<00:00:49.179> thing<00:00:49.359> for<00:00:49.449> me

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
major i think the biggest thing for me

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.720 
major i think the biggest thing for me
is<00:00:49.719> just<00:00:49.809> shoot<00:00:50.170> shot<00:00:50.440> when<00:00:50.620> it's<00:00:50.769> over<00:00:50.980> so<00:00:51.640> you

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
is just shoot shot when it's over so you
