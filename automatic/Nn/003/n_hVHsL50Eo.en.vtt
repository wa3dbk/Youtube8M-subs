00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
probably a little bit more to the right

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.290 
probably a little bit more to the right
side<00:04:36.860> might<00:04:37.250> actually<00:04:37.430> open<00:04:37.820> up<00:04:37.910> a<00:04:38.030> choke<00:04:38.270> a

another creep colony but he can't be
sure<00:04:59.690> of<00:04:59.780> this<00:04:59.870> but<00:05:00.050> I<00:05:00.110> think<00:05:00.140> the<00:05:00.770> fact<00:05:01.010> that

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
sure of this but I think the fact that

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.100 
sure of this but I think the fact that
there<00:05:01.280> was<00:05:01.460> no<00:05:01.790> second<00:05:02.180> extractor<00:05:02.750> coming<00:05:03.020> at

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
there was no second extractor coming at

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.230 
there was no second extractor coming at

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
low second gas for carp is definitely a

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.060 
low second gas for carp is definitely a

good<00:06:41.970> idea<00:06:42.270> form<00:06:42.599> here<00:06:42.780> because<00:06:43.050> it's<00:06:43.199> facing

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
good idea form here because it's facing

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.230 
good idea form here because it's facing
lurker<00:06:43.740> since<00:06:43.919> the<00:06:44.009> rule<00:06:44.220> is<00:06:44.370> basically

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
lurker since the rule is basically

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.450 
lurker since the rule is basically
giving<00:06:45.479> myself<00:06:45.710> an<00:06:46.710> additional<00:06:47.220> layer<00:06:47.400> of

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
giving myself an additional layer of

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.390 
giving myself an additional layer of
Defense<00:06:48.389> so<00:06:48.990> basically<00:06:49.440> the<00:06:49.800> workers<00:06:50.130> have<00:06:50.310> to

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
Defense so basically the workers have to

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.469 
Defense so basically the workers have to
break<00:06:50.639> through<00:06:50.849> more<00:06:50.970> than<00:06:51.000> one<00:06:51.270> layer<00:06:51.419> of

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 
break through more than one layer of

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.020 
break through more than one layer of
Defense<00:06:51.720> I<00:06:52.289> also<00:06:52.979> has<00:06:53.130> a<00:06:53.160> factory<00:06:53.550> coming<00:06:53.880> up

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
Defense I also has a factory coming up

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.760 
Defense I also has a factory coming up
so<00:06:54.240> he's<00:06:54.389> probably<00:06:54.720> just<00:06:54.900> gonna<00:06:55.050> try<00:06:55.289> to<00:06:55.349> speed

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
so he's probably just gonna try to speed

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.760 
so he's probably just gonna try to speed
towards<00:06:56.930> science<00:06:57.930> house<00:06:58.169> is<00:06:58.319> probably<00:06:58.470> the

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:23.420 
but i think going for hive at this point
is<00:07:22.319> just<00:07:22.349> a<00:07:22.530> little<00:07:22.710> bit<00:07:22.800> too<00:07:22.889> risky<00:07:23.190> for<00:07:23.220> him

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.430 
is just a little bit too risky for him
