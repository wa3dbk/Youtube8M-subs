00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
piecing things together thinking okay

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.550 
piecing things together thinking okay
well<00:01:44.970> that's<00:01:45.509> connected<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.290> then

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
well that's connected to that and then

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.200 
well that's connected to that and then
something<00:01:46.950> happens<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.490> huge<00:01:47.729> twice<00:01:48.030> and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
something happens it's huge twice and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.749 
something happens it's huge twice and
you're<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.420> oh<00:01:48.570> my<00:01:48.810> god<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.310> happened

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
you're like oh my god what just happened

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.069 
you're like oh my god what just happened
and<00:01:50.850> then<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> end<00:01:51.450> everything<00:01:51.750> comes

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
and then at the end everything comes

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.859 
and then at the end everything comes
together<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:53.520> makes<00:01:53.790> sense<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.360> that's

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
together and it makes sense and that's

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.450 
together and it makes sense and that's
the<00:01:54.990> type<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.290> film<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.680> wanted<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.280> make

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the type of film that I wanted to make

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.219 
the type of film that I wanted to make
make<00:01:57.210> sure<00:01:57.329> you're<00:01:57.479> always<00:01:57.570> writing<00:01:57.960> down

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
make sure you're always writing down

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.289 
make sure you're always writing down
your<00:01:58.290> ideas<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.040> eventually<00:01:59.490> one<00:01:59.759> thing<00:02:00.000> leads

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
your ideas to eventually one thing leads

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.230 
your ideas to eventually one thing leads
to<00:02:00.420> another<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.930> you'll<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:02.009> pretty<00:02:02.969> good

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
to another and you'll have a pretty good

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.660 
to another and you'll have a pretty good
idea<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.710> want<00:02:04.979> your<00:02:05.159> story<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.549> be

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
idea of what you want your story to be

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.100 
idea of what you want your story to be
not<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.090> not<00:02:06.270> exactly<00:02:06.750> what

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
not it's not exactly what

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.450 
not it's not exactly what
going<00:02:07.230> to<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.410> because<00:02:07.860> you're<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.399> to

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
going to be because you're going to

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.370 
going to be because you're going to
figure<00:02:08.729> things<00:02:08.910> out<00:02:09.149> you're<00:02:09.420> going<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:09.630> figure

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
figure things out you're going to figure

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.740 
figure things out you're going to figure
out<00:02:10.500> different<00:02:10.680> little<00:02:11.160> plot<00:02:11.460> details<00:02:11.750> find

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
out different little plot details find

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.270 
out different little plot details find
things<00:02:12.990> out<00:02:13.170> about<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.590> characters<00:02:14.070> you're

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
things out about the characters you're

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.680 
things out about the characters you're
writing<00:02:14.580> about<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.030> you're<00:02:15.270> going<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.450> weave

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
writing about and you're going to weave

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.420 
writing about and you're going to weave
different<00:02:16.290> things<00:02:16.470> together<00:02:16.650> but<00:02:17.280> when

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
different things together but when

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.800 
different things together but when
you're<00:02:17.550> coming<00:02:17.730> up<00:02:17.880> with<00:02:17.970> an<00:02:18.180> idea<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.510> just

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
you're coming up with an idea you just

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.500 
you're coming up with an idea you just
want<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.110> get<00:02:19.230> an<00:02:20.100> overall<00:02:20.370> sense<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.330> type

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
want to get an overall sense of the type

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.160 
want to get an overall sense of the type
of<00:02:21.540> move<00:02:21.810> you're<00:02:21.960> making<00:02:22.320> style<00:02:23.070> and

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
of move you're making style and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.360 
of move you're making style and
basically<00:02:25.170> what<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.740> be<00:02:25.830> about<00:02:26.010> so

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
basically what it's going to be about so

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.700 
basically what it's going to be about so
once<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.940> have<00:02:27.120> an<00:02:27.330> idea<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.960> time<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.500> start

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
once you have an idea it's time to start

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.490 
once you have an idea it's time to start
writing<00:02:28.980> but<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.850> never<00:02:30.390> go<00:02:30.780> straight<00:02:31.350> into

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
writing but I never go straight into

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.590 
writing but I never go straight into
writing<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> screenplay<00:02:32.460> what<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.300> is

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
writing the screenplay what I do is

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.449 
writing the screenplay what I do is
usually<00:02:33.780> outline<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.830> do<00:02:34.890> multiple

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
usually outline and I do multiple

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.060 
usually outline and I do multiple
outlines<00:02:35.760> for<00:02:36.180> for<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.870> machine<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.410> did<00:02:37.590> four

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
outlines for for the machine I did four

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.710 
outlines for for the machine I did four
different<00:02:38.370> outlines<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.910> just<00:02:39.300> like<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.570> do

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
different outlines I just like to do

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.050 
different outlines I just like to do
that<00:02:39.900> because<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.800> play<00:02:41.520> around<00:02:41.850> with

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
that because I can play around with

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.340 
that because I can play around with
things<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.360> could<00:02:42.510> just<00:02:42.660> write<00:02:42.840> down<00:02:43.050> whatever

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
things I could just write down whatever

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.090 
things I could just write down whatever
I<00:02:43.530> want

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
I want

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.280 
I want
I<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.550> narrow<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.970> list<00:02:45.239> down<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.810> what<00:02:46.260> I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
I can narrow that list down to what I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.650 
I can narrow that list down to what I
actually<00:02:46.739> want<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.400> figuring<00:02:48.239> out<00:02:48.300> what<00:02:48.540> is

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
actually want and figuring out what is

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.600 
actually want and figuring out what is
best<00:02:48.900> for<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.320> story<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.040> when<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.370> start

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
best for the story and when you start

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.520 
best for the story and when you start
writing<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.090> most<00:02:51.300> important<00:02:51.810> part<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.170> you

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
writing the most important part and you

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.900 
writing the most important part and you
can<00:02:52.560> figure<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:53.010> out<00:02:53.190> while<00:02:53.489> you're<00:02:53.700> doing

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
can figure this out while you're doing

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.720 
can figure this out while you're doing
outlines<00:02:54.270> that's<00:02:54.510> fine<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:56.100> must<00:02:56.430> know

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
outlines that's fine but you must know

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.940 
outlines that's fine but you must know
the<00:02:57.090> beginning<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.959> film<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.770> end

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
the beginning of the film and the end

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.030 
the beginning of the film and the end
not<00:02:59.670> necessarily<00:03:00.360> exactly<00:03:01.110> what<00:03:01.560> scene<00:03:01.890> it

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
not necessarily exactly what scene it

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.310 
not necessarily exactly what scene it
starts<00:03:02.370> on<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.880> what<00:03:03.450> scene<00:03:03.660> ends<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.170> just

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
starts on and what scene ends you just

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.080 
starts on and what scene ends you just
want<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.560> rough<00:03:04.800> idea<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.220> where<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.640> starts<00:03:05.970> and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
want a rough idea of where it starts and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.990 
want a rough idea of where it starts and
where<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:06.930> going<00:03:07.140> because<00:03:07.820> writing<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
where it's going because writing in the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.790 
where it's going because writing in the
middle<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.600> film<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.260> hardest<00:03:10.590> part

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
middle of the film is the hardest part

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.280 
middle of the film is the hardest part
it's<00:03:11.280> also<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.519> lot<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.700> fun<00:03:11.820> but<00:03:12.720> how<00:03:13.080> are<00:03:13.170> you

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
it's also a lot of fun but how are you

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.990 
it's also a lot of fun but how are you
supposed<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.650> know<00:03:13.860> what<00:03:14.610> you're<00:03:14.640> going<00:03:14.910> to

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
supposed to know what you're going to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.150 
supposed to know what you're going to
write<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.420> middle<00:03:15.750> if<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.470> have<00:03:16.590> no<00:03:16.860> idea

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
write in the middle if you have no idea

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.830 
write in the middle if you have no idea
where<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.459> story<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:17.880> going<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.540> once<00:03:18.720> again

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
where the story is going so once again

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.840 
where the story is going so once again
figuring<00:03:19.320> out<00:03:19.410> what<00:03:19.530> happens<00:03:19.890> in<00:03:20.250> between<00:03:20.370> is

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
figuring out what happens in between is

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.020 
figuring out what happens in between is
the<00:03:21.690> hardest<00:03:22.080> part<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:23.130> looks<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.459> lot<00:03:23.820> like

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
the hardest part and it looks a lot like

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:34.070 
the hardest part and it looks a lot like
this

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.440 

yeah<00:03:35.080> it<00:03:35.980> sucks<00:03:36.370> if<00:03:36.670> you're<00:03:37.270> really

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
yeah it sucks if you're really

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.940 
yeah it sucks if you're really
struggling<00:03:37.780> though<00:03:38.080> just<00:03:38.320> take<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.500> break<00:03:38.710> and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
struggling though just take a break and

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.710 
struggling though just take a break and
do<00:03:39.400> something<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:39.880> doesn't<00:03:40.030> require<00:03:40.390> a<00:03:40.540> lot

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
do something that doesn't require a lot

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.230 
do something that doesn't require a lot
of<00:03:40.870> attention<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.530> lot<00:03:41.890> of<00:03:42.070> my<00:03:42.220> ideas<00:03:42.640> come<00:03:42.880> to

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
of attention a lot of my ideas come to

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.090 
of attention a lot of my ideas come to
me<00:03:43.390> while<00:03:43.600> I'm<00:03:43.840> in<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.200> shower<00:03:44.230> where<00:03:44.950> I'm

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
me while I'm in the shower where I'm

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.470 
me while I'm in the shower where I'm
laying<00:03:45.280> down<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.880> go<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.030> bed<00:03:46.210> at<00:03:46.330> night

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
laying down to go to bed at night

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.570 
laying down to go to bed at night
eventually<00:03:47.440> something<00:03:47.860> will<00:03:47.890> come<00:03:48.280> and

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
eventually something will come and

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.970 
eventually something will come and
you'll<00:03:49.270> figure<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.570> out<00:03:49.810> just<00:03:50.590> make<00:03:50.710> sure

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
you'll figure it out just make sure

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.200 
you'll figure it out just make sure
you're<00:03:51.130> writing<00:03:51.340> everything<00:03:51.670> down<00:03:51.820> though

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
you're writing everything down though

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.840 
you're writing everything down though
and<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:53.260> know<00:03:53.350> I<00:03:53.620> was<00:03:54.070> working<00:03:54.370> on<00:03:54.460> the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
and you know I was working on the

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.970 
and you know I was working on the
machine<00:03:55.180> this<00:03:55.780> is<00:03:55.930> all<00:03:56.080> my<00:03:56.260> outline<00:03:56.680> stuff

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
machine this is all my outline stuff

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.120 
machine this is all my outline stuff
right<00:03:57.100> here<00:04:00.450> lots<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.810> babies<00:04:02.320> or<00:04:02.350> stuff<00:04:02.830> I'm

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
right here lots of babies or stuff I'm

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.920 
right here lots of babies or stuff I'm
just<00:04:03.160> constantly<00:04:03.640> thinking<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.270> towards<00:04:04.840> the

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
just constantly thinking and towards the

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.420 
just constantly thinking and towards the
end<00:04:05.050> here<00:04:05.170> that's<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.590> part<00:04:05.800> where<00:04:05.950> I<00:04:05.980> figured

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
end here that's the part where I figured

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.940 
end here that's the part where I figured
out<00:04:06.610> okay<00:04:07.150> yeah<00:04:07.630> this<00:04:08.020> is<00:04:08.200> what<00:04:08.410> I'm<00:04:08.500> doing<00:04:08.650> and

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
out okay yeah this is what I'm doing and

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.790 
out okay yeah this is what I'm doing and
I<00:04:09.880> just<00:04:10.090> kept<00:04:10.300> on<00:04:10.420> going<00:04:10.480> with<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:11.050> so<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.680> took

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
I just kept on going with it so I took

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.350 
I just kept on going with it so I took
everything<00:04:12.190> that<00:04:12.370> I<00:04:12.550> wrote<00:04:12.730> down<00:04:12.910> in<00:04:13.210> that

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
everything that I wrote down in that

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.080 
everything that I wrote down in that
notebook<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:14.050> then<00:04:14.440> this<00:04:14.890> time<00:04:15.160> which<00:04:15.940> is

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
notebook and then this time which is

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.220 
notebook and then this time which is
different<00:04:16.360> than<00:04:16.450> any<00:04:16.600> other<00:04:16.690> script<00:04:17.080> I've

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
different than any other script I've

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.050 
different than any other script I've
written<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.650> got<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.400> whole<00:04:18.550> bunch<00:04:18.670> of<00:04:18.760> index

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
written I got a whole bunch of index

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.150 
written I got a whole bunch of index
cards<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:19.510> I<00:04:19.570> wrote<00:04:19.750> down<00:04:19.780> each<00:04:20.320> scene<00:04:20.830> or

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
cards and I wrote down each scene or

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.890 
cards and I wrote down each scene or
each<00:04:21.489> location<00:04:21.820> changed<00:04:22.270> on<00:04:22.480> a<00:04:22.540> different

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
each location changed on a different

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.050 
each location changed on a different
index<00:04:23.260> card<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.710> by<00:04:24.250> doing<00:04:24.430> that<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:24.700> was<00:04:24.910> able

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
index card and by doing that I was able

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.400 
index card and by doing that I was able
to<00:04:25.210> polish<00:04:25.600> up<00:04:25.750> what<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:25.990> had<00:04:26.260> written

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
to polish up what I had written

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.830 
to polish up what I had written
previously<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.460> have<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:28.060> work<00:04:28.210> on<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.480> action

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
previously I have to work on the action

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.320 
previously I have to work on the action
lines<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.560> could<00:04:29.620> work<00:04:29.920> on<00:04:30.070> dialogue<00:04:30.580> if<00:04:31.120> you're

because<00:04:37.240> film<00:04:37.720> is<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:37.990> visual<00:04:38.230> medium<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:39.010> you

because film is a visual medium and you

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.370 
because film is a visual medium and you

going<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.800> be<00:04:41.920> a<00:04:41.950> lot<00:04:42.100> more<00:04:42.130> powerful<00:04:42.400> than<00:04:42.880> if

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
going to be a lot more powerful than if

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
might seem like it's unnecessary but it

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.300
