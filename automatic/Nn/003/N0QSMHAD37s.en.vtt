00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:05.200
 in Germany against Mannheim one considers the first three matchdays stands in 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.189
 saturn-arena is an important treat on the program 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.349
 statistically clear advantages for one purely 34 Duelle there were approximately 20 times 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.509
 the eagles won 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.979
 tenth minute Monheim Lindenberg Saal but the team in dark blue in 

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:23.949
 Germany with the counter 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.829
 that is not a foul 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.279
 11 many players have only value to the counter 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.190
 Derek Hahn played in Straubing last season 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.170
 here again ie the preliminary work of Schütz from 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.880
 finally a goal in the Unterzeil 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.859
 four minutes later 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.190
 again turn over Mannheim but this time make which players 

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.620
 Helmet duty only better 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.679
 Christopher Lee 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.090
 the scorer 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.180
 Balance in the 14 minute 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.530
 Guilt were 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.380
 without real ones 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.800
 from the distance 43 that are 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.210
 he finished for the Kölner Haie now in the fourth wm game in the dress of the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.210
 Adler Mannheim makes his third goal 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.960
 Mannheim again 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.380
 Euro 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.030
 gets the disc songs and tells of the hit the 2 2 1 for the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.030
 Guests 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.650
 right 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.490
 both at the gate of animals as before at 1 2 1 and 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.000
 again, the disc is turning 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.060
 End of the first quarter two to one in front of over 3000 spectators nod Germany 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.320
 but out of the way 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.390
 probably led the wrong ones 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.640
 in the second round, a quarter of an hour did not pass open gates 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.189
 led 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.319
 then again outnumbered went Mannheim 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.880
 with the formation co - founder 00 o'clock on the ice and that already to the 1 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.629
 through Janik and somehow 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.310
 and you behind the gate 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.080
 Maccarone in front of the opponent's box but the disc comes so left 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.510
 who continues to double pack 15 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.510
 his first in the DL 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:38.180
 The SWRC's defeat-free world seems to crumble 90 seconds after 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:39.780
 the 1 2 3 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.109
 were again 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.109
 only two to the 3rd 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.030
 now Ingolstadt dives with his double goalscorer in this game 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.620
 Greilinger praises the disc in front of the goal and no one suspected that Bingen from the 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.779
 air 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.599
 stood before the last 20 minutes 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.599
 3 to 2 for Mannheim 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:12.529
 then the 48 minute bully in front of the Mannheim gate 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.479
 the disc gets stuck so 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:21.149
 Bremen the disc 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:22.249
 to the 3 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.389
 but who scored the goal 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:26.599
 after the bully 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.599
 PixelNet also Felbeneben 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:35.809
 and in the goal area we see in the course of Ingolstadt and Mitchell of Mannheim 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.449
 but they may suspect it 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:41.569
 nobody closer 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.189
 at the scabbard referee 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.539
 Hascher Schouten 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.079
 all correct 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.589
 and the scorer Hambrecht 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:55.739
 another five minutes now where those on the other side Nicki already there from the 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.739
 Distance again, the Eagles are ahead 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.589
 at the bully McDonald's winner 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.589
 Neumarkt brings the puck to there 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.629
 and back in Neustadt and under pressure 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.030
 SID named Daniel the goalkeeper out of the game and tried one with him 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.680
 another field player 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.490
 40 seconds before the final siren but the final and the final day 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.290
 the guests 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.730
 Carinthia of the farmers 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.230
 hits the empty goal for 5 to 3 finish 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.950
 in Germany on 7 the first defeat and that in the 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.639
 own stadium 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.219
 but against an opponent who acts again sovereign this season 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.680
 and probably no longer want to tremble for the playoffs as in the past 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.930
 Both years but directly to the quarterfinals should be
