knuckle shot but in this case you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.680 
knuckle shot but in this case you

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
contact the ball in a different angle to

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.359 
contact the ball in a different angle to
create<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.110> effect<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.590> topspin<00:01:49.100> and

create the effect of topspin and

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.790 
create the effect of topspin and
increasing<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.030> dipping<00:01:50.390> of<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.630> ball<00:01:50.810> make

increasing the dipping of the ball make

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.440 
increasing the dipping of the ball make
sure<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.160> contact<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.760> ball<00:01:52.790> right<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.360> the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
sure you contact the ball right in the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.870 
sure you contact the ball right in the
middle<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.990> create<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.380> knuckle<00:01:54.710> effect<00:01:54.880> you

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
middle to create the knuckle effect you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.790 
middle to create the knuckle effect you
contact<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.450> ball<00:01:56.600> from<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.900> lower<00:01:57.080> angle<00:01:57.170> to

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
contact the ball from a lower angle to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.070 
contact the ball from a lower angle to
earn<00:01:57.920> an<00:01:58.040> upward<00:01:58.430> thrusting<00:01:58.880> motion

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
earn an upward thrusting motion

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.810 
earn an upward thrusting motion
therefore<00:02:00.080> you're<00:02:00.410> creating<00:02:00.950> enforcing<00:02:01.729> the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
therefore you're creating enforcing the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.880 
therefore you're creating enforcing the
topspin<00:02:02.270> on<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.479> ball<00:02:02.600> as<00:02:02.899> you<00:02:03.140> can<00:02:03.290> see<00:02:03.500> my

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
topspin on the ball as you can see my

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.499 
topspin on the ball as you can see my
left<00:02:04.070> ankle<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:04.610> in<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.820> pretty<00:02:05.060> extreme

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
left ankle is in a pretty extreme

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.330 
left ankle is in a pretty extreme
position<00:02:06.050> by<00:02:06.259> putting<00:02:06.619> my<00:02:06.710> ankle<00:02:07.070> in<00:02:07.190> this

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
position by putting my ankle in this

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.190 
position by putting my ankle in this
position<00:02:07.820> this<00:02:08.119> helps<00:02:08.450> lower<00:02:08.630> my<00:02:08.840> center<00:02:09.170> of

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
position this helps lower my center of

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.110 
position this helps lower my center of
gravity<00:02:09.290> this<00:02:10.160> will<00:02:10.369> help<00:02:10.550> increase<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
gravity this will help increase the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.210 
gravity this will help increase the
angle<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.690> power<00:02:11.900> behind<00:02:12.260> upward<00:02:12.830> thrusting

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
motion as you contact the ball this will

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.650 
motion as you contact the ball this will
help<00:02:15.739> maximize<00:02:15.950> potential<00:02:16.790> topspin<00:02:17.450> and

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
help maximize potential topspin and

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.690 
help maximize potential topspin and
dipping<00:02:18.020> effect<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.680> ball<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.489> should

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
dipping effect on the ball you should

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.430 
dipping effect on the ball you should
take<00:02:19.880> caution<00:02:20.120> as<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.690> can<00:02:20.989> sprained<00:02:21.320> your

take caution as you can sprained your

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.290 
take caution as you can sprained your
ankle<00:02:21.500> very<00:02:22.040> easily<00:02:22.280> by<00:02:22.670> performing<00:02:23.209> this

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
ankle very easily by performing this

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.750 
ankle very easily by performing this
technique<00:02:23.780> an<00:02:24.160> alternative<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.640> to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
technique an alternative to this is to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.240 
technique an alternative to this is to
jump<00:02:25.970> forward<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:27.380> may<00:02:27.590> help<00:02:27.709> minimize<00:02:28.220> the

jump forward this may help minimize the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.630 
jump forward this may help minimize the
potential<00:02:28.820> injuries<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:29.690> your<00:02:30.019> left<00:02:30.170> ankle
