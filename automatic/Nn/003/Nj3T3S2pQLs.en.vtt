that was actually it was really good

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.750 
that was actually it was really good
because<00:03:02.960> it<00:03:03.960> had<00:03:04.200> its<00:03:04.380> own<00:03:04.500> style<00:03:04.890> because<00:03:05.490> of

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
because it had its own style because of

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.970 
because it had its own style because of
my<00:03:06.180> inadequacies<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:07.080> had<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.560> make<00:03:07.740> through

my inadequacies I had to make through

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.310 
my inadequacies I had to make through
with<00:03:08.160> what<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.340> had<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.720> that's<00:03:09.900> what<00:03:10.080> made

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
with what I had and and that's what made

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.650 
with what I had and and that's what made
it<00:03:10.470> sound<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.040> good<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:11.610> appropriate<00:03:12.090> you
