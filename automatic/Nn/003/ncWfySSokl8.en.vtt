00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.479 
got to modify the shifter because it's
stripped<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.379> how<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.559> won't<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.920> through<00:00:53.160> all

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
stripped is how it won't go through all

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.520 
stripped is how it won't go through all
the<00:00:54.180> gears<00:00:54.480> properly<00:00:56.629> so<00:00:57.629> that's<00:00:57.989> unfinished

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the gears properly so that's unfinished

tonight so i thought i'd show you it's
running<00:01:04.979> again<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.430> yah<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:07.140> fuel<00:01:07.439> filter<00:01:07.740> was

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
running again I yah the fuel filter was

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.649 
running again I yah the fuel filter was
clogged<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:08.610> what<00:01:08.760> was<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.270> that's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
clogged that's what was going on that's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.450 
clogged that's what was going on that's
why<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.869> wouldn't<00:01:10.170> start<00:01:10.860> that's<00:01:11.130> why<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.340> was

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
why it wouldn't start that's why it was

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.260 
why it wouldn't start that's why it was
very<00:01:12.060> sporadic<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.140> would<00:01:13.290> run<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:15.030> got

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
very sporadic when it would run so I got

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.490 
very sporadic when it would run so I got
rid<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> fuel<00:01:15.780> filter<00:01:16.020> has<00:01:16.229> put<00:01:16.470> a

hacking<00:02:04.410> go<00:02:04.530> sharp<00:02:04.860> right<00:02:05.220> hand<00:02:05.430> turns<00:02:05.700> on

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
hacking go sharp right hand turns on

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.490 
hacking go sharp right hand turns on
this<00:02:06.440> it's<00:02:07.440> not<00:02:07.530> too<00:02:07.740> bad<00:02:09.020> then<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.050> haven't<00:02:10.410> yet

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
this it's not too bad then I haven't yet

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.710 
this it's not too bad then I haven't yet
figured<00:02:10.680> out<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:12.120> need<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.450> put<00:02:12.600> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
figured out the I need to put the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.040 
figured out the I need to put the
throttle<00:02:12.930> cable<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.500> new<00:02:13.700> clutch<00:02:14.700> cable<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.240> but

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
throttle cable a new clutch cable in but

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.330 
throttle cable a new clutch cable in but
I<00:02:16.080> want<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.320> see<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.590> can<00:02:16.650> adopt<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.130> clutch

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
I want to see if I can adopt a clutch

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.150 
I want to see if I can adopt a clutch
cable<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.120> also<00:02:18.420> throttle<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.020> engine<00:02:19.160> now

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
cable to also throttle the engine now

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.860 
cable to also throttle the engine now
you<00:02:20.220> can<00:02:20.340> get<00:02:20.460> rid<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.940> throttle<00:02:21.390> here

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
you can get rid of this throttle here

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.770 
you can get rid of this throttle here
and<00:02:21.990> just<00:02:22.110> keep<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.470> choke<00:02:22.740> right<00:02:23.280> there<00:02:23.780> so

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and just keep the choke right there so

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.600 
and just keep the choke right there so
when<00:02:25.110> quickly<00:02:25.470> fired<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:25.950> can't<00:02:26.160> let<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.370> run

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
when quickly fired I can't let it run

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.450 
when quickly fired I can't let it run
for<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.910> long<00:02:27.120> muscles<00:02:27.360> off<00:02:31.010> that's<00:02:32.010> all<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.190> can

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
for a long muscles off that's all I can

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.540 
for a long muscles off that's all I can
do<00:02:32.900> but<00:02:33.900> as<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:34.590> see<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.890> starting<00:02:35.370> up

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
do but as you can see it starting up

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.510 
do but as you can see it starting up
right<00:02:35.760> away<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.150> that's<00:02:36.210> on<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.720> old<00:02:37.560> old

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
right away and that's on that old old

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.600 
right away and that's on that old old
old<00:02:38.790> battery<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:40.560> battery<00:02:40.740> stood<00:02:41.280> enough<00:02:41.490> to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
old battery the battery stood enough to

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.360 
old battery the battery stood enough to
start<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:42.470> also<00:02:43.470> if<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.740> get<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.130> tire

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
start this also if I do get this tire

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.850 
start this also if I do get this tire
off<00:02:44.580> once<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:44.940> do<00:02:45.440> battery's<00:02:46.440> gonna<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:46.770> be

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
off once I do battery's gonna have to be

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.360 
off once I do battery's gonna have to be
moved<00:02:46.980> again<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.740> have<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.860> try<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.070> find<00:02:50.250> a

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
moved again so I have to try to find a

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.250 
moved again so I have to try to find a
spot<00:02:50.700> for<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.330> don't<00:02:51.720> know<00:02:51.810> where<00:02:52.020> I'm<00:02:52.110> going

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
spot for it I don't know where I'm going

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.720 
spot for it I don't know where I'm going
to<00:02:52.350> put<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.530> battery<00:02:52.920> though<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:55.040> got<00:02:56.040> box<00:02:56.340> for

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
to put the battery though I got box for

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.620 
to put the battery though I got box for
it<00:02:56.820> so<00:02:56.940> that's<00:02:57.090> not<00:02:57.240> an<00:02:57.360> issue<00:02:58.820> but<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.880> am<00:03:00.180> kind

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
it so that's not an issue but I am kind

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.300 
it so that's not an issue but I am kind
of<00:03:00.780> running<00:03:01.110> out<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.260> space<00:03:01.590> on<00:03:01.800> this<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.130> may

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
of running out of space on this I may

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.120 
of running out of space on this I may
have<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.670> mount<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.300> somehow<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.950> back<00:03:05.100> of

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
have to mount it somehow to the back of

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.770 
have to mount it somehow to the back of
the<00:03:05.340> frame<00:03:05.610> rail<00:03:05.850> here<00:03:06.120> I'm<00:03:06.270> not<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.480> hundred

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
the frame rail here I'm not a hundred

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.500 
the frame rail here I'm not a hundred
percent<00:03:07.050> sure<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:11.690> that's<00:03:12.690> that's<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.500> for<00:03:13.709> now

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
percent sure so that's that's it for now

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.220 
percent sure so that's that's it for now
also<00:03:15.510> pulleys<00:03:16.970> I'm<00:03:17.970> on<00:03:18.120> obviously<00:03:18.810> do<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> large

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
also pulleys I'm on obviously do a large

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.560 
also pulleys I'm on obviously do a large
one<00:03:19.410> off<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.739> engine<00:03:20.070> small<00:03:20.430> tiny<00:03:20.940> tiny<00:03:21.360> one

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
one off the engine small tiny tiny one

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.520 
one off the engine small tiny tiny one
on<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.780> transmission<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.930> will<00:03:25.380> be<00:03:25.500> a

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
on the transmission and that will be a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.370 
on the transmission and that will be a
pulley<00:03:25.800> setup<00:03:26.630> there's<00:03:27.630> most<00:03:27.989> amount<00:03:28.260> of

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
pulley setup there's most amount of

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.840 
pulley setup there's most amount of
speed<00:03:28.650> out<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.860> this<00:03:28.950> thing<00:03:29.190> as<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.489> can<00:03:29.640> get

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
speed out of this thing as I can get

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.080 
speed out of this thing as I can get
because<00:03:30.720> again<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.340> street<00:03:32.640> legal<00:03:32.820> golf

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
because again it's a street legal golf

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.690 
because again it's a street legal golf
cart<00:03:33.420> because<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.989> has<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.140> more<00:03:34.590> that's<00:03:35.550> why

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
cart because it has that more that's why

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.790 
cart because it has that more that's why
I<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:37.140> going<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.350> be<00:03:37.410> fun<00:03:37.620> when

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
I like this it's going to be fun when

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.880 
I like this it's going to be fun when
it's<00:03:37.950> done<00:03:38.180> i'm<00:03:39.180> hopefully<00:03:39.660> i<00:03:39.989> can<00:03:40.230> i<00:03:40.739> can

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
it's done i'm hopefully i can i can

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.650 
it's done i'm hopefully i can i can
drive<00:03:41.160> right<00:03:41.220> now<00:03:41.520> is<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.880> pull<00:03:42.239> up<00:03:42.360> on<00:03:42.510> the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
drive right now is to pull up on the

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.020 
drive right now is to pull up on the
existing<00:03:43.170> cable<00:03:43.560> as<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.400> cable<00:03:44.489> still

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
existing cable as the cable still

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.150 
existing cable as the cable still
connected<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.660> clutch<00:03:45.900> let's<00:03:46.860> just<00:03:47.010> not

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
connected to the clutch let's just not

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.240 
connected to the clutch let's just not
connect<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.550> to<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.820> pedal<00:03:48.120> anymore<00:03:49.250> excuse

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
connect it to the pedal anymore excuse

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.870 
connect it to the pedal anymore excuse
me<00:03:50.690> so<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.720> could<00:03:51.930> still<00:03:52.050> drive<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.709> but<00:03:53.040> that

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
me so I could still drive it but that

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.060 
me so I could still drive it but that
wear<00:03:54.060> gloves<00:03:54.530> until<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.590> can<00:03:55.709> get<00:03:55.800> some

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
wear gloves until you can get some

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.600 
wear gloves until you can get some
tension<00:03:56.790> on<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.000> cable

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
tension on the cable

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.830 
tension on the cable
so<00:03:59.240> tomorrow<00:03:59.870> my<00:04:00.290> plan<00:04:00.650> is<00:04:01.360> try<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.420> get<00:04:02.630> this

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
so tomorrow my plan is try to get this

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.910 
so tomorrow my plan is try to get this
left<00:04:03.470> side<00:04:03.770> tire<00:04:04.250> off<00:04:04.690> I'll<00:04:05.690> even<00:04:05.900> heat<00:04:06.710> it<00:04:06.740> up

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
left side tire off I'll even heat it up

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.860 
left side tire off I'll even heat it up
a<00:04:07.070> bit<00:04:07.100> too<00:04:07.460> that's<00:04:08.030> it's<00:04:08.270> not<00:04:08.480> even<00:04:08.720> budging

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
a bit too that's it's not even budging

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.070 
a bit too that's it's not even budging

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
tires eventually i was going to try to

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.280 
tires eventually i was going to try to
test<00:04:22.130> fit<00:04:22.370> some<00:04:22.580> of<00:04:22.670> those<00:04:22.760> ones<00:04:23.120> but<00:04:23.390> they<00:04:24.110> hit

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
test fit some of those ones but they hit

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.250 
test fit some of those ones but they hit
them<00:04:24.470> over<00:04:24.590> too<00:04:24.890> much<00:04:25.360> they'll<00:04:26.360> rub<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:27.020> rub

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
them over too much they'll rub the rub

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.120 
them over too much they'll rub the rub
way<00:04:27.500> too<00:04:27.560> much<00:04:27.890> so<00:04:28.660> this<00:04:29.660> is<00:04:29.930> tires<00:04:30.350> along<00:04:30.800> with

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
way too much so this is tires along with

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.860 
way too much so this is tires along with
these<00:04:31.340> ones<00:04:31.610> here<00:04:31.760> i'm<00:04:31.910> not<00:04:32.090> sure<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.360> size<00:04:32.600> i

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870

for it but I think they're about 12 or
14<00:04:41.600> s<00:04:42.080> ray<00:04:42.800> around<00:04:43.070> there<00:04:43.280> so<00:04:44.120> not<00:04:44.360> bad
