00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.620
 art accessible milan - these were in the company of daniele nicolosi the born for 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.620
 bones hello daniele beautiful evening serene hello 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.999
 I tell you a little about this work you did 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:16.109
 palazzolo back on the facade of the 24 hour sun treaty 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.800
 then he called me 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.640
 research 2 3 months ago there are clear channels for me in this new project 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.189
 was 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.360
 a4 motorway 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.180
 which have max as the organization was changing a bit I was trying to 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.470
 increase milk quality 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.710
 who work called 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.840
 several artists, many curators have chosen to let participate see call 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.100
 due to certain artists they could increase the value of 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.050
 this concept of accessible art 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.600
 I also asked him when I was a very good artist. 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.140
 I came to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.910
 1 usd generates location 0 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.310
 4 hours of intervening natural habitat that 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.540
 that of the street 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.550
 presenting people who do not have a job completely free 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.480
 possibility of accessing mail 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.970
 building because they don't have time because I don't want because they haven't read 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.030
 but who find themselves in front of an artistic intervention 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.899
 and they can cultivate it or quite the contrary 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.899
 I can't be sorry to find myself 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.380
 and therefore this company pvc water 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.180
 he decided to come back anyway 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.180
 to make the space 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.710
 exploitable dame 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.710
 then talking about asking the project for a chance 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.840
 renzo piano di volterra 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.240
 if I could carry out this type of intervention 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.930
 it was. the time of the ok yes spent the inter instead 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.840
 there are no more that yes instead passport fortunately positively 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.370
 note well 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.810
 and no colonel using recycled materials basically 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 in the company 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.470
 renting a 19-meter lift basket 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.660
 here we are to a friend before the first day fabio apartments salento 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.170
 and second day, luca bernocchi read until he too greets 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.879
 that helped me 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.620
 to carry out interventions have been anxiety before 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.240
 before leaving, saying but seeing something quiet and then instead we are 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.569
 rediscovered a 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.479
 spend 14 hours a day helping me 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.479
 erected the species of 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.769
 opel astra from those inspired by 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.189
 massages who is can be voted on his thoughts by 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.419
 from distant countries reserved 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.419
 the den of the genus very close to a year 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.099
 that is coming that takes care of the 2015 expo then 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.449
 buildings rather than building 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.669
 this sun builds its own physically varazze 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.809
 it is a theme that is clear to me also because anyway 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:00.649
 I presented various types of installation related to the theme of the new expo 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.859
 in this case I needed it 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.589
 I really enjoyed the Palazzo di Renzo Piano as a TV show symbol 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.679
 international as a symbol of architecture 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.219
 this time 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.069
 the improvement of the city which in most cases could be 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.809
 also positive often willingly especially in these vital years 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:24.679
 we have seen that probably 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.209
 he's bringing it 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.209
 a social value because architecture is also a 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.929
 the installation is called 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:35.589
 nature pavilion 2 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:37.599
 because the first one was put up 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.559
 scaffold s. 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:42.659
 on scaffolding 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.849
 the piazza cantore sempra milan lasted 12 hours me 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.429
 only the photos remained 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:49.629
 sign while the theater 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.929
 the type of acts 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:54.929
 cfu the countries that will come 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.799
 italy easyterra mail 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.789
 try their projects to which 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:05.789
 as if it were a big one 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.689
 we are ironic about this land of the pavilion today 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:12.799
 is one of the cities 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.749
 as an absolute no 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.129
 and with this expo 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:23.569
 everything is waived and the old man is renounced to carry 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.569
 forward projects new more custom types today 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.789
 for you this kiss its social value 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.270
 they are all registered mad there have been 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.059
 a thousand problems and in the end 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:37.909
 we beat the precious 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:42.099
 boh wanted to embellish work and at the end of all the love I published 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:43.120
 don't have them 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.030
 all phases even when the candleholder of the candle was unloaded 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.030
 Good Friday 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.580
 riccardi tails 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.979
 all the desire to be able 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.050
 tim or ansi 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.259
 intervention days 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.259
 only one facade came out only elementary 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:06.959
 that he was also stolen a reel it was indispensable for purpose 

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:07.740
 work 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.789
 and evidently it was not really the case of acireale 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.219
 at level to color the destiny wanted it to end work in this 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:17.249
 week when we can see relationship was 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.249
 I hope you were here now 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.439
 in the company to understand judo stelvio 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.959
 and let's see to sex often and willingly these interventions are indeed self-produced 

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:34.959
 also because therefore my contribution was completely free 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.810
 it seems to me almost commissioned by pvc which was not so 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.159
 weather italy completely 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.159
 self-produced like most 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.159
 because this type of art that 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:57.629
 but you can't do to see realized 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:00.629
 for yourself for the others I finish I don't have a penis 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:05.989
 this we will ask at least laugh only this bonita has left the most 

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:07.860
 can we hope 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.230
 thank you daniele votta wolf for your next integration projects
