00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:13.389
 My new home is coming, and I arrived. 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.349
 here I was talking to the staff of 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.570
 change 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.619
 I got here first to get the 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.259
 with the agency here is the 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:27.730
 entrance of our house does not have to 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:30.279
 check in with the agency 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.439
 pick up the key, and then the 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.329
 change begins to come to bring everything 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.720
 but as soon as I have the keys I 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.990
 I'll try to make a video of her inside. 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.420
 show empty house and then some 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.270
 Imagine I do another video 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.900
 mtur to show the rest of the house 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.770
 ready, I got home, everything is new. 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:58.620
 I just took inventory of the 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.690
 change with the real estate agency then 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.130
 Let's go for a ride, here I go. 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:10.900
 change until you can not change the camera 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:17.170
 I can tell you, it's all over again. 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:19.420
 enter the broker is a box in 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.320
 English and here is what they call 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.880
 split leads so that the ground floor in the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.320
 It's true what we 're about to 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.470
 get here from the street have to know a 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.510
 and downstairs is the kitchen with 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.060
 Gardens have to go down the same staircase 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.570
 I do not know they do it again. 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:41.140
 but it is very common that this class 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.690
 you can see the neighborhood then here the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.700
 People are going to do it here it's going to be kind to 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:51.130
 tv room living room and tv has 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:57.100
 installations for placing television in the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:59.680
 wall has is the fire we haia 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.830
 will put a sofa reason only to us 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.460
 made a sofa that will get you 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.879
 take this wall all over the place and the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.299
 chairs and nothing else and here in this 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:16.990
 side is technically the dining room but 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.510
 then my loss was like the kitchen 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.990
 large dining also we will 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.720
 do that it will be kind of the 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.840
 Isabella with books so I guess I 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.260
 I'll have only one chair done like that. 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.010
 an armchair to the corner and to have 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.820
 plenty of free space on the floor 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.020
 iacc then this is the first part of the 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:47.550
 first floor 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:51.040
 But when we come down, it 's the kitchen. 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.740
 with the dirty floor that stands out from the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.230
 kitchen is very large 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:01.480
 nine ciman all reformed 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.470
 So you see how spacious it is then 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.860
 aunt 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:11.050
 We'll put it on our table . 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:15.340
 dinner that fit the sun is a table of 66 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.250
 places I think it expands to 8 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.380
 There's this door there as soon as I open it. 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.680
 here there are gardens in which no garden is a 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.300
 this at least the Maria so open 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.180
 We will put the plants 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:36.760
 toys out here for isabella 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:39.220
 the kitchen and close the door there is a 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.700
 What type of basement do you think I have 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.950
 access also to here is the bathroom with 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.780
 He is very good, he also understands that he is part 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.640
 and was laundry washing and drying 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.960
 So, the one that we're going to put 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.170
 shelf shelves and such 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:02.220
 dispense cleaning product comes here has 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.220
 a shower 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:14.040
 this house is here that has a closet to 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:18.030
 This one here is the third room 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:23.460
 so here is going to be guest room 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:28.819
 office gym everything but 60 cm 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.819
 the fourth the room of the mess 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.970
 she climbed me up all these stairs again 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.000
 were the main reason why 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.190
 people came to see the house the first time the self 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.590
 Did not like it because it has all this division. 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.110
 You know, we were used to it. 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.509
 another apartment that all areas 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.310
 april but for the others and it was all 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:55.380
 even walking then the house flowed better 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.590
 So this one is very different here. 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.849
 a cross-border 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.630
 this one is the bathroom I think it will 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:08.990
 To be my father, I'm going to split, not have 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.990
 a shower and also has a bath 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:20.880
 here I am a closet and this closet 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.050
 which is why I can also 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:28.710
 I told the bathroom and the bathroom. 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:30.210
 iacc ascended the second and last floor 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:36.590
 the house where the other two are 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:40.530
 Wednesdays was here is our fourth duel 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.979
 which is not giant but is quite large 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.139
 We 'll put the bed in the middle. 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:51.150
 more shelves or shelves those two 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:54.210
 sides had a fireplace there I guess 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.520
 who closed thanks to God here from the other 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.440
 side of the yew window to the street has to 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:04.199
 put the curtain on and here 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.719
 the margin is pretty good 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:10.080
 not all houses in england have 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:13.259
 We got one-tone oil too. 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.370
 It's just for tomorrow to store things. 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:20.330
 This is the fourth time the beautiful has a 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.949
 Yes, yes, but that does not work. 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.190
 But her room does not have but does not have 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.200
 Nothing, we're going to have to buy one. 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.990
 crib she'll be staying 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:34.340
 this side a cabinet on the other side with 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:36.500
 a dresser here that her room is 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:42.620
 for the funds then it 's quieter 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:46.040
 also in low and is located in a garden and is 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.380
 this does not have much more to 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:53.810
 show the house not 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:56.000
 Now I'm going down again by the Ghanaian house. 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.270
 is trying to train 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.090
 Isabela psychologically to deal with 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:07.130
 with staircase and raissa'm already well 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.840
 dreaming of Christmas decoration in 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.120
 sand 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.310

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.080

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.490
 It will get old by Christmas in the house soon. 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.770
 still I do not know but I think as 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.500
 people are not planning to put any 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.150
 mobile here in this room and then I think 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:27.230
 it's time to go home kind of stay 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:31.070

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:33.500

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.390
 arrive with the moving company to 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.450

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.630

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.630
