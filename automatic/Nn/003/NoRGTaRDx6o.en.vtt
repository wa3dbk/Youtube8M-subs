this<00:02:36.030> torso<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.480> lot<00:02:36.690> better<00:02:36.930> than<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> old<00:02:37.440> one

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
this torso a lot better than the old one

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.490 
this torso a lot better than the old one
and<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:37.980> do<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.820> old<00:02:39.000> one<00:02:39.120> right<00:02:39.360> here<00:02:39.630> so

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
as you can see this tour so I think is

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.740 
as you can see this tour so I think is
more<00:02:53.220> detailed<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:53.760> my<00:02:53.850> opinion<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.480> just

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
more detailed in my opinion it just

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.560 
more detailed in my opinion it just
looks<00:02:55.019> better<00:02:55.170> overall<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.150> he<00:02:57.150> does<00:02:57.329> have<00:02:57.540> a

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
looks better overall and he does have a

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.910 
looks better overall and he does have a
blaster<00:02:58.400> then<00:02:59.400> on<00:02:59.579> the<00:02:59.610> back<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:01.350> new<00:03:01.650> back

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
blaster then on the back the new back

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.759 
blaster then on the back the new back
looks<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.459> lot<00:03:02.640> better<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.120> my<00:03:03.239> opinion<00:03:03.769> but

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
looks a lot better in my opinion but

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.250 
looks a lot better in my opinion but
that's<00:03:04.980> just<00:03:05.220> my<00:03:05.400> opinion<00:03:05.430> um<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.690> think<00:03:06.720> Lego

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
that's just my opinion um I think Lego

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.870 
that's just my opinion um I think Lego
they<00:03:07.500> should<00:03:07.739> have<00:03:07.860> printed<00:03:08.100> legs<00:03:08.489> onto<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
they should have printed legs onto the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.610 
they should have printed legs onto the
stormtrooper<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.630> they<00:03:10.170> should<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.470> just

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
stormtrooper and they should have just

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.410 
stormtrooper and they should have just
did<00:03:11.190> what<00:03:11.400> they<00:03:11.549> did<00:03:11.610> with<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.970> sand<00:03:12.269> trooper

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
did what they did with the sand trooper

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.729 
did what they did with the sand trooper
but<00:03:13.170> took<00:03:13.470> all<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:14.010> sand<00:03:14.280> off<00:03:15.500> because<00:03:16.500> as<00:03:16.620> you

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
but took all the sand off because as you

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.970 
but took all the sand off because as you
can<00:03:16.799> see<00:03:16.890> here<00:03:17.430> he<00:03:17.880> has<00:03:18.030> pretty<00:03:18.329> legs<00:03:18.690> but<00:03:19.110> he

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
can see here he has pretty legs but he

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.710 
can see here he has pretty legs but he
has<00:03:20.070> sand<00:03:20.340> on<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.519> but<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:20.940> think<00:03:20.970> Lego<00:03:21.360> changed

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
has sand on it but I think Lego changed

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.569 
has sand on it but I think Lego changed
to<00:03:21.870> all<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.200> sand<00:03:22.440> off<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.799> did<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.070> for<00:03:23.280> the

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
to all the sand off and did that for the

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.190 
to all the sand off and did that for the
irregular<00:03:23.790> stormtroopers<00:03:24.390> here<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:27.660> if<00:03:27.989> you

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
irregular stormtroopers here so if you

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.560 
irregular stormtroopers here so if you
take<00:03:28.410> off<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.769> stormtroopers<00:03:29.310> helmet<00:03:29.670> he

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
take off the stormtroopers helmet he

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.630 
take off the stormtroopers helmet he
does<00:03:30.900> have<00:03:31.109> a<00:03:31.260> new<00:03:31.440> head<00:03:31.620> which<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.430> head<00:03:32.609> is

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
does have a new head which this head is

that's always been put here now the
speeder<00:05:24.330> bike<00:05:24.509> has<00:05:24.779> been<00:05:25.050> modified<00:05:25.199> a<00:05:25.740> little

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:25.769 
speeder bike has been modified a little

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:28.519 
speeder bike has been modified a little
bit<00:05:26.279> and<00:05:26.519> I<00:05:27.209> have<00:05:27.839> to<00:05:27.990> say<00:05:28.139> this<00:05:28.289> is<00:05:28.409> probably

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:28.529 
bit and I have to say this is probably

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.019 
bit and I have to say this is probably
the<00:05:28.769> best<00:05:29.009> design<00:05:29.339> to<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.519> speeder<00:05:29.849> bike

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
the best design to the speeder bike

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:33.019 
the best design to the speeder bike
Legos<00:05:30.389> done<00:05:30.569> so<00:05:30.749> far<00:05:31.459> so<00:05:32.459> you<00:05:32.550> can<00:05:32.759> take<00:05:32.909> your

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
Legos done so far so you can take your

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.879 
Legos done so far so you can take your
scout<00:05:33.269> trooper<00:05:33.659> and<00:05:33.809> put<00:05:34.199> them<00:05:34.289> on<00:05:34.499> the

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
scout trooper and put them on the

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.230 
scout trooper and put them on the
speeder<00:05:35.399> bike<00:05:35.639> like<00:05:36.599> that<00:05:37.789> actually<00:05:38.789> that<00:05:38.999> and

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
speeder bike like that actually that and

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.179 
speeder bike like that actually that and
then<00:05:39.779> he<00:05:39.959> can<00:05:40.169> hold<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.869> handles<00:05:42.869> and<00:05:43.189> you

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:44.189 
then he can hold the handles and you

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:45.379 
then he can hold the handles and you
could<00:05:44.339> actually<00:05:44.459> have<00:05:44.759> them<00:05:44.849> only<00:05:45.029> holding

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
could actually have them only holding

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.389 
could actually have them only holding
one<00:05:45.569> holding<00:05:45.990> up<00:05:46.079> his<00:05:46.169> pistol<00:05:46.649> just<00:05:47.009> like<00:05:47.219> the

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:47.399 
one holding up his pistol just like the

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:50.929 
one holding up his pistol just like the
box<00:05:47.729> art<00:05:48.229> so<00:05:49.229> this<00:05:49.889> is<00:05:50.069> the<00:05:50.219> scout<00:05:50.550> troopers

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:50.939 
box art so this is the scout troopers

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:54.049 
box art so this is the scout troopers
speed<00:05:51.599> erotica<00:05:51.959> and<00:05:52.079> that's<00:05:52.639> one<00:05:53.639> part<00:05:53.819> of<00:05:53.909> the

00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:54.059 
speed erotica and that's one part of the

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:58.429 
speed erotica and that's one part of the
set<00:05:56.089> so<00:05:57.089> the<00:05:57.300> other<00:05:57.479> part<00:05:57.689> of<00:05:57.809> the<00:05:57.929> set<00:05:58.139> you<00:05:58.289> get

00:05:58.429 --> 00:05:58.439 
set so the other part of the set you get

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.859 
set so the other part of the set you get
like<00:05:58.559> a<00:05:58.589> little<00:05:58.860> tree<00:05:59.159> with<00:06:00.149> a<00:06:00.179> flick<00:06:00.659> fire

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:00.869 
like a little tree with a flick fire

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:03.230 
like a little tree with a flick fire
missile<00:06:01.199> on<00:06:01.349> it<00:06:01.499> and<00:06:02.069> actually<00:06:02.279> fire<00:06:02.909> missiles

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
missile on it and actually fire missiles

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.430 
missile on it and actually fire missiles
backwards

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.510 

so<00:06:09.440> you<00:06:09.500> get<00:06:09.680> a<00:06:09.710> little<00:06:09.890> tree<00:06:10.130> with<00:06:10.280> of<00:06:10.400> the

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
so you get a little tree with of the

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.510 
so you get a little tree with of the
fire<00:06:10.700> whistle<00:06:11.060> on<00:06:11.180> it<00:06:11.330> so<00:06:12.320> i'm<00:06:13.100> going<00:06:13.280> to<00:06:13.370> show

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
fire whistle on it so i'm going to show

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.340 
fire whistle on it so i'm going to show
you<00:06:13.550> other<00:06:13.790> parts<00:06:14.090> of<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.210> tree<00:06:14.420> first<00:06:14.600> so

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
you other parts of the tree first so

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.750 
you other parts of the tree first so
here<00:06:15.560> you<00:06:15.650> have<00:06:15.710> like<00:06:15.950> a<00:06:15.980> little<00:06:16.160> gate<00:06:16.520> or

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
here you have like a little gate or

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.880 
here you have like a little gate or
fence<00:06:17.150> or<00:06:17.330> everyone<00:06:17.780> called<00:06:18.020> and<00:06:18.350> you<00:06:18.590> can<00:06:18.740> pub

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
fence or everyone called and you can pub

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.750 
fence or everyone called and you can pub
like<00:06:19.040> the<00:06:19.190> weapons<00:06:19.460> in<00:06:19.910> that<00:06:20.090> fence<00:06:21.370> so<00:06:22.370> i<00:06:22.400> put

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
like the weapons in that fence so i put

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.850 
like the weapons in that fence so i put
the<00:06:22.970> rebels<00:06:23.540> gun<00:06:23.840> there<00:06:24.020> and<00:06:24.260> have<00:06:24.410> a<00:06:24.440> manning

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
the rebels gun there and have a manning

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.030 
the rebels gun there and have a manning
the<00:06:24.950> tour<00:06:25.220> turret<00:06:25.820> and<00:06:26.140> of<00:06:27.140> course<00:06:27.500> just<00:06:27.830> any

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
the tour turret and of course just any

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.610 
the tour turret and of course just any
regular<00:06:28.280> flipped<00:06:29.150> on<00:06:29.330> the<00:06:29.450> school<00:06:29.690> shoot<00:06:30.530> out

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
regular flipped on the school shoot out

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.940 
regular flipped on the school shoot out
the<00:06:30.800> missile<00:06:32.170> and<00:06:33.170> that's<00:06:33.470> the<00:06:33.590> flick<00:06:33.800> I

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
the missile and that's the flick I

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.560 
the missile and that's the flick I
missile<00:06:34.310> and<00:06:34.430> that's<00:06:34.580> pretty<00:06:34.970> much<00:06:35.090> it<00:06:35.240> for

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570 
missile and that's pretty much it for

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.680 
missile and that's pretty much it for
the<00:06:36.320> tree<00:06:36.710> so<00:06:37.610> just<00:06:37.880> a<00:06:37.940> little<00:06:38.000> tree<00:06:38.420> got<00:06:38.660> a

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
the tree so just a little tree got a

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.430 
the tree so just a little tree got a
grass<00:06:38.930> piece<00:06:39.230> low<00:06:39.800> base<00:06:40.570> so<00:06:41.570> with<00:06:41.960> this<00:06:42.140> set

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
grass piece low base so with this set

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.800 
grass piece low base so with this set
doesn't<00:06:43.040> come<00:06:43.160> with<00:06:43.250> a<00:06:43.340> lot<00:06:43.520> this<00:06:44.180> set<00:06:44.420> is<00:06:44.570> more

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
doesn't come with a lot this set is more

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.620 
doesn't come with a lot this set is more
if<00:06:45.020> you're<00:06:45.170> expanding<00:06:45.800> like<00:06:46.280> to<00:06:46.700> make<00:06:46.850> a<00:06:46.880> rebel

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
if you're expanding like to make a rebel

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.050 
if you're expanding like to make a rebel
army<00:06:47.960> or<00:06:48.140> a<00:06:48.200> Imperial<00:06:48.860> Army<00:06:49.160> you<00:06:49.760> can<00:06:49.910> get<00:06:50.030> a

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
army or a Imperial Army you can get a

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.700 
army or a Imperial Army you can get a
bunch<00:06:50.330> of<00:06:50.450> these<00:06:50.540> sets<00:06:50.810> or<00:06:51.020> if<00:06:51.320> you're<00:06:51.440> making

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
bunch of these sets or if you're making

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.410 
bunch of these sets or if you're making
an<00:06:51.800> indoor<00:06:52.130> mock<00:06:52.340> this<00:06:52.910> would<00:06:53.030> probably<00:06:53.150> be

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.420 
an indoor mock this would probably be

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.080 
an indoor mock this would probably be
good<00:06:53.450> for<00:06:53.780> you<00:06:53.870> just<00:06:54.110> to<00:06:54.230> get<00:06:54.350> minifigures<00:06:55.220> not

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090 
good for you just to get minifigures not

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.480 
good for you just to get minifigures not
really<00:06:56.510> much<00:06:56.630> of<00:06:56.690> the<00:06:56.900> set<00:06:57.170> unless<00:06:57.350> you<00:06:58.280> really

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
really much of the set unless you really

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.940 
really much of the set unless you really
need<00:06:58.760> the<00:06:59.000> speeder<00:06:59.270> bikes<00:06:59.540> the<00:07:00.530> tree<00:07:00.830> itself

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
need the speeder bikes the tree itself

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.150 
need the speeder bikes the tree itself
isn't<00:07:01.790> really<00:07:02.240> that<00:07:02.870> good<00:07:03.110> of<00:07:03.140> a<00:07:03.290> thing<00:07:03.530> it's

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 
isn't really that good of a thing it's

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.240 
isn't really that good of a thing it's
just<00:07:04.340> low<00:07:04.580> tree<00:07:05.360> on<00:07:05.840> a<00:07:05.900> bunch<00:07:06.650> of<00:07:06.770> plates<00:07:06.950> with

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
just low tree on a bunch of plates with

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.690 
just low tree on a bunch of plates with
a<00:07:07.280> foot<00:07:07.580> fire<00:07:07.760> missile<00:07:08.150> so<00:07:09.250> probably<00:07:10.250> the<00:07:10.430> set

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
a foot fire missile so probably the set

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.090 
a foot fire missile so probably the set
is<00:07:10.880> best<00:07:11.270> worth<00:07:11.480> it<00:07:11.660> for<00:07:11.780> the<00:07:11.870> minifigures<00:07:12.320> so

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.100 
is best worth it for the minifigures so

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.800 
is best worth it for the minifigures so
that's<00:07:13.370> pretty<00:07:13.640> much<00:07:13.790> it<00:07:13.850> guys<00:07:14.000> and<00:07:14.480> thanks
