I'm<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.739> huge<00:02:45.160> fan<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.459> tornado<00:02:45.970> initiation

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
I'm a huge fan of tornado initiation

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.870 
I'm a huge fan of tornado initiation
because<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.170> doesn't<00:02:47.500> sacrifice<00:02:47.709> burst<00:02:48.400> while

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
because it doesn't sacrifice burst while

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.120 
because it doesn't sacrifice burst while
giving<00:02:49.120> frog<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.630> lot<00:02:49.959> more<00:02:50.140> defensive<00:02:50.650> utility

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
giving frog a lot more defensive utility

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.670 
giving frog a lot more defensive utility
with<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.430> dash<00:02:51.700> take<00:02:52.630> this<00:02:52.810> scenario<00:02:53.380> for

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
with the dash take this scenario for

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.979 
with the dash take this scenario for
example<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.670> entire<00:02:55.060> team<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.450> guarding

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
example the entire team is guarding

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.199 
example the entire team is guarding
their<00:02:56.140> turret<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.650> an<00:02:57.070> especially<00:02:57.310> defensive

their turret in an especially defensive
position<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.900> frog<00:02:59.620> would<00:02:59.830> have<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.160> be<00:03:00.250> mad<00:03:00.550> to

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
dash into this however twister tweeters

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.430 
dash into this however twister tweeters
allows<00:03:03.880> me<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.209> get<00:03:04.390> off<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.630> critical<00:03:05.170> burst

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
allows me to get off a critical burst

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.650 
allows me to get off a critical burst
while<00:03:06.040> still<00:03:06.340> having<00:03:06.459> my<00:03:06.700> dash<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.270> escape

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
while still having my dash to escape

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.520

without<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.989> scratch<00:03:08.470> now<00:03:09.280> that's<00:03:09.610> cool

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
without a scratch now that's cool

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.560

cloak for after he hits with tongue
snatch<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.660> gives<00:03:17.020> Leon<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.530> choice<00:03:17.890> to

snatch this gives Leon a choice to
