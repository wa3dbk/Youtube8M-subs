are<00:00:50.260> interdependent<00:00:51.219> in<00:00:51.399> simple<00:00:52.390> terms

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
are interdependent in simple terms

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.049 
are interdependent in simple terms
healthy<00:00:53.469> students<00:00:53.949> are<00:00:54.070> better<00:00:54.339> learners<00:00:54.789> and

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
healthy students are better learners and

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.369 
healthy students are better learners and
better<00:00:55.780> educated<00:00:56.320> students<00:00:56.859> are<00:00:57.070> healthier

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
better educated students are healthier

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.869 
better educated students are healthier
research<00:00:59.379> also<00:00:59.620> shows<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.429> using<00:01:00.699> a

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
research also shows that using a

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.340 
research also shows that using a
holistic<00:01:01.179> approach<00:01:01.480> that's<00:01:02.170> the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
holistic approach that's the

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.380 
holistic approach that's the
comprehensive<00:01:02.949> cart<00:01:03.160> has<00:01:03.670> a<00:01:03.699> greater<00:01:04.120> impact

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
comprehensive cart has a greater impact

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.020 
comprehensive cart has a greater impact
than<00:01:04.869> using<00:01:05.199> a<00:01:05.259> single<00:01:05.290> approach<00:01:06.030> basically

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
than using a single approach basically

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.910 
than using a single approach basically
this<00:01:07.180> means<00:01:07.450> taking<00:01:07.840> action<00:01:08.290> in<00:01:08.439> all<00:01:08.590> four

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
this means taking action in all four

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.420 
this means taking action in all four
pillars<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.860> when<00:01:11.860> schools<00:01:12.159> take

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
pillars and when schools take

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.399 
pillars and when schools take
coordinated<00:01:13.119> action<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.750> all<00:01:13.900> four<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.200> these

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
coordinated action and all four of these

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.740 
coordinated action and all four of these
pillars<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:15.310> pieces<00:01:15.729> start<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.060> fit<00:01:16.210> together

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
pillars the pieces start to fit together

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.499 
pillars the pieces start to fit together
like<00:01:17.020> these<00:01:17.649> puzzle<00:01:18.040> pieces<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.610> students

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
like these puzzle pieces and students

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.060 
like these puzzle pieces and students
are<00:01:19.600> supported<00:01:20.079> to<00:01:20.259> realize<00:01:20.649> their<00:01:20.890> full

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
are supported to realize their full

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.429 
are supported to realize their full

when first learning about comprehensive
school<00:01:29.509> health<00:01:29.750> you<00:01:30.049> may<00:01:30.229> be<00:01:30.289> tempted<00:01:30.590> to

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
school health you may be tempted to

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.029 
school health you may be tempted to
think<00:01:30.950> this<00:01:31.250> approach<00:01:31.579> is<00:01:31.909> too<00:01:32.210> much<00:01:32.420> work<00:01:32.719> but

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
think this approach is too much work but

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.620 
think this approach is too much work but
this<00:01:34.039> approach<00:01:34.369> isn't<00:01:34.789> about<00:01:34.969> doing<00:01:35.329> more

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
this approach isn't about doing more

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.200 
this approach isn't about doing more
work<00:01:35.840> it's<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.710> new<00:01:36.859> way<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.130> working<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:38.000> will

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
work it's a new way of working that will
