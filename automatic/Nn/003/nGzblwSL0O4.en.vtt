00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:07.400
 Hello UTB psycho artur and today 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.410
 we will be leading the cruiser 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.969
 it can be considered a tribute to the car 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.130
 on which I rolled pretty 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.010
 many fights five hundred 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.510
 many actually dozens on 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.640
 some do not roll so much but 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.539
 it turned out that the cruiser to me 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.460
 something hooked 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.670
 Well, actually pumping the crew on it 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.400
 for chef you're on level ten 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.099
 which british just needs to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.870
 appear but it seems like the developers already 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.630
 gave the good that like when he's a hundred 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.690
 percent will be well that's when not yet 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.520
 incomprehensible well I decided to prepare in advance 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.370
 for him the crew 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.960
 although at the very beginning I remember buying 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.940
 cruiser just because this is one of 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.989
 few British tanks that I 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.660
 really hurt something 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.260
 here touched me firstly with their external 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.920
 the view 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.460
 the fact that I am really here somewhere remember this 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.440
 tanchik 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.920
 don't remember exactly where might somewhere in 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.780
 saw some video games on the mind 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.760
 call in call of duty the ancients where there 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.400
 the second world was there like these 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.619
 courses and holes were exactly like that 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.840
 british second world war tank 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.490
 it is exactly known for me 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.340
 it was always a cruiser 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.830
 and when I realized that in the game we have been allocated 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.869
 pretty interesting yet well i mean he 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.710
 sort of like should be aztec but 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.540
 for some reason lt 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.759
 I really have it very much 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.390
 interested in let the level be his us 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.130
 as usual st-shki ipad quantities too 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.020
 the gun is basically the same as on 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.900
 Churchill Soviet premium therefore 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.579
 can not say that the gun is bad I would 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.220
 even said this tank virtue 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.470
 what is real if you don't have in the hangar 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.200
 any such punch 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.420
 rate of fire then you lose some 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.670
 part of the highlight of our game here 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.110
 such a gameplay that allows 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.360
 execute the cruiser itself 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.340
 Particularly well, what are we supposed t-34 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.250
 soviet which just took apart 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.380
 stern here but unlike the Soviet 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.320
 course tax for still play 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.600
 more difficult here partly because no 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.380
 absolutely no reservation that is, 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.720
 brina this one for him 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.150
 I do not know what happened bulletproof 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.640
 probably it as riveted she of course 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.370
 It looks beautiful I damn sorry not 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.239
 waited for his tank leaders 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.709
 but really like to fight faded from NATO as 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.010
 have to use tanks in our 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.860
 the game 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.360
 better to be 34 Soviet really because 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.000
 that she even beats something and you 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.769
 Seen here, I quietly went to the M5 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.150
 Now that Stewart Barton because 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.190
 will put you on board 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.209
 there will be something forehead there like a tram 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.459
 there is not much difference 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.160
 the only thing of course when the high-explosive 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.840
 some guns are shooting at you 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.120
 sense to try to substitute a guslya because 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.560
 that in the forehead here is like a plane 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.110
 pretty pretty 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.150
 what's in the tower what's in the case but therefore there 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.700
 other almost one hundred percent go to land 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.380
 But on the harp which closes almost 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.890
 the whole board is quite possible that will pass 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.190
 no damage 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.049
 Well, or at least without breaking through the case with 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.280
 small-caliber mines by the way without 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.650
 such damage is quite realistic well and in general 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.420
 I can say that if you are missing 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.060
 Anyone interesting tanchika for 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.950
 level five just to roll with 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.579
 druganami who pumped for example 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.410
 fives 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.079
 Here that is precisely such a speed 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.500
 St-shka which is for some reason branches 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:25.079
 lt that is, you can take it on 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.079
 Now that is not so easy to do in 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.940
 unlike any other lt chic 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.250
 level five right there chaffik I think 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.530
 cope with achieving urlika much 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.170
 easier in particular because it is fast 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.380
 goes with courses holes of course though there is 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.280
 not in dynamics not in some format 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.160
 open cards 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.170
 she's pretty sad herself 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.700
 shows let's say here in this moment 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.590
 when remember just shot someone 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.230
 two land mines I honestly I already said goodbye to 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.819
 life, but for some reason, as usual 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.000
 put the diamond just don't know what 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.269
 hoped but as you can see I was lucky and 122 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.160
 millimeter a mine for some reason stopped in 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.829
 my caterpillar and actually further in 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.599
 Tanchik his not let and so here 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.250
 this fight ends with me 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.000
 drive up to capture 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.859
 and shove here here is drying 85 that is 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.990
 what can this fight tell us 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.350
 that the car is good 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.640
 and it's kind of unfairly separated. 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.380
 attention water makers 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.600
 and not like me especially not consider all 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.150
 I think that such a machine is not passing 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.280
 interesting actually alternatives 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.860
 among all the cars in general 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.080
 us in the game on the fifth level, I do not see you 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.910
 really well that's where you saw the tash in 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.750
 role st 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.810
 I wonder what is in this car 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.750
 Perhaps the best quality combined at-st 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.480
 chic and lt chic at this level exactly on 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.750
 fifth but still with a bias towards at 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.490
 medium tanks and by the way on honorary 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.470
 medals for medium tanks medals 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.250
 Nikolas for some reason it is depicted 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.680
 cruiser 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.110
 here and somehow strange that in the game Lana himself 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.090
 listed exactly as a light tanchik then 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.190
 there is a pool medal on which 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.680
 drawn Pershing write take 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.720
 you can but here is a nicolas medal on which 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.840
 drawn cruiser take no way 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.960
 because it is purely class and 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.720
 respectively 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.940
 Kruzak is Lt-shku so take 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.250
 can not but maybe someday 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.940
 this car and perry balance and 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.700
 will lead to the rank of st chic but time will tell 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.440
 for now I said goodbye to her if you 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.600
 liked this video or it seemed 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.280
 something useful put the class and 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.070
 subscribe to my channel if not 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.370
 Want to miss my new vidosiki 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.370
 good luck to all
