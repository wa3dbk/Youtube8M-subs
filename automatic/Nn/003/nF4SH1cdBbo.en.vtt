they need to like brackets on the floor

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.430 
they need to like brackets on the floor
times<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.600> same<00:01:24.840> thing<00:01:24.870> on<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> bass<00:01:25.409> drum

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
times the same thing on the bass drum

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.610 
times the same thing on the bass drum

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.860 
with the Spurs and the t rods tone
controls<00:01:29.010> in<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.580> drums<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:30.659> has<00:01:30.840> a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
controls in the drums this one has a

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.500 
controls in the drums this one has a
tone<00:01:31.740> control<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.580> Pratt<00:01:32.820> muffler<00:01:33.210> spot

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
tone control in the Pratt muffler spot

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.600 
tone control in the Pratt muffler spot
because<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> tone<00:01:34.680> control<00:01:35.040> works<00:01:35.340> actually

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
because the tone control works actually

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.550 
because the tone control works actually
better<00:01:36.000> than<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.240> Pratt<00:01:36.479> muffler<00:01:36.870> in<00:01:37.049> some

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
better than a Pratt muffler in some

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.719 
better than a Pratt muffler in some
cases<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.979> 13<00:01:40.979> 16

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
cases so I like that this one is a 13 16

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.390 
cases so I like that this one is a 13 16
22<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.780> there<00:01:42.900> are<00:01:43.020> two<00:01:43.229> 16s<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> happen

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
22 and there are two 16s if you happen

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.039 
22 and there are two 16s if you happen
to<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.670> configuration<00:01:45.360> which<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.810> do

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
to like that configuration which I do

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.680 
to like that configuration which I do
there's<00:01:46.770> no<00:01:46.920> time<00:01:47.190> holder<00:01:47.580> on<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.880> kit<00:01:48.150> so

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
there's no time holder on this kit so

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.490 
there's no time holder on this kit so
you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:49.729> take<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.760> as<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.299> or<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.900> can<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.320> us

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
you can take it as is or you can have us

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.080 
you can take it as is or you can have us
at<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> time<00:01:53.040> holder<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.820> whether

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
at a time holder if you like whether

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.539 
at a time holder if you like whether
