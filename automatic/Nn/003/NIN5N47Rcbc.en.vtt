choose to use ground beef because it has

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.270 
choose to use ground beef because it has
more<00:00:29.250> flavors<00:00:30.199> first<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:32.099> start<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
more flavors first we start with the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.869 
more flavors first we start with the
cutting<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.309> onions<00:00:36.829> we<00:00:37.829> cut<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> onions<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
cutting the onions we cut the onions and

take one eggplant which is washed

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.669 
take one eggplant which is washed
already<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.539> cut<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> ends<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
already and we cut the ends I like to

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:30.950 
already and we cut the ends I like to
slice<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:28.950> by<00:01:29.310> hand<00:01:29.520> not<00:01:29.700> use<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> machine<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
slice it by hand not use a machine and I

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
slice it by hand not use a machine and I
usually<00:01:32.270> slice<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.929> way<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.670> I<00:01:35.670> try<00:01:35.940> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
usually slice it this way and I try to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:53.610 
usually slice it this way and I try to
have<00:01:36.240> around<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:37.319> half<00:01:37.740> inch<00:01:38.039> thickness<00:01:39.289> so

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.480 

of<00:01:54.400> course<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:55.060> eggplant<00:01:55.480> is<00:01:56.380> really<00:01:56.890> what

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
of course the eggplant is really what

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.230 
of course the eggplant is really what
makes<00:01:57.730> the<00:01:58.480> dish<00:01:58.720> quite<00:01:59.910> authentic<00:02:03.060> then<00:02:04.060> one

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
makes the dish quite authentic then one

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.930 
makes the dish quite authentic then one
by<00:02:04.270> one<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.900> place<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.410> eggplant<00:02:05.800> on<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.370> half

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
by one I place the eggplant on the half

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.160 
by one I place the eggplant on the half
sheet<00:02:07.240> pans<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.610> then<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.760> will<00:02:09.910> sprinkle<00:02:10.810> some

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
sheet pans and then I will sprinkle some

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.820 
sheet pans and then I will sprinkle some
olive<00:02:11.740> oil<00:02:11.890> on<00:02:12.130> top<00:02:12.160> like<00:02:13.150> this<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:14.290> then<00:02:14.710> I'll

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
olive oil on top like this and then I'll

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.800 
olive oil on top like this and then I'll
spring<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.190> little<00:02:15.490> bit<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.910> kosher<00:02:16.270> salt

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
spring a little bit of the kosher salt

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.620 
spring a little bit of the kosher salt
and<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:18.250> salt<00:02:18.750> helps<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:21.030> eggplant<00:02:22.030> not<00:02:22.330> to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
and the salt helps the eggplant not to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.180 
and the salt helps the eggplant not to
taste<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:23.590> bitter<00:02:23.740> and<00:02:24.270> then<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.540> will<00:02:26.190> bake

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
taste so bitter and then I will bake

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.150 
taste so bitter and then I will bake
this<00:02:27.460> for<00:02:29.100> around<00:02:30.100> 15<00:02:31.060> 20<00:02:31.390> minutes<00:02:31.660> at<00:02:32.380> 350

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
this for around 15 20 minutes at 350

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.020 
this for around 15 20 minutes at 350
degrees<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.390> next<00:02:38.350> step<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.030> start

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
degrees so the next step is to start

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.560 
degrees so the next step is to start
layering<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.960> different<00:02:41.940> levels<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.540> the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
layering the different levels for the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.730 
layering the different levels for the
moussaka<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.480> first<00:02:46.630> layer<00:02:46.900> would<00:02:47.140> be<00:02:47.290> to

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
moussaka so the first layer would be to

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.610 
moussaka so the first layer would be to
actually<00:02:47.980> place<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:48.520> eggplant<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:50.110> clay

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
actually place the eggplant and the clay

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:59.580 
actually place the eggplant and the clay
pot<00:02:54.090> then<00:02:55.090> after<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:55.600> we'll<00:02:55.900> use<00:02:58.590> some

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
pot then after that we'll use some

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.560 
pot then after that we'll use some
tomato<00:03:00.040> sauce<00:03:01.830> with<00:03:02.830> tomato<00:03:03.130> sauce<00:03:03.220> has<00:03:04.180> some

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
tomato sauce with tomato sauce has some

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.660 
tomato sauce with tomato sauce has some
garlic<00:03:04.930> pepper<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.860> salt<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.370> some<00:03:06.520> olive

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
garlic pepper and salt and some olive

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.610 
garlic pepper and salt and some olive
oil<00:03:07.140> mixed<00:03:08.140> with<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:09.690> then<00:03:10.690> after<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.260> we

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
oil mixed with it then after that we

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.160 
oil mixed with it then after that we
will<00:03:11.980> use<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:13.120> one<00:03:13.300> pound<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.810> ground<00:03:14.020> beef

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
will use the one pound of ground beef

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.060 
will use the one pound of ground beef
that<00:03:14.500> we<00:03:14.709> have<00:03:15.630> drained<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:17.050> steered<00:03:17.980> for

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
that we have drained and steered for

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:29.310 
that we have drained and steered for
almost<00:03:18.520> 10<00:03:18.760> minutes<00:03:21.750> we'll<00:03:22.750> use<00:03:22.930> this<00:03:28.170> then<00:03:29.170> we

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
almost 10 minutes we'll use this then we

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:42.760 
almost 10 minutes we'll use this then we
use<00:03:29.530> another<00:03:29.950> layer<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.220> eggplant

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.400 

okay<00:03:45.190> then<00:03:46.190> we're<00:03:46.340> going<00:03:46.460> to<00:03:46.550> use<00:03:46.700> another<00:03:47.690> cup

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
okay then we're going to use another cup

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.020 
okay then we're going to use another cup
of<00:03:49.030> shredded<00:03:50.470> mozzarella<00:03:51.470> cheese<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.820> will
