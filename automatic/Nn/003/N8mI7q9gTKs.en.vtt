well there's a couple things I like and
don't<00:00:20.730> like<00:00:20.850> about<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.359> player<00:00:22.910> one<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.390> do

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
don't like about this player one I do

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.269 
don't like about this player one I do
like<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:26.849> font<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.220> video<00:00:29.220> and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
like that the font and the video and

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.519 
like that the font and the video and
audio<00:00:29.820> quality<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> lot<00:00:31.019> better<00:00:31.199> than<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
audio quality is a lot better than the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.080 
audio quality is a lot better than the
previous<00:00:31.740> player

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
previous player

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.750 
previous player
they<00:00:33.540> only<00:00:33.719> dislike<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.950> for<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.430> it's

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
they only dislike I have for it it's

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.450 
they only dislike I have for it it's
probably<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.230> doesn't<00:00:37.530> play<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.860> movies

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
probably that it doesn't play the movies

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.350 
probably that it doesn't play the movies
out<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.879> USB<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.629> wanted<00:00:41.300> but<00:00:42.300> uh

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
out of the USB like I wanted but uh

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.069 
out of the USB like I wanted but uh
let's<00:00:43.140> see<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> Power<00:00:43.980> Acoustik<00:00:44.450> PA<00:00:45.450> DVD

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
let's see it's the Power Acoustik PA DVD

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.790 
let's see it's the Power Acoustik PA DVD
for<00:00:46.440> ninety<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.190> comes<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.700> remote

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
for ninety it comes with this remote

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.410 
for ninety it comes with this remote
which<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.280> guess<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> bit<00:00:50.789> slimmer<00:00:51.149> than

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
which is the I guess a bit slimmer than

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.299 
which is the I guess a bit slimmer than
previous<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.289> alright

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
previous one alright

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.740 
previous one alright
the<00:00:54.739> infrared<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.460> receiver<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> red

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the infrared or the receiver for the red

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.080 
the infrared or the receiver for the red
is<00:00:57.899> actually<00:00:58.020> mobiles<00:00:58.800> or<00:00:59.160> not<00:00:59.579> mobile<00:00:59.879> but

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
is actually mobiles or not mobile but

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.240 
is actually mobiles or not mobile but
you<00:01:00.719> could<00:01:00.870> relocate<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.800> could<00:01:02.070> actually

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
you could relocate so you could actually

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.850 
you could relocate so you could actually
get<00:01:02.579> better<00:01:02.820> control<00:01:03.559> let's<00:01:04.559> turn<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:06.860> so

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
get better control let's turn it on so

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.060 
get better control let's turn it on so
it<00:01:08.189> turns<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.580> over<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.500> said<00:01:13.560> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
it turns on over there so like I said it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.850 
it turns on over there so like I said it
it<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.880> easier<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> read<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> font<00:01:16.680> on

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it was easier to read for the font on

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.280 
it was easier to read for the font on
this<00:01:17.070> one<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.490> everything<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.180> readable<00:01:22.110> at

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
this one so everything is readable at

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:36.160 
this one so everything is readable at
least<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:34.500> doesn't<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.130> player<00:01:35.460> font

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
least it doesn't have that player font

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.069 
least it doesn't have that player font
like<00:01:37.460> like<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> previous<00:01:39.000> player<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.900> that

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
like like a previous player but if that

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.410 
like like a previous player but if that
didn't<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.560> bother<00:01:40.740> too<00:01:41.040> much<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:41.970> like

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
didn't really bother too much I do like

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.230 
didn't really bother too much I do like
the<00:01:42.570> blue<00:01:42.810> contrast<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:44.040> guess<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.210> of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the blue contrast I guess I'm kind of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.440 
the blue contrast I guess I'm kind of
bias<00:01:45.479> since<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.020> don't<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.259> an<00:01:46.470> SI<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.450> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
bias since I don't have an SI and and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.399 
bias since I don't have an SI and and
the<00:01:48.780> whole<00:01:48.810> theme<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.259> actually<00:01:49.590> play<00:01:49.799> blue<00:01:50.130> so

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
the whole theme is actually play blue so

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.929 
the whole theme is actually play blue so
that's<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.530> plus<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:52.770> me<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.250> least<00:01:55.670> for<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
that's a plus for me at least for the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.920 
that's a plus for me at least for the
pleasure<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> audio<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.979> pretty<00:01:59.219> good

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
pleasure of the audio it's a pretty good

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.690 
pleasure of the audio it's a pretty good
just<00:02:00.930> turn<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.259> up<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.500> little<00:02:01.710> bit

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
just turn it up a little bit

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.650 
just turn it up a little bit
volume<00:02:04.450> down<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.719> bottom<00:02:04.990> left<00:02:05.289> corner<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
volume down the bottom left corner the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:24.600 
volume down the bottom left corner the
volume<00:02:10.959> is<00:02:11.019> pretty<00:02:11.230> good<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:23.019> like<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
volume is pretty good and so like the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.150 
volume is pretty good and so like the
one<00:02:24.760> thing<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.030> if<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:25.300> pop<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.660> DVD<00:02:26.160> well

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
one thing is if you pop in a DVD well

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.120 
one thing is if you pop in a DVD well
you<00:02:27.640> know<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.760> DVD<00:02:28.680> since<00:02:29.680> we're<00:02:29.830> going<00:02:29.980> with

the car theme we're gonna keep it the
car<00:02:31.840> theme<00:02:32.049> so<00:02:32.709> it's<00:02:32.739> easy<00:02:33.190> pop<00:02:33.519> it<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:37.349> loading

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.150 

I've<00:02:46.540> played<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.019> earlier<00:02:47.319> maybe<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.769> go<00:02:47.980> back
