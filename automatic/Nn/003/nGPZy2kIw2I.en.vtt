00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
started off because of that but I think

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.209 
started off because of that but I think
people<00:01:58.999> now<00:01:59.359> are<00:01:59.630> just<00:01:59.780> largely<00:02:00.289> using<00:02:00.679> as<00:02:00.799> an

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
people now are just largely using as an

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.550 
people now are just largely using as an
excuse<00:02:01.789> because<00:02:02.600> obviously<00:02:02.899> people<00:02:03.350> in

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
excuse because obviously people in

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.989 
excuse because obviously people in

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
how that's going to help much I suppose

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.930 
how that's going to help much I suppose
you<00:06:08.120> can<00:06:08.240> coordinate<00:06:08.870> efforts<00:06:09.110> he<00:06:09.620> canna<00:06:09.980> be

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
you can coordinate efforts he canna be

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.490 
you can coordinate efforts he canna be
an<00:06:11.060> authoritative<00:06:11.540> figure<00:06:12.050> but<00:06:12.320> the

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
an authoritative figure but the

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.020 
an authoritative figure but the
likelihood<00:06:12.710> is<00:06:13.040> most<00:06:13.370> of<00:06:13.550> them<00:06:13.670> hate<00:06:13.850> him

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
likelihood is most of them hate him

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.200 
likelihood is most of them hate him
because<00:06:14.180> he's<00:06:14.450> so<00:06:14.690> posh<00:06:15.020> and<00:06:15.290> stuff<00:06:15.530> but<00:06:16.100> uh

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
because he's so posh and stuff but uh

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.400 
because he's so posh and stuff but uh
that's<00:06:17.210> a<00:06:17.360> strange<00:06:17.630> thing<00:06:17.750> to<00:06:17.900> say<00:06:18.020> because

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
that's a strange thing to say because

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.870 
that's a strange thing to say because
you<00:06:18.590> don't<00:06:18.770> want<00:06:18.890> to<00:06:18.950> chap<00:06:19.250> in<00:06:19.430> charge<00:06:19.700> your

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
you don't want to chap in charge your

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.550 
you don't want to chap in charge your
country<00:06:20.300> to<00:06:20.420> it's<00:06:20.780> quite<00:06:21.080> good<00:06:21.230> to<00:06:21.380> have<00:06:21.470> a

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
country to it's quite good to have a

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
country to it's quite good to have a
posh<00:06:21.740> person<00:06:22.130> in<00:06:22.220> charge<00:06:22.780> but<00:06:23.780> um<00:06:23.990> I<00:06:24.580> don't

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
posh person in charge but um I don't

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.390 
posh person in charge but um I don't
think<00:06:25.730> that's<00:06:25.820> going<00:06:26.030> to<00:06:26.120> actually<00:06:26.240> help<00:06:26.690> much

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
think that's going to actually help much

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.610 
think that's going to actually help much
so<00:06:28.400> it's<00:06:28.670> confusing<00:06:29.540> what<00:06:30.230> they're<00:06:30.410> going<00:06:30.560> to

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
so it's confusing what they're going to

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.820 
so it's confusing what they're going to
do<00:06:30.830> as<00:06:31.760> far<00:06:32.090> as<00:06:32.330> I'm<00:06:32.570> aware<00:06:32.600> the<00:06:33.020> army<00:06:33.380> is<00:06:33.560> not
