00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.809
 Today we make a juice of the 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.150
 Supports fat burning in the body 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.850
 and helps us lose weight 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.650
 but not only that he also acts base 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.900
 on the body which means that you me 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.000
 get energy and detoxify faster 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.039
 can and dehydrates us and that is 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.169
 also extremely important because if you have the 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.779
 hydride then you become less 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.400
 services have to be so tired and the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.859
 Fat burning is also getting sluggish 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.160
 what's going to change, we say 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.629
 have a combination of three here 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.300
 food which interact perfectly 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.340
 if you want to burn more fat the 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.590
 most important ingredient is celery 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.270
 if you want to burn fat then that is 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.609
 celery your friend 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.530
 First, it helps you to detoxify 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.510
 he acts basically on your body what 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.670
 can boost the fat burning 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.800
 And besides, he can metabolize his metabolism 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.160
 a little boost meaning that means you 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.600
 More calories burned in everyday life 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.579
 but important is that celery one 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.890
 has very salty taste and if you have 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.870
 just start with the juicing or 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.790
 not much at all yet 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.620
 have detiget then the taste 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.150
 of celery alone we 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.250
 probably do not taste good 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.920
 and here comes the second ingredient in the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.900
 This is a lime lime 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.400
 harmonizes perfectly with the taste 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.500
 sellering we want you one 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.780

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.690
 enjoy drinking comsoft hate and 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.090
 That's why the combination of lime 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.820
 and celery very beneficial if you 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.920
 can not get a lime then it is 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.590
 also a lemon ok and you get the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.600
 same effect the second advantage of 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.970
 the lime and also of a lemon 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.430
 if you prefer to take lemon 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.350
 that they have the insulin production in the body 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.540
 can lower a little and that means 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.580
 a steady energy and a 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.860
 better fat burning and the third 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.320
 serving ingredient juice is an apple 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.160
 simply first to taste 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.170
 improve 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.060
 second, the apple is a great one 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.580
 vitamins supplier and good for ours 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.500
 defensive forces and third, he gives us 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.720
 just a lot of energy for the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.770
 Everyday already talked enough 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.770
 Let's start the juicer 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.909
 is prohibited is finished and what else 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.709
 important is that you lime or 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.860
 lemons only with the peel 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.330
 should be corrected if they are organic 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.010
 besides, the shell has a something 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.019
 bitter taste and if you are straight 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.940
 the juice may start 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.799
 that we are not so good with the shell 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.989
 tastes like without then just stand 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.209
 and without peel goes into the juicer 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.799
 And now there is a secret tip 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.989
 and that is a pinch of cinnamon of power 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.819
 the juice a little sweeter and besides 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.400
 also the cinnamon has the effect that he 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.799
 can lower his insulin production and 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.269
 that means energy and as I said 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.760
 a better fat burning 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:19.720
 Also, it just tastes great 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:22.720
 make taste test now taste 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.269
 class is basic so it deacidifies the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.400
