00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 tells crowd beauty here is the hobby am 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.049
 bringing you another video 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.049
 and finally to serving the killers river 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.450
 no doubt you must have stayed a lot 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.910
 angry when he heard of the new episode 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.680
 The anime that you like the most is Daughter. 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.050
 We will know that children are very 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.279
 important for explaining and speaking a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.279
 little more of this now 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.930
 fillet is an English word derived from 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.010
 verb to wire that can be translated as 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.990
 to fill 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.730
 when the history of mm almost reaches the 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.770
 place the children appear 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.690
 the episode of the emmy that does not appear in the 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.520
 manga are created with the producers of 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.410
 saga to make the story of the manga that 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.150
 still in production to distance itself in the 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.890
 history of the mpe for a cat is 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.200
 time to complete and complete the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.760
 a saga even finish the manga 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.559
 obviously always have to be ahead 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.720
 ine and this is of utmost importance 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.210
 because in this way it prevents 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.830
 What is your favorite name? 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.360
 the franchise can be exploited 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.850
 commercially maintained a 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.159
 even if it is not always positive, it is 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.500
 of course, so the believers avoid joining 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.630
 for them for weeks or even years 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.490
 which was the case with the postman 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.080
 had a pause in its production of little 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.580
 more than a year because the animal was 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.140
 very close to the manga 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.240
 thus hindering the production of the 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.130
 mp needs to have good manga material 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.710
 already produced that the process is a 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:32.020
 both delayed the production of the piers 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.060
 covers several ways to create a 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.890
 complete daughter saga between two sagas 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.930
 manga has a story and characters 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.060
 previous ones did not even look like a 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.770
 American series creating small bows 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.869
 in its history to elaborate a flashback 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.189
 piller in the form of one or more episodes 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.140
 which do not show any 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.180
 development with the plot or 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.619
 creating a drag effect to prolong 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.350
 for several episodes from the 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.350
 battle trip even a dialogue 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.020
 there is also the cds that do not 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.969
 episodes that are not present in the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.740
 original series and have been added in m 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.689
 however these stacks episodes are 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.429
 directed by the original author so 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.560
 are called phishing scams as in 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.840
 case noemi beach or stay in episode 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.459
 230 where he was very close to the manga 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.260
 so the author himself tite kubo 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.739
 decided to make a story just for the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.390
 mm 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.400
 the federer name that was not given by this 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.730
 saga is non-existent in the manga however 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.040
 written by the creator of the series 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.900
 so you have no obligation to 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.640
 watch a filler a semifinal and with 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.230
 what to do to understand the history of mma 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.329
 some cases where the children are 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.239
 extremely exaggerated, for example 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.130
 english even where the 366 episodes 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.470
 almost half and killer who also have 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.060
 cases where the child and appeals to 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.040
 more money for the series that is what 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.019
 occurs in naruto where the manga has already been 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.150
 concluded at prouni to be very successful 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.129
 How many people are involved in this? 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.959
 everyone wants to place themselves in the 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.940
 end with a series of success and the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:58.489
 which can still yield much more for 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:01.190
 producers and as everyone already knows is 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.660
 of course some very bad bends but 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.400
 We also have children who are 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.260
 very good with for example has a lot of 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.670
 episodes margin 50 which marks the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.530
 beginning of the second season is a 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.120
 episode with the characters talking 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.310
 about how they could prevent the 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.380
 enem was canceled already in naruto the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.480
 episode feels a monster naruto sasc e 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.760
 sakura trying to figure out how purple the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.889
 Cashew face behind that brand Uncle 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.419
 of jokes and trick-or-treating attempts 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.040
 and that even more can manage 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.989
 bosi status for the fans 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.760
 another good example of believers occurs in a 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.829
 difficult and one of the crimes is very 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.829
 funny and well-made 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.460
