 that you also see that you can take the 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.440

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.350

 here with me and nothing left you with the 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.690
 video I'm on 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.960
 we started by applying a pre-corrector and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.189
 when we have a bag what 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.870
 we have to do is apply the pre 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.760
 corrector in the intersection area 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.140
 between the eyecup and the rest of the cheek 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.519
 this you can see it well then in a 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 box description I leave the how 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.329
 correct a bag how to remove a 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.710
 bag with makeup left the link for 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.809
 that you see the full video of how you 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.600
 I correct in this case the sachet 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.949
 full worth what we do is melt 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.899
 the concealer of the skin to little touches 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.000
 trying to apply a product 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.010
 lighter than the tone of our bag 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.329
 feels the same skin tone and a 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.980
 Once we have the correct pre what 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.199
 I'm doing is applying the concealer 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.670
 always also trying not to let us 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.110
 touch an area of ​​the bag or at least 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.030
 possible so that it does not look like we have 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.280
 more movements we are going to apply to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.020
 then on the mobile eyelid a 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.000
 shadow in long-lasting cream says 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.560
 the touches because what you want to do 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 a little ticking the eye but 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.850
 without subtracting elegance then about 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.289
 all the base shade is very simple how 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.940
 you're going to see is just to mark a 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.460
 little bit both above and below 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.960
 with the same shadow in this case in gel 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.760
 which is long-lasting and does not move and 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.800
 it has a tone a bit like that 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.480
 as grayish 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.980
 then we are going to apply the 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.870
 eyeliner in this case and I tell you that 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.460
 I want to mark the eye this you can 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
 do also in a brown tone for 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.030
 example if you do not want to leave it so 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.010
 marked or dark smooth or is it simply 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.550
 avoid the water line if you do not want 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:48.280
 make such a dramatic eye we apply it 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.159
 both inside and above the eye 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.210
 soft touches is worth checking 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.890
 well the look 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.350
 I'm doing with the brush with a 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.850
 ultra thin brush so that our makes 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.860
 the definition and when applicable when 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.630
 we apply a product on the eyelid 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.159
 a person as a little more fallen section 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.780
 you always have to lift up 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.300
 worth the eyelid does not pull out 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.069
 but up and now what we have 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.780
 what to do is simply blur a 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.690
 little bit with the help of a shadow 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.850
 intense brown this eyeliner in black 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.190
 both above and below the 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.680
 soft taps so that it stays 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.180
 directly a smoked but very light 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.069
 it's not your typical smoked by our 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.510
 of the black eye or anything in this case has 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.940
 that being even a whole eye is 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.440
 will mark a more natural point and what 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.030
 we do at the time of applying a little 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.760
 of shade in the basin with a person 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.920
 with age a little more with the skin 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.690
 more mature with the most drooping eyelid is 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.030
 work with the account with the eye 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.560
 open if you turn it with your eye closed 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.239
 we could always fall into the error of 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.590
 mark within what is the basin and 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.600
 when opening the eye we would not be marked 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.310
 then you always have to do it with the 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.230
 open eye and directly work there 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.840
 in this case with a shade of tone 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.519
 intermediate we have the eyebrow and the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.579
 make up in the case of the has very 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.710
 finite this is simply to apply a 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.780
 bit 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.520
 a shade of a tone similar to the tone 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.320
 of the hair and I'm a little bit gray 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.140
 and then just then the 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.790
 we return to comb I will apply a one 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.550
 serum for the eyelashes so they remain 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.260
 more curved and elongated and now after 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.060
 a mascara in this case the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.150
 smoky there is bobby braun that is new 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.590
 which is with a pretty intense black 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.320
 lengthened film volume and then 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.000
 We separate the lashes well with the help of 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.920
 a shadow in cream with a little bit of 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.590
 golden flash we apply with the eyelid 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.170
 mobile on the eyelid mobile sorry with the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.280
 finger and what we do is apply the base 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.570
 in this case a chanel base that 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.640
 reveals finish that is called mat lumière 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.640
 it's not a matte finish but a little 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.230
 bright 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.520
 to miracles the truth is told that 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.290
 they like it a lot and we apply it with the 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.819
 fight of a young 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.409
 let's seal everything we've done 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.519
 with a little bit of loose powder but 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.799
 so that there was not a skin 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.209
 completely matte and off I apply 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.370
 these are the ice of taksim 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.850
 because I love them because they let 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.410
 translucent light from below 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.300
 let's apply then a 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.040
 little bit of sun dust in the center of the 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.230
 face especially to give a little bit of 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.240
 warmth that the pair contoured a 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.430
 little but slightly is the center of 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.660
 the forehead the center of the nose a 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.340
 little in the center of the cheeks 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.920
 but lifting up a little bit 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.450
 also not all mature skins are 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.010
 some skins full of lines of 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.560
 expression and others there is a mature skin 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.180
 that in his youth he was a mixed skin 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.920
 fat and what it does is that the trend 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.660
 is to fall a little bit then with help 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.940
 of the powder that only the contoured 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.850
 we raise factions a little bit without 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.770
 that there are cuts or we are noticed we are going to 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.530
 apply a blush in a tone like 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.960
 matte coral in this case here does not count 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.550
 I love it is very important also in 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.320
 the case of a more mature skin that 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.000
 let's work very smoothly that everything is 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.190
 very well integrated that we are not noticed in 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.170
 cuts it is important that generally 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.670
 do not notice us in the cuts when 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.590
 we are facing a hard signature is much more 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.750
 important to cover everything 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.330
 we work in circles to make a 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.860
 effect on super young skin rubber I'll 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.030
 apply a little illuminator in this 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.520
 case he 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.200
 candlelight that the inau coi 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.220
 we apply a little in the temple area 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.230
 in the zone 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.600
 also the top part of the nose 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.700
 a little bit in the cupid arch zone 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.170
 on the upper lip and a little 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.430
 also the chin area this what 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.740
 what it is going to do is generate an effect of 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.900
 volume also in that area that 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.139
 we press subtle touches of light with this 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.789
 point 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.710
 this gives me a lot of light to the 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.710
 Skin and the younger one etc 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.430
 being a very natural effect we are going to 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.380
 outline below the lips I'm going to 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.120
 delineate a little bit on the outside to 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.849
 use a little lip volume 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.949
 we also fill it inside 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.509
 and then I'm going to apply a gloss 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.639
 that I love that is that it came with 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.139
 that mullah tone is that it will be very 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.259
 natural and elegant we apply it with the 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.889
 skewer 231 to fill the lip and 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.909
 that gives an effect of juiciness and freshness 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.820
 we see that we have marked the eyes but 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:58.930
 I pray the face we go natural 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.930
 here you have the before and after 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.930
 and nothing else would be the look I hope 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.690
 that you liked, I think it's in 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.550
 practice that you tell me what you want 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.710
