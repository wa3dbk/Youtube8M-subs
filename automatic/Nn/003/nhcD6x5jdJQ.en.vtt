right here you got one two three and
then<00:00:23.830> on<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.250> back<00:00:24.460> on<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.300> Neath<00:00:25.450> the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
then on the back on the Neath the

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.430 
then on the back on the Neath the
manifold<00:00:26.140> there's<00:00:27.039> three<00:00:27.280> more<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:29.140> pretty

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
manifold there's three more it's pretty

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.519 
manifold there's three more it's pretty
simple<00:00:29.740> you<00:00:30.539> got<00:00:31.539> this<00:00:31.840> one<00:00:32.050> right<00:00:32.230> here<00:00:32.499> you

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
simple you got this one right here you

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.569 
simple you got this one right here you
take<00:00:32.890> it<00:00:33.010> out<00:00:33.129> then<00:00:33.850> pull<00:00:34.359> it<00:00:34.480> out<00:00:34.570> oh<00:00:35.399> well<00:00:36.399> you

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
three or front is free so gamma Tauri if

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.090 
three or front is free so gamma Tauri if
you<00:00:48.850> want<00:00:49.089> you<00:00:49.179> can<00:00:49.300> take<00:00:49.510> these<00:00:49.659> out<00:00:49.920> which<00:00:50.920> is

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
you want you can take these out which is

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.469 
you want you can take these out which is
pretty<00:00:51.609> easy<00:00:51.819> to<00:00:51.969> take<00:00:52.179> out<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:53.559> you<00:00:53.889> do<00:00:54.069> is

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
pretty easy to take out what you do is

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.209 
pretty easy to take out what you do is
move<00:00:55.479> these<00:00:55.719> out<00:00:55.929> to<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.289> way<00:00:56.440> out<00:00:56.859> of<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.100> way

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
move these out to the way out of the way

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.969 
move these out to the way out of the way
right<00:00:57.579> here<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.809> pull<00:00:59.019> it<00:00:59.109> back<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.909> then<00:01:01.979> in

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
right here and pull it back and then in

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.110 
right here and pull it back and then in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
order to take this manifold out you

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.740 
order to take this manifold out you
gotta<00:01:07.330> take<00:01:08.040> air<00:01:09.040> filter<00:01:09.460> out<00:01:09.610> which<00:01:10.420> is<00:01:10.570> also

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
gotta take air filter out which is also

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.800 
gotta take air filter out which is also
easy<00:01:11.110> we'll<00:01:11.530> move<00:01:11.740> from<00:01:11.950> here<00:01:12.250> from<00:01:12.580> here<00:01:12.810> you

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
easy we'll move from here from here you

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.320 
easy we'll move from here from here you
take<00:01:14.380> this<00:01:14.560> out<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:16.420> pulling<00:01:17.080> on<00:01:17.260> it<00:01:17.290> up<00:01:17.770> this

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
take this out just pulling on it up this

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.740 
take this out just pulling on it up this
comes<00:01:19.330> out<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.930> then<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:25.180> you<00:01:25.360> can<00:01:25.480> take<00:01:25.630> it

over<00:02:49.939> here<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.799> move<00:02:51.799> take<00:02:52.189> it<00:02:52.310> out<00:02:52.430> over<00:02:52.639> here

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
over here and move take it out over here

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.580 
over here and move take it out over here
just<00:02:53.989> move<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.379> back<00:02:54.409> and<00:02:55.060> then<00:02:56.409> it's<00:02:57.409> pretty

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
just move it back and then it's pretty

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.099 
just move it back and then it's pretty
simple<00:02:57.950> once<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.459> get<00:02:58.639> that<00:02:58.790> off<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.840> the

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
simple once you get that off and the

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.899 
simple once you get that off and the
mindful<00:03:00.500> comes<00:03:00.709> up<00:03:00.939> and<00:03:01.939> you<00:03:02.180> move<00:03:03.109> it<00:03:03.230> back

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
mindful comes up and you move it back

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.610 
mindful comes up and you move it back
don't<00:03:04.909> forget<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.329> remove<00:03:05.629> this<00:03:05.870> plug<00:03:06.200> over

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
don't forget to remove this plug over

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.550 
don't forget to remove this plug over
here<00:03:06.859> this<00:03:07.849> plug<00:03:08.510> right<00:03:08.750> here<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:11.379> let's<00:03:12.379> see

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
here this plug right here and let's see

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.920 
here this plug right here and let's see
there's<00:03:12.950> no<00:03:13.189> for<00:03:13.879> the<00:03:13.970> manifold<00:03:14.449> there's<00:03:14.750> no

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
there's no for the manifold there's no

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.020 
there's no for the manifold there's no
screws<00:03:15.290> on<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.620> back<00:03:15.829> they're<00:03:16.190> all<00:03:16.220> up<00:03:16.579> here

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
screws on the back they're all up here

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.439 
screws on the back they're all up here
so<00:03:17.989> let's<00:03:18.680> just<00:03:18.889> cover<00:03:19.159> the<00:03:19.849> manifold<00:03:20.269> has<00:03:20.389> a

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
so let's just cover the manifold has a

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.229 
so let's just cover the manifold has a
gasket<00:03:20.989> but<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:21.500> it's<00:03:21.859> a<00:03:22.190> rubber<00:03:22.519> gasket<00:03:22.790> so

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
gasket but it's it's a rubber gasket so

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.270 
gasket but it's it's a rubber gasket so
you<00:03:23.299> don't<00:03:23.510> have<00:03:23.599> to<00:03:23.720> replace<00:03:24.049> it<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:24.949> as<00:03:25.099> you

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
you don't have to replace it so as you

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.809 
you don't have to replace it so as you
take<00:03:25.489> it<00:03:25.669> out<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.540> don't<00:03:26.750> break<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.549> you<00:03:28.549> just

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
take it out and don't break it you just

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.360 
take it out and don't break it you just
use<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.000> again<00:03:29.299> and<00:03:30.250> sparkplugs

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
use it again and sparkplugs

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.149 
use it again and sparkplugs
you<00:03:32.239> know<00:03:32.359> just<00:03:32.599> use<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.959> factory<00:03:33.560> one<00:03:33.769> or<00:03:33.979> go

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
you know just use the factory one or go

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.949 
you know just use the factory one or go
with<00:03:34.370> double-platinum<00:03:34.879> or<00:03:35.449> whatever<00:03:35.840> you

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
with double-platinum or whatever you

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.530 
with double-platinum or whatever you
want<00:03:36.109> to<00:03:36.169> use<00:03:36.379> but<00:03:36.639> then<00:03:37.639> I'm<00:03:37.760> data<00:03:38.000> it's

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
want to use but then I'm data it's

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.780 
want to use but then I'm data it's
pretty<00:03:38.810> simple<00:03:39.109> and<00:03:39.409> then<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.680> three<00:03:39.949> three

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
pretty simple and then the three three

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.990 
pretty simple and then the three three
spark<00:03:41.629> plugs<00:03:41.870> on<00:03:42.109> the<00:03:42.189> back<00:03:43.189> side<00:03:43.430> underneath

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
spark plugs on the back side underneath

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.869 
spark plugs on the back side underneath
the<00:03:44.239> manifold<00:03:44.889> they<00:03:45.889> have<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.189> same<00:03:46.400> thing<00:03:46.639> I

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
the manifold they have the same thing I

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.379 
the manifold they have the same thing I
have<00:03:47.269> one<00:03:47.540> two<00:03:48.109> three<00:03:48.879> take<00:03:49.879> them<00:03:50.030> out<00:03:50.150> put

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
have one two three take them out put

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.249 
have one two three take them out put
them<00:03:50.959> back<00:03:51.139> in<00:03:51.349> that's<00:03:51.829> it<00:03:52.069> and<00:03:52.989> that's<00:03:53.989> how<00:03:54.199> to

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:54.259 
them back in that's it and that's how to

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:59.499 
them back in that's it and that's how to
remove<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.430> replace<00:03:56.419> spark<00:03:57.109> plugs<00:03:57.319> on<00:03:58.209> 2010<00:03:59.209> 4

00:03:59.499 --> 00:03:59.509 
remove and replace spark plugs on 2010 4

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:05.050 
remove and replace spark plugs on 2010 4
flex<00:03:59.810> none<00:04:00.379> eco<00:04:00.889> and<00:04:02.349> that'll<00:04:03.349> save<00:04:03.919> you<00:04:04.189> $400
