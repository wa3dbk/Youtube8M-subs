favorite piece of trail and do it over
and<00:01:08.940> over<00:01:09.060> again<00:01:09.409> looking<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.740> perfect

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and over again looking for the perfect

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.219 
and over again looking for the perfect
line<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.790> also<00:01:12.060> maybe<00:01:12.360> trying<00:01:12.690> to<00:01:12.750> find<00:01:12.930> extra

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
line and also maybe trying to find extra

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.780 
line and also maybe trying to find extra
little<00:01:13.440> bits<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.770> pom<00:01:14.009> that<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.340> maybe<00:01:14.490> miss

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
little bits of pom that you maybe miss

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.670 
little bits of pom that you maybe miss
first<00:01:15.030> time<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.170> more<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.650> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
first time I think the more you do it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.710 
first time I think the more you do it
the<00:01:16.860> better<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.280> instincts<00:01:17.850> become<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.630> now

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the better your instincts become so now

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.410 
the better your instincts become so now
your<00:01:21.869> body's<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.500> working<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> trail<00:01:23.420> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
your body's really working the trail the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.180 
your body's really working the trail the
next<00:01:24.780> step<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.380> thinking<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:25.799> your<00:01:26.009> line

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
next step is thinking about your line

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.219 
next step is thinking about your line
choice<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:27.149> it's<00:01:27.270> absolutely<00:01:27.360> key<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
choice now it's absolutely key that you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.410 
choice now it's absolutely key that you
look<00:01:28.440> a<00:01:28.590> long<00:01:28.830> way<00:01:29.009> down<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.460> trail<00:01:29.700> give

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
look a long way down the trail give

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.930 
look a long way down the trail give
yourself<00:01:30.659> enough<00:01:30.930> time<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.950> react<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.759> what's

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
yourself enough time to react to what's

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.149 
yourself enough time to react to what's
coming<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.330> ahead<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.899> then<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.740> really

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
coming up ahead and then it's really

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.590 
coming up ahead and then it's really
important<00:01:35.580> to<00:01:35.640> remember<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.390> to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
important to remember that you have to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.020 
important to remember that you have to
look<00:01:36.810> where<00:01:37.050> you<00:01:37.140> want<00:01:37.289> to<00:01:37.409> go<00:01:37.679> and<00:01:38.220> not<00:01:38.490> what

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
look where you want to go and not what

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.460 
look where you want to go and not what
you<00:01:39.179> want<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> avoid<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.229> instance

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
you want to avoid so in this instance

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.100 
you want to avoid so in this instance
for<00:01:40.740> example<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.310> dirty<00:01:41.880> great<00:01:42.270> rock<00:01:42.539> is

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
for example this dirty great rock is

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.169 
for example this dirty great rock is
absolutely<00:01:43.590> screaming<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.280> attention<00:01:44.369> but

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
absolutely screaming for attention but

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.149 
absolutely screaming for attention but
the<00:01:45.240> chances<00:01:45.659> are<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.140> if<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.590> look<00:01:46.890> at<00:01:47.009> it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the chances are that if you look at it

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.340 
the chances are that if you look at it
you're<00:01:47.759> probably<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.690> hit<00:01:48.929> it<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
you're probably going to hit it and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.279 
you're probably going to hit it and
that's<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:50.360> really<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.479> very<00:01:51.750> good<00:01:51.929> line<00:01:52.140> at

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
that's not really a very good line at

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.680 
that's not really a very good line at
all<00:01:52.500> much<00:01:53.100> better<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.880> look<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.300> right<00:01:54.330> of
