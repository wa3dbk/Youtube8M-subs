 Christian Ronaldo under sticks Claudio 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.970
 bravo of Christianity 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.490
 they have everything and they have shown it 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.200
 the bbv league will attend another great duel 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.630
 between the two best players of the 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.730
 world a date with the story a 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.050
 encounter between aces and a new face to 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.050
 face between leo messi-cristiano ronaldo 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.809
 the history of the classics of the two 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.360
 it's amazing both have signed nights 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.790
 epic for their teams like 10 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.469
 March 2007 when I read Messi of 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.629
 Slitting hand completed his first 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.070
 hat-trick in a barça-real madríd can 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.519
 the referee's whistle hits him 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.519
 Christian 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.310
 the players have faced 22 times 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 in a classic with 10 wins for the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.630
 FC Barcelona- and 6 for Real Madrid 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.580
 Cristiano Ronaldo has marked the 45th 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.560
 hundred of his team's goals a 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.090
 percentage higher than the Argentine that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.369
 signs 38 percent 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.070
 although, nevertheless, Messi has more goals 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.179
 marked in the classics 21 so many by 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.179
 14 from Portuguese 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.770
 the history of both is exemplified on 7 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.080
 October 2012 when in the tie to 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.610
 two goals both stars showed their 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.830
 quality with so many that were vital 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.040
 for the two teams in a camp nou 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.040
 delivered 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.560
 precisely in can barça came the 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.740
 victory that earned him the league to the real 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.110
 madrid in 2011 2012 the team then 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.729
 directed by mourinho won 1 to 2 in 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.649
 Barcelona with a Christian 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.750
 stratospheric that defined a 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.019
 kickback and brought the three points to 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.019
 mother 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.540
 For his part, Leo Messi became the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.950
 last year in the first player in the 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.990
 history in getting two hat-tricks 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.209
 against Real Madrid in victory in 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.709
 the santiago bernabéu demonstrating that it is 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.890
 the best player in the history of the 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.890
 classics 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.180
 I think if he loses 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.080
 in general, the numbers show a 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.780
 advantage of the Argentine regarding 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.640
 Christian but in FC Barcelona- you know 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.490
 that sensations are what counts 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.010
 today 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.170
 although the year of month and 2015 has been 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.570
 stratospheric with a comeback both to 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.910
 individual level as a collective in the 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.430
 last Christian classic was vital for 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.250
 get the win by 3-1 with a goal 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.290
 of Real Madrid 7 - both will be 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.510
 accompanied by their usual squires 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.340
 to keep increasing your numbers and 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.340
 continue beating the records that they 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.380
 they have already achieved they have no stop 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.000
 they do not know what their roof is and they are 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.160
 aware that the entire planet 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.080
 will be aware of what they do are the 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.540
 two best players in the world and one 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.080
 once more the duel is predicted to the highest
