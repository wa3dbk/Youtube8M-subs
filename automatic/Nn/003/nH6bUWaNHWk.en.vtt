00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 what's up new stefan rejoice and her 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.790
 welcome to another 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.830
 squad pictures yes friends i have 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.590
 of course again on facebook yours 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.900
 opinion and there was just 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.550
 as strong as you are stupid you are 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.830
 all full on glasses that can not be true 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.400
 his wanted to be a fully in 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.099
 shape 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.080
 lord bendtner team and of course i have 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.689
 I rangemacht me here so a 19 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.399
 team in formation 4321 of course 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.890
 according to bendtner everything in form 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.450
 we have four lying seven nations 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.520
 I do not believe that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.440
 Anyone will build many 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.030
 players are also pretty rare though 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.860
 I did not lump myself 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.660
 friends i bought all players 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.800
 even if it took a very long time 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.300
 but also thought for a long time 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.100
 i was having this team together 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.410
 Now maybe not that way 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.210
 playful the best but i think 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.789
 even if you look as such has front with 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.800
 Bendtner lord ribbon after the release head 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.300
 as in form and then as a team around the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.309
 year then not there you are all 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.979
 orders from the court 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.400
 of course with our north with ours 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.799
 lord bendtner wolfsburger before such 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.590
 Moreover, it is simply the lord 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.900
 point we continue with our child 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.850
 striker here we have our andré 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.320
 apple screens four star skills 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.479
 four digits weak on boost cost 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.729
 do you have to hammer around the 35,000 coins 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.520
 Players can just complete everything 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.159
 Skill trick shooting skill tricks 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.049
 is yes that would be a super player 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.750
 then go on to our right 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.329
 striker and that was with the rarest cz 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.040
 The one that ever exists is falling out 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.960
 I think the first team of the week 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.880
 and that is just so difficult 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.860
 to get the rtl is 11 players 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.070
 looking for players and has sometime 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.979
 your luck 59 minute 58 seconds 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.630
 exactly and then I got him 780 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.240
 because butt 82 is a very good one 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.189
 Passing and dribbling also I think 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.960
 four star skills and then ours 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.090
 striker already complete we continue 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.670
 with our right central midfield 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.229
 here we have it co of real madrid yes 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.990
 now, too, finally has the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.840
 four star skills and I like that 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.959
 also very good 79 tempo for the opted 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.350
 optimal for the opti for the position 83 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.660
 shot 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.850
 90 suitable 91 dribbling what do you want 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.200
 More is not so great right now 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.120
 defense game but if you look 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.680
 let's see the playing style of real madrid 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.540
 we actually have a look at 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.120
 give quite offensive midfield 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.250
 continue with toni kroos his 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.750
 teammates oh yes today 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.140
 of course everything is 0 in great case 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.390
 that did not say and toni kroos is 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.710
 a pretty allrounder pasta pretty 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.810
 well in that position , I would say 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.670
 with disco in front of everything and can do that 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.250
 Great the strikers in scene put ours 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.370
 right or our steerable denies 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.570
 totally on the left central 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.220
 midfielder is a leftist 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.370
 central attacking midfielder 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.810
 namely in wayne rooney wayne rooney 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.180
 Maybe many hey think why 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.560
 in central Mittefeld because he is the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.910
 actually quite good this position 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.130
 can hold I think had 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.840
 actually great value super long shops 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.270
 for the position, although not the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.520
 best thing about the defensive game but 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.900
 if you look at his aggressions 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.180
 values ​​and so on simply looks 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.160
 only bombastic and that's why he likes 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.990
 me on this position also very good 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.850
 therefore easy for the central offensive 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.890
 or for the storm perhaps a 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.900
 that's a bit too slow then it was 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.630
 our three-midfield I guess 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.760
 similar to the game style a bit like that 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.500
 what real madrid offered as we have 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.510
 ever two real madrid players and 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.510
 just pretty offensive to ours 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.360
 left-back is on the grill cliché 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.520
 from manchester city be second in shape 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.560
 outstanding values ​​his normal card 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.860
 simply an outstanding player 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.840
 and thus a superspieler day over 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.720
 continue with our right-back 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.690
 here have stefan stefan troller head 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.310
 lichtsteiner ill values ​​can be right 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.960
 Mittelfeld can be right-back 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.090
 right wing of pension just from 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.030
 front to back from left to right 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.400
 simply complete from the back to the front 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.590
 a great horse-tongue player can 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.960
 Just shoot everything except well then 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.170
 Let's go further with our heart 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.420
 with our internal defenses though we 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.330
 Chris Smalling has the perfect 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.470
 link to wayne rooney and therefore ca is 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.270
 Of course not the best 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.690
 defender but you look what 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:24.000
 if you want to know more about 79 tempo 84 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.610
 defense 80 46 very large 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.340
 just a top player for the price 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.560
 our right defender is york 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.570
 berlin ii which is also relatively rare 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.970
 was lucky that I get the 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.500
 have and that is our second 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.490
 defender I need to believe 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.880
 I have nothing to say when you look 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.860
 the values look at 89 signs 89 46 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.860
 and then we come to last but not least 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.210
 our goalkeeper and he is 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.280
 Berlin knows him any I believe 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.600
 not so we only have left 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.300
 is is the start I also think so 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.760
 pretty much the only one in the form 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.229
 Goalkeeper next to the holiday or 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.550
 or an Italian is it 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.950
 even the only one and even of course 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.210
 taken the other because the lama me 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.410
 because again everyone understands 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.430
 Not what I want to say, I think so 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.200
 I do not understand him myself either 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.590
 want to say definitely needs of the 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.850
 gate 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.340
 otherwise we can not get to the full 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.650
 chemistry no link list otherwise and thus 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.260
 we have full chemistry all in form 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.840
 snow link wasted lord bender in the team 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.010
 really great heads are all that 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.390
 what you want I hope you have 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.160
 If so , I would like myself 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.450
 Thumbs upwards friends look forward to me 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.800
 frankly, have been quite a long time 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.750
 the players think for a long time 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.610
 bought that was already a work some 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.080
 think scott pictures yes there is there 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.700
 maybe three minutes a team like that 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.990
 it is not easy friends often 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.660
 you have to pretty much 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.710
 consider it because this 08 15 shit that 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.630
 really no one wants to see 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.790
 and I think this team is already 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.380
 very good friends then it was 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.790
 Word from me as I said if it is you 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.350
 please let thumb up there 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.610
 I would like a lot over 6,000 likes 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.740
 maybe even seven or eight 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.169
 1000 for lord bendtner are looking forward to a bag 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.160
 there's again yes then say goodbye 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.690
 me now but i wish you 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.520
 Another nice weekend is good 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.520
 skin in and ciao 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:12.240
 Overall, the value was getting 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.240
 penultimate result for the first league
