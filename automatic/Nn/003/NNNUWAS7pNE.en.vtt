00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
of the vehicle we have two up top and we

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.430 
of the vehicle we have two up top and we
have<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.590> down<00:01:01.860> through<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.280> hole<00:01:03.440> slightly

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
have one down through this hole slightly

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.750 
have one down through this hole slightly
tricky<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.949> get<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> that's<00:01:05.430> what<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
tricky to get to that's what the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.630 
tricky to get to that's what the
extension<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.330> great<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.590> go<00:01:08.280> ahead<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
extension is great for so go ahead and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.270 
extension is great for so go ahead and
remove<00:01:08.940> these<00:01:09.660> three<00:01:09.990> bolts<00:01:10.350> I'll<00:01:10.740> try<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
remove these three bolts I'll try and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.609 
remove these three bolts I'll try and
show<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.550> if<00:01:11.790> they<00:01:11.880> review<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.619> third

it<00:01:48.700> would<00:01:48.819> be<00:01:49.030> this<00:01:49.270> year

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.280 

as<00:01:58.120> they<00:01:59.050> don't<00:01:59.260> give<00:01:59.410> you<00:01:59.500> much<00:01:59.530> room

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
as they don't give you much room

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.100 
as they don't give you much room
you<00:02:01.860> bought<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.370> 8-pin<00:02:03.150> connector<00:02:03.660> of<00:02:03.870> which

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
you bought this 8-pin connector of which

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.970 
you bought this 8-pin connector of which
this<00:02:04.980> applied<00:02:05.370> only<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.700> devices<00:02:06.150> probably

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
this applied only you devices probably

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.950 
this applied only you devices probably
and<00:02:07.980> then<00:02:08.100> if<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.820> have<00:02:09.090> aftermarket<00:02:09.840> head

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
and then if you have aftermarket head

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.510 
and then if you have aftermarket head
the<00:02:11.330> hid<00:02:12.330> setup<00:02:12.900> go<00:02:13.650> ahead<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:13.950> remove<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.340> it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
the hid setup go ahead and remove all it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.410 
the hid setup go ahead and remove all it
which<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:14.970> well

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
which as well

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.400 
which as well
now<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.440> headlight<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:17.040> fairly<00:02:18.030> easy<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.690> take

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
now the headlight is fairly easy to take

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.300 
now the headlight is fairly easy to take
out<00:02:21.500> want<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.590> go<00:02:22.680> ahead<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.480> slide<00:02:24.480> this

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
out want to go ahead and slide this

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.480 
out want to go ahead and slide this
connector<00:02:26.390> turn<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:28.380> pull<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.620> out

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
connector turn it and pull it out

one<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.640> most<00:02:31.970> difficult<00:02:32.210> parts<00:02:32.660> for<00:02:33.050> the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
one of the most difficult parts for the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.940 
one of the most difficult parts for the
sunlight<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.800> this<00:02:34.550> nib<00:02:35.290> goes<00:02:36.290> right<00:02:36.650> into

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
sunlight is this nib goes right into

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.210 
sunlight is this nib goes right into
this<00:02:37.070> slot<00:02:37.370> down<00:02:37.640> here<00:02:38.290> onto<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.530> slam<00:02:39.800> panel

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
this slot down here onto the slam panel

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.360 
this slot down here onto the slam panel
and<00:02:41.920> typically<00:02:42.920> if<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.250> can<00:02:43.490> slide<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:45.370> turn

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
and typically if you can slide the turn

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.110 
and typically if you can slide the turn
signal<00:02:46.760> area<00:02:47.030> out<00:02:47.660> first<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.710> then<00:02:49.670> pull<00:02:49.940> back

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
signal area out first and then pull back

signal area out first and then pull back
this<00:02:50.810> way<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:52.220> will<00:02:52.370> typically<00:02:52.640> come<00:02:52.850> off<00:02:53.000> a

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
this way it will typically come off a

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.810 
this way it will typically come off a
lot<00:02:53.270> easier<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.900> it's<00:02:54.110> like<00:02:54.320> forward

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
lot easier and it's like forward

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.150 
lot easier and it's like forward
maneuver<00:02:55.820> out<00:02:56.170> now<00:02:57.170> slightly<00:02:57.470> over<00:02:57.830> exposing

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
maneuver out now slightly over exposing

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.950 
maneuver out now slightly over exposing
the<00:02:58.340> shot<00:02:58.580> so<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.000> can<00:02:59.180> kind<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.750> see

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
the shot so that you can kind of see

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.100 
the shot so that you can kind of see
well<00:03:00.170> getting<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.560> there's<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.640> single<00:03:02.180> tab<00:03:02.480> up

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
well getting it there's a single tab up

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.550 
well getting it there's a single tab up
in<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.440> top<00:03:04.450> these<00:03:05.450> growth<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:06.140> something<00:03:06.500> you

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
in the top these growth is something you

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.600 
in the top these growth is something you
could<00:03:06.820> leverage<00:03:07.820> that<00:03:08.150> down

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
could leverage that down

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.589 
could leverage that down
come<00:03:10.120> out<00:03:11.190> take<00:03:12.190> out

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
come out take out

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.490 
come out take out
you<00:03:13.750> need<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.049> take<00:03:14.230> out<00:03:15.030> on<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.150> right<00:03:16.299> side

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
you need to take out on the right side

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.319 
you need to take out on the right side
left<00:03:17.500> side<00:03:17.760> before<00:03:18.760> removing<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.180> bumper

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
left side before removing the bumper

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.880 
left side before removing the bumper
from<00:03:19.599> safety<00:03:20.109> we'll<00:03:20.560> need<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.799> use<00:03:20.829> a<00:03:21.340> t20

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.870 

both<00:03:25.490> that<00:03:25.880> both<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.360> front<00:03:27.050> valence<00:03:27.830> on<00:03:28.610> to

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
both that both the front valence on to

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.720 
both that both the front valence on to
the<00:03:29.000> fender<00:03:29.800> real<00:03:30.800> liner

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
the fender real liner

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:43.009 
the fender real liner
so<00:03:33.060> we<00:03:33.209> take<00:03:33.360> that<00:03:33.420> all

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.679 

next<00:03:44.019> step<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.439> to<00:03:44.590> simply<00:03:45.370> pull<00:03:45.879> outwards<00:03:46.390> on

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
next step is to simply pull outwards on

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:49.820 
next step is to simply pull outwards on
the<00:03:47.170> fender<00:03:47.650> here

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.120 

you'll<00:03:50.830> help<00:03:51.040> multiple<00:03:51.490> lips<00:03:52.180> pop

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
you'll help multiple lips pop

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.150 
you'll help multiple lips pop
