are a lot of BOTS doing it too
unfortunately

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
unfortunately

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.719 
unfortunately
hopefully<00:01:48.649> jagex<00:01:49.040> should<00:01:49.250> have<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:49.550> fixed

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
hopefully jagex should have that fixed

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.749 
hopefully jagex should have that fixed
soon<00:01:50.180> all<00:01:50.899> right<00:01:51.050> so<00:01:51.380> we'll<00:01:51.920> say<00:01:52.159> that<00:01:52.430> this<00:01:52.580> is

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
soon all right so we'll say that this is

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.880 
soon all right so we'll say that this is
a<00:01:52.790> full<00:01:52.970> inventory<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:53.659> once<00:01:53.840> you're<00:01:54.020> done<00:01:54.049> you

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
have two options right now you can run

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.050 
have two options right now you can run
back<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:57.950> bank<00:01:58.159> after<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:58.640> have<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.790> full

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
a ladder right there and you climb up it

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.220 
a ladder right there and you climb up it
and<00:02:16.209> then<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:17.360> just<00:02:17.390> click<00:02:17.690> on<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.900> spinning

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
and then you just click on the spinning

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.960

wheel you click spin on the spinning
wheel<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.420> then<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.380> see<00:02:21.590> bowstring<00:02:22.489> and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
wheel and then you see bowstring and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.250 
wheel and then you see bowstring and
then<00:02:22.730> flax<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.239> parenthesis<00:02:23.720> that's<00:02:23.989> what<00:02:24.170> you

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
then flax in parenthesis that's what you

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.650 
then flax in parenthesis that's what you
want<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.500> make<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.280> then<00:02:25.400> just<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:26.000> know<00:02:26.090> type

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
want to make and then just you know type

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.150 
want to make and then just you know type
a<00:02:26.780> random<00:02:27.140> high<00:02:27.350> number<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.800> make<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> whole

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
a random high number to make the whole

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.240 
a random high number to make the whole
inventory<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.850> as<00:02:29.569> I<00:02:30.080> said<00:02:30.350> before<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:31.100> need

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
inventory and as I said before you need

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.280 
inventory and as I said before you need
ten<00:02:31.519> crafting<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.239> do<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:32.510> but<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.110> can

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
ten crafting to do this but this can

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.780 
ten crafting to do this but this can
actually<00:02:33.440> get<00:02:33.800> your<00:02:33.920> crafting<00:02:34.340> level<00:02:34.640> up

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
actually get your crafting level up

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.210 
actually get your crafting level up
decently<00:02:35.390> fast<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:36.049> it'll<00:02:36.799> pretty<00:02:37.070> much

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
decently fast and it'll pretty much

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.819 
decently fast and it'll pretty much
double<00:02:37.579> your<00:02:37.730> profit<00:02:38.120> as<00:02:38.209> well<00:02:38.420> because<00:02:38.900> as<00:02:39.230> of

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
double your profit as well because as of

double your profit as well because as of
right<00:02:39.890> now<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.760> runescape<00:02:41.510> let<00:02:42.470> me<00:02:42.530> check<00:02:42.680> the

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
right now in runescape let me check the

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.050 
right now in runescape let me check the
date<00:02:42.980> here

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
date here

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.680 
date here
March<00:02:44.600> 15th<00:02:45.140> 2013<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.269> prices<00:02:47.570> are

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
March 15th 2013 so the prices are

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.090 
March 15th 2013 so the prices are
probably<00:02:47.780> gonna<00:02:48.019> change<00:02:48.110> by<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.739> time<00:02:48.980> you

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
probably gonna change by the time you

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.949 
probably gonna change by the time you
guys<00:02:49.190> watch<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.519> video<00:02:49.790> but<00:02:50.120> flax<00:02:50.540> is<00:02:50.750> going

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
guys watch this video but flax is going

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.020 
guys watch this video but flax is going
for<00:02:51.110> around<00:02:51.200> 40<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.769> 45<00:02:52.220> bow<00:02:52.579> strings<00:02:52.880> going

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
for around 40 to 45 bow strings going

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.690 
for around 40 to 45 bow strings going
for<00:02:53.269> around<00:02:53.510> 70<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:53.959> 80<00:02:54.380> each<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:55.489> you<00:02:55.519> can

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
for around 70 to 80 each so you can

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.240 
for around 70 to 80 each so you can
potentially<00:02:56.150> double<00:02:56.570> your<00:02:56.720> profit<00:02:57.140> but<00:02:57.590> in

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
potentially double your profit but in

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.920 
potentially double your profit but in
the<00:02:58.370> time<00:02:58.579> it<00:02:58.730> takes<00:02:58.850> you<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.120> spin<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.660> whole

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
the time it takes you to spin a whole

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.740 
the time it takes you to spin a whole
inventory<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.799> flat<00:03:01.190> flax<00:03:02.060> in<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.359> bow<00:03:02.510> string

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
inventory of flat flax in the bow string

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.750 
inventory of flat flax in the bow string
you<00:03:03.410> could<00:03:03.560> probably<00:03:03.709> have<00:03:04.040> picked<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:04.609> whole

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
you could probably have picked a whole

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.319 
you could probably have picked a whole
nother<00:03:04.970> inventory<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.750> just<00:03:06.170> plain<00:03:06.709> flax<00:03:07.130> so<00:03:07.940> I

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
nother inventory of just plain flax so I

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.569 
nother inventory of just plain flax so I
guess<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:09.170> money-making<00:03:09.530> doesn't<00:03:10.430> really

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
guess the money-making doesn't really

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.759 
guess the money-making doesn't really
get<00:03:10.790> any<00:03:11.030> faster<00:03:11.329> whether<00:03:12.109> or<00:03:12.320> not<00:03:12.440> you're

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
get any faster whether or not you're

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.319 
get any faster whether or not you're
spending<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.310> or<00:03:13.459> not<00:03:13.609> it<00:03:13.790> just<00:03:13.820> kind<00:03:14.120> of<00:03:14.150> gets

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
spending it or not it just kind of gets

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.479 
spending it or not it just kind of gets
you<00:03:14.450> some<00:03:14.630> free<00:03:14.780> crafting<00:03:15.260> experience<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:16.070> I

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
you some free crafting experience and I

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.740 
you some free crafting experience and I
feel<00:03:16.670> like<00:03:16.850> bow<00:03:17.000> strings<00:03:17.329> a<00:03:17.420> little<00:03:17.630> bit

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
feel like bow strings a little bit

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.870 
feel like bow strings a little bit
easier<00:03:18.049> to<00:03:18.140> sell<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:19.100> yeah<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.519> hope<00:03:19.730> that

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
easier to sell so yeah I hope that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.940 
easier to sell so yeah I hope that
