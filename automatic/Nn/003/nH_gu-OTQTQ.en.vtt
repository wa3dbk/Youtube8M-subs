00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
little bit about something we get a lot

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.640 
little bit about something we get a lot
of<00:00:12.030> questions<00:00:12.389> every<00:00:12.660> spring<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.410> and

it's it's a timely thing to cover in
this<00:00:15.809> video<00:00:16.940> basically<00:00:17.940> how<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.359> start<00:00:18.600> a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
this video basically how do you start a

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.830 
this video basically how do you start a
pond<00:00:18.930> upright<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.740> spring<00:00:20.070> well<00:00:20.689> we<00:00:21.689> could

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
pond upright in the spring well we could

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.359 
pond upright in the spring well we could
go<00:00:21.930> into<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.170> lot<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.560> different<00:00:22.830> things<00:00:22.980> but

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
go into a lot of different things but

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.640 
go into a lot of different things but
there's<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.699> few<00:00:23.880> things<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.240> want<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.170> want<00:00:25.529> to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
it's clean make sure that you get all

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.820 
it's clean make sure that you get all
the<00:00:29.250> debris<00:00:29.970> gunk<00:00:30.570> accumulation<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.590> stuff

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the debris gunk accumulation of stuff

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.229 
the debris gunk accumulation of stuff
that<00:00:32.070> may<00:00:32.219> have<00:00:32.369> gotten<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.790> there<00:00:32.940> over<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
that may have gotten in there over the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.160 
that may have gotten in there over the
winter<00:00:33.510> out<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> good<00:00:34.920> clean<00:00:35.460> start<00:00:36.170> you'll

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
winter out get a good clean start you'll

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.139 
winter out get a good clean start you'll
probably<00:00:37.380> want<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.829> add<00:00:37.890> some<00:00:38.219> fresh<00:00:38.460> water<00:00:38.730> do

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
probably want to add some fresh water do

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.479 
probably want to add some fresh water do
either<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.719> full<00:00:40.020> water<00:00:40.469> change<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.219> full

water change with regards to putting

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.529 
water change with regards to putting
fresh<00:00:47.010> stuff<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.460> there<00:00:47.640> obviously<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.360> want

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
fresh stuff in there obviously you want

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.229 
fresh stuff in there obviously you want
to<00:00:48.570> dechlorinate<00:00:49.610> get<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> chlorine<00:00:51.090> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
to dechlorinate get the chlorine and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.970 
to dechlorinate get the chlorine and
chloramine<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.260> there<00:00:52.410> make<00:00:52.649> sure<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
chloramine out of there make sure that

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.319 
chloramine out of there make sure that
that's<00:00:53.100> all<00:00:53.399> gone<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.090> fish

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that's all gone if you have fish

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.500 
that's all gone if you have fish
involved<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.730> one<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.879> most<00:00:57.030> important

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
involved and one of the most important

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.970 
involved and one of the most important
things<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.899> always<00:00:58.079> go<00:00:58.289> back<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.770> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
things and I always go back to this I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.799 
things and I always go back to this I
know<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.489> sounds<00:00:59.789> like<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> broken<00:01:00.180> record<00:01:00.510> but

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
know it sounds like a broken record but

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.540 
know it sounds like a broken record but
when<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.079> start<00:01:01.350> off<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> new<00:01:01.649> pond<00:01:02.039> or<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.309> fresh

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
when you start off a new pond or a fresh

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.979 
when you start off a new pond or a fresh
pond<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> spring<00:01:03.270> make<00:01:03.480> sure<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.899> you

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
pond in the spring make sure that you

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.620 
pond in the spring make sure that you
get<00:01:04.170> good<00:01:04.650> beneficial<00:01:05.430> bacteria<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:06.360> in

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
get good beneficial bacteria going in

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.560 
get good beneficial bacteria going in
there<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> bio<00:01:07.920> filter<00:01:08.570> you

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
there if you have a bio filter you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.640 
there if you have a bio filter you
always<00:01:09.780> want<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> keep<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.290> mind<00:01:10.500> that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
always want to keep in mind that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.410 
always want to keep in mind that
whenever<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.070> shut<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> system<00:01:11.670> down<00:01:11.880> or<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
whenever you shut the system down or the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
whenever you shut the system down or the
flow<00:01:12.630> down<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.049> may<00:01:13.170> not<00:01:13.320> take<00:01:13.560> water<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:13.920> of

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
flow down you may not take water out of

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.370 
flow down you may not take water out of
the<00:01:14.189> pond<00:01:14.400> body<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.630> shut<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.170> flow

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the pond body but if you shut the flow

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.080 
the pond body but if you shut the flow
of<00:01:16.409> water<00:01:16.740> down<00:01:17.009> through<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.369> bio<00:01:17.580> filter

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
of water down through that bio filter

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.330 
of water down through that bio filter
bacteria<00:01:18.990> begins<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.650> die<00:01:19.799> off<00:01:20.040> immediately

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
bacteria begins to die off immediately

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.840 
bacteria begins to die off immediately
and<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.619> you<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:22.740> if<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.430> been<00:01:23.520> shut<00:01:23.790> down

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and so you know if it's been shut down

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.700 
and so you know if it's been shut down
all<00:01:24.119> winter<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.600> bacteria<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.259> probably

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
all winter the bacteria is probably

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.620 
all winter the bacteria is probably
either<00:01:25.920> dormant<00:01:26.490> or<00:01:26.610> depleted<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.420> bio

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
either dormant or depleted in that bio

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.170 
either dormant or depleted in that bio
filter<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.290> well<00:01:28.500> as<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> pond<00:01:29.100> itself<00:01:29.460> so

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
filter as well as in the pond itself so

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.149 
filter as well as in the pond itself so
you<00:01:30.240> want<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.600> replenish<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.530> revive<00:01:31.890> it

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
you want to replenish that and revive it

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.530 
you want to replenish that and revive it
and<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.000> you're<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.450> to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and so to do that you're going to

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.740 
and so to do that you're going to
supplement<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.229> beneficial<00:01:34.619> bacteria<00:01:35.750> for

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
supplement with beneficial bacteria for

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.359 
supplement with beneficial bacteria for
a<00:01:36.780> while<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> early<00:01:37.650> spring<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.189> these

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
a while in the early spring to get these

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.429

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.429

as it does with any new pond six to
eight<00:01:46.590> weeks<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.070> may<00:01:47.220> see<00:01:47.280> some<00:01:47.759> algae

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
eight weeks you may see some algae

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.539 
eight weeks you may see some algae
issues<00:01:48.960> or<00:01:49.140> Walter<00:01:49.409> water<00:01:49.770> quality<00:01:50.189> problems

issues or Walter water quality problems

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.580 
issues or Walter water quality problems
in<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> early<00:01:50.820> days<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.020> bacteria

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
in the early days but as this bacteria

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.170 
in the early days but as this bacteria
gets<00:01:52.799> more<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.130> more<00:01:53.189> established<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> pond

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
gets more and more established the pond

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.880 
gets more and more established the pond
will<00:01:54.390> become<00:01:54.689> clearer<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.200> cleaner<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.560> so

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
will become clearer and cleaner and so

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.310 
will become clearer and cleaner and so
that's<00:01:56.700> probably<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.299> number<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.689> tip<00:01:57.930> don't

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
that's probably the number one tip don't

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.350 
that's probably the number one tip don't
forget<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.770> use<00:01:58.950> some<00:01:59.250> good<00:01:59.430> bacteria<00:01:59.640> to<00:02:00.180> kick

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
plants established as soon as you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.230 
plants established as soon as you
possibly<00:02:19.710> can<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.220> because<00:02:20.730> that's<00:02:20.880> always

possibly can to because that's always

possibly can to because that's always
going<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.690> help<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.050> balancing<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.530> pond<00:02:22.800> out

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
going to help in balancing the pond out

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.160 
going to help in balancing the pond out
blocking<00:02:23.850> some<00:02:24.030> excessive<00:02:24.540> sunlight<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.050> all

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
blocking some excessive sunlight and all

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.350 
blocking some excessive sunlight and all
those<00:02:25.410> things<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.070> if<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.700> get<00:02:26.850> started<00:02:27.240> off

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
those things so if you get started off

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.260 
those things so if you get started off
right<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.930> can<00:02:28.080> definitely<00:02:28.620> help<00:02:29.270> minimize

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
right you can definitely help minimize

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.150 
right you can definitely help minimize
