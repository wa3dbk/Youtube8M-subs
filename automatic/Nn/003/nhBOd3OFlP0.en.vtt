00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
over to the court now there may be a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.170 
over to the court now there may be a

but<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.180> doubt<00:00:42.239> that's<00:00:42.629> going<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> happen<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
but I doubt that's going to happen I

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.290 
but I doubt that's going to happen I
think<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.829> time<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> talking<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.969> over

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
think the time for the talking is over

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.560 
think the time for the talking is over
that's<00:00:45.690> why<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.960> warrant<00:00:46.890> has<00:00:47.039> been<00:00:47.070> executed

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
that's why the warrant has been executed

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.880 
that's why the warrant has been executed
yeah<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.020> he<00:00:49.079> has<00:00:49.200> attorneys<00:00:49.710> at

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
yeah we know that he has attorneys at

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.500 
yeah we know that he has attorneys at
this<00:00:50.010> point<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.340> unclear<00:00:50.460> whether<00:00:51.270> he's

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
this point it's unclear whether he's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.479 
this point it's unclear whether he's
changed<00:00:51.840> attorneys<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.469> he<00:00:52.739> had<00:00:52.890> somebody<00:00:53.100> new

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
changed attorneys or he had somebody new

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.840 
changed attorneys or he had somebody new
but<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:54.300> how<00:00:54.510> much<00:00:55.160> are<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.340> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.699> be

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
but but how much are they going to be

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.490 
but but how much are they going to be
able<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.090> necessarily<00:00:57.360> get<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.230> him<00:00:58.350> after

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
able to necessarily get out of him after

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.840 
able to necessarily get out of him after
this<00:00:58.710> point<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> sort<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.280> mentioned<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.699> it

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
this point you sort of mentioned that it

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
this point you sort of mentioned that it
may<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> talking<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.750> over<00:01:00.989> at<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.199> point

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
may be the talking is over at this point

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.619 
may be the talking is over at this point
if<00:01:01.530> he's<00:01:01.649> already<00:01:01.829> lawyered<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:03.270> he<00:01:03.449> just

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
if he's already lawyered up is he just

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.880 
if he's already lawyered up is he just
going<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.199> charged<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.589> sit<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.860> my

going there to be charged and sit in my
cell<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.280> little<00:01:05.489> while<00:01:05.610> that's<00:01:06.390> certainly

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
cell for a little while that's certainly

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.810 
cell for a little while that's certainly
what<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.560> indications<00:01:08.220> are<00:01:08.430> here

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
what all the indications are here

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.090 
what all the indications are here
because<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.900> police<00:01:10.170> know<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.680> he<00:01:10.830> has<00:01:10.950> an

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
because the police know that he has an

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.500 
because the police know that he has an
attorney<00:01:11.430> they're<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.060> talk<00:01:12.299> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
attorney they're not going to talk to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.060 
attorney they're not going to talk to
him<00:01:12.630> without<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> attorneys<00:01:13.470> present<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
him without the attorneys present and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.219 
him without the attorneys present and
well<00:01:14.220> without<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.909> attorneys<00:01:15.360> allowing<00:01:15.960> him

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
well without the attorneys allowing him

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.920 
well without the attorneys allowing him
to<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.500> interviewed<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.640> again<00:01:18.060> that's<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
to be interviewed so again that's the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.780 
to be interviewed so again that's the
least<00:01:19.170> likely<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> scenarios<00:01:20.460> at<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
least likely of the scenarios at this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.840 
least likely of the scenarios at this
point<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:22.740> there<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> good<00:01:23.250> chance<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.670> he

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
point is there a good chance that he

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.520 
point is there a good chance that he
knew<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.689> coming<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.229> he<00:01:25.380> was

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
knew that this was coming and he was

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.560 
knew that this was coming and he was
waiting<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:25.950> his<00:01:26.070> home<00:01:26.340> knowing<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.299> this

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
waiting in his home knowing that this

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.969 
waiting in his home knowing that this
day<00:01:27.810> was<00:01:28.020> coming<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.500> his<00:01:28.680> lawyers

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
day was coming and that his lawyers

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.560 
day was coming and that his lawyers
would<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.369> meet<00:01:29.520> him<00:01:29.700> downtown

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
would have to meet him downtown

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
process take at one point what might we

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.070 
process take at one point what might we
expect<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.380> see<00:03:22.590> him<00:03:22.800> in<00:03:23.010> court<00:03:23.220> today<00:03:23.900> well<00:03:24.900> go

from there to the court and in terms of

when we'll see him today it's unclear

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.470 
when we'll see him today it's unclear
certainly<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.400> court<00:03:32.700> house<00:03:32.850> has<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.330> prepare

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
certainly the court house has to prepare

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.550 
certainly the court house has to prepare
for<00:03:34.140> for<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.920> media<00:03:35.760> throng<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.720> we'll

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
for for the media throng and we'll

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.640 
for for the media throng and we'll
probably<00:03:37.890> have<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:38.850> move<00:03:39.810> through<00:03:40.140> all<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.410> the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
probably have to move through all of the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.680 
probably have to move through all of the
other<00:03:40.680> cases<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.640> get<00:03:41.790> those<00:03:42.000> out<00:03:42.300> of<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.510> way

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
other cases and get those out of the way

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.560 
other cases and get those out of the way
and<00:03:43.020> probably<00:03:43.560> set<00:03:43.830> it<00:03:43.860> inside<00:03:44.700> some<00:03:44.970> specific

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
and probably set it inside some specific

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.350 
and probably set it inside some specific
time<00:03:45.810> my<00:03:46.739> guess<00:03:47.190> is<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.790> would<00:03:47.970> be<00:03:48.120> in<00:03:48.239> the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
time my guess is it would be in the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.729 
time my guess is it would be in the
early<00:03:48.510> afternoon<00:03:49.290> but<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:50.130> can't<00:03:50.670> say<00:03:50.910> for<00:03:50.940> sure

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
early afternoon but I can't say for sure

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.930 
early afternoon but I can't say for sure
it's<00:03:52.739> certainly<00:03:52.950> going<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.160> be<00:03:53.220> something<00:03:53.850> to

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
it's certainly going to be something to

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.390 
it's certainly going to be something to
see<00:03:53.970> North<00:03:54.360> out<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.630> Laura<00:03:54.810> obviously<00:03:55.380> kind<00:03:56.250> of

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
see North out of Laura obviously kind of

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.800 
see North out of Laura obviously kind of
a<00:03:56.459> quiet<00:03:56.640> town<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.180> have<00:03:57.300> something<00:03:57.660> like<00:03:57.690> this

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
a quiet town to have something like this

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.960 
a quiet town to have something like this
going<00:03:57.989> on<00:03:58.410> at<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.950> police<00:03:59.310> station<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.850> then

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
going on at the police station and then

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.550 
going on at the police station and then
at<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.270> courthouse<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.020> something<00:04:01.410> is

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
at the courthouse is this something is

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.590 
at the courthouse is this something is
it<00:04:01.980> ever<00:04:02.100> difficult<00:04:02.580> for<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:03.090> court<00:04:03.330> to<00:04:03.450> handle

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
it ever difficult for a court to handle

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.210 
it ever difficult for a court to handle
the<00:04:03.870> throng<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.680> media<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.100> they<00:04:05.190> are

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
the throng of media that they are

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.620 
the throng of media that they are
expecting<00:04:05.760> this<00:04:05.850> afternoon<00:04:06.360> does<00:04:06.510> that

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
expecting this afternoon does that

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.530 
expecting this afternoon does that
change<00:04:06.870> anything<00:04:07.520> well<00:04:08.520> certainly<00:04:09.300> in<00:04:09.510> terms

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
change anything well certainly in terms

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.860 
change anything well certainly in terms
of<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.769> press<00:04:11.209> access<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.510> can<00:04:12.750> be

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
of the the press access that can be

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.020 
of the the press access that can be
difficult<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.620> involve<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.130> lot<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.340> logistics

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
difficult and involve a lot of logistics

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.280 
difficult and involve a lot of logistics
but<00:04:15.360> that<00:04:15.600> courthouses<00:04:16.560> are<00:04:17.959> familiar<00:04:18.959> with

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
but that courthouses are familiar with

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.740 
but that courthouses are familiar with
high<00:04:19.830> publicity<00:04:20.250> cases<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.299> I<00:04:21.390> think<00:04:21.450> they'll

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
high publicity cases and I think they'll

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.840 
high publicity cases and I think they'll
be<00:04:21.900> able<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.140> handle<00:04:22.410> this<00:04:22.680> over<00:04:22.950> there<00:04:23.100> all
