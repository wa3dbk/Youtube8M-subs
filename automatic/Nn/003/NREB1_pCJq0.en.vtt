00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.780
 and pampa the yard when you want and action 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.419
 next to me they will see me they go to prison there 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.700
 that to advance more papista idea already 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.520
 let's do it right, get tschoop to my side 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.350
 sipán padilla not so much with your want 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.510
 although I follow my mom 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.130
 is a foam one of the brands that 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.350
 they take out more exclusive editions for their 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.850
 footballers probably yes but to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.860
 I'm always good news because 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.390
 I love the bo power boot and in this 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.400
 occasion it is an evolution of the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.840
 Boot eua power has many good things 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.760
 but maybe one of the ones that we could 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.160
 to miss is that being a boot 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.020
 that has the name power is missing 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.879
 a little armed for that for mario 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.070
 balotelli have released a new edition 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.080
 which has the name evo accuracy 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.790
 it really is an evolved web Europe 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.270
 to get more armed in the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.900
 moment of the beating we have the bag with 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.690
 the initials of mario balotelli in 945 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.800
 and this is the new app uma led to cure 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.800
 so for mario balotelli 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.549
 What are the characteristics of this new 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.929
 boot because really though 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.939
 aesthetically look like new power 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.969
 just looking at the hand and manipulating 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:21.460
 the philosophy of 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.439
 entrance the material of the casing gives it 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.750
 plate is identical is the same analyze 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.240
 which uses the puma ecopower as standard 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.819
 it also has all this grip technology 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.530
 text that allows more grip between the 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.850
 ball and the ball one of the main 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.740
 problems of the first generation of 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.270
 evo power and that were solved in the 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.459
 second generation of course in 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.020
 huacullani also has it and then the 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.479
 this boot key element 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.610
 differentiator then between the inner layer 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.649
 of dad lite has the technology 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.989
 accuracy that are layers of foam 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.149
 that gets a little thicken this 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:55.060
 shell this external material arman 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.319
 much more the beating and although something does not 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.239
 they limit too much 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.069
 this hyper flexible feature that 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:01.719
 have the evo power since remember that 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.640
 the main element technology 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.860
 main thing that mounts this boot is that 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.429
 after studying the reaction of a stick of 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.959
 golf or a racket hit the ball 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.450
 to see how they generated elastic energy 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.769
 have tried to replicate it to the boot and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.659
 this is the only boot on the market that 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.150
 when he hits the ball he has the 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:21.799
 hyper ability to extend and release 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.799
 helping our striking power 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.030
 and that has an inner layer 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.040
 of acura like that makes it not 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.160
 essential the everfit that that 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.900
 item that he had in the serial boot 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.440
 in the inner zone to get 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.430
 stabilize the boot on the foot 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.990
 The new internal foam is 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.430
 sufficiently stable the boot remains 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.590
 sufficiently armed when we think 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.940
 the string therefore only to the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.340
 admits and the inner foam are 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.470
 enough to assemble the boot the key 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.360
 still in the sole has the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.130
 gradual stability frame which is this 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.110
 kind of spine that goes to 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.510
 allow the boots to spread and you 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.250
 extend in the front area but that 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.500
 the zone of the foot bridge of the zone 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.270
 that can cause injuries always be 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.800
 controlled there is always a good support 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.739
 to torsions and in no time the 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.360
 Athlete's foot suffer during the game 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.590
 distribution of tacos then we 're going 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.050
 seeing already in the previous generations 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.720
 of evo power conical tacos in the area 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.540
 of the first support and elongated studs in the 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.160
 area of ​​the most stable area the one that we 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.440
 has to give traction when we run to 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.430
 more speed we make turns we make 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.150
 torn and braked 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.150
 good million 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.489
 the vacuum increases the armed that is good 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.980
 but the question is will also increase the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.670
 weight because that is not so good for 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.170
 check it 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.569
 what we do is bring us a demo 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.340
 power series with same 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.129
 technical characteristics of detail and 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.139
 others that the cure was yes but with the 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.909
 Unlike that has no foam 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.040
 internal so let's start the 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:00.299
 weighing let's remember the weight of the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.889
 puma series despite 199 grams 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.030
 and now by logic should increase it the 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.549
 key is that at the moment too 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.829
 so that the properties are not lost 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.650
 so of 199 grams let's move on to 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.810
 226 grams I think it's a moment of 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.669
 pretty logical weight 26 grams are 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.380
 practically imperceptible at the time 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.359
 of soccer nauta however the 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.440
 Difference of armed with the boot on 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.970
 in the foot for those who like to 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.770
 other armed yes that is very different 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.030
 between the demo power series and the eba 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.030
 pure for mario balotelli 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.980
 the player of the liverpool mario balotelli 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.630
 it's an icon for some it's a 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.510
 transgressor for others but what is 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.440
 clear is that pumas known to be one of 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.510
 your elite athletes is your second boot 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.490
 special your second generation of boots 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.550
 specials and we loved it 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.650
 yes I liked puma evo power me too 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.630
 He noticed that the lack of armed 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.670
 koné vaccines and we have a boot 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.350
 foam we can really say that 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.350
 It is very armed and that enhances the blows
