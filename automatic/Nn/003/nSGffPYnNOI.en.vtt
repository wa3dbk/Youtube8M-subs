00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
shouldn't miss them but it was the

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
that I had to overcome everything was

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.710 
that I had to overcome everything was
something<00:01:28.549> that<00:01:28.700> was<00:01:28.819> that<00:01:28.939> I<00:01:29.060> had<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.420> do<00:01:29.569> to

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
something that was that I had to do to

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.990 
something that was that I had to do to
become<00:01:29.899> a<00:01:30.049> better<00:01:30.110> tennis<00:01:30.530> player<00:01:30.819> and<00:01:31.819> I

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
become a better tennis player and I

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.639 
become a better tennis player and I
think<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:32.329> takes<00:01:32.569> just<00:01:32.899> a<00:01:32.990> lot<00:01:33.170> of<00:01:33.259> hard<00:01:33.439> work

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
think it takes just a lot of hard work

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.219 
think it takes just a lot of hard work
and<00:01:33.890> determination<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:34.850> also<00:01:35.509> right

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
and determination and also right

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.469 
and determination and also right
coaching<00:01:36.770> I<00:01:37.039> really<00:01:37.759> don't<00:01:37.909> think<00:01:38.090> about

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
coaching I really don't think about
