00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.670
 distribution of points in the reyno of navarra 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.340
 between osasuna and betis the day that the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.379
 picture 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.760
 pamplonica honored patxi dagger that 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.710
 managed to reach the number of 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.169
 four hundred sixty-four matches 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.140
 and therefore surpass the brand of 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:27.349
 echeverria that I had been with for many years 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.360
 that brand of more matches defending the 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.610
 zamarra rojilla could not osasuna 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.290
 Honor your captain because he does not 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.670
 got the victory and actually started 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.930
 very bad the match for the whole 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.949
 navarro with this first occasion of 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.219
 Jorge Molina 2 minutes into the match 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.950
 in which we could not see beñat absent 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.260
 by sanction absence very remarkable by 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.289
 course in a betis that came out more and 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.329
 better this is the second time in so 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.910
 only nine minutes that of molina in 2 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.850
 the one of paula or in the 9 closing of head 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.610
 that goes to the left of the goal 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.530
 by andrés fernández took a lot osasuna 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.740
 in shooting at the goal 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.020
 of the betis and this is the controversial play 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.270
 of the canceled goal game 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.789
 rubén castro for possible offside 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.390
 it is not too clear in the images 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.969
 because it seems that it is at the limit of that 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.530
 regulatory situation could be a 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.880
 little forward a little to 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.009
 back but everything very justito the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.679
 out of play that did end up whistling the 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.390
 match referee velasco carballo 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:37.329
 osasuna found as usual 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.179
 in the speed of cejudo and lamah his 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.829
 best weapons this is the best occasion or 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.690
 rather, the first great occasion of 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.820
 match for the Navarre team 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.100
 they starred could hung and the most 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.670
 finishing on the 23rd of the first period 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.110
 Alvaro cañito and the center 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.120
 second stick ends it to the outer net 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.310
 the lama cock 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.090
 in fact osasuna as we said slow 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.470
 very much in shooting at goal and this 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.140
 It would be the second big opportunity 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.340
 first period for the whole Navarre 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.979
 is 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.150
 armenteros the one who ends up sending the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.930
 ball 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.930
 outside though 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.290
 play a betis player and finish the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.260
 play on corner draw at 0 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.480
 after the first 45 minutes domain of 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.700
 osasuna in the second half but a 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.989
 domain with very little stuck with very 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.520
 little arrival although he loves in the 23rd 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.570
 get 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.570
 shoot with the rope 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.300
 and be the protagonist of the first occasion 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.690
 of the second half took the match 23 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.360
 minutes in seeing a first conatus of 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.250
 dangerous attack and he starred as 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.440
 the response we said yes of 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.030
 Betis was in fact in fact ten 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.400
 minutes later very clear 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.230
 opportunity for the Betic team as 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.730
 the one of molina in the canopy hand in hand with 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.000
 the goalkeeper 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.799
 andrés now the hand at the hands of rubén 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.290
 castro that sends the ball very badly to 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:13.019
