00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
to put together it's just already

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.420 
to put together it's just already
blended<00:04:00.510> for<00:04:00.900> me<00:04:00.990> I<00:04:01.050> don't<00:04:01.230> have<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.680> couple

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
blended for me I don't have to couple

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.550 
blended for me I don't have to couple
grams<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:02.940> Himalayan<00:04:03.420> pink<00:04:03.630> salt<00:04:03.750> because

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
grams of Himalayan pink salt because

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.800 
grams of Himalayan pink salt because
salt<00:04:04.740> is<00:04:05.130> down<00:04:05.370> there<00:04:05.580> on<00:04:05.880> them<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.360> I<00:04:06.540> think

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
salt is down there on them and I think

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.530 
salt is down there on them and I think
it<00:04:06.930> just<00:04:06.960> needs<00:04:07.350> that<00:04:07.650> salt<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:09.180> make<00:04:09.390> this

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
it just needs that salt to make this

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.600 
it just needs that salt to make this
happen<00:04:09.780> isn't<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.260> pretty<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:11.340> would<00:04:11.490> be

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
happen isn't that pretty this would be

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.110
