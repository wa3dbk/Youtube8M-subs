00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
there so this might use a little quite a

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.500 
there so this might use a little quite a
bit<00:02:41.719> of<00:02:41.810> gas<00:02:42.549> obviously<00:02:43.549> as<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.819> said<00:02:43.879> last

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
bit of gas obviously as I said last

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.209
