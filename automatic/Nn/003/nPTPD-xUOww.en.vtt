00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.390
 and then it's time for the first attempt 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.100
 last preparations on the take-off table and one last 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.349
 skeptical look 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.349
 so it should start 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.509
 Bob Bowman is more logical for Linux and pop culture 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.509
 but the requirements for Wulff 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.300
 the tires are turning 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.910
 the car breaks out 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.740
 the brakes rest 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.100
 Not even half of the track has the Quattro managed what is it 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.000
 problem 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.340
 Citizens need 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.250
 next to the supply again 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.250
 the winner of the radio station jump the providers so accurately 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.220
 that she choked on asking what the Fuck for Forest 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.830
 So shoveling snow on the hill 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.630
 so that the tires do not penetrate 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.630
 with the second attempt 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.360
 but this time is already shortly after the shelling 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.100
 despite four-wheel drive, the car can not keep on the snowy slope 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.820
 that's why we're switching to other Spycher ranges 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.370
 Nail angel seven millimeters 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.820
 if it does not work then not at all 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 the last try 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.510
 once again all cameras are positioned and the helicopter 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.850
 goes up in the air to capture the crucial moment 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 the seconds before the start 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.299
 this time it was packed 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.930
 80 percent gradient 48 vertical meters are 19 years after the first drive stops 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.349
 another car is the ski jumping hill of Kite Runner 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.359
 Enthusiasm for those who love this 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.359
 made possible 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.189
 for Athens 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.189
 In practice, every year on 3 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:48.429
 looking for a chance, the Audi has made it completely of its own accord 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.389
 how will he come down again? 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:58.469
 Now the car must still be on the hook a winch sure the 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.489
 Drive back to the take-off because it would simply drive backwards 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.489
 certainly not a good idea 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.879
 The speaker once felt this sense of skew and attractive 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.190
 Growth would put them in spite of this tax 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.070
 So if you want to drive as well as it does for you as a driver 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.270
 the particular problem on the hill has been
