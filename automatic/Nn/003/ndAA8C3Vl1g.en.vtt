00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.170
 me children when I propose you 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.580
 it's just us 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.369
 today I propose to you 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.980
 present the mini kids from chez parrot 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.199
 this is the little device there 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.140
 while you finally plug that you 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.630
 put on your sun visor with the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.480
 little clip that you have here and there you 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.940
 have a cable so in fact 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.640
 mini usb so in fact that is connected 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.570
 directly here so we passed it 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.680
 in the joint 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.360
 of the door is in fact to whom it is 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.430
 pass under it and so it happens 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.650
 directly on cigar lumines then 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.379
 why up there it was down to black 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.400
 is there so it's actually white that's 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.670
 because in the meantime we put there 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.559
 will have usb lanyard this is so this little 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.050
 device is super nice it's a 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.550
 hands free kit for the whole 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.380
 so when you get back in the car 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.960
 directly so actually hop 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.880
 it detects your presence and it comes out of 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.140
 the day before 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.649
 so it actually connects your your 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.710
 phone 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.570
 the big advantage also is that in fact 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.430
 the directory snaps directly 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.110
 this is your phone for example that 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.670
 you have there finally you put it 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.500
 elsewhere where you want and so 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.020
 directly so in fact it to your 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.479
 directory and after in speech synthesis 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.300
 you can call in the person that 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.670
 you want here you have the wheel 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.340
 so in fact to adjust the volume or 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.490
 others there the speaker and there the microphone 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.140
 that capture your voice then the synthesis 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.759
 voice is when you call 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.090
 voice recognition when you call 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.619
 someone 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.720
 and when someone calls you too 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.540
 so it comes in so it says so 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.890
 the person then he rings and he indicates 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.790
 that the person who calls you then to 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.320
 do a test so the age and the phone 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.600
 from home because I'm next 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.130
 and so I will call myself on the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.540
 cell phone that is here ch and 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.540
 you will see what it gives 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.709
 I was called 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.530
 that's it, then you're going to have the 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.900
 phone that is right next 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:37.010
 ap wyeth 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.010
 so that's rejected 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:50.489
 rejected so here is in fact you 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.650
 so see the speech synthesis we have 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.530
 heard so in fact do not quote me cap 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.349
 peeled is automatically so it's actually 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.569
 sounds it tells me keith and capel and in 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.510
 the more he asks you accepted or rejected 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.780
 so in fact if you want to accepted 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.370
 the call or reject it then is for 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.090
 call it's the same you press if my 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:23.069
 memories are good 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:25.379
 here julie is still calling this is good 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.739
 it was jimmy so actually because 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.959
 that's it but see it's relatively 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.060
 friendly kids it works when 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.370
 even relatively well this is the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.940
 mark parrot as you can see and 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.480
 it's the parrot minikit is everything 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.299
 to speech synthesis the ai if you have a 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.720
 wheel so in fact to adjust the 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.299
 volume 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.370
 this is so in fact to win in 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.420
 pressing there and he hung up in 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.370
 supporting them that's all there is and 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.230
 there you have the speaker 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.359
 that's all there is and therefore in fact 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.239
 here the trick for who to load 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.799
 Well, I put it squarely 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.970
 so he is constantly loading 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.510
 benefit him I know how he is 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.060
 always operational here are the children 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.340
 it's parrot who does that and I 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.139
 find it very nice so the price 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.680
 low therefore there are specials on time 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:23.250
 current at sir green light for 47 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:25.500
 euros 90 so in fact on the 2.59 I 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.599
 believe 90 this is a good product it 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.530
 is delivered so you have here the same here 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:33.900
 so with the cayla and a cord 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.750
 usb which in my opinion is long but not 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.880
 slow enough so for and with the lit 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.400
 cigar so usb that's here this is it 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.550
 it's really a good product months 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.550
 children
