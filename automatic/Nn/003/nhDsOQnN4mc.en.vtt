00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.570
 Magomed Ozdoev 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.760
 named so-called Do nickname 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.949
 which you may not really like 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.619
 there were all there for making fun guys 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.599

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.950

 team ruby how do you smile in Kazan 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.920
 How do you like our city, I think that it is not 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.480
 falling in love is impossible but if not from the first 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.879
 time yes from the second just yes already not even 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.480
 noticed how nearly a year has passed such from 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.219
 Kazan to the city â€‹â€‹is very beautiful 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.460
 changed in the time I was here 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.480
 the last time there was a recent radio 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.270
 two years ago 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.550
 and so that at least they could see it 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.810
 it was three four years ago I was very 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.960
 Does this then with the then see Kazan 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.909
 especially the roads we went to the game yah 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.530
 because in the bass you don't notice it 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.780
 in total, and we went to the game so much iambol and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.090
 and I sat but always sat with the locomotive 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.299
 next to guillermo guillermo says friend 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.750
 This Kazan is a serious game for the sake of 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.229
 downtown you are going well over 100 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.680
 flew in to sign a contract very 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.270
 I was very surprised I did not see such 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.399
 on scale and such a beautiful city 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.790
 but after moscow and peter question from 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.619
 your last interview, I realized that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.100
 you sighed with such relief when 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.140
 passed problems with conviction as well 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.990
 say relieved my heart is empty of you 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.170
 dead man in that I can 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.280
 progress and work and not 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.320
 distracted by some different others 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.420
 moments but you are generally pretty 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.009
 sincere man here judging by those 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.729
 the interview that I have already managed 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.280
 read 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.340
 never say bad behind your back and 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.019
 how much shit you don't do and always 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.880
 rotate here you yourself think so 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.860
 quality makes you stronger or is it 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.040
 can be interpreted as yours 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.220
 weak character I was brought up like that and 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.850
 There are moments in life that need 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.380
 I can not pass through it 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.510
 This is especially found in football when 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.340
 you need to be this or heating life on 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.010
 I think my biggest mistake is 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.630
 that I don't care about people or whatever 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.239
 Gennady always say what I think 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.290
 how do you see your future as 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.109
 sports so 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.980
 personal life I want to be a world champion 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.110
 Europe 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.900
 become 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.050
 I would not give gold to a champion in Russia 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.820
 made a ruby I put such before 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.710
 a task and everything else if you 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.560
 you will achieve such here everything else 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.120
 will always be near to family 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.660
 life of course is beautiful 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.370
 family life as well as everyone else 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.920
 you want to be the champion of europe 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.910
 there was clarity in the interview because from 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.550
 their stated that 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.200
 shave your head on if the national team 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.350
 Russian football will not work 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.959
 Europe to hold back and the words of this group 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.680
 now I certainly understand that you 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.350

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.270
