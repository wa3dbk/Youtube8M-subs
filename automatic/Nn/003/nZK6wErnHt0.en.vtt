00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
think our games will complement each

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.060 
think our games will complement each
other<00:00:20.400> well<00:00:20.539> I'm<00:00:21.539> just<00:00:21.750> saying<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.800> could<00:00:22.920> take

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
