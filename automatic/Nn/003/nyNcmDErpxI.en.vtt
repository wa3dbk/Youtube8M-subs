a<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.710> bit<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.370> too<00:00:38.430> plus<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.059> was

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
a little bit I think so too plus it was

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.000 
a little bit I think so too plus it was
an<00:00:39.270> actual<00:00:39.510> real<00:00:39.629> control<00:00:39.899> droid<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.350> set<00:00:40.649> so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
to be kylo Ren's cross lightsaber well

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.450 
to be kylo Ren's cross lightsaber well
we're<00:00:57.539> assuming<00:00:57.809> but<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.440> likely<00:00:58.680> most

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
we're assuming but it's likely most

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.939 
we're assuming but it's likely most
likely<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.870> that's<00:01:00.989> pretty<00:01:01.140> exciting<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.800> I'm

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
likely so that's pretty exciting and I'm

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.950 
likely so that's pretty exciting and I'm
go<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.609> ones<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.149> pretty<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.690> really

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
go to ones that are pretty not really

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.500 
go to ones that are pretty not really
are<00:01:04.580> there's<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> main<00:01:06.180> villain

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
are there's going to be the main villain

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.690 
are there's going to be the main villain
mask<00:01:06.720> which<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.080> kylo<00:01:07.409> Ren<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.920> also<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> Darth

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.020 
yeah yeah which is a pretty you know me
a<00:01:12.900> thing<00:01:13.170> well<00:01:14.010> yeah<00:01:14.220> well<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.549> ties<00:01:14.790> into

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
a thing well yeah well that ties into

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.880 
a thing well yeah well that ties into
there's<00:01:15.450> already<00:01:15.600> concept<00:01:16.229> art<00:01:16.409> showing<00:01:16.710> that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
there's already concept art showing that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.249 
there's already concept art showing that
Darth<00:01:17.100> Vader's<00:01:17.460> mask<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:18.180> seems<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.200> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
Darth Vader's mask is seems like a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.010 
Darth Vader's mask is seems like a
pretty<00:01:19.439> important<00:01:19.979> part<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> plot<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.659> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
pretty important part of the plot so I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.749 
pretty important part of the plot so I
think<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.619> further<00:01:23.009> confirms<00:01:23.640> that

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
think this just further confirms that

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.179 
think this just further confirms that
and<00:01:24.119> talking<00:01:24.390> about<00:01:24.689> kylo<00:01:25.380> Ren's<00:01:25.619> mask<00:01:25.920> or

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and talking about kylo Ren's mask or

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.319 
and talking about kylo Ren's mask or
lead<00:01:26.490> villain<00:01:26.759> mask<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.119> now

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
lead villain mask so like right now

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.120 
lead villain mask so like right now
they're<00:01:30.540> trying<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.869> keep<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.710> don't<00:01:31.829> show
