00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
of those films like the non any web

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.150 
of those films like the non any web
article<00:00:35.329> says<00:00:35.510> it<00:00:35.719> could<00:00:35.899> seems<00:00:36.890> like<00:00:37.040> it

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
article says it could seems like it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.500 
article says it could seems like it
would<00:00:37.250> kind<00:00:37.309> of<00:00:37.489> lend<00:00:37.730> itself<00:00:38.030> pretty<00:00:38.300> nicely

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
would kind of lend itself pretty nicely

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.440 
would kind of lend itself pretty nicely
to<00:00:38.750> 3d<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:39.710> this<00:00:40.460> is<00:00:40.579> something<00:00:40.969> that<00:00:41.149> has

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
to 3d and this is something that has

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
been discussed in the form a little bit

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.090 
been discussed in the form a little bit
the<00:00:43.280> past<00:00:43.489> several<00:00:43.730> months<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.210> know<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:44.510> a

the past several months you know the a

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.930 
the past several months you know the a
possibility<00:00:46.100> this<00:00:46.219> is<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:46.430> first<00:00:46.640> like

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
possibility this is the first like

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.940 
possibility this is the first like
something<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.410> first<00:00:48.590> time<00:00:48.710> we've<00:00:48.829> seen

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
something the first time we've seen

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.260 
something the first time we've seen
anything<00:00:49.250> on<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.430> front<00:00:49.640> page<00:00:49.850> basically

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
anything on the front page basically

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.170 
anything on the front page basically
suggesting<00:00:50.840> this<00:00:51.020> and<00:00:51.730> but<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.879> general

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
suggesting this and but the general

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.360 
suggesting this and but the general
reaction<00:00:53.329> obviously<00:00:54.079> is<00:00:54.199> extremely<00:00:54.949> negative

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
reaction obviously is extremely negative

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.619 
reaction obviously is extremely negative

is<00:01:51.020> about<00:01:51.170> um<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:52.880> guess<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.750> concern<00:01:55.390> for<00:01:56.390> some

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
is about um I guess the concern for some

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.420 
is about um I guess the concern for some
people<00:01:56.899> is<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.350> I'm<00:01:57.710> just<00:01:58.040> trying<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.280> figure

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
people is that I'm just trying to figure

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.130 
people is that I'm just trying to figure
out<00:01:58.520> how<00:01:58.729> is<00:01:58.939> this<00:01:59.030> going<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.270> affect<00:01:59.329> the<00:01:59.869> film

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
out how is this going to affect the film

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.920 
out how is this going to affect the film
if<00:02:00.409> you<00:02:01.159> see<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.340> in<00:02:01.490> 2d<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.820> maybe<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.450> way

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
if you see it in 2d and maybe the way

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.840 
if you see it in 2d and maybe the way
the<00:02:03.170> shots<00:02:03.649> will<00:02:03.829> be<00:02:03.860> framed<00:02:04.280> in<00:02:04.430> some<00:02:04.640> cases

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
the shots will be framed in some cases

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.959 
the shots will be framed in some cases
will<00:02:05.840> be<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:06.320> sort<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.680> utilize<00:02:07.009> 3d<00:02:07.549> as<00:02:07.700> much<00:02:07.850> as

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
will be to sort of utilize 3d as much as

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.999 
will be to sort of utilize 3d as much as
possible<00:02:08.119> like<00:02:08.840> you'll<00:02:09.319> frame<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.770> in<00:02:09.800> such<00:02:09.979> a

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
possible like you'll frame it in such a

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.500 
possible like you'll frame it in such a
way<00:02:10.099> that<00:02:10.220> maybe<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:10.700> wouldn't<00:02:11.090> do<00:02:11.209> it<00:02:11.330> that

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
way that maybe you wouldn't do it that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.320 
way that maybe you wouldn't do it that
way<00:02:11.720> if<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.620> were<00:02:12.770> just<00:02:13.040> doing<00:02:13.190> 2d

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
way if you were just doing 2d

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.850 
way if you were just doing 2d
and<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.750> might<00:02:14.960> be<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.170> occasional<00:02:15.560> gimmick

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
and it might be the occasional gimmick

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.350 
and it might be the occasional gimmick
like<00:02:15.920> let's<00:02:16.310> have<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.610> water<00:02:16.790> fly<00:02:17.180> at<00:02:17.330> the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
like let's have the water fly at the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.270 
like let's have the water fly at the
screen<00:02:17.720> because<00:02:17.990> it'll<00:02:18.200> be<00:02:18.260> like<00:02:18.620> 3d<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.160> know

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
screen because it'll be like 3d you know

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.160 
screen because it'll be like 3d you know
let's<00:02:19.490> have<00:02:19.640> do<00:02:19.850> this<00:02:20.060> stuff<00:02:20.240> you<00:02:20.840> know<00:02:20.990> there

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
let's have do this stuff you know there

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.330 
let's have do this stuff you know there
might<00:02:21.230> be<00:02:21.290> some<00:02:21.500> things<00:02:21.680> like<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:21.890> but

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
might be some things like that but

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.830 
might be some things like that but
overall<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.090> don't<00:02:23.330> think<00:02:23.450> there's<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:23.630> huge

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
overall I don't think there's a huge

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.860 
overall I don't think there's a huge
need<00:02:23.960> for<00:02:24.290> concern<00:02:25.270> there's<00:02:26.270> one<00:02:26.480> concern<00:02:26.810> I

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
need for concern there's one concern I

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.600 
need for concern there's one concern I
can't<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.830> kind<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.040> understand<00:02:28.460> that<00:02:28.550> I'll

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
can't I can kind of understand that I'll

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.400 
can't I can kind of understand that I'll

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
think the concern was voiced that I

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.280 
think the concern was voiced that I
think<00:04:02.150> she's<00:04:02.269> from<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.630> marketing<00:04:03.080> perspective

3d<00:04:10.820> you<00:04:11.180> know<00:04:11.269> I<00:04:11.299> can<00:04:11.570> kind<00:04:11.750> of<00:04:11.810> understand

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
3d you know I can kind of understand

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.330 
3d you know I can kind of understand
what<00:04:12.380> I<00:04:12.470> would<00:04:12.590> just<00:04:12.709> kind<00:04:12.769> of<00:04:12.860> make<00:04:12.980> me<00:04:13.070> cringe

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
what I would just kind of make me cringe

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.610 
what I would just kind of make me cringe
so<00:04:14.299> I<00:04:14.330> guess<00:04:14.450> from<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.810> perspective<00:04:15.170> I<00:04:15.470> can

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
so I guess from that perspective I can

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.990 
so I guess from that perspective I can
understand<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.130> concern<00:04:16.430> here<00:04:16.640> but<00:04:16.790> as<00:04:16.880> far

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
understand the concern here but as far

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.460 
understand the concern here but as far
as<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.239> movie<00:04:17.450> itself<00:04:17.570> I'm<00:04:18.049> really<00:04:18.320> not

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
as the movie itself I'm really not

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.550 
as the movie itself I'm really not
concerned<00:04:18.680> at<00:04:19.100> all<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:20.390> big<00:04:20.780> question<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.530> I

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
concerned at all the big question that I

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.409 
concerned at all the big question that I
think<00:04:21.979> if<00:04:22.430> this<00:04:22.760> turns<00:04:22.940> out<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.180> be<00:04:23.300> true

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
think if this turns out to be true

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.210 
think if this turns out to be true
turned<00:04:24.229> out<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.410> be<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.500> case<00:04:24.590> that<00:04:25.010> I<00:04:25.070> think

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
turned out to be the case that I think

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.980 
turned out to be the case that I think
narni<00:04:25.460> fans<00:04:25.640> will<00:04:25.910> be<00:04:25.940> debating<00:04:26.300> right<00:04:26.870> up

until the movie's release

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
is what version do you see first I mean

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.610 
is what version do you see first I mean
unless<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.360> movie<00:04:32.600> completely<00:04:32.960> sucks<00:04:33.350> I'm

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
going to see it multiple times I saw a

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.120 
going to see it multiple times I saw a
wardrobe<00:04:35.960> seven<00:04:36.290> times<00:04:36.470> I<00:04:36.710> saw<00:04:36.890> prince

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.660 
wardrobe seven times I saw prince
caspian<00:04:37.520> five<00:04:37.730> times<00:04:38.800> so<00:04:39.800> I'll<00:04:40.190> see<00:04:40.490> both

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
caspian five times so I'll see both

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.960 
caspian five times so I'll see both
versions<00:04:40.940> almost<00:04:41.720> certainly<00:04:42.580> so<00:04:43.580> the

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.750 
much thought but I would think that I
would<00:04:56.600> go<00:04:56.840> see<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.170> 3d<00:04:57.410> version<00:04:57.680> first<00:04:58.130> just

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
would go see the 3d version first just

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.660 
would go see the 3d version first just
because<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.650> would<00:05:00.650> think<00:05:00.890> that<00:05:01.190> if<00:05:01.550> you're

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
because I would think that if you're

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.770 
because I would think that if you're
shooting<00:05:01.820> a<00:05:02.000> movie<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.360> you<00:05:02.420> know<00:05:02.510> it's<00:05:02.660> going

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
shooting a movie and you know it's going

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.140 
shooting a movie and you know it's going
to<00:05:02.840> be<00:05:02.900> in<00:05:03.020> 3d<00:05:03.230> you<00:05:03.530> would<00:05:03.770> shoot<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.190> with<00:05:05.000> the

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
to be in 3d you would shoot it with the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.450 
to be in 3d you would shoot it with the
assumption<00:05:05.450> that<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.960> 3d<00:05:06.320> movie<00:05:06.710> is<00:05:06.920> the<00:05:07.220> real

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
assumption that the 3d movie is the real

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.790 
assumption that the 3d movie is the real
movie<00:05:07.940> and<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.480> 2d<00:05:08.840> movies<00:05:08.960> kind<00:05:09.320> of<00:05:09.500> the

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
movie and the 2d movies kind of the

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.550 
movie and the 2d movies kind of the
other<00:05:10.010> version<00:05:10.280> basically<00:05:11.260> it'll<00:05:12.260> be<00:05:12.380> cool

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
other version basically it'll be cool

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.990 
other version basically it'll be cool
when<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.770> blu-ray<00:05:13.040> comes<00:05:13.280> out<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.670> you<00:05:13.850> can

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
when the blu-ray comes out and you can

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.360 
when the blu-ray comes out and you can
choose<00:05:14.360> between<00:05:14.390> the<00:05:15.140> 3d<00:05:15.500> if<00:05:15.680> if<00:05:15.860> this<00:05:16.040> is<00:05:16.190> true

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
choose between the 3d if if this is true

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.040 
choose between the 3d if if this is true
everything<00:05:16.730> 2d<00:05:17.180> or<00:05:17.300> 3d<00:05:17.360> that'll<00:05:17.780> be<00:05:17.840> kind<00:05:18.020> of

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
everything 2d or 3d that'll be kind of

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.020 
everything 2d or 3d that'll be kind of
fun<00:05:18.260> I<00:05:18.470> think<00:05:19.100> to<00:05:19.220> look<00:05:19.430> at<00:05:19.550> it<00:05:19.670> both<00:05:19.760> ways<00:05:19.970> and

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
fun I think to look at it both ways and

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.910 
fun I think to look at it both ways and
I've<00:05:20.270> never<00:05:20.420> seen<00:05:20.630> a<00:05:20.690> 3d<00:05:20.870> blu-ray<00:05:21.380> yet<00:05:21.410> so<00:05:21.770> that

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
I've never seen a 3d blu-ray yet so that

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.730 
I've never seen a 3d blu-ray yet so that
mean<00:05:22.040> eat<00:05:22.510> but<00:05:23.510> so<00:05:23.810> that'll<00:05:24.230> be<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.470> dilemma

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
mean eat but so that'll be the dilemma

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.350 
mean eat but so that'll be the dilemma
that<00:05:24.980> every<00:05:25.310> narni<00:05:25.580> fans<00:05:25.790> going<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.120> have<00:05:26.210> to

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
that every narni fans going to have to

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.030 
that every narni fans going to have to
face<00:05:26.540> if<00:05:26.810> this<00:05:27.050> turns<00:05:27.230> out<00:05:27.380> to<00:05:27.440> be<00:05:27.560> true<00:05:27.770> which

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
face if this turns out to be true which

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.500 
face if this turns out to be true which
version<00:05:28.370> do<00:05:28.430> you<00:05:28.460> see<00:05:28.640> first<00:05:28.910> and<00:05:29.210> right<00:05:29.330> now

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
version do you see first and right now

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.450 
version do you see first and right now
I'm<00:05:29.690> thinking<00:05:29.870> I'd<00:05:30.140> probably<00:05:30.320> go<00:05:30.710> with<00:05:30.860> 3d<00:05:31.220> and

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
I'm thinking I'd probably go with 3d and

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.910 
I'm thinking I'd probably go with 3d and
then<00:05:32.060> I<00:05:32.090> then<00:05:32.390> I<00:05:32.540> a<00:05:32.870> few<00:05:33.350> days<00:05:33.470> later<00:05:33.650> i<00:05:33.740> come

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
then I then I a few days later i come

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.220 
then I then I a few days later i come
back<00:05:33.980> and<00:05:34.160> go<00:05:34.400> see<00:05:34.610> it<00:05:34.700> again<00:05:34.760> in<00:05:35.060> 2d<00:05:35.360> then<00:05:36.110> I'd

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
back and go see it again in 2d then I'd

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.690 
back and go see it again in 2d then I'd
yield<00:05:36.320> write<00:05:36.590> a<00:05:36.620> review<00:05:36.860> of<00:05:36.950> it<00:05:37.130> which<00:05:37.460> one<00:05:37.640> I

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
yield write a review of it which one I

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.180 
yield write a review of it which one I
like<00:05:37.850> better<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.380> if<00:05:39.380> 3d<00:05:39.710> really<00:05:39.950> adds

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
like better and if 3d really adds

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.800 
like better and if 3d really adds
something<00:05:40.460> and<00:05:40.760> I<00:05:40.850> don't<00:05:41.000> know<00:05:41.060> I<00:05:41.120> can<00:05:41.570> really

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
something and I don't know I can really

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.150 
something and I don't know I can really
just<00:05:42.050> I<00:05:42.230> get<00:05:42.440> things<00:05:42.650> just<00:05:42.740> cuz<00:05:42.980> of<00:05:43.100> my

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
just I get things just cuz of my

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.470 
just I get things just cuz of my
experience<00:05:43.610> with<00:05:43.700> Beowulf<00:05:43.880> and<00:05:44.180> I<00:05:44.270> didn't

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
experience with Beowulf and I didn't

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.300 
experience with Beowulf and I didn't
think<00:05:44.540> bailiff<00:05:44.870> was<00:05:44.990> a<00:05:45.050> great<00:05:45.200> movie<00:05:45.470> I<00:05:45.620> really

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
think bailiff was a great movie I really

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.110 
think bailiff was a great movie I really
didn't<00:05:46.580> but<00:05:46.820> um<00:05:47.030> I<00:05:47.770> can't<00:05:48.770> see<00:05:49.010> I<00:05:49.310> do<00:05:49.790> think<00:05:50.060> the

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
didn't but um I can't see I do think the

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.930 
didn't but um I can't see I do think the
3d<00:05:50.420> kind<00:05:50.630> of<00:05:50.750> added<00:05:51.050> a<00:05:51.110> lot<00:05:51.260> to<00:05:51.320> it<00:05:51.770> added<00:05:52.760> a<00:05:52.850> lot

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
3d kind of added a lot to it added a lot

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.070 
3d kind of added a lot to it added a lot
to<00:05:53.000> that<00:05:53.270> sort<00:05:53.540> of<00:05:53.630> fun<00:05:53.840> mythical<00:05:54.500> feel<00:05:55.460> and<00:05:56.080> I

can see dawn treader you know really

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.090 
can see dawn treader you know really
benefiting<00:05:59.870> from<00:05:59.960> this<00:06:00.170> sort<00:06:00.530> of<00:06:00.590> also<00:06:00.830> the

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
benefiting from this sort of also the

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.980 
benefiting from this sort of also the
huge<00:06:01.340> variety<00:06:01.520> of<00:06:01.760> locations<00:06:02.090> and<00:06:02.540> characters

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
huge variety of locations and characters

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.730 
huge variety of locations and characters
and<00:06:03.350> stuff<00:06:03.530> I<00:06:03.770> can<00:06:03.920> see<00:06:04.130> it<00:06:04.280> I<00:06:04.490> can<00:06:05.150> see<00:06:05.600> it<00:06:05.720> a<00:06:05.900> 3d

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
and stuff I can see it I can see it a 3d

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.200 
and stuff I can see it I can see it a 3d
being<00:06:06.950> a<00:06:07.100> benefit<00:06:07.520> and<00:06:07.670> making<00:06:07.910> it<00:06:07.970> a<00:06:08.060> better

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
being a benefit and making it a better

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.700 
being a benefit and making it a better
movie<00:06:08.420> and<00:06:08.630> adding<00:06:08.840> a<00:06:08.900> lot<00:06:09.020> to<00:06:09.200> it<00:06:09.350> possibly

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
movie and adding a lot to it possibly

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.010 
movie and adding a lot to it possibly
but<00:06:10.550> again<00:06:10.970> we<00:06:11.120> don't<00:06:11.300> know<00:06:11.450> if<00:06:11.570> this<00:06:11.660> is<00:06:11.720> if

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
but again we don't know if this is if

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.300 
but again we don't know if this is if
any<00:06:12.170> this<00:06:12.350> is<00:06:12.470> true<00:06:12.680> it's<00:06:12.860> basically<00:06:13.190> just

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
any this is true it's basically just

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.800 
any this is true it's basically just
speculation<00:06:13.880> now<00:06:14.120> because<00:06:14.330> we<00:06:14.450> know<00:06:14.540> Fox

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
speculation now because we know Fox

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.450 
speculation now because we know Fox
wants<00:06:15.200> to<00:06:15.290> make<00:06:15.440> you<00:06:15.710> know<00:06:15.830> looks<00:06:16.220> like<00:06:16.370> they

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
wants to make you know looks like they

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.800 
wants to make you know looks like they
really<00:06:16.580> want<00:06:16.790> to<00:06:16.850> push<00:06:16.970> the<00:06:17.030> whole<00:06:17.390> 3d<00:06:17.780> thing

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
really want to push the whole 3d thing

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.530 
really want to push the whole 3d thing
and<00:06:18.200> monsters<00:06:18.530> and<00:06:18.710> aliens<00:06:19.180> somehow<00:06:20.180> managed

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
and monsters and aliens somehow managed

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.500 
and monsters and aliens somehow managed
to<00:06:20.570> do<00:06:20.780> well<00:06:20.990> and<00:06:21.230> that's<00:06:21.830> 3d<00:06:22.310> but<00:06:22.910> again<00:06:23.000> you

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
to do well and that's 3d but again you

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.200 
to do well and that's 3d but again you
have<00:06:23.720> the<00:06:23.960> option<00:06:24.430> in<00:06:25.430> fact<00:06:25.610> most<00:06:25.850> of<00:06:25.910> the<00:06:26.000> time

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
have the option in fact most of the time

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.600 
have the option in fact most of the time
the<00:06:26.660> 2d<00:06:27.020> version<00:06:27.050> has<00:06:27.830> a<00:06:27.860> much<00:06:28.130> wider<00:06:28.370> release

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
the 2d version has a much wider release

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.480 
the 2d version has a much wider release
than<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.090> 3d<00:06:29.390> version<00:06:29.950> at<00:06:30.950> least<00:06:31.100> as<00:06:31.220> far<00:06:31.370> as

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
than the 3d version at least as far as

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.420 
than the 3d version at least as far as
I'm<00:06:31.610> aware<00:06:31.700> maybe<00:06:32.090> it's<00:06:32.330> different<00:06:32.450> now<00:06:32.720> but

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
I'm aware maybe it's different now but

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.010 
I'm aware maybe it's different now but
it's<00:06:34.430> like<00:06:34.630> like<00:06:35.630> the<00:06:35.720> way<00:06:35.810> it<00:06:35.900> was<00:06:35.960> for

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
it's like like the way it was for

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.530 
it's like like the way it was for
available<00:06:36.500> if<00:06:36.590> is<00:06:36.740> that<00:06:36.950> you<00:06:37.190> have<00:06:37.400> it<00:06:37.580> in<00:06:37.760> 2d

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
available if is that you have it in 2d

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.510 
available if is that you have it in 2d
like<00:06:39.050> at<00:06:39.260> a<00:06:39.290> theater<00:06:39.620> you've<00:06:39.770> got<00:06:39.890> almost<00:06:40.250> all

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
like at a theater you've got almost all

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.650 
like at a theater you've got almost all
the<00:06:40.700> screens<00:06:41.000> are<00:06:41.210> in<00:06:41.300> 2d

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
the screens are in 2d

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.690 
the screens are in 2d
like<00:06:41.930> one<00:06:42.080> or<00:06:42.200> two<00:06:42.230> that<00:06:42.440> are<00:06:42.530> in<00:06:42.590> 3d<00:06:42.920> so<00:06:43.670> I

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
like one or two that are in 3d so I

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.850 
like one or two that are in 3d so I
cannot<00:06:44.300> for<00:06:44.630> the<00:06:44.690> life<00:06:44.750> of<00:06:45.200> me<00:06:45.260> understand

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
cannot for the life of me understand

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.800 
cannot for the life of me understand
what<00:06:46.070> is<00:06:46.250> the<00:06:46.430> big<00:06:46.640> deal<00:06:46.670> if<00:06:47.090> it's<00:06:47.240> in<00:06:47.330> 3d<00:06:47.540> just

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
what is the big deal if it's in 3d just

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.140 
what is the big deal if it's in 3d just
go<00:06:47.990> see<00:06:48.200> it<00:06:48.290> in<00:06:48.380> 2d<00:06:48.550> so<00:06:49.550> I<00:06:49.580> don't<00:06:49.820> really<00:06:49.940> get

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
go see it in 2d so I don't really get

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.960 
go see it in 2d so I don't really get
that<00:06:50.620> but<00:06:51.620> I<00:06:51.830> guess<00:06:52.160> I<00:06:52.430> think<00:06:52.730> this<00:06:52.790> would<00:06:52.940> be

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
that but I guess I think this would be

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.800 
that but I guess I think this would be
interesting<00:06:53.480> um<00:06:54.430> yeah<00:06:55.430> I<00:06:55.760> guess<00:06:55.820> I<00:06:56.210> can<00:06:56.360> say<00:06:56.570> it

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
interesting um yeah I guess I can say it

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.120 
interesting um yeah I guess I can say it
doesn't<00:06:56.930> really<00:06:57.290> bother<00:06:57.380> me<00:06:57.620> either<00:06:57.830> way<00:06:57.950> but

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
doesn't really bother me either way but

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.610 
doesn't really bother me either way but
I<00:06:58.700> guess<00:06:59.300> it's<00:06:59.480> safe<00:06:59.600> to<00:06:59.660> say<00:06:59.780> that<00:06:59.990> I<00:07:00.290> hope

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
I guess it's safe to say that I hope

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.590 
I guess it's safe to say that I hope
it's<00:07:00.830> in<00:07:00.950> 3d<00:07:01.160> I<00:07:01.490> think<00:07:01.910> that<00:07:02.090> would<00:07:02.240> that<00:07:02.540> would

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
it's in 3d I think that would that would

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.300 
it's in 3d I think that would that would
be<00:07:02.780> cool<00:07:02.990> i<00:07:03.020> think<00:07:03.380> it<00:07:03.500> could<00:07:03.680> possibly<00:07:03.860> add<00:07:04.280> a

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
be cool i think it could possibly add a

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.370 
be cool i think it could possibly add a
lot<00:07:04.520> to<00:07:04.580> it<00:07:04.910> but<00:07:05.480> either<00:07:05.570> way<00:07:05.810> we<00:07:06.050> have<00:07:06.200> the

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
lot to it but either way we have the

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.740 
lot to it but either way we have the
option
