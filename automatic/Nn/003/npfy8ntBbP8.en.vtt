00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.370
 we have many followers for this 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.230
 music style and precisely not 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.059
 we take the audacity to invite a 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.040
 specialist of this musical area 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.270
 welcome to him is Uncle Sam comes from 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.450
 inside the country 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.860
 go sit goddess or 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.170
 then we talk a little bit with the 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.030
 experience at a musical level that you 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.770
 you consider Chinese and nacho have contributed 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.570
 for growth the good sounds 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.200
 very well the choice of 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.040
 instruments I think are very successful are 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.010
 some boys that 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.500
 which is seen to have been a vocal effort 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.360
 the vocalization sounds good the problem 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.020
 that I see him is the letters he does not have 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.300
 depth do not have message this 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.010
 because you do not explain a little action and 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.630
 a public file what are your 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.250
 study your preparation as for this 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:52.390
 end of this type of comments 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.430
 I do not know if we make a good effort 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.740
 well it's great because I have a 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.040
 felt our music the reggaeton 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.470
 people have good people think that 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.450
 just fight and dance here there's a lot 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.490
 poetry in attention to us and it's a 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.080
 fight for trains authenticity of 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.970
 we believe that it is not so 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.130
 successful the comment because it has 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.690
 listened to music to us true that 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.580
 us the change that we treat 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.870
 to make him is that the lyrics are prof 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.760
 who wants to imitate wisin and yandel 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.020
 but the most important thing here I think that 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.560
 is to maintain respect with our 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.560
 international guests 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.590
 the idea that is to evaluate they have been 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.110
 with don omar they are well seen but 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.239
 you asked me what was your goal and 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.459
 he was only with them the letters lack 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.140
 of depth are letters that do not leave 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.120
 messages 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.120
 it seems to bring you meringue 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.260
 for a second 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.520
 your musical perception problem 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.970
 we are not recording quiet 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.920
 if we have years working here 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.840
 and we have a lot that's your problem 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.840
 if you think it's disgusting but for 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.489
 forever 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.960

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.390
