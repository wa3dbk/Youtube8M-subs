00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 7 8 inches is the most perfect size 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.259
 tablet in such a tablet is sensitive 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.120
 less body and much less weight 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.550
 that in everyday use much 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.410
 more convenient than large tablets naturally 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.509
 they did not appear immediately all at first 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.279
 played with large tablets but now 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.320
 doing the same thing with tablets 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.060
 smaller ones do not know exactly how it 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.580
 It turned out on small tablets except 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.580
 Popularity got more and colloquial 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.230
 speakers and phone functionality 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.789
 bred such pieces a lot 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.820
 and today we look at this 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.600
 representative from prestigio multipad 4 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.440
 ultimate 80 3g with conversational speaker and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440
 very long title 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.250
 it would seem why you need such a big 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.129
 smartphone 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.140
 but no it's a tablet talking on a tablet 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.519
 badly spoil the reputation of even a hardened 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.289
 lovelace on hell with her 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.000
 cause and effect let's get about 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.490
 aluminum case looks like a tablet 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.899
 far better plastic is certainly not the most 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.790
 the best option in the winter outside 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.619
 but it is assembled well monolithic 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.009
 design issue completely unnecessary 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.720
 sounds 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.640
 Yes, and such a body looks much 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.170
 solid than plastic front panel 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.100
 completely covered with oleophobic glass 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.750
 coated 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.640
 the main part of the front panel is 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.259
 display about him a little later frame 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.970
 wide enough for comfortable 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.950
 use both horizontally and 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.509
 vertically above the display is not 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.399
 loudest speaker and speaker 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.960
 front camera while tablet 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.119
 covered with mirror edging that 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.319
 perfectly complements the design of the case behind it 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.750
 are all the main elements 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.460
 controls bottom left and empty 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.679
 on the right under the cap space for 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.810
 full-sized sims and micro sd cards and 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.640
 beside the volume rocker and 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.530
 microphone holes who put it there 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.420
 in it is not clear because even if you 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.610
 talk to the tablet then do in 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.000
 it's in the other direction ok let's continue 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.950
 top placed microusb 35 m jack and 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.869
 guessing the idea of ​​the same guy who 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.940
 place the microphone sawed button 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.979
 inclusions for me find it difficult and 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.750
 reach uncomfortable but it's garbage because 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.429
 The set has a magic pocket cover 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.429
 which turns the device on and off 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.140
 back part more 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.879
 aluminum plastic is deprived of top and under 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.680
 him a wireless antenna from 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.019
 interesting wall back big logo 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.330
 speaker window camera in black public and 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.489
 the reset button in the center is without 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.930
 comments just hello you yourself 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.940
 know who the display is now 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.010
 this is an 8 inch un with wide angles 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.200
 review and beautiful picture colors 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.599
 soft saturated watch pictures and videos 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.459
 for example on 2d sites is very cool 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.870
 sensory part also no complaints 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.470
 you can touch five at the same time 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.040
 fingers 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.659
 let down only 1024 resolution at 768 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.840
 last year would still be about the channel but 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:49.909
 user is now experienced and 165 now 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.920
 consider insufficient indicators and this 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.860
 subjective moment 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.540
 the case is all right and it weighs 448 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.550
 gram lack of button layout 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.440
 you can get used it is not scary just 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.760
 just a matter of time both cameras are frankly 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.040
 surprised frontal 2 megapixel 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.380
 can create quality group 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.670
 Duckface and also suitable for video chat 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.370
 only good lighting is needed 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.319
 8 megapixel main camera too 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.330
 it is desirable to have enough light then 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.069
 she will take a good shot depending 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.930
 from lighting and color transmission will be 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.489
 walking plus or minus but generally like 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.000
 for tablet cameras and and that's enough with 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.190
 head 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.019
 she also writes video at 30 frames in 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.239
 second is not the best result but rather 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.040
 not bad when such a device and because it 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.049
 absolutely not the most necessary thing 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.090
 tablet camera in such a device I 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.799
 I use no more than call from him but 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.630
 it is all the same good that such bonuses are 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.250
 but here's iron is important to have good 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.650
 after all, user experience should be 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.549
 cool earned android 4 2 1 here 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.860
 meets quad mediatek mt8389 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.730
 with a clock speed of 1 2 gigahertz one 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.890
 gigabyte of RAM and powervr sgx544mp 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.440
 the drive is enough for 16 gigabytes of 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.790
 which about 12 available to the user works 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.410
 everything is quite nice if you don't 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.510
 spoiled by very productive 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.370
 With devices, this one will not upset tass so 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.290
 Of course there will be no records but most 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.630
 users will be enough but dude 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.670
 not all are played though this device too 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.570
 will allow depending on the requirements 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.670
 games to iron 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.769
 with the interface there are hitch and Rybkina 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.049
 not often and not coupons working fine 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.970
 and heats not much live help from 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.039
 a couple of active days with a sim card and on 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.780
 a day or two more without her I have 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.020
 so the local battery ran out 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.640
 capacity of 4850 milliampere hour in total 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.060
 it turns out a good tablet looks like 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.260
 nice working fine and worth everything 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.000
 275 dollars is not so much that 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.650
 actually allows you to close your eyes on 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.900
 some flaws but the biggest 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.360
 device problem a little bit in another nexus 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.890
 7 average cost 10 bucks more but 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.820
 if you really need conversational 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.280
 3g speakers 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.320
 galaxy tab 3 is the most expensive 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.090
 50 and ultimately simple philistine 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.520
 rather look more toward 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.040
 well-known brand is a pity because prestige 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.540
 already very good and hello again 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.540
 do you know who 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.169
 but
