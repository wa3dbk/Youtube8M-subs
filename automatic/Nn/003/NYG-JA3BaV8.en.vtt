00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
what is it called I guess you just say

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.520 
what is it called I guess you just say
some<00:01:06.740> cards<00:01:07.270> along<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.450> side<00:01:08.659> of<00:01:08.690> it<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.229> when

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
some cards along the side of it so when

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.480 
some cards along the side of it so when
I<00:01:09.560> sprayed<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.040> wheel

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
I sprayed the wheel

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.430 
I sprayed the wheel
it<00:01:11.120> wouldn't<00:01:11.420> spray<00:01:11.930> on<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.110> tires<00:01:12.320> and

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
it wouldn't spray on the tires and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.690 
it wouldn't spray on the tires and
actually<00:01:12.710> went<00:01:12.830> on<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:12.979> inside<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:13.490> spray

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
actually went on the inside and spray

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.730 
actually went on the inside and spray
the<00:01:13.820> inside<00:01:14.090> as<00:01:14.210> well<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:15.260> actually<00:01:15.530> looks

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
the inside as well so it actually looks

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.719 
the inside as well so it actually looks
right<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.220> looks<00:01:16.430> good<00:01:16.670> but<00:01:18.460> let<00:01:19.460> me<00:01:19.549> get<00:01:19.670> you
