was<00:01:02.210> not<00:01:02.420> only<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:02.870> USB<00:01:03.170> 3.0<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.220> you're

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
was not only is it USB 3.0 so you're

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.340 
was not only is it USB 3.0 so you're
going<00:01:04.519> to<00:01:04.580> get<00:01:04.699> superfast<00:01:05.180> speeds<00:01:05.840> like<00:01:06.140> on

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
going to get superfast speeds like on

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.680 
going to get superfast speeds like on
the<00:01:06.530> icon<00:01:07.370> here<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:07.729> says<00:01:07.909> up<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.120> 10<00:01:08.420> times

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
the icon here it says up to 10 times

faster<00:01:09.430> n<00:01:10.430> supports<00:01:11.090> USB<00:01:11.540> 2.0<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:12.409> is

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
faster n supports USB 2.0 so it is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.910 
faster n supports USB 2.0 so it is
backwards<00:01:13.010> compatible<00:01:13.150> but<00:01:14.150> also<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:14.720> this

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
backwards compatible but also that this

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.880 
backwards compatible but also that this
enclosure<00:01:15.920> will<00:01:16.250> work<00:01:16.490> with<00:01:16.729> ide<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.450> SATA

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
enclosure will work with ide and SATA

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.580

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
hard drives now are SATA connectors but

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.710 
hard drives now are SATA connectors but
a<00:01:24.950> lot<00:01:25.190> of<00:01:25.220> people<00:01:25.549> may<00:01:25.909> still<00:01:26.210> be<00:01:26.330> running<00:01:26.479> the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
a lot of people may still be running the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.930 
a lot of people may still be running the
older<00:01:27.020> IDE<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.100> it's<00:01:28.250> nice<00:01:28.460> that<00:01:28.490> they<00:01:28.820> have
