interesting<00:01:29.780> now<00:01:30.140> he's<00:01:30.380> much<00:01:30.590> fitter<00:01:30.890> and

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
interesting now he's much fitter and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.950 
interesting now he's much fitter and
he's<00:01:31.130> much<00:01:31.310> stronger<00:01:31.640> he's<00:01:32.330> much<00:01:32.570> more<00:01:32.750> horse

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
he's much stronger he's much more horse

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.250 
he's much stronger he's much more horse
to<00:01:33.140> ride<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.070> he<00:01:34.940> was<00:01:35.090> more<00:01:35.390> difficult<00:01:35.600> than<00:01:35.960> to

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
to ride so he was more difficult than to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.200 
to ride so he was more difficult than to
get<00:01:36.650> a<00:01:36.680> clean<00:01:36.950> test<00:01:37.220> out<00:01:37.400> of<00:01:37.550> but<00:01:37.700> easier<00:01:38.030> to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
get a clean test out of but easier to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.330 
get a clean test out of but easier to
ride<00:01:38.390> now<00:01:39.020> he<00:01:39.080> knows<00:01:39.350> all<00:01:39.620> his<00:01:39.650> stuff<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.280> he

ride now he knows all his stuff and he

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.370 
ride now he knows all his stuff and he
is<00:01:40.580> strong<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.030> powerful<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:41.720> if<00:01:42.020> that

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
is strong and powerful so if that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.770 
is strong and powerful so if that

make choices about which one is the best

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.949 
make choices about which one is the best
at<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.920> time<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.730> know<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.120> think<00:03:24.240> those

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
at the time you know so I think those

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.449 
at the time you know so I think those
veterans<00:03:25.319> and<00:03:25.830> then<00:03:25.920> we<00:03:26.010> have<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.160> lot<00:03:26.430> of

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
veterans and then we have a lot of

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.760 
veterans and then we have a lot of
talent<00:03:26.940> coming<00:03:27.090> up<00:03:27.330> so<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:27.989> think<00:03:28.319> it's<00:03:28.620> going

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
talent coming up so I think it's going

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.380 
talent coming up so I think it's going
to<00:03:28.830> be<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.950> large<00:03:29.190> pool<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.730> larger<00:03:30.000> pool<00:03:30.120> than<00:03:30.300> we

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
to be a large pool a larger pool than we

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.900 
to be a large pool a larger pool than we
think<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.959> draw<00:03:31.140> from<00:03:31.380> certainly<00:03:31.890> in<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.670> next

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910
