the early 60s vandals destroyed the
place<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.670> they<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.150> shut<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.420> down<00:00:24.539> from

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
place and they just shut it down from

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.730 
place and they just shut it down from
that<00:00:24.869> point<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:26.180> look<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.359> found<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.209 

rundown<00:00:31.740> abandoned<00:00:32.579> man-powered<00:00:33.210> elevator

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.340 

as<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.309> can<00:00:38.460> see<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:38.879> missing<00:00:39.450> some<00:00:40.050> fixed

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
as you can see it's missing some fixed

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.830 
as you can see it's missing some fixed
decremented<00:00:40.890> planes<00:00:42.079> especially<00:00:43.079> there<00:00:44.840> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
decremented planes especially there and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.400 
decremented planes especially there and
I<00:00:45.989> got<00:00:46.140> some<00:00:46.700> sidewalk<00:00:47.700> here<00:00:48.860> I'm<00:00:51.410> I'm

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
I got some sidewalk here I'm I'm

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.240 
I got some sidewalk here I'm I'm
thinking<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:53.280> might<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.969> an<00:00:54.090> Otis<00:00:55.280> and

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
thinking this might be an Otis and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.490 
thinking this might be an Otis and
obviously<00:00:59.250> it's<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.420> such<00:01:00.660> bad<00:01:00.899> shape<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
obviously it's in such bad shape it

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.229 
obviously it's in such bad shape it
doesn't<00:01:01.680> really<00:01:01.980> work<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.670> we're<00:01:02.789> gonna<00:01:02.879> scale

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
doesn't really work so we're gonna scale

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.590 
doesn't really work so we're gonna scale
the<00:01:03.420> shaft<00:01:04.760> we're<00:01:05.760> gonna<00:01:05.850> go<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> fixed

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the shaft we're gonna go up the fixed

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.380 
the shaft we're gonna go up the fixed
incremented<00:01:07.080> planes<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.040> case<00:01:08.390> cuz

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
incremented planes or in this case cuz

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.260 
incremented planes or in this case cuz
it's<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.600> steep<00:01:10.340> we'll<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.520> go<00:01:11.640> around<00:01:11.760> some

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it's so steep we'll just go around some

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.840 
it's so steep we'll just go around some
of<00:01:12.299> them

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.440 

so<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.510> can<00:01:18.659> see<00:01:18.870> they<00:01:19.080> had<00:01:20.270> they<00:01:21.270> had<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
so you can see they had they had a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.000 
so you can see they had they had a
service<00:01:22.080> area<00:01:22.350> right<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:28.530> could<00:01:28.650> see

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
service area right here you could see

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.120 
service area right here you could see
where<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.940> you<00:01:30.619> could<00:01:31.619> see<00:01:31.650> where<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
where the you could see where the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.730 
where the you could see where the
original<00:01:32.340> guide<00:01:32.790> rail<00:01:33.090> was<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:40.320> was<00:01:40.470> built

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
original guide rail was this was built

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.400 
original guide rail was this was built
right<00:01:40.979> into<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.430> side<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> hill<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.410> it

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
right into the side of the hill and it

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.240 
right into the side of the hill and it
goes<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.630> goes<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:45.990> way<00:01:46.080> to<00:01:46.470> 6th

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
goes to and it goes all the way to 6th

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.570 
goes to and it goes all the way to 6th
Street<00:01:47.280> up<00:01:47.640> there<00:01:48.200> here's<00:01:49.200> another<00:01:49.580> here's

Street up there here's another here's
another<00:01:50.910> service<00:01:51.509> corridor

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.500 

there's<00:02:05.110> another<00:02:05.790> hint<00:02:06.790> of<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:07.030> guide<00:02:07.270> rail

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
there's another hint of a guide rail

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.490 
there's another hint of a guide rail
that<00:02:07.750> used<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.110> be<00:02:08.350> I<00:02:11.430> would<00:02:12.430> betting<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:13.500> would

commander plane that's actually pointing
downwards<00:02:22.870> as<00:02:23.140> we<00:02:23.440> head<00:02:23.620> towards<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:27.130> as

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
downwards as we head towards it and as

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.530 
downwards as we head towards it and as
we<00:02:27.430> make<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.760> turn<00:02:29.850> these<00:02:30.850> fixed<00:02:31.240> incremental

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
we make the turn these fixed incremental

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.360 
we make the turn these fixed incremental
planes<00:02:31.900> get<00:02:32.170> crooked<00:02:35.400> over<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.520> decay

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
planes get crooked over the decay

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.600 
planes get crooked over the decay
they've<00:02:39.370> actually<00:02:39.610> leaned<00:02:40.150> towards<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.780> hill

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
they've actually leaned towards the hill

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.800 
they've actually leaned towards the hill
here's<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.700> big<00:02:42.970> section<00:02:43.240> of<00:02:43.420> guide<00:02:43.660> rail<00:02:43.960> and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
here's a big section of guide rail and

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.270 
here's a big section of guide rail and
at<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> very<00:02:47.170> end<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:49.420> service<00:02:50.140> corridor

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.310 

now<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.340> get<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.760> see<00:02:57.180> as<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.330> said<00:02:58.600> it's<00:02:59.080> fairly

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
now you get to see as I said it's fairly

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.830 
now you get to see as I said it's fairly
straight<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.010> gets<00:03:00.160> crooked<00:03:00.550> right<00:03:00.730> there

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.350 

this<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.370> almost<00:03:06.370> straight<00:03:06.640> it's<00:03:06.910> leaning

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
this is almost straight it's leaning

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.530 
this is almost straight it's leaning
ever<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:07.780> slightly<00:03:08.080> to<00:03:08.260> your<00:03:08.620> right<00:03:09.450> then<00:03:10.450> it

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
ever so slightly to your right then it

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.470 
ever so slightly to your right then it
gets<00:03:10.690> worse<00:03:11.550> then<00:03:12.550> it<00:03:12.700> leans<00:03:12.880> quite<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.180> bit<00:03:13.360> to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
gets worse then it leans quite a bit to

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.780 
gets worse then it leans quite a bit to
the<00:03:13.570> left

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.949 

that's<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.970> end<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.269> service<00:03:18.689> corridor

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
that's the end of the service corridor
