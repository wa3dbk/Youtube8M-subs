the pressures off in training we start
with<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:07.980> basic<00:03:08.310> command<00:03:08.760> which<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.330> fetch<00:03:09.630> we

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
with a basic command which is fetch we

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.520 
with a basic command which is fetch we
give<00:03:10.350> her<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.560> pressure<00:03:10.800> fetch<00:03:12.110> fetch<00:03:13.110> not
