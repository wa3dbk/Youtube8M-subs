get started using Mac and a trackpad so
I<00:00:27.779> decided<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.410> create<00:00:28.590> these<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.550> tutorial

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.179 
I decided to create these this tutorial
even<00:00:30.390> though<00:00:30.539> I'm<00:00:30.810> completely<00:00:31.410> new<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.070> this

and let you know what I have found out
ok<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:36.809> first<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.890> system<00:00:38.879> trackpad

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
ok so first of all the system trackpad

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.060 
ok so first of all the system trackpad
settings<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.270> this<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> system<00:00:43.200> preference

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
settings so this is a system preference

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.139 
settings so this is a system preference
trackpad<00:00:45.059> window<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.280> okay<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> lot<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.730> these<00:00:47.820> it

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
trackpad window I okay a lot of these it

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.639 
trackpad window I okay a lot of these it
doesn't<00:00:48.420> matter<00:00:48.600> what<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.050> use<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.500> will

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
doesn't matter what you use but I will

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.680 
doesn't matter what you use but I will
show<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.250> ones<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.940> found<00:00:51.210> that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
show you the ones that I have found that

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.410 
show you the ones that I have found that
were<00:00:51.899> very<00:00:52.410> necessary<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:54.059> set

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
were very necessary to to get set

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.450 
were very necessary to to get set
correctly<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:57.140> pinch<00:00:58.140> opening<00:00:58.739> clothes<00:00:59.039> is

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
correctly so pinch opening clothes is

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.369 
correctly so pinch opening clothes is
important<00:01:00.559> it's<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:02.039> only<00:01:02.329> good<00:01:03.329> way<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
important it's the only good way to do a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.240 
important it's the only good way to do a
zoom<00:01:05.750> that<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.049> control<00:01:07.530> accurately

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
zoom that you can control accurately

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.960 
zoom that you can control accurately
within<00:01:08.930> blender<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.770> found<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
within blender that I have found a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.780 
within blender that I have found a
screen<00:01:12.540> zoom<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.530> option<00:01:13.950> that's<00:01:14.220> really

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
screen zoom the option that's really

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.420 
screen zoom the option that's really
helpful<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.509> set<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> pointer<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.979> at<00:01:17.130> or

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
helpful is set so the pointer is at or

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
helpful is set so the pointer is at or
near<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> center<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.450> image<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.960> that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
near the center of the image and that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.340 
near the center of the image and that
lets<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.880> control<00:01:20.880> where<00:01:21.600> exactly<00:01:21.990> you're

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
lets you control where exactly you're

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.200 
lets you control where exactly you're
zooming<00:01:22.740> into<00:01:23.509> I<00:01:24.509> use<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.920> secondary<00:01:26.430> tap<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
zooming into I use for secondary tap the

now<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:31.070> in<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.610> blender<00:01:33.200> documentation

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
now and in the blender documentation

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.240 
now and in the blender documentation
this<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.780> what<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:36.900> call<00:01:37.250> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
I do the three finger dragging but if

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.460 
I do the three finger dragging but if
you<00:01:47.790> do<00:01:47.939> one<00:01:48.299> if<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.720> use<00:01:48.869> two<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.170> finger

you do one if you use two one finger

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.789 
you do one if you use two one finger
trap<00:01:49.740> dragging<00:01:50.280> that's<00:01:50.520> fine<00:01:51.030> too<00:01:51.710> okay<00:01:52.710> and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.679 
settings don't matter okay so moving on
into<00:02:00.090> blender<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.880> your<00:02:03.060> standard

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
into blender so this is your standard

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.130 
into blender so this is your standard
start<00:02:04.170> up<00:02:04.259> file<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.790> I'm<00:02:05.939> coming<00:02:06.180> up<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.390> up

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
start up file so I'm coming up here up

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.330 
start up file so I'm coming up here up

is important for using the Mac trackpad
emulate<00:02:27.310> numpad<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:28.240> also<00:02:28.630> quite<00:02:29.140> important

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
emulate numpad is also quite important

hold<00:05:10.470> down<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:11.100> function<00:05:11.640> key<00:05:11.850> while<00:05:12.360> you

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
hold down the function key while you

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.330 
hold down the function key while you
press<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:14.190> f12<00:05:14.550> button<00:05:14.880> in<00:05:15.240> order<00:05:15.360> to<00:05:15.600> get<00:05:15.750> the

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
press the f12 button in order to get the

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.480 
press the f12 button in order to get the
the<00:05:17.340> actual<00:05:17.670> function<00:05:18.090> instead<00:05:18.390> of<00:05:18.540> its

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
the actual function instead of its

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.820 
the actual function instead of its
alternate<00:05:20.490> which<00:05:20.970> is<00:05:21.560> fooling<00:05:22.560> with<00:05:22.680> the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
alternate which is fooling with the

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.820 
alternate which is fooling with the
volume<00:05:23.130> control<00:05:23.570> so<00:05:24.570> that's<00:05:24.780> true<00:05:25.020> for<00:05:25.440> all

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
volume control so that's true for all

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.760 
volume control so that's true for all
the<00:05:26.040> function<00:05:26.370> keys<00:05:26.550> hold<00:05:26.880> down<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.180> FN<00:05:27.570> key

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
the function keys hold down the FN key

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.540 
the function keys hold down the FN key
in<00:05:28.770> order<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:29.340> actually<00:05:29.520> do<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.360> function<00:05:30.780> key

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
in order to actually do the function key

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.380 
in order to actually do the function key
okay<00:05:32.550> um<00:05:33.470> proportional<00:05:34.470> editing<00:05:34.820> so<00:05:35.820> this

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
okay um proportional editing so this

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.300 
okay um proportional editing so this
took<00:05:36.570> me<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:36.840> longest<00:05:36.990> time<00:05:37.260> to<00:05:37.290> figure<00:05:38.070> out

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
took me the longest time to figure out

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.310 
took me the longest time to figure out
so<00:05:38.880> I<00:05:38.910> will<00:05:39.510> uh<00:05:39.540> I<00:05:41.120> get<00:05:42.120> rid<00:05:42.360> of<00:05:42.390> the<00:05:42.660> cube<00:05:42.960> and

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
so I will uh I get rid of the cube and

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.460 
so I will uh I get rid of the cube and
add<00:05:43.770> a<00:05:43.800> UV<00:05:44.190> spheres<00:05:44.550> to<00:05:44.820> make<00:05:45.000> this<00:05:45.470> clearer

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
add a UV spheres to make this clearer

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.870 
add a UV spheres to make this clearer
okay<00:05:47.810> it's<00:05:48.810> selected<00:05:49.320> I<00:05:49.470> will<00:05:49.530> tab<00:05:50.010> into<00:05:50.430> edit

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
okay it's selected I will tab into edit

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.440 
okay it's selected I will tab into edit
mode<00:05:50.910> and<00:05:52.550> deselect<00:05:53.550> most<00:05:53.910> of<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.150> vertices

mode and deselect most of the vertices

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.150 
mode and deselect most of the vertices
and<00:05:54.930> I<00:05:55.110> will<00:05:55.350> zoom<00:05:55.860> in<00:05:56.130> on<00:05:56.250> it<00:05:57.260> okay<00:05:58.260> so<00:05:58.320> come

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
and I will zoom in on it okay so come

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.670 
and I will zoom in on it okay so come
down<00:05:59.430> here<00:05:59.940> and<00:06:00.060> turn<00:06:00.240> on<00:06:00.680> proportional

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
down here and turn on proportional

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.830 
down here and turn on proportional
editing<00:06:01.830> and<00:06:04.760> with<00:06:05.760> the<00:06:05.880> vertex<00:06:06.300> mode

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
editing and with the vertex mode

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.380 
editing and with the vertex mode
selected<00:06:07.440> I<00:06:07.710> will<00:06:08.000> click<00:06:09.000> on<00:06:09.180> one<00:06:09.450> vertex<00:06:09.810> and

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
selected I will click on one vertex and

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.020 
selected I will click on one vertex and
to<00:06:12.390> use<00:06:12.540> proportional<00:06:13.020> editing<00:06:13.850> start<00:06:14.850> to

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
to use proportional editing start to

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.580 
to use proportional editing start to
drag<00:06:15.270> and<00:06:15.540> you<00:06:15.630> will<00:06:15.750> see<00:06:15.960> the<00:06:16.110> size<00:06:16.350> of<00:06:16.500> the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
drag and you will see the size of the

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.830 
drag and you will see the size of the
influence<00:06:17.210> circle<00:06:18.210> and<00:06:19.700> with<00:06:20.700> after<00:06:21.540> starting

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
influence circle and with after starting

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.590 
influence circle and with after starting
to<00:06:21.960> drag<00:06:22.230> and<00:06:22.590> without<00:06:22.950> letting<00:06:23.370> go<00:06:23.450> you<00:06:24.450> can

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
to drag and without letting go you can

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.690 
to drag and without letting go you can
then<00:06:24.780> hit<00:06:24.990> the<00:06:25.140> up<00:06:25.290> arrow<00:06:25.620> key<00:06:25.740> to<00:06:26.280> increase

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
then hit the up arrow key to increase

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.970 
then hit the up arrow key to increase
the<00:06:27.360> size<00:06:27.600> of<00:06:27.780> proportional<00:06:28.290> influence<00:06:28.710> and

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
the size of proportional influence and

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.420 
the size of proportional influence and
or<00:06:29.550> the<00:06:29.730> down<00:06:29.910> arrow<00:06:30.150> key<00:06:30.740> to<00:06:31.740> decrease<00:06:32.250> the

or the down arrow key to decrease the

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.220 
or the down arrow key to decrease the
size<00:06:32.610> of<00:06:32.790> proportional<00:06:33.330> intervals<00:06:33.720> so<00:06:34.020> be

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
size of proportional intervals so be

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.670 
size of proportional intervals so be
sure<00:06:34.380> to<00:06:34.560> do<00:06:34.710> that<00:06:34.920> after<00:06:35.460> you<00:06:35.850> start<00:06:36.090> dragging

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
sure to do that after you start dragging

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:45.530 
sure to do that after you start dragging
but<00:06:37.680> without<00:06:38.010> letting<00:06:38.400> go<00:06:38.550> and<00:06:42.170> okay<00:06:43.170> and<00:06:43.470> I<00:06:44.540> do

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
but without letting go and okay and I do

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:56.140 
but without letting go and okay and I do
it<00:06:45.660> one<00:06:45.840> more<00:06:46.020> time<00:06:46.260> start<00:06:46.950> dragging<00:06:52.040> grab

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.650 

start<00:06:57.150> dragging<00:06:57.680> up<00:06:58.680> arrow<00:06:59.400> to<00:06:59.580> increase<00:06:59.880> the

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
start dragging up arrow to increase the

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.040 
start dragging up arrow to increase the
influence<00:07:01.100> down<00:07:02.100> arrow<00:07:02.430> to<00:07:03.420> decrease<00:07:03.840> the

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
influence down arrow to decrease the

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.360 
influence down arrow to decrease the
influence<00:07:05.930> so<00:07:06.930> I<00:07:06.960> think<00:07:07.230> that's<00:07:07.590> all<00:07:07.980> you

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
influence so I think that's all you

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.670 
influence so I think that's all you
really<00:07:08.820> need<00:07:09.120> to<00:07:09.270> get<00:07:09.420> started<00:07:09.690> learning<00:07:10.350> the

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
really need to get started learning the

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.650 
really need to get started learning the
influence<00:07:11.250> so<00:07:11.700> I<00:07:12.000> hope<00:07:12.270> this<00:07:12.420> has<00:07:12.630> been

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
influence so I hope this has been

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.830 
influence so I hope this has been
helpful<00:07:12.900> thank<00:07:13.500> you
