00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.870
 hello everyone knows batten morning 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.210
 today we find ourselves live on 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.619
 what kind of black ops two years ago I launched 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.230
 a little snipers and we get 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.520
 found on the map id jaked so for 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.970
 start I wish you a very 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 happy New Year 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.699
 we just started the year 2013 and then 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.070
 here we have taken the courses anyway 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.539
 I took the lessons it's true that 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.009
 it's a bit complicated because it was 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.079
 at festive times and suddenly 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.769
 resume classes well it's a bit 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.710
 the routine is a little everyday life 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:44.039
 everyone finally anyway for the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.679
 most people who listen to me 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:53.530
 because I know that people who 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:56.799
 watch my videos are aged 12 13 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.199
 years to here it can go up to ten 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.689
 nine years after that depends on there are some 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.539
 accounts that are a bit phony 

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:09.280
 I know there are people who have 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.420
 over 80 from 80 years old and he had watched 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.759
 video but that's really 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.049
 people we create phony accounts 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.560
 because yeah I can not imagine by 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.319
 example my grandmother or my grandfather 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.549
 look at collodi circles but 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:22.899
 voila 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.130
 frankly this year it was a very 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.940
 happy new year anyway for me because 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.459
 that we moved east of 2000 after 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.000
 what 10,000 subscribers so that was 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:36.750
 really a sick thing it's I 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.120
 think it's mostly thanks to a 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.500
 to the videos that I did in front before 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.420
 the release of black ops 2 so that's it 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.070
 helped me a lot 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.260
 people around me who have me 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.020
 helped and I thank him thank you 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.350
 you watching my video load 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.350
 be one 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.950
 so it's a little hot that's it 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.440
 nine so that was almost two 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.479
 weeks I had not done any video and I 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.750
 will tell you a little bit why he gives 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.729
 reason 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.290
 as in the last two videos 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.660
 sick shocks I got a cold I had a 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.020
 angina I have a little something that you 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.330
 drunk most people that 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.200
 it's really the basic disease that 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.670
 a lot of people catch it 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.440
 what every two months or something from 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.500
 kind but me it's really the thing 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.510
 who gets drunk and that I can you have 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.280
 that I do not arrive finally I do not understand 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.489
 his share is not that it's already two 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.430
 weeks that I'm sick and never I 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.380
 cough that's it I'm drunk and is 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.680
 then down the other reason is that I 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.180
 play a lot more at black ops 2 I know 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.580
 not if it's the same for you but 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.080
 here is finally I'm pretty geek and at the 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.880
 exit from the game and that makes that now 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.209
 I'm a little fed up but hey I'm ok 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.950
 still play a little bit but I 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.770
 you admit that 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.650
 that's it a lot more I'm going back over 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.670
 on modern from and and gta with the 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.280
 members of my team and then here I play 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.900
 really quietly 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.090
 it's true that every day I have to play 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.470
 are we going to say half an hour game did not 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.940
 played a huge half an hour an hour 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.069
 no more then before that it makes 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.080
 finally turn the exit of the coop of 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.150
 game but I did not even count the hours 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:27.080
 but at the base I often play that 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.630
 can last one to two hours a day 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.580
 when really what are these pages and 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.200
 I remind you that in the last 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.640
 video it seems to me in my before 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.560
 last video I said I had 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.350
 a lot of time to play lens for that 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.180
 that I can 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.190
 I can play one to two hours a day 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.420
 but we think of you that I have a little 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.890
 fed up but hey it's that's normal 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.060
 because I really indicated to the 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.890
 exit of the ve is what makes that ben 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.480
 that's when we say a lot about the same 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.910
 final day we start to get fed up 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.210
 but this year in my opinion it's going 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.240
 have a lot of surprises because 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:08.450
 I was at 5 going out 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:11.450
 in spring so it seems like yeah that to 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.800
 the end of the year there is the dlc that's 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.260
 blake as the key to go out at the end of 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.359
 month we feel that there are four maps one 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.079
 zombie map that alert to not bad to 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.239
 new mode 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.570
 if I understood a new mode 1.3 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.600
 and we can embody a zombie that has 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.970
 look pretty stylish and a new weapon 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.490
 in addition so I saw this trailer I was 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.810
 there frankly it's okay 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.400
 allow to see the to spend a little bit of 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.150
 time me personally the 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.920
 the game pack 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.680
 I expect it more for the zombie than the 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.220
 multi even though the maps she looked 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.830
 quite stylish we saw that there was a 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.240
 kind of a waterfall I do not know 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.920
 which they could take us 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.810
 a lot of little things 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.900
 nice enough but i have so i'm waiting 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.500
 more for the zombie since ben here 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.240
 that's the secret zombies all that is 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.720
 challenged with the mates it's pretty south 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:12.680
 do this stuff and so that's it 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:16.440
 and in addition we were told that 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:20.580
 microsoft was going to show his next 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.940
 xbox halo 3 I'm more like it 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.630
 call 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.790
 finally xbox the next generation 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.050
 console what are they going for there they go it has 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:33.270
 shown at e3 and and will come out late 2013 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.020
 so I would say more October 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.020
 November December 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.960
 so yeah that's rather it's rather a 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.520
 good surprise and I do not think that that 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.660
 was coming soon I thought 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.090
 more 2014 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.600
 yeah that's right it's going to get more 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.300
 2013 which may be pretty hot 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.740
 this is the price must know that the ps3 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.410
 when she came out she cost 600 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.390
 euros and there all the shots okay 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.930
 further increase the games when one is 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.680
 ps2 and ps3 past sas increased 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.480
 Verry much 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.210
 she has all the blows when we go 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.039
 from ps3 aps cat and xbox to the 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.169
 the xbox just not how we call it 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.750
 the next xbox it will still increase 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:18.370
 every time so it may be 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.750
 quite complicated in my opinion in my opinion 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.620
 video games that will end up getting 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:26.530
 transform as a luxury hobby 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.470
 that's how it gets more and more expensive 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.680
 and they will put us more dlc 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.199
 for each game it's going to be pretty 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.180
 15 candy what good in any case I know 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:40.509
 no I made some 15 bodies that I 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.479
 went I had first meaning that 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:45.880
 I made about thirty that he acted 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:48.669
 to die 13 times good it's not a huge 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.620
 score jo this is the first part as 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.150
 I play more 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.310
 so here I hope that 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.110
 Did you like this video 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.750
 I do not know when do I do it again 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.310
 a video made in the week on gta 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.700
 I think with the number of matches and we 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.890
 will 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:06.130
 and in any case I wish you to 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:08.310
 all a happy new year 2013 go bye all 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.310
 the world
