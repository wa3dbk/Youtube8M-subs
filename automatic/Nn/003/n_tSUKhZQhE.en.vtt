00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
head gunslinger you'll see that's the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.790 
head gunslinger you'll see that's the
detail<00:00:36.829> so<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.809> got<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> roughly<00:00:40.260> shaped<00:00:40.350> I'm

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
detail so I got it roughly shaped I'm

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.139 
detail so I got it roughly shaped I'm
not<00:00:40.920> too<00:00:41.100> concerned<00:00:41.340> about<00:00:42.199> you<00:00:43.199> know<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
not too concerned about you know the

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
not too concerned about you know the
edges<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.420> would<00:00:45.960> want<00:00:46.230> them<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.070> is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
edges as I would want them but this is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.630 
edges as I would want them but this is
basically<00:00:47.430> how<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.420> go<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.600> there

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
basically how it's going to go on there

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.130 
basically how it's going to go on there
just<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.899> after<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.989> got<00:00:55.109> your

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
just like that so after you got your

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
just like that so after you got your
edges<00:00:55.559> cut<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.550> way<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.730> want<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:58.969> this

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
edges cut out the way you want it this

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
edges cut out the way you want it this
is<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> white<00:01:00.359> back<00:01:00.660> decal<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:02.300> all<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.809> edges

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
is a white back decal so all the edges

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.560 
is a white back decal so all the edges
have<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.949> cut<00:01:05.220> exactly<00:01:05.880> where<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.120> want<00:01:06.480> them

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
have to be cut exactly where I want them

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.330 
have to be cut exactly where I want them
otherwise<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.440> are<00:01:07.730> to<00:01:08.730> put<00:01:08.910> whatever<00:01:09.120> shape

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
otherwise that are to put whatever shape

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.070 
otherwise that are to put whatever shape
from<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.550> edges<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.120> on<00:01:12.270> there<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.780> just

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
from the edges is on there it's just

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.550 
from the edges is on there it's just
