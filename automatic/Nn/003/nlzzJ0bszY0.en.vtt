is mildew resistant it's a great variety

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.620 
is mildew resistant it's a great variety
to<00:00:31.289> grow<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> northwest<00:00:33.210> or<00:00:33.450> any

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
place in the US as a matter of fact the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.030 
place in the US as a matter of fact the
time<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.809> divide<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.260> as<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> couple<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.800> tricks

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
time to divide it as a couple of tricks

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.369 
time to divide it as a couple of tricks
number<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:38.670> before<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.120> start<00:00:39.420> dividing<00:00:39.870> you

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
number one before I start dividing you

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.229 
number one before I start dividing you
see<00:00:40.440> how<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.680> leads<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.980> turn<00:00:41.219> yellow<00:00:41.460> that's

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
see how this leads to turn yellow that's

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.510 
see how this leads to turn yellow that's
because<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.290> month<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.860> November

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
because it's just the month of November

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.540 
because it's just the month of November
the<00:00:45.059> plants<00:00:45.600> are<00:00:45.719> done<00:00:46.020> growing<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.710> I'm

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the plants are done growing for this I'm

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.430 
the plants are done growing for this I'm
just<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> clip<00:00:48.239> them<00:00:48.390> back<00:00:48.629> doesn't

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
just going to clip them back doesn't

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.150 
just going to clip them back doesn't
matter<00:00:49.559> where<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.950> cut<00:00:50.430> clip<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.570> back<00:00:52.350> so

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
matter where I cut clip this back so

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.200 
matter where I cut clip this back so
that<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.940> makes<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.329> easier<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.730> move<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
that it makes it easier to move and

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.049 
that it makes it easier to move and
divide<00:00:57.840> up<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> clock<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.370> only<00:00:59.789> need<00:00:59.910> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
divide up the clock now you only need to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.930 
divide up the clock now you only need to
divide<00:01:00.449> most<00:01:00.840> perennials<00:01:01.320> maybe<00:01:02.190> every<00:01:02.550> three

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
divide most perennials maybe every three

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.860 
divide most perennials maybe every three
to<00:01:03.059> five<00:01:03.270> years

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870

they're fragrant they've been in the
ground<00:01:11.610> about<00:01:11.790> seven<00:01:12.240> years<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.920> dividing

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
ground about seven years so dividing

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.490 
ground about seven years so dividing
them<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.189> long<00:01:14.460> overdue<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
them is long overdue and you see all I

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.380 
them is long overdue and you see all I
do<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.100> take<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.430> section<00:01:18.350> media<00:01:19.670> inch<00:01:20.670> long<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
do is take a section media inch long and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.469 
do is take a section media inch long and
four<00:01:22.110> inch<00:01:22.259> wide<00:01:22.350> section<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.250> move<00:01:24.180> the

four inch wide section and move the
entire<00:01:24.930> section<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> ground<00:01:26.790> that's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
entire section out of the ground that's

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.690 
entire section out of the ground that's
the<00:01:27.900> tip<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.380> makes<00:01:28.650> dividing<00:01:29.189> perennials

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the tip that makes dividing perennials

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.899 
the tip that makes dividing perennials
easier<00:01:30.150> take<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.900> whole<00:01:31.110> thing<00:01:31.140> out

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
easier take the whole thing out

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
easier take the whole thing out
drop<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.090> down<00:01:33.299> don't<00:01:33.960> need<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.530> gentle

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
drop it down don't need to be gentle

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.600 
drop it down don't need to be gentle
with<00:01:35.280> them<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:36.600> using<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> shade<00:01:37.610> fade

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
with them and then using the shade fade

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.319 
with them and then using the shade fade
just<00:01:39.500> chop<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.799> half<00:01:40.970> now<00:01:41.970> what<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.270> does

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
just chop it in half now what this does

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.569 
just chop it in half now what this does
it<00:01:43.170> means<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.590> these<00:01:43.710> new<00:01:44.009> roots<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.460> going

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
it means that these new roots are going

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.580 
it means that these new roots are going
to<00:01:44.640> form<00:01:44.909> plants<00:01:45.750> could<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:45.990> more<00:01:46.350> vigorous

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
to form plants could be more vigorous

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.560 
to form plants could be more vigorous
than<00:01:46.829> ever<00:01:47.159> before<00:01:47.579> I'm<00:01:47.790> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.180> great

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
than ever before I'm going to get great

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.469 
than ever before I'm going to get great
blooms<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.070> remember<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.670> include<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.180> soil

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
blooms if I remember to include the soil

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.990 
blooms if I remember to include the soil
here<00:01:52.380> I've<00:01:52.500> got<00:01:52.710> some<00:01:52.950> compost

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.130 

doesn't<00:01:59.000> matter<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.299> compost<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.810> little<00:01:59.960> bit

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
doesn't matter the compost a little bit

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.319 
doesn't matter the compost a little bit
clumpy<00:02:00.740> still<00:02:01.189> because<00:02:01.820> I'm<00:02:01.909> going<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.149> dig

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
clumpy still because I'm going to dig

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.410 
clumpy still because I'm going to dig
that<00:02:02.509> in<00:02:02.570> because<00:02:03.500> it's<00:02:03.950> fall<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:04.850> compost

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
that in because it's fall this compost

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.389 
that in because it's fall this compost
will<00:02:05.569> continue<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.049> decompose<00:02:07.209> in<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.390> spring

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
will continue to decompose in the spring

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.369 
will continue to decompose in the spring
you're<00:02:10.399> going<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.640> have<00:02:10.879> tons<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.989> new<00:02:12.170> growth

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
you're going to have tons of new growth
