00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
want to talk about how to make the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.900 
want to talk about how to make the
correct<00:00:11.550> hip<00:00:11.940> turn<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.679> see<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:13.950> many<00:00:14.219> students

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
correct hip turn I see so many students

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.730 
correct hip turn I see so many students
swaying<00:00:15.389> their<00:00:15.780> hips<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.440> getting<00:00:16.619> their

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
swaying their hips and getting their

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.019 
swaying their hips and getting their
weight<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.220> outside<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.820> right<00:00:18.000> foot

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
weight to the outside of the right foot

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.750 
weight to the outside of the right foot
it<00:00:18.690> makes<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.050> very<00:00:19.199> difficult<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.830> generate

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
it makes it very difficult to generate

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.370 
it makes it very difficult to generate
power<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.359> makes<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.720> very<00:00:21.810> difficult<00:00:22.080> to

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
power it makes it very difficult to

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.830 
power it makes it very difficult to
achieve<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.800> correct<00:00:22.920> impact<00:00:23.430> position<00:00:23.840> so

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
achieve the correct impact position so

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.500 
achieve the correct impact position so
let's<00:00:25.050> focus<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.590> how<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.859> hips<00:00:26.310> move<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
let's focus on how the hips move in the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.790 
let's focus on how the hips move in the
backswing<00:00:29.300> I've<00:00:30.300> got<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> little<00:00:31.140> training<00:00:31.529> aid

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800

backswing I've got a little training aid
here<00:00:32.070> that's<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> give<00:00:32.640> me<00:00:32.790> some<00:00:33.090> feel

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690

as I go back my right hip moves towards

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.469 
as I go back my right hip moves towards
the<00:01:17.759> target<00:01:19.369> you<00:01:20.369> hear<00:01:20.700> people<00:01:21.060> saying<00:01:21.299> all

the target you hear people saying all

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.760 
the target you hear people saying all
the<00:01:21.570> time<00:01:21.780> keep<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.319> weight<00:01:22.469> on<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.740> inside

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the time keep the weight on the inside

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.440 
the time keep the weight on the inside
of<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.399> right<00:01:23.609> foot<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> top<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
of your right foot at the top of the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.359 
of your right foot at the top of the
backswing<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.049> they're<00:01:25.259> absolutely<00:01:26.009> correct

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
backswing and they're absolutely correct

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.520 
backswing and they're absolutely correct
where's<00:01:27.179> your<00:01:27.420> weighted<00:01:27.750> address<00:01:28.079> it's<00:01:28.350> not

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
where's your weighted address it's not

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.679 
where's your weighted address it's not
necessarily<00:01:29.159> all<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> way<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> inside<00:01:29.789> so

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
necessarily all the way to the inside so

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.649 
necessarily all the way to the inside so
how<00:01:30.869> does<00:01:30.929> it<00:01:31.049> get<00:01:31.289> there<00:01:31.700> your<00:01:32.700> weight<00:01:33.119> goes

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
how does it get there your weight goes

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.429 
how does it get there your weight goes
towards<00:01:34.319> the<00:01:34.530> target<00:01:34.829> below<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.909> waist<00:01:36.439> when

he<00:01:37.500> said<00:01:37.679> it<00:01:37.799> again<00:01:37.859> your<00:01:38.459> weight<00:01:38.670> goes

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
he said it again your weight goes

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.749 
he said it again your weight goes
towards<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.600> target<00:01:40.020> below<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.250> waist<00:01:41.459> if

towards the target below the waist if

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.090 
towards the target below the waist if
not<00:01:41.969> you'll<00:01:42.359> have<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.600> reverse<00:01:43.170> weight<00:01:43.590> shift<00:01:43.920> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
not you'll have a reverse weight shift a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.630 
not you'll have a reverse weight shift a
reverse<00:01:44.429> pivot<00:01:45.229> notices<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.259> turn<00:01:46.560> back<00:01:46.829> my
