00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.519 

this<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.230> white<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.500> gold<00:00:25.859> color<00:00:26.220> and

this is the white and gold color and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.859 
this is the white and gold color and
it's<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.739> LTE<00:00:29.070> version<00:00:29.669> which<00:00:30.239> is<00:00:30.419> the<00:00:30.449> 4G

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
it's the LTE version which is the 4G

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:47.750

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.670 

so<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> gold<00:00:48.990> and<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.470> a<00:00:49.530> key

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
so this is the gold and this is a key

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
the cover it's smoother than the other

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:12.249 
the cover it's smoother than the other
phones<00:00:58.110> I<00:00:58.320> guess<00:01:00.200> LTE<00:01:01.200> will<00:01:01.470> I<00:01:02.030> do

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259
