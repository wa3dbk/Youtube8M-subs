00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
and at that time it was doable it was

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.270 
and at that time it was doable it was
doing<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.049> would<00:02:50.170> be<00:02:50.319> like<00:02:50.470> if<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.799> tried<00:02:51.130> to

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
doing it would be like if I tried to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.000 
doing it would be like if I tried to

foil a Spinks his revelation deck today
yes<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.180> would<00:02:55.269> cost<00:02:55.480> money<00:02:55.780> but<00:02:56.910> yes<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.329> know

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
yes it would cost money but yes you know

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.539 
yes it would cost money but yes you know

type of stuff and he speaks revelations
themselves<00:03:04.799> but<00:03:05.799> it<00:03:06.579> would<00:03:06.730> be<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:06.940> same<00:03:06.970> idea

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
themselves but it would be the same idea

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.970

could shark all day long for fest lands
especially<00:03:17.349> the<00:03:17.590> fetch<00:03:17.799> like<00:03:18.010> non<00:03:18.489> foil<00:03:18.910> fetch

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
especially the fetch like non foil fetch

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.819 
especially the fetch like non foil fetch
lands<00:03:19.569> and<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:21.100> could<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.549> I<00:03:21.790> mean<00:03:22.180> at<00:03:22.750> GPS<00:03:23.470> at

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.860 
lands and you could do I mean at GPS at
PT<00:03:24.579> cues<00:03:25.530> people<00:03:26.530> will<00:03:27.130> they<00:03:27.760> were<00:03:28.450> taking
