00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.710
 show one of the best modules 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 ex-post that I've tried in a lot 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.099
 time and I want to thank a 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.929
 subscriber who kindly in the video 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.940
 yesterday left his opinion in the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.070
 recommended comments on one of these 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.619
 expos modules that is an application this 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.630
 Subscriber is called and woods and no doubt 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.369
 some from here I thank you 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.420
 the module specifically we are going to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.820
 search and I'll show you how 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.599
 download it mainly so that what 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.519
 you can see it's called tinted status bar in 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.320
 this case this version that you see here 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.420
 is the beta version and if you have the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.489
 ex-post modules will be as simple as 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.050
 search as you just taught it and 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.879
 once in the third tab that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.010
 you have around here as a general rule 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.140
 you are going to have configured to use the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.149
 global configuration that will show you that 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.680
 you can not download more than versions 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.120
 stable that are neither beta nor 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.649
 experimental, well, you have to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.660
 click on this button and now once 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.129
 activated this option you are going to download e 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 install the latest experimental version 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.940
 which will allow you access in 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.789
 this case that I have installed is 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.949
 the 1.8 point 93 to the last options 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.449
 of this application so interesting that 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.250
 I 'm going to show you such that now 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.120
 let's go into it dye status 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.730
 FARC once 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.670
 as you see mainly the application 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.470
 It is characterized by having a very 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.880
 curious and is the one you are seeing by 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.820
 here at the top that we 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.010
 allows you to configure applications for 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.050
 that the status bar is translucent 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.910
 in an effect very similar to that already 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.650
 introduced android law and such as os 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.120
 I showed in workshop applications so 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.560
 let's take a look at all the 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.630
 functions first of all we 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.610
 allow the first two options does 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.470
 a very specific configuration by 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.690
 each application and I'll show you what 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.550
 first the default settings and we're going 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.760
 to leave the first option to the end 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.440
 we can mark I want you to have 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.790
 account that all the options that I 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.920
 I have marked are those that I have gone 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.630
 testing and those that I was disappointed in 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.160
 that work perfectly so if 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.080
 you want everything to be just as I 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.030
 I have and how I'm going to show you 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.950
 that you have it configured as I 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.410
 I have the first thing we are going to mark respect 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.020
 the apis of kitkat that is if the bar 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.150
 blocking for example or screens 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.310
 start are configured so that 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.410
 be translucent we are not going to interfere 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.030
 in that configuration since it works at 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.530
 perfection and we will not get more 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.570
 problems where there are not 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.159
 in appearance we could activate these 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.180
 three 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.129
 mainly allow us the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.510
 color gradient is this that you are 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.670
 seeing around here the bar is not going to be 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.219
 completely translucent but by the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.959
 bottom part will be very transparent 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.150
 and the top will be doing 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.519
 a gradient to a more opaque tone for 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.819
 that way the settings and icons of 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.709
 signal and others are not completely covered 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.840
 and so they can still be visible in 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.579
 react to turn off the lights is that 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.859
 mainly because if we have yes 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.659
 we activate the night mode is not going to 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.159
 follow the blank bar in case 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.720
 the application had a white background in 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.489
 its normal mode but it is going to adapt 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.829
 again in terms of action bar 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.480
 well this would mainly be for 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.519
 you have a navigation bar style 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.230
 virtual buttons in the nexus we 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.150
 they would also allow adjustment in the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.430
 same tone as far as advanced we can 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.500
 allow here keeping this option 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.329
 that each application does not have as much 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.549
 manual configuration but you can 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.379
 interact with the apis that is 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.120
 application provide you for 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.250
 interchange and make a manual adjustment 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.840
 in case the developer has 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.830
 allowed and lastly in filters 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.420
 color let's activate the src option 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.340
 here as you see gives us a small 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.380
 explanation but basically in the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.600
 notification icons let's activate 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.790
 the second option that comes to us in this 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.440
 way and well let's go now one of the 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.730
 most interesting functions that is that 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.200
 one thing is that this application 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.030
 provide I have already told you the 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.160
 tools to each of the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.780
 applications so they can be activated 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.000
 as such and have this function so 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.680
 interesting but if some application does not 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.230
 it works in concrete too much there 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.730
 we can configure it manually I os 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.830
 I'm going to show youtube that is 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.840
 an application that is not what is 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.090
 better here you have all the functions 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.220
 developed by google so that the 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.440
 Youtube application can act then 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.030
 well here you have three other options the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.950
 First link the colors of the bar 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.240
 of navigation status this again no 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.310
 we are interested because we do not have a 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.870
 phone with virtual buttons but in 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.110
 If we had it, it could be 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.420
 useful here you have to react the bar 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.880
 change of visibility action this is 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.320
 that if the navigation bar that 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.480
 You see in the status bar 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.340
 had a white tone and we did not 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.480
 let's see the icons because not 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.370
 was well adapted from that 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.190
 application to this feature in 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.860
 concrete we could simply 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.300
 adapt it to be seen 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.880
 perfectly the icons of both the 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.010
 Battery as of the watch as of the wifi and 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.450
 others so good once seen more or 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.460
 less this application that I have already 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.010
 put all the roll of the matter of the 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.450
 theory let's practice if we're going to 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.310
 enter a folder that I have 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.810
 downloaded here with the applications in 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.340
 that you are going to be able to see this effect so 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.530
 cool here you have for example series 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.210
 droid is an application so that 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.650
 had downloaded and that simply did not 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.570
 I had to configure nothing but 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.700
 has automatically detected that the 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.010
 top has a blue color like this 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.200
 that is doing a gradient as you see 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.240
 in a more transparent first tone already 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.120
 As it goes up, it's something very similar 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.910
 to what we can see in the bar of the 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.770
 normal and current screens here 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.990
 you have for example the play store that does not 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.490
 we have this solid bar in black 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.110
 as we were used to 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.570
 any android version but it will 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.120
 it adapts again to the grayish color 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.530
 in this case and it is very nice here 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.090
 you have for example to make a 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.890
 obligation to listen to music that the 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.600
 tone is something also grayish but a 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.640
 little darker and again fits with 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.740
 a pretty interesting opacity that 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.060
 it allows us that the application is much 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.830
 more beautiful in terms of 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.590
 or visual here you have for example the 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.389
 ex post module that you see is not an 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.610
 bar currently opaque no matter how much 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.490
 here there is a space of separation but 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.840
 that again fits and is not something so 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.940
 contrasted here you have for example 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.770
 youtube this is a case that showed you 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.560
 and how could I configure it so that 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.110
 in case you do not see at all the 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.850
 degraded icons help us to 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.070
 that can be configured better and for 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.810
 last you have an application that in this 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.430
 case would not be well adapted that 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.900
 call time light as you see we continue 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.850
 having this solid bar in color 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.740
 black but it would be as simple as leaving 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.690
 to this particular application that does not 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.700
 work well and configure the way 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.440
 manual as you have already shown to 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.090
 your taste for the end of the day 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.250
 you can get it working at 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.110
 no more than that all gone for this 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.880
 video I hope you liked it I hope 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.320
 you follow me down here my networks 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.880
 social my twitter and facebook where 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.740
 I'm always posting news about the 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.400
 channel and see you in the next video 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.400
 a greeting
