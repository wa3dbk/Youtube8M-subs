00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.910

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.870

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:12.460
 That it means the light of the mystery Surutto

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.930

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.120
 There 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.680

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.680
 Tei was 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.940

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.770
 This stage is gone Is the I'd never done m dance so much 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:56.229

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.870

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:34.500
 After painting, I bought a branch first 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.500

 I do not want to be a space I knew 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.650

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:30.930
 Yes 8 cut 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:33.270
 It was a disastrous result that is important with eight machines, but I wonder if there was a shot that was good even with eco 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:37.590

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:41.300
