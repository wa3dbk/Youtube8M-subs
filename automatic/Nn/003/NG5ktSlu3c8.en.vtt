00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
back partnership in my opinion in the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.460 
back partnership in my opinion in the
world<00:02:08.040> last<00:02:08.220> season<00:02:08.700> also<00:02:09.600> with<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.290> young

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470

zouma<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.860> also<00:02:14.190> autonomous<00:02:14.550> cars<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.180> think

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
zouma and also autonomous cars I think

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.630 
zouma and also autonomous cars I think
that<00:02:16.290> there<00:02:16.500> are<00:02:16.620> more<00:02:16.770> into<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.100> mold<00:02:17.520> of

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
that there are more into the mold of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.550 
that there are more into the mold of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
really make mistakes that's something

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.180

that<00:02:24.870> double<00:02:25.200> Elise<00:02:25.410> does<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.860> personally

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
that double Elise does I personally

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.920 
that double Elise does I personally
think<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.910> one<00:02:27.120> position<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.690> we<00:02:27.810> were

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
think the one position that we were

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.660 
think the one position that we were
actually<00:02:28.020> mr.<00:02:28.470> Byrd<00:02:28.650> we<00:02:28.800> seem<00:02:28.980> more<00:02:29.160> homey<00:02:29.370> b

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
actually mr. Byrd we seem more homey b

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.190 
actually mr. Byrd we seem more homey b
center<00:02:29.970> midfield<00:02:30.390> because<00:02:30.630> when<00:02:30.780> mattox

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
center midfield because when mattox

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.870 
center midfield because when mattox
can't<00:02:31.740> play<00:02:32.010> he's<00:02:32.280> been<00:02:32.460> fit<00:02:32.640> into<00:02:32.760> that

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
can't play he's been fit into that

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.180 
can't play he's been fit into that
positioning<00:02:33.450> apart<00:02:34.140> from<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.530> game<00:02:34.740> I<00:02:34.980> think

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
positioning apart from the game I think

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.220 
positioning apart from the game I think
it's<00:02:35.310> against<00:02:35.490> crystal<00:02:35.940> palace<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.630> think<00:02:37.170> he

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
it's against crystal palace I think he

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.590 
it's against crystal palace I think he
was<00:02:37.320> very<00:02:37.380> good<00:02:37.710> in<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:37.890> position<00:02:38.100> but<00:02:38.640> you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
was very good in that position but you

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.240 
was very good in that position but you
know<00:02:39.690> he's<00:02:39.810> not<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.990> center<00:02:40.410> midfielder<00:02:40.920> and

center<00:02:54.270> midfielder<00:02:54.750> when<00:02:54.930> he's<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.110> dynamic

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
center midfielder when he's a dynamic

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.970 
center midfielder when he's a dynamic
quick<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.820> good<00:02:57.239> passer<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.260> absolve<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.830> good

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
quick a good passer and absolve a good

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.820 
quick a good passer and absolve a good
shot<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.790> Ramirez<00:03:00.300> is<00:03:00.480> very<00:03:00.720> very<00:03:00.900> good<00:03:01.020> he's

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
shot like Ramirez is very very good he's

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.979 
shot like Ramirez is very very good he's
very<00:03:01.920> dynamic<00:03:02.640> very<00:03:02.850> quick<00:03:03.180> but<00:03:03.390> he<00:03:03.510> lacks<00:03:03.780> a

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
very dynamic very quick but he lacks a

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.630 
very dynamic very quick but he lacks a
path<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.560> think<00:03:04.709> his<00:03:04.830> path<00:03:05.100> percentages<00:03:05.580> in

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
path I think his path percentages in

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.030 
path I think his path percentages in
like<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.150> mid<00:03:06.390> 70s<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.650> know<00:03:07.739> that's<00:03:07.950> not

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
like the mid 70s you know that's not

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.460 
like the mid 70s you know that's not
really<00:03:08.550> good<00:03:08.760> enough<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.180> we<00:03:10.110> need<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.320> bring

really really good at and I always say

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.660 
really really good at and I always say
to<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.530> first<00:03:58.739> half<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.100> season<00:03:59.220> he<00:03:59.370> was<00:03:59.459> for

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
to the first half the season he was for

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.130 
to the first half the season he was for
his<00:03:59.760> best<00:03:59.970> player<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.239> think<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.720> started<00:04:00.989> to

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
his best player I think it started to

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.620 
his best player I think it started to
sink<00:04:01.320> in<00:04:01.590> what<00:04:01.860> he<00:04:02.010> signed<00:04:02.310> for<00:04:02.760> injuries<00:04:03.360> came

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
sink in what he signed for injuries came

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.259 
sink in what he signed for injuries came
in<00:04:03.780> he<00:04:03.870> wasn't<00:04:04.140> getting<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.410> team<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:05.850> just

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
in he wasn't getting the team and I just

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.870 
in he wasn't getting the team and I just
think<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.989> kind<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.350> a<00:04:07.519> made<00:04:08.519> him<00:04:08.670> drop

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
think that that kind of a made him drop

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.670 
think that that kind of a made him drop
his<00:04:09.060> performance<00:04:09.510> but<00:04:09.570> he<00:04:09.660> had<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.959> good<00:04:10.440> end<00:04:10.620> to

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
his performance but he had a good end to

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.590 
his performance but he had a good end to
the<00:04:10.830> season<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.280> why<00:04:11.430> he<00:04:11.760> scored<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.209> our<00:04:12.330> last

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
the season is why he scored in our last

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.920 
the season is why he scored in our last
game<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:13.140> he's<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.709> good<00:04:13.919> shadow<00:04:14.190> um<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.750> big

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
game so he's a good shadow um the big

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.060 
game so he's a good shadow um the big
ones<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.410> obviously<00:04:16.739> videl<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.519> uh

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
ones is obviously videl and uh

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.220
