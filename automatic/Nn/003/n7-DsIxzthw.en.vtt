this<00:02:02.170> much<00:02:02.380> just<00:02:02.920> because<00:02:03.039> specialist

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
this much just because specialist

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.669 
this much just because specialist
doesn't<00:02:03.999> help<00:02:04.149> your<00:02:04.240> team<00:02:04.479> win<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:04.929> that's

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
doesn't help your team win and that's

doesn't help your team win and that's

something that I learned pretty quickly

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.559 
something that I learned pretty quickly

hardline let me talk about this for a

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.400 
hardline let me talk about this for a
second<00:02:49.120> hardline<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:49.900> probably<00:02:50.140> one<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
second hardline is probably one of the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.170 
second hardline is probably one of the
most<00:02:50.530> underrated<00:02:51.040> perks<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.519> this<00:02:51.640> game<00:02:51.790> when
