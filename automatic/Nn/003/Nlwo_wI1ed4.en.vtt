00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.080 

hey<00:00:00.630> guys<00:00:00.900> right<00:00:01.589> then<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:02.040> said<00:00:02.879> I<00:00:02.909> wasn't

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hey guys right then I said I wasn't

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.880 
hey guys right then I said I wasn't
gonna<00:00:03.300> do<00:00:03.480> another<00:00:03.689> one<00:00:03.840> but<00:00:04.319> I<00:00:04.380> didn't<00:00:04.650> fit<00:00:04.799> in

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
gonna do another one but I didn't fit in

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.280 
gonna do another one but I didn't fit in
it<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.100> time<00:00:05.310> so<00:00:05.700> I'd<00:00:06.210> rather<00:00:06.450> explain<00:00:06.750> it<00:00:07.109> Ryan

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
it in time so I'd rather explain it Ryan

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.230 
it in time so I'd rather explain it Ryan
throw<00:00:07.620> up<00:00:07.680> another<00:00:07.799> couple<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.340> minutes<00:00:08.610> so<00:00:08.760> we

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
throw up another couple of minutes so we

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:21.140 
throw up another couple of minutes so we
got<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:11.030> let<00:00:12.030> me<00:00:12.090> put<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> bit<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.480> volume<00:00:12.809> on<00:00:20.150> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
got to let me put a bit of volume on and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.609 
got to let me put a bit of volume on and
then<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.359> next<00:00:21.390> bit<00:00:21.810> he<00:00:21.900> goes<00:00:22.050> straight<00:00:22.380> into

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
then the next bit he goes straight into

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.099 
then the next bit he goes straight into
it<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.460> know<00:00:23.939> we've<00:00:24.090> broke<00:00:24.330> off<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.750> videos

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
it so I know we've broke off on videos

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.960 
it so I know we've broke off on videos
and<00:00:25.140> whatnot<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:26.039> remember<00:00:26.519> this

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
and whatnot but just remember this

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.400 
and whatnot but just remember this
little<00:00:27.240> station<00:00:27.630> comes<00:00:27.900> straight<00:00:28.140> from<00:00:28.380> that

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
little station comes straight from that

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:42.230 
little station comes straight from that
one<00:00:30.439> believe<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.740> something<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.250> that

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.560 

so<00:00:43.240> we<00:00:43.510> play<00:00:43.720> for<00:00:44.500> fret<00:00:44.860> if<00:00:45.130> they<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:49.450> then

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
so we play for fret if they be and then

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.170 
so we play for fret if they be and then
high<00:00:49.840> e<00:00:52.980> no<00:00:53.980> we<00:00:54.190> don't<00:00:54.370> play<00:00:54.490> the<00:00:54.640> high<00:00:54.790> E<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.150> I

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
high e no we don't play the high E so I

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.990 
high e no we don't play the high E so I
will<00:00:55.300> play<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.660> fourth<00:00:55.900> fret<00:00:56.080> would<00:00:56.200> be<00:00:57.000> seven

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
will play the fourth fret would be seven

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.100 
will play the fourth fret would be seven
pull<00:00:58.300> off<00:00:58.450> to<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.720> high<00:00:58.870> e<00:00:58.900> on<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.710> high<00:00:59.860> E<00:01:00.540> 754

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.670 

bend<00:01:05.110> up<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.440> B<00:01:05.620> string<00:01:06.040> of<00:01:06.160> the<00:01:06.250> seventh<00:01:06.670> fret

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
bend up the B string of the seventh fret

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.760 
bend up the B string of the seventh fret
and<00:01:08.730> then<00:01:09.730> we<00:01:09.910> play<00:01:10.210> on<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:11.020> fourth<00:01:11.320> fret<00:01:11.620> we

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
and then we play on the fourth fret we

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:20.270 
and then we play on the fourth fret we
do<00:01:11.890> eb<00:01:12.520> g<00:01:14.760> slide<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:15.940> g<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.510> third<00:01:16.810> fret<00:01:19.080> so

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
do eb g slide the g to the third fret so

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:30.960 
do eb g slide the g to the third fret so
from<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.369> top<00:01:27.119> D<00:01:28.119> string<00:01:28.540> 6-4<00:01:29.320> 66<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:30.580> usual

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
from the top D string 6-4 66 the usual

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:41.930 
from the top D string 6-4 66 the usual
little<00:01:31.240> bit<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.960> we<00:01:38.080> play<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.830> D<00:01:39.369> string<00:01:39.640> for

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
little bit then we play the D string for

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:50.130 
little bit then we play the D string for
c4<00:01:42.940> of<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:45.570> g6<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.780> G<00:01:48.360> Bend<00:01:49.360> up<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.720> six<00:01:49.990> of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
c4 of the g6 to the G Bend up the six of

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:59.760 
c4 of the g6 to the G Bend up the six of
the<00:01:50.230> GM<00:01:50.560> released<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:51.100> four

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.070 

and<00:02:00.770> then<00:02:01.160> with<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> think<00:02:01.760> I<00:02:02.060> don't<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:02.960> don't

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
and then with a think I don't I don't

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.960 
and then with a think I don't I don't
get<00:02:03.380> this<00:02:03.530> far<00:02:03.800> because<00:02:04.010> usually<00:02:04.370> and<00:02:04.820> you'll

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
get this far because usually and you'll

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.590 
get this far because usually and you'll
probably<00:02:05.120> find<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:07.250> backing<00:02:07.490> tracks<00:02:07.940> and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
probably find and the backing tracks and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.570 
probably find and the backing tracks and
the<00:02:08.780> red<00:02:08.960> court<00:02:09.229> starts<00:02:09.619> quieting<00:02:10.070> down<00:02:10.100> here

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
the red court starts quieting down here

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.340 
the red court starts quieting down here
so<00:02:11.030> unless<00:02:11.210> you're<00:02:11.330> playing<00:02:11.540> in<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.720> band

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
so unless you're playing in a band

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.780 
so unless you're playing in a band
you<00:02:12.470> won't<00:02:12.680> probably<00:02:12.890> need<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.310> next<00:02:13.580> few

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
you won't probably need the next few

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.210 
you won't probably need the next few
bits<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.960> don't<00:02:15.230> particularly<00:02:15.620> play<00:02:16.070> them

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
bits and I don't particularly play them

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.950 
bits and I don't particularly play them
so<00:02:16.370> I'm<00:02:16.490> not<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.760> master<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.510> next<00:02:17.780> few

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
so I'm not the master of the next few

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.220 
so I'm not the master of the next few
parts<00:02:18.520> but<00:02:19.520> I<00:02:19.550> will<00:02:19.760> show<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.240> them<00:02:20.420> anyway

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
parts but I will show you of them anyway

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.050 
parts but I will show you of them anyway
what<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:21.650> should<00:02:21.860> play<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:22.340> believe<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:22.910> do<00:02:23.030> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
what you should play I believe you do a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.850 
what you should play I believe you do a
series<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:23.600> few<00:02:25.570> just<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.690> few<00:02:26.720> chokes<00:02:29.860> something

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
series a few just a few chokes something

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.720 
series a few just a few chokes something
like<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.459> then<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:33.250> slide<00:02:34.250> into<00:02:34.550> the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
like that and then you slide into the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.440 
like that and then you slide into the
sixth<00:02:35.120> fret<00:02:35.270> of<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.510> D<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.940> then<00:02:37.940> play<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.270> g

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
sixth fret of the D and then play the g

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.130 
sixth fret of the D and then play the g
string<00:02:38.780> 6<00:02:39.050> fret<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:41.390> then<00:02:41.540> play<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> riff

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
string 6 fret and then play a riff

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:50.590 
string 6 fret and then play a riff
something<00:02:42.800> something<00:02:43.400> similar<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:49.600> five

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
something something similar to five

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.430 
something something similar to five
after<00:02:51.290> four<00:02:51.530> on<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.310> beat<00:02:52.959> six<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.110> four<00:02:54.350> of

after four on the beat six to four of
the<00:02:54.620> G<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:56.360> on<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:58.340> D<00:02:58.550> string<00:02:58.790> six<00:03:00.760> and

the G and on the the D string six and

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.320 
the G and on the the D string six and
then<00:03:02.030> we<00:03:02.060> slide<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.530> thirteenth<00:03:04.130> fret

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
that was d G D little pause then play

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.600 
that was d G D little pause then play
the<00:03:12.410> G<00:03:12.650> again<00:03:12.950> on<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.400> 13th

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:30.240

in<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:44.410> background<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.920> think<00:03:44.950> when<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.370> starts

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610

day now on biddies he's probably gonna

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:07.600
