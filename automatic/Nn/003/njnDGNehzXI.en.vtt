working<00:01:01.020> with<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.320> really<00:01:01.559> build<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.129> as

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
working with to really build up but as

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.770 
working with to really build up but as
you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.550> see<00:01:02.760> from<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> look<00:01:03.390> I'm<00:01:03.510> wearing

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you can see from the I look I'm wearing

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.630 
you can see from the I look I'm wearing
today<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.710> really<00:01:04.949> work<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.339> them<00:01:05.489> and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
today you can really work with them and

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.609 
today you can really work with them and
build<00:01:05.790> them<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.180> some<00:01:06.240> added<00:01:06.750> drama<00:01:07.049> but

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
build them to get some added drama but

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.890 
build them to get some added drama but
at<00:01:07.979> first<00:01:08.369> swipe<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.570> little

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
at first swipe this is a little

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.420 
at first swipe this is a little
disappointing<00:01:10.049> because<00:01:10.650> those<00:01:10.950> shadows<00:01:11.400> just

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
disappointing because those shadows just

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.880 
disappointing because those shadows just
don't<00:01:12.000> pick<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.299> quite<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:12.960> much<00:01:13.110> pigmentation

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
don't pick up quite as much pigmentation

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.219 
don't pick up quite as much pigmentation
as<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.310> would<00:01:14.430> hope<00:01:14.640> even<00:01:15.540> still<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.020> does

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
as you would hope even still it does

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.350 
as you would hope even still it does
contain<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.100> said<00:01:17.280> before<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.610> great<00:01:17.939> mix<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
contain as I said before a great mix of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.969 
contain as I said before a great mix of
Max<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.110> shimmers<00:01:19.530> which<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.799> really

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
Max and shimmers which is really

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.800 
Max and shimmers which is really
unprecedented<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.909> think<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.360> drugstore

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
unprecedented I think for the drugstore

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.649 
unprecedented I think for the drugstore
because<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.740> two<00:01:23.310> three<00:01:24.150> at<00:01:24.420> least

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
because you get one two three at least

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.020 
because you get one two three at least
