00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.009
 this fun world that for many years

 your ears have reached anonymously 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:26.919
 I started with Disneyland gold and 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.200
 presents between the magical world of color 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.809
 and I started to keep telling all this not 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.910
 then I kind of like I stayed with the 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.810
 voice and when I hear people 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.380

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.380

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.620
 movies there's double action has not 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.840
 disputed between goals but this one had to be 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.530
 a romantic moment if the gentleman 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.840
 fran in the first very famous series that 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.430
 I had to double and the character that 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.740
 played dub was called alf 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.130
 who talked like that and I started doing the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.220
 hello series william greets his friend 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.350
 gordon weiss no problem but the voice 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.450
 it is not the only work tool 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.880
 Histrionic ability is fundamental and 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.980
 you really have to be an actor in this 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.750
 kind of work that is a specialty 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.820
 the current ruling now or 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.580
 preference to fight or preference for 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.320
 fight and mother in the beautiful and although today 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.210
 in day the dubbing work has 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.010
 evolved with technology the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.300
 actors remember how hard their 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.520
 office in a beginning for 1953 in 10 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.409
 one thousand 53 three years after they have 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.780
 started the television 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.369
 if it started to bend intensely to 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.859
 slow down series that reached doctors 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.119
 all stacked in a single microphone and 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.850
 we all have to do it at the same 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.409
 time and well then I knew the one that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.590
 you got wrong the other one made a mistake 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.510
 tip now we work alone every each 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.760
 papers 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.850
 separately but then 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.360
 we work three or four on the lectern in 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.010
 the microphone and then meet up was 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.020

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.910
 a month or two months there doing them

 every day in the next delivery to 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.510
 Although film and television have 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.990
 found in the dubbing an industry 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.030
 profitable 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.680
 the actors raise their voices against 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.150
 the low salaries the tested with 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.740
