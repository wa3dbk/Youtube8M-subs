00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.510 

you

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.880 

in<00:00:37.520> the<00:00:37.730> track<00:00:37.970> we<00:00:38.240> can<00:00:38.420> test<00:00:38.690> three<00:00:39.620> obstacles

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
in the track we can test three obstacles

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.000 
in the track we can test three obstacles
in<00:00:40.660> these<00:00:41.660> ones<00:00:41.930> we<00:00:42.110> can<00:00:42.290> see<00:00:42.320> different

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
in these ones we can see different

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.400 
in these ones we can see different
features<00:00:43.550> of<00:00:43.580> the<00:00:43.850> car<00:00:44.060> some<00:00:44.600> obstacles<00:00:45.200> are

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
features of the car some obstacles are

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.590 
features of the car some obstacles are
by<00:00:45.620> title<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.310> see<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.610> maximum<00:00:46.820> capabilities

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
by title to see the maximum capabilities

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.340 
by title to see the maximum capabilities
of<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:47.870> car<00:00:48.080> we<00:00:48.620> can<00:00:48.650> now<00:00:49.340> pass<00:00:49.730> by<00:00:50.000> one<00:00:50.989> by<00:00:51.140> one

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
of the car we can now pass by one by one

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.070 
of the car we can now pass by one by one
and<00:00:51.560> then<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:51.770> can<00:00:52.010> explain<00:00:52.340> a<00:00:52.400> little<00:00:52.610> bit<00:00:52.879> how

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
and then I can explain a little bit how

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.910 
and then I can explain a little bit how
how<00:00:54.080> they<00:00:54.230> works<00:00:58.180> in<00:00:59.180> this<00:00:59.420> case<00:00:59.739> we<00:01:00.739> have<00:01:00.890> a

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
how they works in this case we have a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.000 
how they works in this case we have a
mountain<00:01:01.190> with<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.850> 30<00:01:02.449> degrees<00:01:02.980> slope<00:01:06.010> when

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
mountain with the 30 degrees slope when

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.730 
mountain with the 30 degrees slope when
we<00:01:07.220> are<00:01:07.400> half<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.300> way<00:01:08.570> up<00:01:08.720> we<00:01:09.290> can<00:01:09.470> see

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
we are half of the way up we can see

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.740 
we are half of the way up we can see
that<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.040> car<00:01:10.220> has<00:01:10.430> a<00:01:10.460> feature<00:01:11.240> which<00:01:11.540> is<00:01:11.720> the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
that the car has a feature which is the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.340 
that the car has a feature which is the
Hill<00:01:12.340> Start<00:01:13.340> Assist

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
Hill Start Assist

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.620 
Hill Start Assist
once<00:01:15.350> I<00:01:15.500> release<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.920> brake<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.399> car<00:01:16.940> holds

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
once I release the brake the car holds

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.070 
once I release the brake the car holds
three<00:01:18.440> seconds<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.520> then<00:01:19.880> before<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.869> car

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
three seconds and then before the car

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.989 
three seconds and then before the car
goes<00:01:21.350> I<00:01:21.680> just<00:01:22.100> can

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:23.999 
goes I just can

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:27.039 
goes I just can
give<00:01:24.539> throttle<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.289> the<00:01:25.530> car<00:01:25.710> easy<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.399> up

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
give throttle on the car easy going up

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.980 
give throttle on the car easy going up
completely<00:01:28.049> safe

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.790 

now<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:31.620> are<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.700> cinder<00:01:33.450> send

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
now we are going to do the cinder send

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.620 
now we are going to do the cinder send
so<00:01:34.800> we<00:01:34.950> connect<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.370> button<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.270> then

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
so we connect the button and then

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.060 
so we connect the button and then
basically<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.560> car<00:01:38.030> controls<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.690> paper<00:01:40.070> by

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
basically the car controls the paper by

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.160 
basically the car controls the paper by
braking<00:01:41.610> controlling<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.480> speed<00:01:42.690> very<00:01:42.990> low

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
braking controlling the speed very low

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.420 
braking controlling the speed very low
speed<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.740> then<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:44.910> can<00:01:45.620> go<00:01:46.620> down<00:01:46.650> perfectly

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
speed so then we can go down perfectly

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:56.250 
speed so then we can go down perfectly
without<00:01:47.580> any<00:01:48.000> race<00:01:48.960> very<00:01:49.890> safe

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.190 

in<00:01:56.740> this<00:01:56.950> idea<00:01:57.340> we<00:01:58.060> can<00:01:58.240> test<00:01:58.480> how<00:01:59.140> much

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
in this idea we can test how much

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.320 
in this idea we can test how much
suspension<00:02:00.040> travel<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.520> car<00:02:00.700> has<00:02:03.210> when<00:02:04.210> the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
suspension travel the car has when the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.770 
suspension travel the car has when the
car<00:02:04.540> goes<00:02:05.140> over<00:02:05.380> these<00:02:06.150> obstacles<00:02:07.150> some<00:02:07.630> of

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
car goes over these obstacles some of

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.690 
car goes over these obstacles some of
the<00:02:07.900> wheels<00:02:08.110> lose<00:02:08.890> contact<00:02:09.190> with<00:02:09.460> the<00:02:09.580> ground

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
the wheels lose contact with the ground

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.070 
the wheels lose contact with the ground
they<00:02:10.480> will<00:02:10.900> start<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.740> spin<00:02:12.010> without<00:02:12.790> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
they will start to spin without the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.660 
they will start to spin without the
giving<00:02:14.080> instruction<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.980> car<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
giving instruction to the car the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.520 
giving instruction to the car the
traction<00:02:16.090> control<00:02:16.120> detects<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.960> some

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
traction control detects that some

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.320 
traction control detects that some
wheels<00:02:17.770> are<00:02:17.980> turning<00:02:18.610> faster<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
wheels are turning faster that the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.200 
wheels are turning faster that the
opposite<00:02:19.840> one<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.920> car<00:02:21.130> gets<00:02:21.370> stopped<00:02:21.670> in

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
opposite one so the car gets stopped in

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.420 
opposite one so the car gets stopped in
that<00:02:22.450> moment<00:02:22.630> if<00:02:22.990> we<00:02:23.050> give<00:02:23.500> little<00:02:23.860> gas

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
that moment if we give little gas

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.090 
that moment if we give little gas
we<00:02:24.520> give<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.880> order<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.770> transfer<00:02:26.770> all<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
we give the order to transfer all the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.980 
we give the order to transfer all the
torque<00:02:27.310> from<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.790> width<00:02:28.120> which<00:02:28.270> is<00:02:28.300> spinning

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
torque from the width which is spinning

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.110 
torque from the width which is spinning
to<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.260> one<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.590> has<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:30.010> good<00:02:30.130> grip<00:02:30.430> in<00:02:30.670> that

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
to the one that has a good grip in that

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:39.710 
to the one that has a good grip in that
moment<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:32.200> car<00:02:32.380> get<00:02:32.620> out<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.640> obstacle

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.460 

now<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.900> here

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
now in here

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.700 
now in here
weight<00:02:41.740> distribution<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.850> obstacle<00:02:43.470> we<00:02:44.470> can

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
weight distribution this obstacle we can

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.940 
weight distribution this obstacle we can
see<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.850> weight<00:02:46.030> distribution<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.750> car

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
see the weight distribution of the car

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.410 
see the weight distribution of the car
the<00:02:47.950> pickup's<00:02:48.310> has<00:02:48.520> more<00:02:49.060> weight<00:02:49.180> at<00:02:49.390> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the pickup's has more weight at the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.480 
the pickup's has more weight at the
front<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:49.990> in<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.410> obstacle<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.160> car<00:02:51.310> will

front so in this obstacle the car will
fall<00:02:51.840> sooner<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:52.870> for<00:02:53.320> example<00:02:53.710> a

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
fall sooner that for example a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.330 
fall sooner that for example a
pathfinder

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
pathfinder

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.310 
pathfinder
at<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.090> same<00:02:55.300> time<00:02:55.540> when<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.840> carries<00:02:56.140> with

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
at the same time when the carries with

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.890 
at the same time when the carries with
the<00:02:56.470> two<00:02:56.680> diagonal<00:02:57.190> wheels<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:58.270> car<00:02:58.450> has<00:02:58.870> a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
the two diagonal wheels the car has a

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.670 
the two diagonal wheels the car has a
torsion<00:02:59.500> so<00:02:59.860> we<00:03:00.010> can<00:03:00.190> see<00:03:00.430> if<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.880> car<00:03:01.060> is

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
torsion so we can see if the car is

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.070 
torsion so we can see if the car is
really<00:03:02.680> stiff<00:03:02.950> really<00:03:03.400> strong<00:03:03.850> so<00:03:04.840> now<00:03:05.020> you

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
really stiff really strong so now you

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.460 
really stiff really strong so now you
can<00:03:05.380> see<00:03:05.620> how<00:03:05.830> tough<00:03:06.820> and<00:03:07.120> smart<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:08.080> pickup

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
can see how tough and smart this pickup

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.170 
can see how tough and smart this pickup
is

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
is

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.300 
is
what<00:03:10.780> we<00:03:10.930> want<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.260> do<00:03:11.500> always<00:03:11.829> with<00:03:12.189> these

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
what we want to do always with these

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.869 
what we want to do always with these
trucks<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:12.909> to<00:03:13.209> make<00:03:13.930> easy<00:03:14.799> driving<00:03:15.159> some
