their child they really can't be on the
road<00:04:12.810> it's<00:04:13.200> way<00:04:13.440> too<00:04:13.500> hard<00:04:13.830> especially<00:04:14.070> for<00:04:14.400> a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
road it's way too hard especially for a

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.660 
road it's way too hard especially for a
mother<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.330> raise<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.930> child<00:04:16.170> while<00:04:17.160> on<00:04:17.460> the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
road so this sadly could be the end of

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.460 
road so this sadly could be the end of
