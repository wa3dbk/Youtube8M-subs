firing rocket mechanism right yeah and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.060 
firing rocket mechanism right yeah and
there<00:00:49.780> was<00:00:49.900> a<00:00:49.930> different<00:00:50.320> prototype<00:00:50.890> but

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
there was a different prototype but

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.580

picturing very colorful armor and didn't
really<00:00:56.140> look<00:00:56.260> like<00:00:56.320> what<00:00:56.500> Boba<00:00:56.920> Fett<00:00:57.100> appeal

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
really look like what Boba Fett appeal

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.640 
really look like what Boba Fett appeal
on<00:00:58.330> the<00:00:58.480> back<00:00:58.630> of<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.810> package<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.290> your<00:00:59.410> mail

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
on the back of the package and your mail

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.040

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
get a Boba Fett with a firing rocket

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.010 
get a Boba Fett with a firing rocket
right<00:01:06.370> because<00:01:07.030> there<00:01:07.180> were<00:01:07.270> some<00:01:07.420> incidents

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
right because there were some incidents

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.260 
right because there were some incidents
I<00:01:08.140> guess<00:01:08.380> back<00:01:08.560> then<00:01:08.620> with<00:01:09.370> firing<00:01:09.730> mechanisms

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
I guess back then with firing mechanisms

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.850 
I guess back then with firing mechanisms
and<00:01:10.420> lawsuits<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.960> guess<00:01:11.110> them<00:01:11.260> to<00:01:11.409> China<00:01:11.620> died

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
and lawsuits I guess them to China died

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.970 
and lawsuits I guess them to China died
army<00:01:12.220> I<00:01:12.430> don't<00:01:12.820> know<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:14.140> decided<00:01:14.830> not<00:01:14.920> to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
army I don't know they decided not to

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.010

ask<00:01:15.310> about<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.760> firing<00:01:16.000> mechanism<00:01:16.659> they

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
ask about the firing mechanism they

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.600 
ask about the firing mechanism they
produced<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.500> few<00:01:17.740> prototypes<00:01:18.070> which<00:01:18.520> were

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
produced a few prototypes which were

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.399 
produced a few prototypes which were

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
a that'd be an L slot when you say it

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.800 
a that'd be an L slot when you say it
looks<00:05:50.680> like<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.860> yeah<00:05:51.100> L<00:05:51.340> because<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.240> j1<00:05:52.630> had

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
looks like the yeah L because the j1 had

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.260 
looks like the yeah L because the j1 had
more<00:05:52.990> of<00:05:53.080> a<00:05:53.170> loop<00:05:53.410> so<00:05:54.310> there's<00:05:54.520> what<00:05:54.970> the<00:05:55.120> back

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
more of a loop so there's what the back

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.930 
more of a loop so there's what the back
of<00:05:55.420> them<00:05:55.540> looks<00:05:55.720> like<00:05:56.520> there's<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:57.760> one

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
of them looks like there's the one

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.810 
of them looks like there's the one
missile<00:05:58.380> that's<00:05:59.380> tiny<00:05:59.800> so<00:06:00.310> with<00:06:00.490> that<00:06:00.610> one

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
missile that's tiny so with that one

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:06.729 
fire this the way the way it was like

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:08.189

that's<00:07:06.940> not<00:07:07.090> the<00:07:07.210> one<00:07:07.330> to<00:07:07.419> fly<00:07:07.540> this<00:07:07.660> Mike<00:07:08.020> I

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 
that's not the one to fly this Mike I

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.290 
that's not the one to fly this Mike I
think<00:07:08.410> that's<00:07:08.530> just<00:07:08.650> one<00:07:08.860> to<00:07:09.010> show<00:07:09.060> okay<00:07:10.060> cuz

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 
think that's just one to show okay cuz

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.370 
think that's just one to show okay cuz
if<00:07:10.419> there's<00:07:10.810> nothing<00:07:11.020> that<00:07:11.139> that's<00:07:11.290> gonna

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
if there's nothing that that's gonna

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.219 
if there's nothing that that's gonna
grip<00:07:11.710> it<00:07:11.860> into<00:07:12.130> launch<00:07:13.120> I<00:07:13.510> think<00:07:13.750> that<00:07:14.050> just

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:14.229 
grip it into launch I think that just

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.040 
grip it into launch I think that just
want<00:07:14.440> to<00:07:14.620> sort<00:07:15.010> of<00:07:15.130> match<00:07:15.490> the<00:07:16.050> regular

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
want to sort of match the regular

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.840 
want to sort of match the regular
advantage<00:07:17.650> okay<00:07:18.010> this<00:07:18.310> must<00:07:18.490> be<00:07:18.669> the

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:18.850 
advantage okay this must be the

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.390 
advantage okay this must be the
projectile<00:07:19.270> filing<00:07:20.050> one<00:07:20.199> lost<00:07:20.410> that<00:07:20.620> -<00:07:20.860> all
