00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
this tank she can see him taking a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
forward position here on more I think

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.869 
forward position here on more I think
and<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> matchmaking<00:00:52.200> is<00:00:52.379> pretty<00:00:52.559> even<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
and the matchmaking is pretty even to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:54.260 
and the matchmaking is pretty even to
yourself

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
yourself

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.200 
yourself
at<00:00:54.510> most<00:00:54.809> which<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.829> always<00:00:56.100> good<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.399> us<00:00:56.670> this

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
at most which is always good for us this

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.400 
at most which is always good for us this
thing<00:00:57.420> does<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.840> preferential<00:00:58.350> matchmaking

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
thing does get preferential matchmaking

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.760 
thing does get preferential matchmaking
this<00:00:59.039> means<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.730> only<00:01:00.000> sees<00:01:00.960> tier<00:01:01.559> 8

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
this means that it only sees tier 8

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.810 
this means that it only sees tier 8
tanks<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.160> doesn't<00:01:02.399> see<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.670> any<00:01:02.879> t90<00:01:03.390> tanks<00:01:04.820> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
tanks it doesn't see to any t90 tanks so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.740 
tanks it doesn't see to any t90 tanks so
she<00:01:05.940> can<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.210> taking<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.479> forward

three<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.210> half<00:04:04.360> seconds<00:04:04.750> which<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:04.900> quite

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
three and a half seconds which is quite

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.190 
three and a half seconds which is quite
fast<00:04:05.500> which<00:04:06.460> kind<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.760> makes<00:04:06.910> up<00:04:07.090> for<00:04:07.300> it<00:04:07.390> we've

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
fast which kind of makes up for it we've

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.530 
fast which kind of makes up for it we've
done<00:04:08.230> about<00:04:08.470> 2,000<00:04:09.460> damage<00:04:09.670> right<00:04:09.790> now<00:04:09.850> also<00:04:10.240> I
