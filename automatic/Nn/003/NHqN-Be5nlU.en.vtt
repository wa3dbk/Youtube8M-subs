I'm<00:00:08.910> here<00:00:09.300> today<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.540> talk<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.900> you

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
I'm here today to talk to you

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.410 
I'm here today to talk to you
elements<00:00:11.830> compounds<00:00:12.040> and<00:00:12.459> mixtures<00:00:12.549> you

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
elements compounds and mixtures you

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.840 
elements compounds and mixtures you
thought<00:00:13.599> you<00:00:13.690> can<00:00:13.750> say

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
thought you can say

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.129 
thought you can say
but<00:00:14.970> it<00:00:15.060> actually<00:00:15.210> serves<00:00:15.570> as<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> very<00:00:15.960> good

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
but it actually serves as a very good

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.820 
but it actually serves as a very good
example<00:00:16.200> of<00:00:16.860> that<00:00:18.230> we<00:00:19.230> reach<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.590> here<00:00:19.770> and

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
example of that we reach in here and

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.910 
example of that we reach in here and
take<00:00:20.130> out<00:00:20.370> a<00:00:21.320> couple<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.410> these<00:00:22.530> wonderful

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
take out a couple of these wonderful

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.210 
take out a couple of these wonderful
flakes<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:25.110> very<00:00:25.320> fact<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.770> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.070> look

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
flakes the very fact that you can look

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.340 
flakes the very fact that you can look
at<00:00:26.340> these<00:00:26.520> and<00:00:26.850> see<00:00:27.119> different<00:00:27.600> gradients<00:00:28.200> of

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
at these and see different gradients of

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
at these and see different gradients of
brown<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.119> brown<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.470> more<00:00:31.470> brown<00:00:31.710> but

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:32.370 
brown and brown and more brown but

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.220 
brown and brown and more brown but
different<00:00:32.730> shades<00:00:33.150> of<00:00:33.300> brown<00:00:33.420> tells<00:00:33.930> us<00:00:34.080> right

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
different shades of brown tells us right

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.350 
different shades of brown tells us right
away<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.590> know<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> mixture<00:00:35.220> and<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
away we know it's a mixture and a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.860 
away we know it's a mixture and a
mixture<00:00:36.629> of<00:00:36.720> what<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.170> might<00:00:37.350> ask<00:00:37.760> well<00:00:38.870> they

is<00:00:55.650> that<00:00:55.940> there's<00:00:56.940> iron<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.979> this<00:00:58.979> cereal<00:00:59.370> well

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
is that there's iron in this cereal well

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.670 
is that there's iron in this cereal well
you<00:01:00.479> say<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.750> course<00:01:00.989> there's<00:01:01.140> iron<00:01:01.409> that's

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you say of course there's iron that's

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.369 
you say of course there's iron that's
important<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.190> your<00:01:02.339> diet<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.870> important

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
important for your diet it is important

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.289 
important for your diet it is important
to<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.620> your<00:01:04.710> diet<00:01:05.299> hemoglobin

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
to have in your diet hemoglobin

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.620 
to have in your diet hemoglobin
molecules<00:01:07.080> which<00:01:07.710> transport<00:01:08.370> oxygen<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
molecules which transport oxygen in the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.670 
molecules which transport oxygen in the
blood

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
blood

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.190 
blood
they<00:01:10.920> rely<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.250> iron<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> same

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
they rely on iron but is that the same

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.320 
they rely on iron but is that the same
kind<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.530> iron<00:01:13.770> students<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:14.610> know<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:15.000> like

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
kind of iron students one know as like

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.899 
kind of iron students one know as like
cars<00:01:16.110> are<00:01:16.320> made<00:01:16.440> of<00:01:16.590> hammers<00:01:17.370> and<00:01:17.520> nails<00:01:17.670> are

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
cars are made of hammers and nails are

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.090 
cars are made of hammers and nails are
made<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.180> yes<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:20.060> well<00:01:21.500> if<00:01:22.500> there<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.829> in

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
made of yes it is well if there is in

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.639 
made of yes it is well if there is in
fact<00:01:23.130> iron<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:24.119> these<00:01:24.960> flakes<00:01:25.289> you<00:01:25.530> would

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
fact iron in these flakes you would

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.429 
fact iron in these flakes you would
think<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.250> maybe<00:01:26.729> they'd<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.630> attracted<00:01:28.320> by

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
think that maybe they'd be attracted by

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.590 
think that maybe they'd be attracted by
a<00:01:28.469> powerful<00:01:29.100> magnet<00:01:29.460> now<00:01:30.329> I've<00:01:30.420> got<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
a powerful magnet now I've got a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.499 
a powerful magnet now I've got a
neodymium<00:01:31.289> magnet<00:01:31.649> right<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.509> it's

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
neodymium magnet right here and it's

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.440 
neodymium magnet right here and it's
very<00:01:33.840> powerful<00:01:34.109> I<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.609> go<00:01:35.609> there<00:01:36.180> there's

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
very powerful I can go there there's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.109 
very powerful I can go there there's
some<00:01:36.630> iron<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.079> blender<00:01:37.859> oh<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.799> if<00:01:41.119> there

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
some iron in that blender oh so if there

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.580 
some iron in that blender oh so if there
is<00:01:42.270> iron<00:01:42.570> these<00:01:42.780> flakes<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.259> should<00:01:43.439> see<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
is iron these flakes we should see a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.020 
is iron these flakes we should see a
definite<00:01:43.920> attraction<00:01:44.399> between<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.759> flakes

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
definite attraction between the flakes

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.849 
definite attraction between the flakes
and<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.689> magnet<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.289> we<00:01:46.380> go<00:01:46.530> I'm<00:01:46.770> going

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
and the magnet so here we go I'm going

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.209 
and the magnet so here we go I'm going
to<00:01:47.009> bring<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.250> up<00:01:47.369> next<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.850> them<00:01:48.979> I'm<00:01:49.979> not

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
to bring this up next to them I'm not

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.569 
to bring this up next to them I'm not
seeing<00:01:50.490> much<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:52.009> well<00:01:53.009> not<00:01:53.340> even<00:01:53.369> that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
seeing much here well not even that

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.690 
seeing much here well not even that
little<00:01:53.789> guy<00:01:54.109> hmm<00:01:55.140> well<00:01:55.979> there<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.579> an

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
little guy hmm well there is an

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.849 
little guy hmm well there is an
attraction<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.479> because<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.140> iron<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.679> there

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
attraction but because the iron in there

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.340 
attraction but because the iron in there
is<00:01:58.979> rather<00:01:59.249> low<00:01:59.579> concentration<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:01.170> not

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
is rather low concentration it's not

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.480 
is rather low concentration it's not
that<00:02:01.530> strong<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.070> there's<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> lot<00:02:02.369> of

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
that strong and there's a lot of

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.770 
that strong and there's a lot of
friction<00:02:02.700> between<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.270> flakes<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
friction between the flakes and the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.760 
friction between the flakes and the
table<00:02:04.549> so<00:02:05.549> here's<00:02:05.729> an<00:02:05.850> idea<00:02:06.469> we'll<00:02:07.469> put<00:02:07.649> these

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
table so here's an idea we'll put these

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.160 
table so here's an idea we'll put these
flakes<00:02:08.130> in<00:02:08.280> their<00:02:08.399> natural<00:02:08.820> environment<00:02:09.300> that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
flakes in their natural environment that

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.449 
flakes in their natural environment that
is<00:02:10.350> floating<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.860> little<00:02:10.890> Bowl

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.160 

and<00:02:14.640> I'm<00:02:15.209> going<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.390> fill<00:02:15.599> this<00:02:15.720> petri<00:02:15.959> dish

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and I'm going to fill this petri dish

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.910 
and I'm going to fill this petri dish
actually<00:02:16.379> up<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:17.310> way<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:17.879> top<00:02:18.180> and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
actually up all the way to the top and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.119 
actually up all the way to the top and
then<00:02:19.920> some<00:02:20.569> so<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.720> they<00:02:21.840> float<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.920> like

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
then some so that they float just like

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.429 
then some so that they float just like
that<00:02:26.599> they<00:02:27.599> don't<00:02:27.720> tend<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.989> go<00:02:28.079> toward<00:02:28.349> the

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
that they don't tend to go toward the

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.119 
that they don't tend to go toward the
surface<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> sides<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:29.840> now<00:02:30.950> if<00:02:31.950> you

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
surface to the sides and now if you

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.270 
surface to the sides and now if you
watch<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.609> you<00:02:32.819> can<00:02:32.970> definitely<00:02:33.150> see<00:02:33.629> an

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
watch this you can definitely see an

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.849 
watch this you can definitely see an
attraction<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.609> magnet<00:02:36.000> or<00:02:36.530> they<00:02:37.530> go<00:02:37.680> like

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
attraction to the magnet or they go like

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.890 
attraction to the magnet or they go like
this<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.459> have<00:02:38.579> it<00:02:38.730> switch<00:02:39.209> directions

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
this I can have it switch directions

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.110 
this I can have it switch directions
oh<00:02:40.250> there's<00:02:41.250> quite<00:02:41.640> an<00:02:41.790> attraction<00:02:44.120> let's

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
oh there's quite an attraction let's

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.960 
oh there's quite an attraction let's
look<00:02:45.269> at<00:02:45.359> this<00:02:45.480> small<00:02:45.750> flake<00:02:46.049> we<00:02:46.200> had<00:02:46.349> there

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
look at this small flake we had there

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.250 
look at this small flake we had there
it's<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.030> good<00:02:48.209> question<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.780> could<00:02:48.870> be<00:02:49.019> more

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
it's a good question is it could be more

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.399 
it's a good question is it could be more
attracted<00:02:49.799> by<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.370> magnet<00:02:50.760> or<00:02:50.879> less<00:02:51.200> it's<00:02:52.200> got

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
attracted by the magnet or less it's got

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.369 
attracted by the magnet or less it's got
less<00:02:53.190> mass<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:54.150> less<00:02:54.329> inertia<00:02:54.599> but<00:02:55.139> it's<00:02:55.260> also

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
less mass so less inertia but it's also

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.800 
less mass so less inertia but it's also
got<00:02:55.560> less<00:02:55.709> iron<00:02:55.920> whoo<00:02:56.730> look<00:02:57.359> at<00:02:57.480> those<00:02:57.599> two

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
got less iron whoo look at those two

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.750 
got less iron whoo look at those two
they<00:02:57.959> got<00:02:58.079> magnetized<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.829> attracted<00:02:59.730> to

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
they got magnetized and attracted to

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.390 
they got magnetized and attracted to
each<00:02:59.849> other<00:02:59.939> I<00:03:00.090> guess<00:03:00.379> let's<00:03:01.379> see<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.650> here

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.559 

they<00:03:05.400> definitely<00:03:05.849> seems<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.060> be<00:03:06.150> attracted

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
they definitely seems to be attracted

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.429 
they definitely seems to be attracted
pretty<00:03:06.720> quickly<00:03:06.930> too<00:03:08.030> hmm<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.900> there<00:03:10.079> is<00:03:10.200> iron

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
pretty quickly too hmm so there is iron

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.259 
pretty quickly too hmm so there is iron
and<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:11.040> might<00:03:11.220> be<00:03:11.370> able<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.549> judge<00:03:11.849> different

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
and you might be able to judge different

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.819 
and you might be able to judge different
iron<00:03:12.450> contents<00:03:13.019> of<00:03:13.079> these<00:03:13.170> cereals<00:03:13.500> by<00:03:13.590> having

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
iron contents of these cereals by having

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.210 
iron contents of these cereals by having
little<00:03:13.980> flake<00:03:14.609> races<00:03:15.150> across<00:03:15.389> the<00:03:15.480> bowl

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
little flake races across the bowl

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.289 
little flake races across the bowl
another<00:03:17.220> thing<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.459> might<00:03:17.609> try<00:03:17.819> doing<00:03:18.060> though

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
another thing you might try doing though

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.650 
another thing you might try doing though
is<00:03:18.799> extracting<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:19.919> iron<00:03:20.190> from<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.209> cereal

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
is extracting that iron from the cereal

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.780 
is extracting that iron from the cereal
and<00:03:22.319> that's<00:03:22.500> rather<00:03:22.709> easy<00:03:22.949> to<00:03:23.099> do<00:03:23.280> that's<00:03:23.669> why

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and that's rather easy to do that's why

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.789 
and that's rather easy to do that's why
I<00:03:23.819> have<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.060> blender<00:03:24.389> for<00:03:24.599> so<00:03:25.470> I'm<00:03:25.560> going<00:03:25.739> to

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
I have this blender for so I'm going to

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:35.229 
I have this blender for so I'm going to
put<00:03:26.010> about<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.430> cup<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.940> water<00:03:29.540> in<00:03:30.540> our<00:03:30.989> blender

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:42.170 

and<00:03:38.810> about<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.840> cup<00:03:40.079> of<00:03:40.199> cereal<00:03:41.180> which

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
and about a cup of cereal which

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.839 
and about a cup of cereal which
according<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.930> label<00:03:43.139> is<00:03:43.669> how<00:03:44.669> many

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
according to the label is how many

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.719 
according to the label is how many
servings<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.359> that<00:03:45.889> well<00:03:46.889> about<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.280> serving

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
servings is that well about a serving

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.750 
servings is that well about a serving
3/4<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.840> cup<00:03:48.870> is<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.139> serving<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:50.430> we'll<00:03:50.669> get

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
3/4 of a cup is a serving so we'll get

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.369 
3/4 of a cup is a serving so we'll get
an<00:03:50.849> idea<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.090> how<00:03:51.180> much<00:03:51.329> iron<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:51.870> get<00:03:52.079> when

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
an idea of how much iron you get when

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.030 
an idea of how much iron you get when
you<00:03:52.440> have<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> bowl<00:03:52.859> of<00:03:52.889> total<00:03:54.409> in<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.739> morning

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
you have a bowl of total in the morning

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.219 
you have a bowl of total in the morning
okay

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:57.229 
okay

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.289 
okay
so<00:03:58.229> here<00:03:58.590> we<00:03:58.680> go<00:03:59.040> now<00:03:59.699> I'm<00:03:59.760> going<00:03:59.909> to<00:03:59.940> blend<00:04:00.180> it

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
so here we go now I'm going to blend it

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.699 
so here we go now I'm going to blend it
for<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.810> little<00:04:00.900> while<00:04:01.019> it's<00:04:01.440> gonna<00:04:01.530> be<00:04:01.650> a

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
for a little while it's gonna be a

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:24.129 
for a little while it's gonna be a
rather<00:04:01.889> noisy<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.819> here<00:04:03.090> we<00:04:03.150> go

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.960 

that's<00:04:25.139> something<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:25.590> could<00:04:25.740> call<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.189> serial

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
that's something you could call a serial

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.230 
that's something you could call a serial
dilution<00:04:27.590> that's<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.680> joke<00:04:28.860> sorry<00:04:29.159> anyway<00:04:29.610> um

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
dilution that's a joke sorry anyway um

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.429 
dilution that's a joke sorry anyway um
bad<00:04:30.750> joke<00:04:30.990> we're<00:04:31.770> going<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.629> yeah<00:04:33.659> we're<00:04:34.319> going

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:36.469 
bad joke we're going to yeah we're going
to<00:04:34.500> pour<00:04:34.770> this<00:04:34.919> off<00:04:35.159> into<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.460> cup<00:04:35.729> here<00:04:36.000> mmm

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.379 
nice and rich and I'm gonna actually
pour<00:04:41.189> back<00:04:41.400> a<00:04:41.430> little<00:04:41.729> bit<00:04:41.819> here<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.150> try<00:04:42.360> to

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
pour back a little bit here to try to

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.300 
pour back a little bit here to try to
rinse<00:04:43.139> out<00:04:43.379> that<00:04:43.620> sludge<00:04:44.009> in<00:04:44.189> the<00:04:44.219> bottom

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
rinse out that sludge in the bottom

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.800 
rinse out that sludge in the bottom
because<00:04:44.699> I<00:04:44.789> know<00:04:44.849> there's<00:04:45.150> some<00:04:45.330> iron<00:04:45.569> down

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
because I know there's some iron down

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.730 
because I know there's some iron down
there<00:04:46.909> okay<00:04:49.129> and<00:04:50.240> now<00:04:51.240> when<00:04:52.199> you<00:04:52.319> do<00:04:52.439> this<00:04:52.590> you

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
there okay and now when you do this you

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.779 
there okay and now when you do this you
want<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:52.979> make<00:04:53.189> sure<00:04:53.219> you<00:04:53.400> use<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.550> plastic

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
want to make sure you use a plastic

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.200 
want to make sure you use a plastic
spoon<00:04:54.330> because<00:04:55.669> otherwise<00:04:56.669> you're<00:04:57.060> going<00:04:57.150> to

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
spoon because otherwise you're going to

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.450 
spoon because otherwise you're going to
get<00:04:57.360> stuck<00:04:57.569> to<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:57.900> spoon<00:04:58.349> here<00:04:58.560> and<00:04:58.620> I'm<00:04:59.280> just

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
get stuck to the spoon here and I'm just

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.040 
get stuck to the spoon here and I'm just
going<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.639> hold<00:04:59.819> this<00:04:59.969> magnet<00:05:00.449> in<00:05:00.539> place<00:05:00.750> for<00:05:00.990> a

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
going to hold this magnet in place for a

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.959 
going to hold this magnet in place for a
while<00:05:01.229> as<00:05:01.469> I<00:05:01.620> stir<00:05:01.919> this<00:05:02.069> around<00:05:04.580> if<00:05:05.580> you<00:05:05.759> make

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:05.969 
while as I stir this around if you make

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:07.969 
while as I stir this around if you make
the<00:05:06.240> this<00:05:06.750> is<00:05:06.930> called<00:05:07.139> a<00:05:07.199> slurry<00:05:07.560> if<00:05:07.770> you<00:05:07.860> make

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
the this is called a slurry if you make

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.700 
the this is called a slurry if you make
the<00:05:08.099> slurry<00:05:08.400> too<00:05:08.879> thick<00:05:09.379> it'll<00:05:10.379> be<00:05:10.440> hard<00:05:10.680> for

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
the slurry too thick it'll be hard for

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.529 
the slurry too thick it'll be hard for
the<00:05:10.889> iron<00:05:11.069> to<00:05:11.219> get<00:05:11.400> through<00:05:11.729> so<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:12.449> this

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
the iron to get through so it's this

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.570 
the iron to get through so it's this
pretty<00:05:12.719> liquidy<00:05:12.960> here<00:05:13.349> and<00:05:14.159> I<00:05:14.219> think<00:05:14.370> you<00:05:14.430> can

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
pretty liquidy here and I think you can

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.730 
pretty liquidy here and I think you can
already<00:05:14.729> see<00:05:15.210> if<00:05:15.629> I<00:05:15.719> move<00:05:15.990> this<00:05:16.169> magnet<00:05:16.560> to<00:05:16.620> the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
already see if I move this magnet to the

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.820 
already see if I move this magnet to the
side<00:05:16.949> a<00:05:17.509> little<00:05:18.509> spot<00:05:18.840> of<00:05:18.990> iron<00:05:19.259> that's<00:05:19.529> form

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
side a little spot of iron that's form

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.100 
side a little spot of iron that's form
there<00:05:20.270> it<00:05:21.270> was<00:05:21.389> in<00:05:21.509> there<00:05:21.629> there's<00:05:21.810> plenty

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
there it was in there there's plenty

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.300 
there it was in there there's plenty
more<00:05:22.139> in<00:05:22.289> there<00:05:22.500> though<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:22.860> we'll<00:05:22.949> collect<00:05:23.129> a

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
more in there though so we'll collect a

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.550 
more in there though so we'll collect a
little<00:05:23.490> bit<00:05:23.580> more<00:05:25.129> this<00:05:26.129> really<00:05:27.440> disgusts<00:05:28.440> the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
little bit more this really disgusts the

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.469 
little bit more this really disgusts the
students<00:05:28.979> like<00:05:29.550> they<00:05:30.000> don't<00:05:30.150> like<00:05:30.240> to<00:05:30.330> see

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
students like they don't like to see

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.570 
students like they don't like to see
cereal<00:05:30.870> blended<00:05:31.169> with<00:05:31.289> water<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:31.770> they

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
cereal blended with water and they

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.550 
cereal blended with water and they
certainly<00:05:32.879> don't<00:05:33.060> like<00:05:33.240> to<00:05:33.360> see<00:05:33.569> elemental

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
certainly don't like to see elemental

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.070 
certainly don't like to see elemental
iron<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:35.279> kind<00:05:35.490> of<00:05:35.610> iron<00:05:36.330> that's<00:05:36.599> in<00:05:36.719> nails

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
iron the kind of iron that's in nails

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.680 
iron the kind of iron that's in nails
and<00:05:37.500> car<00:05:37.800> bodies<00:05:38.129> in<00:05:38.339> their<00:05:39.000> breakfast<00:05:39.389> cereal

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
and car bodies in their breakfast cereal

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.059 
and car bodies in their breakfast cereal
but<00:05:39.870> it's<00:05:40.020> important<00:05:40.440> from<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.620> realize<00:05:40.919> that

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.069 
but it's important from the realize that

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.519 
but it's important from the realize that
that's<00:05:41.159> an<00:05:41.550> important<00:05:42.029> nutrient<00:05:42.539> mineral<00:05:43.440> for

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
that's an important nutrient mineral for

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.290 
that's an important nutrient mineral for
them<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.710> have<00:05:43.800> in<00:05:43.889> their<00:05:44.009> diets<00:05:44.339> now<00:05:45.060> once

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
them to have in their diets now once

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.999 
them to have in their diets now once
it's<00:05:45.419> in<00:05:45.509> the<00:05:45.599> body<00:05:45.810> of<00:05:45.930> course<00:05:46.259> it<00:05:46.440> digests

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
it's in the body of course it digests

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.939 
it's in the body of course it digests
and<00:05:47.099> it<00:05:47.400> gets<00:05:47.610> converted<00:05:47.940> into<00:05:48.270> iron<00:05:48.509> ions<00:05:49.050> but

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
and it gets converted into iron ions but

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.480 
and it gets converted into iron ions but
it<00:05:50.190> is<00:05:50.370> in<00:05:50.550> there<00:05:50.759> is<00:05:50.969> elemental<00:05:51.690> iron<00:05:52.190> so<00:05:53.190> here

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
it is in there is elemental iron so here

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.459 
it is in there is elemental iron so here
I<00:05:53.520> think<00:05:53.699> we<00:05:53.759> get<00:05:53.879> a<00:05:53.940> good<00:05:54.060> picture<00:05:54.330> of<00:05:54.449> and<00:05:55.409> I

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
I think we get a good picture of and I

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:56.839 
I think we get a good picture of and I
don't<00:05:55.560> think<00:05:55.740> I've<00:05:55.800> gotten<00:05:56.009> at<00:05:56.159> all<00:05:56.310> I<00:05:56.520> don't

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
don't think I've gotten at all I don't

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.029 
don't think I've gotten at all I don't
know<00:05:57.029> how<00:05:57.150> long<00:05:57.300> I<00:05:57.389> have<00:05:57.509> to<00:05:57.539> start<00:05:57.810> to<00:05:58.020> get<00:05:58.889> all

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
know how long I have to start to get all

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.589 
know how long I have to start to get all
to<00:05:59.159> come<00:05:59.310> out<00:05:59.430> but<00:05:59.759> I've<00:06:00.210> gotten<00:06:00.419> a<00:06:00.479> good
