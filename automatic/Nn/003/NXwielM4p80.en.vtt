00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.170
 well the answer is not simple you 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.070
 you can see it an answer of faith would be 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:21.130
 that as believers in the word of God 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:23.470
 we know what is revealed is inspired 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.850
 and these are realities that are allowed 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.050
 by faith 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.900
 and that if the scientific part is 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.720
 secondary revelations the initiative 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.870
 divine by which the god himself sought 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.260
 transmit your mind and your heart your 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.020
 will your wishes and your laws to the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.680
 human creature through a group of 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.910
 chosen intermediaries or first 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.440
 human transmitters of revelation 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.420
 divine 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.839
 run couples with the revelation 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.730
 the theme of divine inspiration we say 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.420
 divine inspiration and the action of 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.909
 god through his spirit he kept 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.149
 this transmission of his pure thought 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.119
 and faithful until you become a 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.070
 book that today we call bible that 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.830
 initially this revelation had to be 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.930
 have given orally and then when 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.280
 appeared the writing became 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.440
 concrete revelation described 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.350
 that's why we affirm that the word of God 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.110
 is inspired as much as the word 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.229
 of God is revealed this is the answer 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.630
 of faith to the initial question about the 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.860
 reliability of the word of God to the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.810
 bible can not be read in its fullness and 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.450
 in all its scope only with the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.110
 human mind with the human resources of 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.320
 the reason not even with the resources 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.899
 scientists who are also limited 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.780
 we have a superior faculty that god 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.390
 give to those who ask and who comes 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.690
 to him who is called faith faith we 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.750
 allows you to understand many truths 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.520
 many realities than the simple reason 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.550
 human and human knowledge do not 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.680
 allow to understand and the bible the best 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.800
 way to understand and understand it is to 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.580
 through faith but we can still have 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.790
 criteria and let's say empirical real 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.480
 concrete that this is the word of God 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.060
 that your content is not content 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.700
 grossly gross of the human mind 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.430
 the wonders that the word of God has 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.950
 made over the centuries in the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.620
 individuals and in the towns of the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.170
 which you and I are maybe an example 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.000
 the transformation that this can do 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.400
 word in our inner lives 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.170
 outside mind the influence that I have 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.620
 had in different civilizations to 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.630
 through centuries and centuries of history 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.550
 they show us that it is not a book 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.459
 whatever is a book that comes from 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.700
 a higher mind than the divided mind 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.360
 because 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.120
 the experts the theologians the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.670
 anthropologists when they study the text 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.170
 sacred discovers what is called the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.319
 internal criteria 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.750
 that is a special book what are 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.510
 the internal criteria are the same 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.630
 beauty that transcends any beauty 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.870
 human the same penetration of the message 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.480
 which is not and can not be the invention of a 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.150
 simple man the same power of the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:36.510
 word in itself as it says isaiah 55 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.090
 does not return never made without effect 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.610
 in the mind and heart and in the life of 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.260
 those who approach her those are 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.830
 what we call the internal criteria 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.410
 and many more later if we want to study 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.360
 thoroughly the script we will find 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.610
 that we not only have arguments from 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.220
 faith to know what it is 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.370
 revealed truth truly inspired by 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.580
 god and it still is but also 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.230
 empirical arguments 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.990
 story arguments arguments 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.330
 cultural external internal arguments 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.360
 of the word itself as a book that was 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.360
 fact revealed by god but through 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.000
 of human language and they assure us 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.930
 that is still a current book 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.640
 relevant and very useful and 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.680
 importance for all generations 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.950
 inducing the world's today 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.950
 postmodern
