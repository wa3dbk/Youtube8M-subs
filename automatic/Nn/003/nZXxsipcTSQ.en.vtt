do its control find ya see what the
problem<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:24.450> go<00:01:24.600> remember<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.020> game<00:01:25.229> was

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
problem is you go remember this game was

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.830 
problem is you go remember this game was
made<00:01:25.590> quite<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> few<00:01:26.250> years<00:01:26.340> ago<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.939> these

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
made quite a few years ago now and these

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.219 
made quite a few years ago now and these
to<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.170> computers<00:01:29.040> used<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.250> be<00:01:29.369> optimized<00:01:29.880> for

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
to be computers used to be optimized for

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.620 
to be computers used to be optimized for
two<00:01:31.229> core<00:01:31.500> systems<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.880> couldn't<00:01:33.180> handle

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
two core systems so it couldn't handle

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.350 
two core systems so it couldn't handle
the<00:01:34.409> four<00:01:34.680> calls<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.210> we're<00:01:36.329> basically

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the four calls so what we're basically

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.090 
the four calls so what we're basically
doing<00:01:36.750> now<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.470> making<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.070> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
doing now is this is making it so you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.020 
doing now is this is making it so you
only<00:01:44.579> youth<00:01:44.790> two<00:01:45.060> cores<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.659> your<00:01:45.780> system

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.820 

push<00:01:52.479> me<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:52.690> just<00:01:52.869> lost<00:01:53.049> it<00:01:53.260> where<00:01:53.409> is<00:01:53.590> on<00:01:53.740> the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
push me I just lost it where is on the
