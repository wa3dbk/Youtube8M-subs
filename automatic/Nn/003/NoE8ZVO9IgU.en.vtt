00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:02.750
 Hello 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.180
 I would like to talk about the installation method 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.450
 time and adjustments 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.759
 the accuracy of the clock 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.859
 to adjust the accuracy of the course 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:13.119
 you need to press and hold the top 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.119
 a button 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.849
 after about two seconds the clock switched 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.489
 in gauge setting mode 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:22.699
 constant 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.720
 its accuracy depends on its value 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.989
 o'clock 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.749
 value this constant is possible 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.749
 select by pressing the bottom of the legs 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.500
 up to a specific watch 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.240
 601 is a calibration value 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.990
 constant at which 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.960
 maximum stroke accuracy 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.950
 That is, the clock does not hurry and does not lag behind 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.900
 to complete the installation 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.010
 gauge constant follows 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.010
 press the top button again 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.940
 as you can see after climate change y 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.970
 constant time value 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.330
 zeroed out 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.310
 to set the time you need to click 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.310
 stock exchange in the lower club 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.900
 after about two seconds the clock switched 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.410
 in time setting mode 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.360
 top button set to 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 o'clock 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.170
 when the value of the clock is set 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.600
 presses the bottom button again to 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.980
 set minute 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.350
 the minutes value also select the top 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.350
 button 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:22.339
 at the time of the last signal accurate 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:23.459
 of time 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.549
 in the short press the bottom 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.469
 a button 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.039
 but 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.039
 remember 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.229
 in Moscow 18 hours 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:45.949
 installed 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:47.669
 clock is equipped with switches for 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.599
 keeping time 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.599
 power failure 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.369
 in spite of the fact that the indicator goes out 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.369
 the passage of time continues 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:04.559
 after restoring power, the clock 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.309
 continues to show exact 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.619
 time 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:08.439
 Thanks for attention
