and<00:02:11.920> so<00:02:12.520> you<00:02:12.610> spend<00:02:12.850> three<00:02:13.000> minutes<00:02:13.360> on<00:02:13.540> second

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
and so you spend three minutes on second

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.190 
and so you spend three minutes on second
inversion<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:18.120> three<00:02:19.120> minutes<00:02:19.480> working<00:02:19.810> on

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
inversion and three minutes working on

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.580 
inversion and three minutes working on
third<00:02:20.590> inversion<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:24.330> in<00:02:25.330> these<00:02:25.900> days<00:02:26.560> you

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
third inversion and in these days you

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.900 
third inversion and in these days you
know<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.100> just<00:02:27.280> want<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.750> really<00:02:28.750> sit<00:02:29.230> down

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
know you just want to really sit down

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.120 
know you just want to really sit down
don't<00:02:30.910> think<00:02:31.090> about<00:02:31.270> anything<00:02:31.450> else<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.050> do<00:02:32.890> a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
don't think about anything else and do a

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.240 
don't think about anything else and do a
lot<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.430> repetitions<00:02:34.210> of<00:02:34.420> these<00:02:35.200> little<00:02:35.650> steps

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
lot of repetitions of these little steps

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.270 
lot of repetitions of these little steps
and<00:02:37.120> then<00:02:37.240> on<00:02:37.330> day<00:02:37.570> three<00:02:37.960> this<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.860> really

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
and then on day three this is a really

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.130 
and then on day three this is a really
important<00:02:39.820> day<00:02:39.880> what<00:02:40.480> you're<00:02:40.600> going<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.810> do<00:02:40.990> is

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
important day what you're going to do is

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.440 
important day what you're going to do is
just<00:02:41.350> review<00:02:41.860> everything<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.580> did<00:02:42.820> in<00:02:42.970> days<00:02:43.150> 1

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
just review everything you did in days 1

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.030 
just review everything you did in days 1
&amp;<00:02:43.630> 2<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:44.170> you're<00:02:44.260> going<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.410> spend<00:02:44.620> your<00:02:44.680> full

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
&amp; 2 so you're going to spend your full

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:54.979 
&amp; 2 so you're going to spend your full
10<00:02:45.370> minutes<00:02:47.400> playing<00:02:48.400> these<00:02:48.640> arpeggios

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.880 

you're<00:02:55.989> going<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.170> want<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:56.380> do<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.650> much

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
you're going to want to do it much

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.490 
you're going to want to do it much
slower<00:02:57.190> than<00:02:57.430> I'm<00:02:57.700> doing<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:58.239> I'm<00:02:58.900> only<00:02:59.230> doing

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
slower than I'm doing it I'm only doing

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.620 
slower than I'm doing it I'm only doing
it<00:02:59.560> fast<00:02:59.800> just<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.580> I<00:03:00.610> don't<00:03:00.730> take<00:03:01.239> up<00:03:01.420> all

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
it fast just so that I don't take up all

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.900 
it fast just so that I don't take up all
your<00:03:01.660> time<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:03.100> can<00:03:03.280> spend<00:03:03.610> more<00:03:03.850> time

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
your time and you can spend more time

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.330 
your time and you can spend more time
today<00:03:04.360> working<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:05.080> these<00:03:05.410> arpeggios<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:08.340> by

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
today working on these arpeggios so by

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.330 
today working on these arpeggios so by
the<00:03:09.400> end<00:03:09.489> of<00:03:09.670> day<00:03:09.850> 3<00:03:10.180> you've<00:03:10.390> got<00:03:10.630> these<00:03:10.870> four

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
the end of day 3 you've got these four

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.910 
the end of day 3 you've got these four
inversions<00:03:12.340> or<00:03:12.910> four<00:03:13.330> positions<00:03:14.230> for<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.709> major

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
inversions or four positions for a major

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.300 
inversions or four positions for a major
7<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.610> then<00:03:16.300> starting<00:03:16.750> on<00:03:16.810> day<00:03:17.050> 4<00:03:17.470> you're

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
7 and then starting on day 4 you're

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.990 
7 and then starting on day 4 you're
going<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.820> play<00:03:19.090> these<00:03:20.459> arpeggios<00:03:21.459> up<00:03:21.700> an

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
going to play these arpeggios up an

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.300 
going to play these arpeggios up an
octave<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:22.780> you're<00:03:23.230> going<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.380> have<00:03:23.590> different

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
octave so you're going to have different

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.620 
octave so you're going to have different
shapes<00:03:24.930> different<00:03:25.930> string<00:03:26.410> sets<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:27.480> but<00:03:28.480> the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
shapes different string sets and but the

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.280 
shapes different string sets and but the
same<00:03:28.840> notes

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
same notes

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.660 
same notes
so<00:03:29.530> here's<00:03:29.830> root<00:03:30.100> position<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:33.130> first

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
so here's root position and first

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.620 
so here's root position and first
inversion<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:36.489> on<00:03:36.580> day<00:03:36.760> four<00:03:37.090> you're<00:03:37.300> going<00:03:37.510> to

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
inversion so on day four you're going to

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.130 
inversion so on day four you're going to
practice<00:03:38.080> five<00:03:38.380> minutes<00:03:38.769> on<00:03:38.890> root<00:03:39.070> position

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
practice five minutes on root position

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.809 
practice five minutes on root position
and<00:03:41.140> five<00:03:41.380> minutes<00:03:41.680> on<00:03:41.830> first<00:03:42.070> inversion

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
and five minutes on first inversion

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.449 
and five minutes on first inversion
you're<00:03:44.599> gonna<00:03:44.750> get<00:03:44.989> those<00:03:45.230> as<00:03:45.560> comfortable<00:03:46.340> as

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
you're gonna get those as comfortable as

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.890 
you're gonna get those as comfortable as
you<00:03:46.549> can<00:03:46.580> slowly<00:03:47.090> with<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.450> metronome<00:03:47.480> just

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
you can slowly with the metronome just

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.539 
you can slowly with the metronome just
like<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.319> did<00:03:48.470> in<00:03:48.620> day<00:03:48.799> one<00:03:49.129> for<00:03:49.489> these<00:03:51.549> and

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
like you did in day one for these and

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.740 
like you did in day one for these and
then<00:03:53.180> on<00:03:53.480> day<00:03:54.409> five<00:03:55.010> you're<00:03:55.849> going<00:03:55.879> to<00:03:56.209> spend

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
then on day five you're going to spend

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.960 
then on day five you're going to spend
four<00:03:57.409> minutes<00:03:57.739> reviewing<00:03:58.250> what<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:58.579> did<00:03:58.790> on

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
four minutes reviewing what you did on

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.720 
four minutes reviewing what you did on
day<00:03:59.000> four<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:03.530> then<00:04:03.799> you're<00:04:03.980> going<00:04:04.129> to<00:04:04.190> add<00:04:04.400> in

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
day four and then you're going to add in

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.640 
day four and then you're going to add in
second<00:04:05.239> inversion<00:04:05.329> and<00:04:05.780> third<00:04:05.989> inversion<00:04:06.500> in

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
second inversion and third inversion in

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.339 
second inversion and third inversion in
this<00:04:06.799> higher<00:04:07.010> octave<00:04:07.459> as<00:04:07.640> well<00:04:11.109> we<00:04:12.109> spend

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
this higher octave as well we spend

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.800 
this higher octave as well we spend
about<00:04:12.439> three<00:04:12.769> minutes<00:04:12.950> on<00:04:13.220> each<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:13.730> then<00:04:14.540> on

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
about three minutes on each and then on

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.460 
about three minutes on each and then on
day<00:04:15.349> six<00:04:16.070> we<00:04:17.060> do<00:04:17.299> something<00:04:18.019> similar<00:04:18.139> to<00:04:18.440> what

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
day six we do something similar to what

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.129 
day six we do something similar to what
we<00:04:18.620> did<00:04:18.739> on<00:04:18.889> day<00:04:18.919> three<00:04:19.459> on<00:04:19.639> day<00:04:20.090> six<00:04:20.510> we're

we did on day three on day six we're

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.800 
we did on day three on day six we're
going<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.560> review<00:04:22.130> everything<00:04:22.970> we've<00:04:23.240> done<00:04:23.479> on

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
going to review everything we've done on

Days four and five so you can spend the
full<00:04:26.030> ten<00:04:26.270> minutes<00:04:26.600> playing<00:04:26.840> these<00:04:27.139> four

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
full ten minutes playing these four

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:37.960 
full ten minutes playing these four
arpeggios<00:04:28.039> and<00:04:34.030> this<00:04:36.039> by<00:04:37.039> the<00:04:37.100> end<00:04:37.310> of<00:04:37.400> day<00:04:37.580> six

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
arpeggios and this by the end of day six

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.610 
arpeggios and this by the end of day six
you've<00:04:38.600> spent<00:04:39.139> a<00:04:39.380> good<00:04:39.919> amount<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.280> time

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
you've spent a good amount of time

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.960 
you've spent a good amount of time
playing<00:04:42.620> your<00:04:42.919> edges<00:04:45.729> like<00:04:46.729> so<00:04:47.169> and<00:04:48.169> in<00:04:48.970> two

different octaves and so the goal at

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.460 
different octaves and so the goal at
this<00:04:56.240> point<00:04:56.479> isn't<00:04:56.690> for<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.139> be<00:04:57.260> able<00:04:57.320> to

this point isn't for you to be able to
play<00:04:57.680> these<00:04:57.889> fast<00:04:58.280> not<00:04:59.090> at<00:04:59.270> all<00:04:59.449> the<00:04:59.810> goal<00:05:00.020> at

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
play these fast not at all the goal at

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.810 
play these fast not at all the goal at
this<00:05:00.229> point<00:05:00.320> is<00:05:00.620> for<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:00.949> to<00:05:01.070> know<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.520> shapes

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
this point is for you to know the shapes

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.360 
this point is for you to know the shapes
and<00:05:02.360> be<00:05:02.449> able<00:05:02.539> to<00:05:02.690> play<00:05:02.930> them<00:05:03.080> slowly<00:05:03.410> and<00:05:03.680> have

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
and be able to play them slowly and have

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.990 
and be able to play them slowly and have
a<00:05:04.400> good<00:05:04.970> idea<00:05:05.180> of<00:05:05.560> how<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.620> play<00:05:06.919> each<00:05:07.160> one<00:05:07.460> way

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
a good idea of how to play each one way

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000 
a good idea of how to play each one way
or<00:05:08.150> that<00:05:08.270> where<00:05:08.479> this<00:05:08.660> is<00:05:08.810> on<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.080> neck<00:05:09.260> it'll

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
or that where this is on the neck it'll

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.860 
or that where this is on the neck it'll
be<00:05:10.130> a<00:05:10.160> different<00:05:10.430> week's<00:05:10.880> objective<00:05:11.510> to<00:05:11.720> get

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
be a different week's objective to get

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.300 
be a different week's objective to get
them<00:05:12.080> faster<00:05:12.620> that's<00:05:12.860> a<00:05:12.979> totally<00:05:13.280> different

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
them faster that's a totally different

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.100 
them faster that's a totally different
thing<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:13.729> we'll<00:05:13.940> definitely<00:05:14.090> go<00:05:14.419> over<00:05:14.750> speed

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
thing and we'll definitely go over speed

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.469 
thing and we'll definitely go over speed

at<00:05:20.599> day<00:05:20.900> six<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.440> you've<00:05:21.590> got<00:05:21.770> all<00:05:21.919> these

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
at day six and you've got all these

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.400 
at day six and you've got all these
different<00:05:22.490> shapes<00:05:22.760> you<00:05:23.030> play<00:05:23.539> them<00:05:23.660> slowly<00:05:23.900> on

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
different shapes you play them slowly on

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.779 
different shapes you play them slowly on
day<00:05:24.620> seven<00:05:25.039> we're<00:05:25.160> going<00:05:25.280> to<00:05:25.340> add<00:05:25.550> these

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
day seven we're going to add these

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.339 
day seven we're going to add these
shapes<00:05:26.120> together<00:05:26.539> we're<00:05:26.750> going<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:26.930> connect

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
shapes together we're going to connect

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.350 
shapes together we're going to connect
them<00:05:27.530> so<00:05:27.770> that<00:05:27.919> instead<00:05:28.250> of<00:05:28.310> having<00:05:28.880> three

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
them so that instead of having three

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.810 
them so that instead of having three
strained<00:05:30.199> arpeggios<00:05:30.889> we're<00:05:31.159> playing<00:05:31.400> six

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
strained arpeggios we're playing six

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.550 
strained arpeggios we're playing six
string<00:05:32.090> arpeggios<00:05:32.630> so<00:05:33.139> you're<00:05:33.229> going<00:05:33.349> to<00:05:33.440> take

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
string arpeggios so you're going to take

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.480 
string arpeggios so you're going to take
your<00:05:33.740> root<00:05:33.949> position<00:05:34.190> low<00:05:34.789> arpeggio

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
your root position low arpeggio

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.370 
your root position low arpeggio
you're<00:05:38.090> going<00:05:38.210> to<00:05:38.270> take<00:05:38.449> your<00:05:38.750> first

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
you're going to take your first

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.939 
you're going to take your first
inversion<00:05:39.770> higher<00:05:40.190> as<00:05:40.490> you<00:05:41.590> and<00:05:42.590> you<00:05:42.740> combine

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
inversion higher as you and you combine

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:53.350 
inversion higher as you and you combine
them<00:05:43.310> to<00:05:43.580> be<00:05:43.729> this<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:51.310> you<00:05:52.310> do<00:05:52.490> that<00:05:52.669> for<00:05:52.910> root

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
them to be this and you do that for root

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.740 
them to be this and you do that for root
position<00:05:53.870> first<00:05:54.349> inversion<00:05:58.750> second

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
inversion and third inversion and in the

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.089 
inversion and third inversion and in the
process<00:06:12.110> of<00:06:12.259> connecting<00:06:12.590> all<00:06:12.949> these

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 
process of connecting all these

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:14.920 
process of connecting all these
arpeggios<00:06:13.310> together<00:06:14.030> you<00:06:14.270> reinforce

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
arpeggios together you reinforce

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.659 
arpeggios together you reinforce
everything<00:06:15.470> that<00:06:15.650> you<00:06:15.860> would<00:06:15.979> learn<00:06:16.190> on<00:06:16.460> Days

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
everything that you would learn on Days

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.350 
everything that you would learn on Days
one<00:06:16.970> through<00:06:17.180> six<00:06:17.479> and<00:06:18.190> it<00:06:19.190> helps<00:06:19.550> you<00:06:19.729> get<00:06:20.150> a

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
one through six and it helps you get a

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.450 
one through six and it helps you get a
major<00:06:20.720> seven<00:06:21.139> all<00:06:21.289> over<00:06:21.530> the<00:06:21.650> neck<00:06:21.830> now<00:06:22.310> this

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
major seven all over the neck now this

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.070 
major seven all over the neck now this
is<00:06:22.580> just<00:06:22.789> the<00:06:22.910> beginning<00:06:23.360> you<00:06:23.509> know<00:06:23.599> seven

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
is just the beginning you know seven

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.469 
is just the beginning you know seven
days<00:06:24.110> isn't<00:06:24.860> enough<00:06:25.099> time<00:06:25.490> to<00:06:25.669> master<00:06:25.940> it<00:06:26.270> it's

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
days isn't enough time to master it it's

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.180 
days isn't enough time to master it it's
definitely<00:06:26.990> enough<00:06:27.169> time<00:06:27.380> to<00:06:27.500> make<00:06:27.620> huge

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
definitely enough time to make huge

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.719 
definitely enough time to make huge
amounts<00:06:28.490> of<00:06:28.550> progress<00:06:29.030> and<00:06:30.310> from<00:06:31.310> here<00:06:31.550> you

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
amounts of progress and from here you

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.790 
amounts of progress and from here you
want<00:06:31.880> to<00:06:32.030> spend<00:06:32.900> another<00:06:33.110> week<00:06:33.380> you<00:06:33.680> know

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
want to spend another week you know

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.980 
want to spend another week you know
maybe<00:06:34.009> just<00:06:34.130> the<00:06:34.550> whole<00:06:34.729> week<00:06:35.000> reinforcing

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
maybe just the whole week reinforcing

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.300 
maybe just the whole week reinforcing
everything<00:06:36.409> that<00:06:36.560> you<00:06:36.680> did<00:06:36.830> in<00:06:37.099> this<00:06:37.250> first

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
everything that you did in this first

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.790 
everything that you did in this first
seven<00:06:38.030> day<00:06:38.180> period<00:06:38.479> but<00:06:39.080> the<00:06:39.259> point<00:06:39.500> is<00:06:39.650> that

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
seven day period but the point is that

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.010 
seven day period but the point is that
you<00:06:39.949> practice<00:06:40.159> every<00:06:40.759> day<00:06:40.970> do<00:06:41.509> your<00:06:41.659> best<00:06:41.840> not

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
you practice every day do your best not

you practice every day do your best not
to<00:06:42.080> skip<00:06:42.470> any<00:06:42.620> days<00:06:42.919> and<00:06:43.430> you<00:06:43.520> practice<00:06:43.849> for<00:06:44.000> at

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
to skip any days and you practice for at

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.140 
to skip any days and you practice for at
least<00:06:44.240> ten<00:06:44.659> minutes<00:06:44.870> and<00:06:45.880> anything<00:06:46.880> beyond

least ten minutes and anything beyond
ten<00:06:47.449> minutes<00:06:47.750> is<00:06:47.930> you<00:06:48.320> know<00:06:48.470> up<00:06:48.650> to<00:06:48.680> you<00:06:48.979> how

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:49.159 
ten minutes is you know up to you how

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:52.240 
ten minutes is you know up to you how
you<00:06:50.050> divvy<00:06:51.050> out<00:06:51.080> like<00:06:51.530> how<00:06:51.770> much<00:06:51.919> time<00:06:51.979> you

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
you divvy out like how much time you

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.610 
you divvy out like how much time you
spend<00:06:52.490> on<00:06:52.610> each<00:06:52.759> subject<00:06:53.300> but<00:06:53.930> make<00:06:54.259> sure<00:06:54.289> your

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
spend on each subject but make sure your

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.550 
spend on each subject but make sure your
minimum<00:06:55.070> ten<00:06:55.280> minutes<00:06:55.639> is<00:06:55.849> met<00:06:56.120> and<00:06:56.330> if<00:06:57.199> you

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
minimum ten minutes is met and if you

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.850 
minimum ten minutes is met and if you
miss<00:06:57.830> a<00:06:57.860> day<00:06:58.360> the<00:06:59.360> best<00:06:59.630> way<00:07:00.050> to<00:07:00.080> look<00:07:00.349> at<00:07:00.530> it<00:07:00.680> is
