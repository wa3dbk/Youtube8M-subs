a lot to bring through some of the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.230 
a lot to bring through some of the
younger<00:02:03.950> players<00:02:04.100> into<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.580> Celtic<00:02:05.060> Frost

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
younger players into the Celtic Frost

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.060 
younger players into the Celtic Frost
team<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.200> something<00:02:06.530> you're<00:02:06.650> hoping<00:02:06.800> to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
team is that something you're hoping to

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.619 
team is that something you're hoping to
get<00:02:07.280> involved<00:02:07.580> with<00:02:07.700> then<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.119> very<00:02:08.269> hands<00:02:08.569> on

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
get involved with then I very hands on

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.959 
get involved with then I very hands on
basis<00:02:09.019> as<00:02:09.140> well<00:02:09.259> yep<00:02:09.920> why<00:02:10.129> it's<00:02:10.459> important<00:02:10.909> to

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:10.969 
basis as well yep why it's important to

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:12.340 
basis as well yep why it's important to
a<00:02:10.999> club<00:02:11.180> like<00:02:11.359> Celtic

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
a club like Celtic

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.230 
a club like Celtic
to<00:02:12.740> bring<00:02:12.950> through<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.310> youth<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:13.910> think

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
to bring through the youth I think

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.470 
to bring through the youth I think
that's<00:02:14.930> always<00:02:15.350> been<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.830> case<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:17.330> it's

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
that's always been the case and and it's

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.120 
that's always been the case and and it's
tough<00:02:17.690> when<00:02:17.900> you've<00:02:18.050> got<00:02:18.200> good<00:02:18.380> frosting<00:02:18.860> and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
tough when you've got good frosting and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.920 
tough when you've got good frosting and
it's<00:02:19.490> got<00:02:19.670> terrific<00:02:19.940> international<00:02:20.690> players

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
it's got terrific international players

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.270 
it's got terrific international players
and<00:02:21.110> it's<00:02:21.260> never<00:02:21.440> easy<00:02:21.620> for<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.920> young<00:02:22.010> player

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
and it's never easy for the young player

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.060 
and it's never easy for the young player
to<00:02:22.460> break<00:02:22.580> through<00:02:22.880> but<00:02:23.750> that's<00:02:23.900> always<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.290> the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
to break through but that's always a the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.530 
to break through but that's always a the
challenge<00:02:25.520> for<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.730> club<00:02:25.910> can<00:02:26.120> we<00:02:26.240> get<00:02:26.390> young

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
challenge for the club can we get young

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.640 
challenge for the club can we get young
players<00:02:26.810> out<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.050> first<00:02:27.260> team<00:02:27.410> but<00:02:27.560> they've

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
players out the first team but they've

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.110 
players out the first team but they've
got<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:27.860> be<00:02:27.920> good<00:02:28.040> enough<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.430> when<00:02:29.000> they're

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
got to be good enough and when they're

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.730 
got to be good enough and when they're
good<00:02:29.240> enough<00:02:29.330> hopefully<00:02:29.690> they<00:02:30.380> will<00:02:30.470> get<00:02:30.620> that

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
good enough hopefully they will get that

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:40.340 
good enough hopefully they will get that
opportunity<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:31.850> show<00:02:32.030> where<00:02:32.180> they<00:02:32.270> can<00:02:32.420> do

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.410
