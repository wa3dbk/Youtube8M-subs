00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.359
 There are concrete days. 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:15.329
 the track and the dry chick doctor has finished garbage being polluted with 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.109
 pigments added in the preparation of the mixture 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.039
 the whole mixture 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.140
 cement and pigments is to homogenize the 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.429
 resulting in a 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.849
 finished with three cut options 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.969
 the consumption of only 3-5 children per square meter 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.710
 provides considerable savings in roofing equipment 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.739
 increased productivity of the labor force at tva eurotop pirineus that stands out 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:43.650
 by disarmament 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.390
 rustic and at the same time sophisticated in color 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.540
 the roof reminded him of the mountainous regions of the Pyrenees in the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.830
 Spain 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.739
 the application is founded 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.570
 made of sand especially cement and additives check the movie 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.489
 modern aesthetic finish providing 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.600
 legs 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.580
 I ask per square meter 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.070
 contrary to what many people think 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.190
 concrete tiles are not heavier than ceramic tiles 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.770
 the price per square meter is even lower in some cases 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.600
 to compare 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.810
 the price per square meter of the tile I ask for concrete again is 46 comma 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.950
 eight pounds per square meter 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.660
 while the most common ceramic daughters, for example carp and canal, have 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.610
 a consumption of 26 kilos per square meter 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.980
 and grows on average two children and a grandchild and a child resulting in 54 commas 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.320
 six pounds per square meter 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.789
 jatene the Portuguese consumes on average 17 pieces 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.189
 and passes two point six kilos the price per square meter of 44 comma 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.329
 two pounds this without considering that the absorption of water 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.630
 which is higher in ceramic tiles 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.340
 this way the wood does not need to be reinforced 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.560
 nor is there an overload with the dimensioning of the foundation due to the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.589
 use of concrete tiles 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.669
 special parts 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.360
 then I notice that it presents a complete line of special parts 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.360
 designed to offer a better finish to the roof 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:22.959
 These solutions, besides practical ones, bring beauty and lots of 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.959
 the most apparent points on the roof 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.839
 the installation of concrete tiles 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:50.069
 the convocation of the tiles must be made via the chosen city to the left 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.059
 starting from the eave or the lower part of the roof and continuing in 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:57.269
 direction to a van 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.079
 tiles should be supported by the upper parts of the victims should 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.980
 need to set that year, the 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.459
 determination 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.839
 expansion joints 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:13.679
 for leg restraint the installer should observe whether the 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:16.009
 leaving a dilatation joints 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:20.039
 is releasing allows the tiles to be accommodated during the expansion period 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.829
 and avoid any breaks and think about progress of the roof 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:27.709
 camera installation 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.709
 the commendation must be agreed with cement mortar 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.589
 edition of the pigment for all prouni 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:36.309
 loop but we recommend 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:40.870
 the ica still to a room his definitive position to confirm his 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:42.440
 correct distribution 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.050
 the overlap and therefore must be at least 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.550
 seven centimeters 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.659
 and it is very important that the tax 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.080
 the mortar used is protected 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.039
 should not be exposed to time actions 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:59.769
 it is essential to maintain an alignment so it persists in the upper front 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.449
 of the piece a small marking and when being installed and called for the alignment 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.009
 with the aid of a tongue 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:11.419
 for the perfect finishing and sealing of the summit line is used the piece 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.870
 from the beginning of the career the first one will be installed at this point the cell phone 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.359
 the end of the career 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.639
 consequently it is the last piece to be placed 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.309
 installation of the general paulistinha's camp 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:30.179
 the island side-finish can be executed with finishing parts 

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:34.969
 lateral 'or paulistinha is one of the topics settled with mortar what 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:38.270
 should not be exposed actions of the time 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.409
 ventilation stack 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.490
 the conventional roof accumulated a hot air barrier in flight with 

00:04:44.489 --> 00:04:48.489
 logitech with unpleasant consequences such as internal heating 

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:53.319
 of the house and the degradation of the materials that make up the roof structure 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.229
 ventilation daughters solve the problem by encouraging airflow and 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.279
 efficient 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:03.939
 the ventilation strip and close the cool or cool wind spreads across the slab 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.760
 the upper batteries is in charge of examining the hot air which for being more 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.240
 obvious focus on turkey 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.550
 the result is a well-ventilated residence even during the summer 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.999
 slope 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:22.310
 minimum inclinations depends on the fulfillment of 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:29.590
 for greetings from zero to seven meters hospitalization is 30% for each meter 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.660
 additional add 2% of hospitalization value for perfect carved 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:36.289
 late coverage 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.029
 slopes above 96% 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:42.259
 the winning tracks are all swept away 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.960
 in stadiums domains 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.330
 the aluminum muse I went was the 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.589
 pizzolato technically the residence with efficiency and practicality 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.789
 the tata moved away from the seven roof type of heat and avoiding the appearance 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.029
 of protests 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:02.379
 and easy to install, simply extend the blanket with the 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:06.019
 boring domain down on the charges in the direction are conrado 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.129
 consultation with the people of the central trade union 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.069
 the placement is always done from the bottom up 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.409
 so that the next blanket strip is over the previous strip 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.739
 feel the change in the structure of wood with other nails 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.030
 Fix the complexes on the blanket 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.580
 in the same direction as cars 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.780
 ukra castro is important because they create a distance between Lieberman 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.820
 after putting the ridiculous batteries according to the directions of the 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.509
 preservation of the environment is one of the main pillars of our 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:44.460
 quality policy 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.069
 the use of our natural resources and the improvement of the quality of 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:54.009
 people's life with preservation and minimal environmental impact is a 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:56.330
 essential press priority
