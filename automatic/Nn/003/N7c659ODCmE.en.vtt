00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.180
 today I bring you a brief review and we are going to 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.770
 talk about these new lipsticks that you have 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:38.360
 released these are the soft sensation 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.360
 slip color toilet 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.550
 the format of these lipsticks is kind 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.560
 txuri the post color is a kind of 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.380
 Yumbo lipstick but how good they spin 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.050
 Here, the tip is coming out and we 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.820
 allows the comfort of not having to 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.290
 walk there with the pencil sharpener and all the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.620
 history have a recommended price of 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.540
 ten euros although you know that always 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.140
 you can find cheaper 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.380
 then I would recommend 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.750
 search in different websites in different 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.370
 stores take advantage of the offers and everything 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.240
 this kind of thing so that they come out a lot 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.369
 better although I'll leave the photos of 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.190
 how are all on the lips because 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.190
 This one I'm wearing is the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.430
 the 0 22 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.020
 on lips 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.179
 This one that I like right now 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.390
 so he sees it a little cherry type maybe 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.909
 because good now we have just I'm 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.069
 taking advantage of five minutes of sunshine 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.929
 but you are going to see how they are in the 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.439
 lips at the entrance of the goats 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.560
 I'm going to put here in the little hand and have 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.140
 a lot of brightness that's true 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.930
 They smell like vanilla that I like 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.940
 much moisturizes on the lip and yes that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.599
 they have a good duration because it is that 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.769
 stain the lip except one that is the 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:24.130
 020 this is a lot is a very 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.790
 natural 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.299
 this more natural tone does not have much 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.239
 I'm going to put them here a little bit 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:39.459
 several passes is worth it because it looks like 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:42.069
 better this would be the 0 20 the natural one that 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.400
 would be this tone is a brown cited that 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.010
 on the lip is quite discreet 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.489
 one of the ones I like the most is the 0 17 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.760
 playing at pink that is this pink is 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.780
 Pretty songs or I do not know if it's kind of 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.709
 oil lamp 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.109
 or any of these but it's very striking 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.120
 when I put it on, so in addition 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.069
 I like to wear those with 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.980
 different times when I've put 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.830
 has attracted a lot of attention and has 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.820
 liked 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.760
 and continuing with the range of the fuchsias 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.280
 we work like that it would be pretty in fuchsia 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.590
 which is 0 18 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.500
 and this one is more type to the best 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.530
 it's not without passions but some of these 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.470
 of maxi that looks a little bit more 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.440
 this fuchsia these two I already tell you that 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.060
 pigment the lip with dark stretches 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.160
 you are going to see what more pigment in the lip 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:45.080
 the one that looks like it's purple is 0 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.230
 19 room it 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:53.740
 is that it would look a bit like they have finished 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.740
 to the color voice chicken feather 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.510
 and the pigmentation is good 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.680
 I thought I was going to stay a lot more 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.450
 dark but on the lip 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.720
 and now let's finish with the two 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.930
 red tones a little darker and other 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.470
 more vibrant the one that I wear on my lips 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:18.390
 that is the my lips network 020 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.390
 it would be so 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.650
 this and after 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.819
 that a touch that is 021 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.000
 that would be more of a classic red the truth 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:37.610
 is that this tone is perhaps a little 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.610
 less special these would be the 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.560
 the second signal tones the follow 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.300
 in general, yes, I liked it 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.889
 has surprised is true that there were people 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.960
 that talked about what 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.060
 last year I think that in summer I 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.180
 they have brought out a range of colors from these 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.240
 6 pigment very well removing the one that you 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.180
 I say the third 20 that is more lip tone 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.819
 the others do stain the lip and the 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.949
 case is that I took off this right now 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:11.529
 I still have my lip 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.330
 - Pretty red then it's as if 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.819
 dye a little bit and I like that because 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.900
 I like the most intense colors and with 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:21.270
 a decent enough duration 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.250
 and nothing those have been new impressions 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.889
 fast you know that in the box of 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.780
 information I leave the link to the blog and 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.880
 little more than tell the makeup I carry 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.400
 something very simple if roy thinks 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.169
 I took that I was going to put a 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.259
 Red candle mission baseline a 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.330
 little marked and I hope you like it 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.590
 that is entertained a ratillo and 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.590
 See you in the next video
