00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
piece on there so it would be easier to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.980

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:22.940 

right<00:07:17.020> let's<00:07:17.500> say

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:22.950 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:28.370 

I<00:07:23.120> I<00:07:24.120> think<00:07:24.750> another<00:07:25.190> 32<00:07:26.190> it<00:07:26.850> might<00:07:27.060> be<00:07:27.270> 30<00:07:27.540> but

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 
I I think another 32 it might be 30 but

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:36.560 
I I think another 32 it might be 30 but
it's<00:07:28.770> either<00:07:29.160> 30<00:07:29.610> by<00:07:30.420> 32<00:07:31.230> by<00:07:31.730> 33<00:07:32.730> 2<00:07:33.450> by<00:07:33.950> 31<00:07:34.950> 32<00:07:35.570> by

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:36.570 
it's either 30 by 32 by 33 2 by 31 32 by

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:43.790 
it's either 30 by 32 by 33 2 by 31 32 by
32<00:07:37.610> I'm<00:07:38.900> saying<00:07:39.900> wild<00:07:40.410> guess<00:07:40.940> 32<00:07:41.940> by<00:07:42.150> 32<00:07:42.870> that

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 
32 I'm saying wild guess 32 by 32 that

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.180 
32 I'm saying wild guess 32 by 32 that
is<00:07:44.160> actually<00:07:44.820> really<00:07:45.030> big<00:07:45.410> there's<00:07:46.410> actually

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.190 
is actually really big there's actually

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.870 
is actually really big there's actually
a<00:07:47.370> bigger<00:07:48.120> one<00:07:48.630> it's<00:07:49.320> a<00:07:49.530> gray<00:07:49.830> one<00:07:50.100> and<00:07:50.430> it's
