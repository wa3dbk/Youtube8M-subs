00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.830 
we've actually captured not just as fans
in<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> stadium<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.270> outside<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
in the stadium but outside of the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.990

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
stadium so as well as we know it's not

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.280 
stadium so as well as we know it's not
just<00:00:36.180> about<00:00:36.270> those<00:00:36.540> people<00:00:36.719> over<00:00:36.930> there<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
captured that with the spans own so we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.229 
captured that with the spans own so we
create<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> fan<00:00:41.250> zones<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> countries

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.399 
reason we want to do the external
geometry<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:18.930> they've<00:01:19.080> got<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.290> much

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
geometry is because they've got so much

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.630 
geometry is because they've got so much
character<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> outside<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.400> mean<00:01:20.549> when

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
character on the outside I mean when

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.710 
character on the outside I mean when
you're<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> gameplay<00:01:21.270> looking<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
you're in the gameplay looking at the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.359 
you're in the gameplay looking at the
field<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.080> kind<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.259> only<00:01:22.380> you're<00:01:22.950> limited<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
field you kind of only you're limited to

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.649 
field you kind of only you're limited to
what<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.790> see<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.150> by<00:01:24.240> virtue<00:01:24.360> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
what you can see just by virtue of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.910 
what you can see just by virtue of
playing<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> game<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:25.650> want<00:01:25.890> to
