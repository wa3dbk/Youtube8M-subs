times<00:02:30.760> on<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:31.270> channel<00:02:31.420> because<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.840> think<00:02:31.900> it

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
times on this channel because I think it

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.440 
times on this channel because I think it

this video may have encouraged me to
read<00:04:31.770> The<00:04:31.889> Marriage<00:04:32.039> Plot<00:04:32.250> sooner<00:04:32.759> rather

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
read The Marriage Plot sooner rather

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.999 
read The Marriage Plot sooner rather
than<00:04:33.090> later<00:04:33.150> if<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.840> don't<00:04:34.139> know<00:04:34.289> this<00:04:34.470> story

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
than later if you don't know this story

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.100 
than later if you don't know this story
takes<00:04:35.340> place<00:04:35.460> partially<00:04:36.150> in<00:04:36.360> a<00:04:36.449> college<00:04:36.840> it's

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
takes place partially in a college it's

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.680 
takes place partially in a college it's
about<00:04:37.289> a<00:04:37.620> couple<00:04:38.340> that<00:04:38.490> meets<00:04:38.729> while<00:04:39.240> in

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
about a couple that meets while in

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.450 
about a couple that meets while in
college<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.500> then<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:40.650> think<00:04:40.979> it<00:04:41.070> moves<00:04:41.250> on

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
college and then I think it moves on

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.950 
college and then I think it moves on
beyond<00:04:41.759> that<00:04:41.970> point<00:04:42.150> but<00:04:42.360> part<00:04:42.599> of<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.750> story

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
beyond that point but part of the story

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.200 
beyond that point but part of the story
does<00:04:43.199> take<00:04:43.380> place<00:04:43.530> in<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.800> college<00:04:44.099> so<00:04:44.400> this<00:04:45.030> is

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
does take place in a college so this is

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.790 
does take place in a college so this is
definitely<00:04:45.389> one<00:04:45.720> that<00:04:45.990> i<00:04:46.050> want<00:04:46.229> to<00:04:46.620> read
