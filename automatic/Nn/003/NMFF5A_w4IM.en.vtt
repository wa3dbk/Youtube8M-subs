00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
actually experiencing and I think so

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.060 
actually experiencing and I think so
many<00:00:55.850> things<00:00:56.210> go<00:00:57.080> through<00:00:57.350> their<00:00:57.530> mind<00:00:57.770> isn't

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
many things go through their mind isn't

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.470 
many things go through their mind isn't
like<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:58.400> go<00:00:58.550> through<00:00:58.580> warm-ups<00:00:59.210> and<00:00:59.360> they're

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
like you go through warm-ups and they're

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.120 
like you go through warm-ups and they're
any<00:00:59.600> different<00:00:59.660> or<00:01:00.170> practice<00:01:00.620> during<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.950> week

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
any different or practice during a week

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.000 
any different or practice during a week
is<00:01:01.370> really<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:02.330> that<00:01:02.600> much<00:01:02.870> different<00:01:03.320> but

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
is really that that much different but

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.490 
is really that that much different but
you<00:01:04.370> should<00:01:05.089> see<00:01:05.270> some<00:01:05.540> of<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:06.050> know<00:01:06.110> some

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
try to calm them down before the game

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.310 
try to calm them down before the game

because some of them are so wired for

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.020 
because some of them are so wired for
sound<00:01:12.530> because<00:01:13.520> they're<00:01:13.670> just<00:01:13.790> looking

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
sound because they're just looking

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.750 
keep them focused but even it's even
more<00:01:20.570> dramatic<00:01:21.110> after<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.560> game<00:01:21.740> because<00:01:22.550> I

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
more dramatic after the game because I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.520 
more dramatic after the game because I
