00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.080
 hi nice that you watch 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.549
 another new hair tutorial today 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.770
 this time I really want you one 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.020
 very happy to show internship i have one 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.660
 done some braids a few times and so now 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.029
 time to play football otherwise what you make for it 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.490
 Needed is of course a rubber band 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.670
 preferably a point comb is an ordinary one 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.710
 comb and brush your hair out to brush 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.630
 and a slider and if you were limp now 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.309
 having her then is also very nice 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.860
 keep the hair spray close by 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.800
 we are going to start now i have in my 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.140
 all the curls that I have 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.969
 made yesterday with the set he leaves 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.890
 I sit in it because it is very bad 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.260
 fun with this tail 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.610
 that your hair is not style was allowed now 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.410
 her name is handy to it 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.760
 Just curl a little bit in advance and you 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.320
 does not have to be precise just 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.270
 gross picking up lame just wanted just 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.640
 can take a bit of it 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.870
 do you want it now or couple have counsel 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.430
 I recommend to you for example one 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.019
 using a dry shampoo tool is real 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.670
 some poofy word you know you 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.650
 just know you ran into jabbing or what 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.630
 then that struggle with the bulbs 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.670
 if someone turns it off then 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.780
 you have something more that rocky idea so that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.909
 can also do what I am going to do this there 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.299
 a little bit in alone I'll do everything 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.299
 back up 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.369
 because can also just a little coarse away 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.869
 and it just some wave of picking up 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.869
 that it will really be bulging 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.430
 I almost got it now I have 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.100
 a leave-in spray is in the right 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.020
 knew blond the idle that is a spray that 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.180
 the soft texture of her cast off and 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.970
 that is also easier to comb 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.759
 10 times and I have a dry shampoo in it 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.610
 have done that yesterday and today 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.290
 a little bit this morning because I think so 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.810
 is my the crop is it what else 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.670
 softer so I do that on the starter cloth 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.340
 god by massaging and then i really have that 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.780
 volume immediately on day one instead 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.490
 of what you normally have and 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.770
 by the time you have to wash it then 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.270
 it just starts to sit nicely and again 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.380
 then you have it so it is real 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.429
 top 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.530
 I also have an article on my website 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.050
 in which I made the dry shampoo 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.209
 stuff and compare the sales and from 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.110
 the stretch and therefore therefore you will find all 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.120
 information about the products and I have to 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.920
 I just wanted more dry shampoo 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.350
 but it's really hard I don't know 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.750
 where you buy it but a lot 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.340
 Kruger and Etos stores have them 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.380
 just don't stand I really don't understand 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.330
 what it is then they have something 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.090
 complete line of veils but none 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.010
 So dry shampoo is really crazy because 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.920
 I actually wanted to buy it for a moment 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.570
 take pictures to beautiful one 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.040
 make a comparison for the website 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.500
 so that you can also use those ingredients 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.430
 I would like to see that from the rest 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.170
 know 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.329
 dry shampoo so unfortunately I do not like 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.370
 science because he just can't be found 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.959
 authors I don't know what you how 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.459
 you coming 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.650
 but you could always use me I 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.140
 like tips or brand you use 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.150
 then and where do you get and then I have to 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.750
 would like him a baby comparison 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.489
 With a professional product I have now 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.290
 everything happens 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.000
 I add a little lag between me not 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.600
 crazy much because it is really something 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.769
 more casual it may be a bit looser so that 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.190
 I do now 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.230
 now i go with the tangle teezer i go all 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.660
 apply a little way to warriors 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.780
 herein is quite rolling over care 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.130
 sure will go back you have just 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.130
 reve smooth draws 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.000
 here at the front feels for itself 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.560
 a people where the tufts are 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.560
 then you feel like there are kind of loops 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.360
 as we are often elastic 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.890
 there 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.360
 yes then it is difficult for me to do so 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.850
 just really easy to intermediate 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.300
 nor any complicated show off 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.400
 do that it is what you do 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.440
 see it already with a you go as it were 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.380
 just a little push so that the 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.430
 to fit in nicely because we 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.380
 want a convex tail and go get your hair 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.770
 to grab 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.770
 but then the art is over 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.670
 not to put everything away 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:27.150
 so you are really going to feel so that you also have one 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:29.300
 bulging there content of him that elastic 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.300
 there 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.629
 that is then you share your hair on this 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.370
 then just let us unload you again 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:50.250
 behind japan and you go here too 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.280
 so also from the front 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.810
 it really has to fall loose again 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.500
 you can put all your fingers under it and 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.590
 then you pull it up and you grab one 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.590
 tuft 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.400
 everyone he just around it 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.199
 because I know of course never likes 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.340
 and very rustic you see that is real 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:14.280
 live my thing like that and you will 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.699
 just fix with a slider 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.870
 I do not have the body 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.930
 I sat we go I go one 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.620
 search slider 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.599
 yes we are now you have done this I have 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.150
 locked him I found a pin 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.129
 what to do now is just the tail 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.229
 from rolling up 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:37.830
 you can do that very easily by om 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:40.680
 just split as it were and then 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.500
 I 'm just going to topple most in between 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.870
 that tail in it doesn't have to be much 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.880
 and ensures that never wonder 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.979
 coming 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.880
 letter a reason below is fine but that 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:55.169
 you not 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.330
 they bear height of Martijn seeing it 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.219
 is so istie half 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:03.389
 I'll get you something so that you 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:05.340
 see everything completely see and soul 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.590
 and they think he can do that nicely 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.940
 has bulbs at the top and then tasty ones 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.650
 tail 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.460
 whoever you nice full of not good 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.580
 relationship 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.500
 very loud in heat so I said I 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.500
 find it more fun than completely silent 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.210
