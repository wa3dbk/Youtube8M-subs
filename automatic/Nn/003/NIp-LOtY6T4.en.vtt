00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
into hundreds of times with personal

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.750 
into hundreds of times with personal
clients<00:00:36.350> of<00:00:36.440> mine<00:00:36.470> and<00:00:37.070> obviously<00:00:37.370> clients

clients of mine and obviously clients
using<00:00:37.940> our<00:00:38.060> programs<00:00:38.480> before<00:00:39.410> i<00:00:39.650> get<00:00:39.829> to<00:00:39.920> the

using our programs before i get to the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.069 
using our programs before i get to the
question<00:00:40.400> let<00:00:41.239> me<00:00:41.329> tell<00:00:41.630> you<00:00:41.780> why<00:00:42.050> this

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
question let me tell you why this

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.920 
question let me tell you why this
happens<00:00:42.880> if<00:00:43.880> you're<00:00:44.149> let's<00:00:44.510> say<00:00:44.630> you're

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
happens if you're let's say you're

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.780 
happens if you're let's say you're
relatively<00:00:45.649> out<00:00:45.829> of<00:00:45.950> shape<00:00:46.130> you're<00:00:46.160> just

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
relatively out of shape you're just

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.280 
relatively out of shape you're just
starting<00:00:47.180> toward<00:00:47.600> there<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:47.960> you<00:00:48.020> want<00:00:48.230> to

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
starting toward there and you want to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.960 
starting toward there and you want to
lose<00:00:48.380> 30<00:00:48.620> pounds<00:00:48.800> right<00:00:49.280> there's<00:00:49.610> what's

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
lose 30 pounds right there's what's

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.080 
lose 30 pounds right there's what's
known<00:00:50.239> as<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:50.690> law<00:00:50.930> of<00:00:50.960> diminishing<00:00:51.620> returns

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
known as the law of diminishing returns

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.819 
known as the law of diminishing returns
so<00:00:53.090> initially<00:00:53.390> you<00:00:53.690> do<00:00:54.050> a<00:00:54.079> little<00:00:54.380> bit<00:00:54.559> of<00:00:54.590> work

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
so initially you do a little bit of work

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.650 
so initially you do a little bit of work
and<00:00:55.430> you're<00:00:55.820> going<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:55.969> see<00:00:56.120> some<00:00:56.239> really<00:00:56.510> good

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
and you're going to see some really good

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.209 
and you're going to see some really good
results<00:00:56.840> because<00:00:57.350> let's<00:00:57.530> say<00:00:57.590> your<00:00:57.829> body<00:00:58.040> is

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
results because let's say your body is

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.430 
results because let's say your body is
not<00:00:58.399> used<00:00:58.700> to<00:00:58.850> working<00:00:59.210> out<00:00:59.270> all<00:00:59.570> of<00:00:59.630> a<00:01:00.170> sudden

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
not used to working out all of a sudden

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.049 
not used to working out all of a sudden
you're<00:01:00.530> starting<00:01:00.770> to<00:01:00.829> work<00:01:00.950> out<00:01:01.129> it's<00:01:01.550> going

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
you're starting to work out it's going

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.950 
you're starting to work out it's going
to<00:01:02.800> metabolize<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:04.280> lot<00:01:05.149> of<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.329> excess<00:01:05.659> stores

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
to metabolize a lot of the excess stores

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.770 
to metabolize a lot of the excess stores
of<00:01:06.229> fat<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.710> calories<00:01:07.270> however<00:01:08.270> as<00:01:08.479> we<00:01:08.659> get

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
of fat and calories however as we get

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.020 
of fat and calories however as we get
fitter<00:01:09.139> what<00:01:10.039> happens<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.609> that<00:01:10.639> you<00:01:10.759> need<00:01:10.999> a

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
fitter what happens is that you need a

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.370 
fitter what happens is that you need a
little<00:01:11.209> bored<00:01:11.359> you<00:01:11.450> need<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:11.659> work<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:12.079> little

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
little bored you need to work a little

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.529 
little bored you need to work a little
bit<00:01:12.829> harder<00:01:13.219> or<00:01:13.459> it<00:01:13.670> started<00:01:13.939> a<00:01:14.060> little<00:01:14.329> bit

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
bit harder or it started a little bit

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.529 
bit harder or it started a little bit
quite<00:01:15.079> a<00:01:15.109> bit<00:01:15.380> harder<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:16.729> get<00:01:16.909> a<00:01:16.969> little<00:01:17.329> bit

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
quite a bit harder to get a little bit

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.539 
quite a bit harder to get a little bit
more<00:01:17.689> improvement<00:01:18.289> right<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:18.889> as<00:01:19.039> you<00:01:19.369> get

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
more improvement right so as you get

fitter and fitter and fitter you do that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.469 
fitter and fitter and fitter you do that
much<00:01:21.920> more<00:01:22.189> were<00:01:22.429> computed<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:22.909> much<00:01:23.270> more

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
much more were computed that much more

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.120 
much more were computed that much more
diligent<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.380> pay<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:24.799> much<00:01:24.950> more

attention<00:01:25.459> to<00:01:25.819> the<00:01:26.359> little<00:01:26.600> details<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:28.369> get

attention to the little details to get

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.940 
attention to the little details to get
small<00:01:29.090> results<00:01:29.689> it's<00:01:30.289> like<00:01:30.469> an<00:01:30.590> olympic

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
small results it's like an olympic

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.099 
small results it's like an olympic
sprinter<00:01:30.979> right<00:01:31.880> think<00:01:32.599> of<00:01:32.749> an<00:01:32.899> Olympic

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
sprinter right think of an Olympic

100-meter<00:01:33.590> sprinter<00:01:34.520> think<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.179> how<00:01:35.389> much

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
100-meter sprinter think of how much

100-meter sprinter think of how much
would<00:01:35.719> work<00:01:35.929> if<00:01:36.170> they<00:01:36.380> need<00:01:36.619> to<00:01:36.649> do<00:01:37.069> to<00:01:38.889> improve

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:39.889 
would work if they need to do to improve

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:42.699 
would work if they need to do to improve
their<00:01:40.099> time<00:01:40.399> to<00:01:40.909> be<00:01:40.939> is<00:01:41.179> that<00:01:41.209> to<00:01:41.689> be<00:01:41.810> one

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709

lost 22 pounds in the last month which
is<00:02:18.740> pretty<00:02:18.980> amazing<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.640> all<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> sudden<00:02:20.450> I

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
is pretty amazing and all of a sudden I

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.050 
is pretty amazing and all of a sudden I
haven't<00:02:21.350> lost<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.590> single<00:02:21.740> pound<00:02:21.920> in<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:23.030> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
haven't lost a single pound in like a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.490 
haven't lost a single pound in like a
week<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.450> half<00:02:23.480> what<00:02:23.900> should<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.110> do<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.380> get

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
week and a half what should I do to get

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500 
week and a half what should I do to get
over<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.709> plateau<00:02:24.950> okay<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.480> first

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
over to the plateau okay so the first

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.970 
over to the plateau okay so the first
thing<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:27.020> again<00:02:27.290> if<00:02:27.410> you're<00:02:27.530> just<00:02:27.800> starting

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
thing is again if you're just starting

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.340 
thing is again if you're just starting
to<00:02:28.280> exercise<00:02:28.550> realize<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.690> weight<00:02:30.080> loss

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
to exercise realize that the weight loss

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.240 
to exercise realize that the weight loss
is<00:02:30.650> not<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.130> goal<00:02:31.340> its<00:02:31.610> body<00:02:31.970> x<00:02:32.420> body

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
is not the goal its body x body

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.680 
is not the goal its body x body
composition<00:02:34.250> transformation<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.300> after

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
composition transformation and after

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.270 
composition transformation and after
because<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.990> might<00:02:36.170> lose<00:02:36.320> 20<00:02:36.680> pounds<00:02:36.709> and

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
because you might lose 20 pounds and

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.820 
because you might lose 20 pounds and
then<00:02:37.790> things<00:02:38.720> might<00:02:38.810> start<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.200> level<00:02:39.350> off<00:02:39.560> so

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
then things might start to level off so

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.490 
then things might start to level off so
first<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.310> all<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.520> have<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.730> consider<00:02:41.209> that

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
first of all you have to consider that

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.350 
first of all you have to consider that
is<00:02:42.500> there<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.280> change<00:02:43.700> in<00:02:43.940> body<00:02:44.120> composition

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
is there a change in body composition

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.870 
is there a change in body composition
are<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.170> building<00:02:45.800> more<00:02:46.130> muscle<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.670> losing

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
are you building more muscle and losing

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.479 
are you building more muscle and losing
more<00:02:47.150> fat<00:02:47.480> remember<00:02:47.900> muscle<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:48.739> more<00:02:49.160> dense

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
more fat remember muscle is more dense

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.940 
more fat remember muscle is more dense
than<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.820> fat<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.209> weighs<00:02:50.450> more<00:02:50.780> than<00:02:50.840> fat<00:02:51.020> for

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
than a fat it weighs more than fat for

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.100 
than a fat it weighs more than fat for
the<00:02:52.040> amount<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.280> space<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:52.790> takes<00:02:52.940> up<00:02:53.180> so

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
the amount of space that it takes up so

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.750 
the amount of space that it takes up so
even<00:02:54.410> if<00:02:54.590> you've<00:02:54.739> lost<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.160> lot<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.310> weights<00:02:55.610> and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
even if you've lost a lot of weights and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.040 
even if you've lost a lot of weights and
then<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:55.940> starts<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.180> taper<00:02:56.390> off<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.750> could

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
then it starts to taper off it could

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.720 
then it starts to taper off it could
just<00:02:57.260> be<00:02:57.410> that<00:02:57.560> you're<00:02:57.860> just<00:02:58.040> building<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.580> bit

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
just be that you're just building a bit

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.090 
just be that you're just building a bit
more<00:02:58.880> muscle<00:02:59.410> even<00:03:00.410> though<00:03:00.530> your<00:03:00.680> body<00:03:00.890> fat

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
more muscle even though your body fat

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.520 
more muscle even though your body fat
percentage<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.640> going<00:03:01.910> down<00:03:02.090> okay<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.410> you

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
percentage is going down okay so you

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.640 
percentage is going down okay so you
might<00:03:03.950> have<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.250> same<00:03:04.459> weight<00:03:05.450> but<00:03:06.290> actually

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
might have the same weight but actually

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.650 
might have the same weight but actually
be<00:03:06.769> leaner<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:07.610> try<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:07.910> get<00:03:08.090> your<00:03:08.239> body<00:03:08.420> fat

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
be leaner so try to get your body fat

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.170 
be leaner so try to get your body fat

suggestions<00:03:13.400> let's<00:03:13.790> first<00:03:14.060> look<00:03:14.150> at<00:03:14.330> the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
suggestions let's first look at the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.930 
suggestions let's first look at the
diets<00:03:14.870> one<00:03:15.769> of<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:15.920> greatest<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.519> easiest

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
diets one of the greatest the easiest

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.449 
diets one of the greatest the easiest
whisk<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.360> or<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.540> plateau<00:03:17.810> is<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.709> cycle<00:03:19.310> your

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
whisk it or a plateau is to cycle your

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.170 
whisk it or a plateau is to cycle your
calories<00:03:20.500> for<00:03:21.500> instance<00:03:21.860> let's<00:03:22.370> say<00:03:22.519> you<00:03:23.060> have

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
calories for instance let's say you have

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.479 
calories for instance let's say you have
a<00:03:23.470> I'm<00:03:24.470> going<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.650> just<00:03:24.769> break<00:03:25.070> down<00:03:25.100> very

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
a I'm going to just break down very

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.229 
a I'm going to just break down very
simply<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:25.970> three<00:03:26.420> day<00:03:26.630> cycle<00:03:27.250> one<00:03:28.250> day<00:03:28.459> you

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
simply the three day cycle one day you

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.229 
simply the three day cycle one day you
have<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.420> lot<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.720> calories<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.829> next<00:03:31.220> day<00:03:31.489> you

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
have a lot of calories the next day you

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.660 
have a lot of calories the next day you
have<00:03:32.450> very<00:03:32.810> few<00:03:33.260> calories<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.130> third<00:03:34.459> day

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
have very few calories and the third day

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.550 
have very few calories and the third day
you<00:03:34.730> have<00:03:35.030> kind<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.329> a<00:03:35.420> mediocre<00:03:36.019> number<00:03:36.470> of

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
you have kind of a mediocre number of

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.880 
you have kind of a mediocre number of
calories<00:03:37.180> now<00:03:38.230> with<00:03:39.230> with<00:03:39.620> some<00:03:39.769> of<00:03:39.829> the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
calories now with with some of the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.470 
calories now with with some of the
programs<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.280> i<00:03:40.400> put<00:03:40.579> together<00:03:40.670> i've<00:03:41.000> got<00:03:41.450> a

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
programs that i put together i've got a

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.150 
programs that i put together i've got a
little<00:03:41.570> bit<00:03:41.870> more<00:03:42.019> detailed<00:03:42.680> in<00:03:42.829> this<00:03:42.950> but

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
little bit more detailed in this but

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.560 
little bit more detailed in this but
generally<00:03:43.579> the<00:03:43.700> idea<00:03:43.940> is<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.060> if<00:03:44.239> you<00:03:44.329> eat

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
generally the idea is that if you eat

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.870 
generally the idea is that if you eat
the<00:03:44.780> exact<00:03:45.260> same<00:03:45.590> number<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:45.980> calories<00:03:46.220> every

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
the exact same number of calories every

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.759 
the exact same number of calories every
single<00:03:47.269> day<00:03:47.420> right<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.350> I<00:03:48.380> don't<00:03:48.410> suggest

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
single day right and I don't suggest

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.160 
single day right and I don't suggest
counting<00:03:49.310> calories<00:03:49.489> let's<00:03:50.480> say<00:03:50.600> you<00:03:50.750> roughly

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
counting calories let's say you roughly

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.280 
counting calories let's say you roughly
have<00:03:51.380> 2500<00:03:52.070> calories<00:03:52.190> every<00:03:52.820> single<00:03:53.180> day<00:03:53.329> your

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
have 2500 calories every single day your

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.650 
have 2500 calories every single day your
body<00:03:54.590> is<00:03:54.769> going<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:55.040> hit<00:03:55.370> it's<00:03:56.150> gonna<00:03:56.390> it's

I feel I've Greer their view the same
workout<00:04:57.500> twice<00:04:58.900> maybe<00:04:59.900> it's<00:05:00.050> just<00:05:00.080> because

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
I'm I don't I get bored of doing the

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.510 
I'm I don't I get bored of doing the

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
same thing over and over again so

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.380 
same thing over and over again so
traditionally<00:05:04.520> when<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.000> put<00:05:05.180> through<00:05:05.300> the

traditionally when I put through the

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.320 
traditionally when I put through the
program<00:05:05.720> is<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.080> lot<00:05:06.320> of<00:05:06.470> variety<00:05:06.980> and<00:05:07.340> that's<00:05:08.240> a

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
program is a lot of variety and that's a

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
program is a lot of variety and that's a

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
muscles confused and that is the key to

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.950 
muscles confused and that is the key to
getting<00:05:51.950> over<00:05:52.130> plateaus<00:05:52.580> the<00:05:53.360> next<00:05:53.720> thing<00:05:53.870> you

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
getting over plateaus the next thing you

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.230 
getting over plateaus the next thing you
can<00:05:54.110> do<00:05:54.200> is<00:05:54.350> also<00:05:54.650> look<00:05:54.800> at<00:05:54.950> taking<00:05:55.400> a<00:05:55.550> little

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
can do is also look at taking a little

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.790 
can do is also look at taking a little
bit<00:05:56.420> of<00:05:56.450> recovery<00:05:56.870> time<00:05:57.050> sometimes<00:05:57.530> people

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
bit of recovery time sometimes people

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.860 
bit of recovery time sometimes people
are<00:05:57.890> simply<00:05:58.100> overtraining<00:05:58.760> sometimes<00:05:59.690> one<00:05:59.840> of

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
are simply overtraining sometimes one of

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.240 
are simply overtraining sometimes one of
the<00:05:59.960> best<00:06:00.230> things<00:06:00.440> you<00:06:00.590> can<00:06:00.620> do<00:06:00.860> is<00:06:01.040> take<00:06:01.220> a

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
the best things you can do is take a

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.180 
the best things you can do is take a
week<00:06:01.490> off<00:06:01.700> training<00:06:02.090> all<00:06:02.180> to<00:06:02.300> get<00:06:02.420> it<00:06:02.980> ready<00:06:03.980> to

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
week off training all to get it ready to

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.370 
week off training all to get it ready to
come<00:06:04.340> back<00:06:04.370> maybe<00:06:04.700> fresher<00:06:05.180> more<00:06:05.540> energized

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
come back maybe fresher more energized

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.770 
come back maybe fresher more energized
and<00:06:06.710> your<00:06:07.250> body<00:06:07.400> might<00:06:07.670> be<00:06:07.820> able<00:06:07.880> to<00:06:08.030> respond<00:06:08.480> a

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
and your body might be able to respond a

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.620 
and your body might be able to respond a
little<00:06:08.810> bit<00:06:09.170> more<00:06:09.350> resilient<00:06:10.340> so<00:06:11.060> those<00:06:11.450> are

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
little bit more resilient so those are

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.920 
little bit more resilient so those are
some<00:06:11.660> things<00:06:12.500> to<00:06:12.860> think<00:06:12.890> about<00:06:13.510> if<00:06:14.510> you've<00:06:14.750> hit

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
some things to think about if you've hit

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.440 
some things to think about if you've hit
a<00:06:14.960> plateau<00:06:15.190> so<00:06:16.190> take<00:06:16.520> those<00:06:16.670> to<00:06:16.820> heart<00:06:17.000> take

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
a plateau so take those to heart take

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.760 
a plateau so take those to heart take
