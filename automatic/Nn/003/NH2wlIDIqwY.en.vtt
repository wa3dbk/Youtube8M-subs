00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
first person shooter which was a lot of

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.850 
first person shooter which was a lot of
action<00:00:57.220> and<00:00:57.510> some<00:00:58.510> funny<00:00:58.720> stuff<00:00:58.989> then<00:00:59.650> he<00:00:59.739> had

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
action and some funny stuff then he had

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.920 
action and some funny stuff then he had
the<00:00:59.949> beat<00:01:00.129> of<00:01:00.280> episodes<00:01:00.550> which<00:01:00.730> were<00:01:00.930> mostly

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
the beat of episodes which were mostly

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.580 
the beat of episodes which were mostly
comical<00:01:02.920> episode<00:01:03.280> but<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.909> lot<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.440> fights<00:01:05.440> in

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
comical episode but a lot of fights in

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.260 
comical episode but a lot of fights in
between<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.010> stuff<00:01:06.190> but<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.700> space<00:01:06.850> ones<00:01:07.120> are

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
between and stuff but the space ones are

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.460 
between and stuff but the space ones are
a<00:01:07.330> lot<00:01:07.450> more<00:01:07.540> serious<00:01:07.990> than<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.170> other<00:01:08.320> ones

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
a lot more serious than the other ones

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.899 
a lot more serious than the other ones
and<00:01:08.710> that's<00:01:09.159> I<00:01:09.220> think<00:01:09.250> because<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.670> tone<00:01:09.880> of

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
and that's I think because the tone of

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.460 
and that's I think because the tone of
those<00:01:10.150> games<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.600> lot<00:01:10.630> more<00:01:10.870> seriously<00:01:11.200> look<00:01:11.380> at

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
those games a lot more seriously look at

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.030 
those games a lot more seriously look at
games<00:01:11.740> like<00:01:12.550> Wing<00:01:13.150> Commander<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:14.440> space

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
games like Wing Commander the space

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.490 
games like Wing Commander the space
episodes<00:01:15.640> were<00:01:16.150> really<00:01:16.960> interesting

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
episodes were really interesting

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.520 
episodes were really interesting
actually<00:01:17.890> because<00:01:18.540> that's<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:19.870> end<00:01:20.140> of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
actually because that's the end of

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.070 
actually because that's the end of
season<00:01:20.920> one<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.460> it's<00:01:21.729> where<00:01:22.030> Cara's<00:01:22.750> walls
