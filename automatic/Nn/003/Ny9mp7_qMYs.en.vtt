few months first I'd like to say that
you<00:00:30.929> could<00:00:31.109> play<00:00:31.289> bottleneck<00:00:31.830> guitar<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.780> any

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780

really don't have to do any special
setup<00:00:38.629> most<00:00:39.629> guitars<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.770> play<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
setup most guitars that you play in a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.139 
setup most guitars that you play in a
standard<00:00:41.760> way

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
standard way

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.880 
standard way
the<00:00:42.420> action<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.020> good<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.500> mean<00:00:43.710> by

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the action is good and what I mean by

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.459 
the action is good and what I mean by
that<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.309> string<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.809> height<00:00:46.079> from<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that is that string the height from the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.500 
that is that string the height from the
string<00:00:47.340> height<00:00:47.550> from<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.739> fingerboard<00:00:50.510> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
string height from the fingerboard you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.880 
string height from the fingerboard you
don't<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:51.989> anything<00:00:52.170> special<00:00:52.500> like

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
don't have to do anything special like

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.250 
don't have to do anything special like
put<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.579> nut<00:00:53.820> extend<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.570> raise<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
bridge at all the one thing you might

bridge at all the one thing you might
have<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.809> do<00:00:57.989> though<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.250> might<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.699> to

have to do though is you might have to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.340 
have to do though is you might have to
be<00:00:59.879> concerned<00:01:00.239> about<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> string<00:01:00.899> gauge<00:01:01.109> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
be concerned about the string gauge that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650 
be concerned about the string gauge that
you<00:01:01.500> use<00:01:01.760> if<00:01:02.760> you're<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> use<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> same

you use if you're going to use the same

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.960 
you use if you're going to use the same

the low string that way when you do
tuned<00:01:18.689> down<00:01:19.020> you'll<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.680> enough<00:01:20.040> tension<00:01:20.310> on

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
tuned down you'll have enough tension on

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940 
tuned down you'll have enough tension on
the<00:01:20.640> strings<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.240> play<00:01:21.360> bottleneck<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.860> if

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the strings to play bottleneck but if

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.800 
the strings to play bottleneck but if
you<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.250> two<00:01:23.490> guitars<00:01:23.909> maybe<00:01:24.390> one's<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you have two guitars maybe one's a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
you have two guitars maybe one's a
resonator<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.409> another<00:01:26.040> regular<00:01:26.340> guitar<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
resonator or another regular guitar you

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.990 
resonator or another regular guitar you
can<00:01:27.150> string<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.450> totally<00:01:27.960> different<00:01:29.000> if

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
can string it totally different if

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640 
can string it totally different if
you're<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.450> play<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.840> lower<00:01:31.079> tunings

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
you're going to play in lower tunings

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.149 
you're going to play in lower tunings
and<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.159> lower<00:01:32.340> tunings<00:01:32.850> would<00:01:33.030> be<00:01:33.680> deg<00:01:34.680> or<00:01:34.890> C

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
and the lower tunings would be deg or C

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.789 
and the lower tunings would be deg or C
you<00:01:35.400> put<00:01:35.909> heavier<00:01:36.270> strings<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.200> heavier

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
you put heavier strings on and heavier

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.760 
you put heavier strings on and heavier
gauge<00:01:38.070> strings<00:01:38.430> run<00:01:38.670> from<00:01:38.880> about<00:01:39.030> us<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.479> 16<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
gauge strings run from about us of 16 to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.190 
gauge strings run from about us of 16 to
a<00:01:40.799> 56<00:01:41.549> now<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.329> thing<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> course<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:43.110> you

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
a 56 now the one thing of course if you

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.289 
a 56 now the one thing of course if you
put<00:01:43.350> heavy<00:01:43.619> strings<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.430> can't<00:01:44.729> tune<00:01:45.060> that

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
put heavy strings on you can't tune that

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.569 
put heavy strings on you can't tune that
guitar<00:01:45.659> up<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.170> standard<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.040> it'll<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.220> be

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
guitar up to standard so it'll just be

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.210 
guitar up to standard so it'll just be
for<00:01:47.820> lower<00:01:48.659> tunings<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.710> because<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
for lower tunings but because of the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.679 
for lower tunings but because of the
thicker<00:01:50.460> strings<00:01:50.880> you'll<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.180> more<00:01:51.360> tension

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
thicker strings you'll have more tension

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.020 
thicker strings you'll have more tension
you'll<00:01:52.020> get<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> better<00:01:52.409> tone<00:01:52.790> another<00:01:53.790> way<00:01:53.970> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you'll get a better tone another way to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.480 
you'll get a better tone another way to
go<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.290> want<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:56.070> above

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
go is if you want to to an up above

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.880 
go is if you want to to an up above
standard<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.240> would<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.600> saying<00:01:57.930> keys

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
standard and that would be saying keys

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.639 
standard and that would be saying keys
of<00:01:59.040> ena<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.939> put<00:02:00.149> lighter<00:02:00.450> strings<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.560> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
of ena you put lighter strings on so you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.469 
of ena you put lighter strings on so you
put<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> light<00:02:02.159> gauge<00:02:02.430> string<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.060> they<00:02:03.119> run

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
put a light gauge string and they run

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.850 
put a light gauge string and they run
from<00:02:03.780> about<00:02:04.079> 11<00:02:04.590> or<00:02:04.680> 12<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> 54<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:07.740> you

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
from about 11 or 12 to a 54 and then you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.160 
from about 11 or 12 to a 54 and then you
can<00:02:08.009> tune<00:02:08.250> up<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.030> one<00:02:09.330> thing<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.720> do<00:02:09.780> just

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
can tune up now the one thing I do just

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.630 
can tune up now the one thing I do just
to<00:02:10.229> get<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> little<00:02:10.619> more<00:02:10.739> tone<00:02:11.039> because<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> lot

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
to get a little more tone because a lot

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.280 
to get a little more tone because a lot
of<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.849> bottleneck<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.810> played<00:02:13.050> on<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
of the bottleneck is played on the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.729 
of the bottleneck is played on the
heights

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
heights

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.369 
heights
I'll<00:02:14.010> substitute<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:15.000> two<00:02:15.180> high<00:02:15.420> strings<00:02:16.019> and

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
I'll substitute the two high strings and

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.039 
I'll substitute the two high strings and
what<00:02:16.739> I'll<00:02:16.859> do<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.159> I'll<00:02:17.310> put<00:02:17.549> up<00:02:17.579> a<00:02:17.879> 13<00:02:18.599> on<00:02:18.810> for

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
what I'll do is I'll put up a 13 on for

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.170 
what I'll do is I'll put up a 13 on for
the<00:02:19.109> e<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.620> I'll<00:02:19.709> put<00:02:19.859> a<00:02:19.890> 17<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:20.939> B<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the e and I'll put a 17 on for the B and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.160 
the e and I'll put a 17 on for the B and
I<00:02:21.629> could<00:02:21.810> still<00:02:22.049> tune<00:02:22.290> up<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.730> way<00:02:24.170> I'll

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
I could still tune up in that way I'll

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.979 
I could still tune up in that way I'll
get<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.379> nice<00:02:25.620> clear<00:02:26.040> tone<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.730> some<00:02:27.299> cases<00:02:27.599> with

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
get a nice clear tone in some cases with

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.750 
get a nice clear tone in some cases with
the<00:02:28.109> lighter<00:02:28.319> gauge<00:02:28.560> strings<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.189> could<00:02:29.370> tune

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
the lighter gauge strings you could tune

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.030 
the lighter gauge strings you could tune
down<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.359> the<00:02:30.480> lower<00:02:30.659> tunings<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.290> they'll

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
down to the lower tunings and they'll

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.559 
down to the lower tunings and they'll
still<00:02:32.370> play<00:02:32.639> well<00:02:32.849> you'll<00:02:33.000> still<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.329> enough

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
still play well you'll still have enough

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.789 
still play well you'll still have enough
tension<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:34.409> kind<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.769> to

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
tension but you kind of have to

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.660 
tension but you kind of have to
experiment<00:02:35.280> around<00:02:36.469> the<00:02:37.469> next<00:02:37.739> thing<00:02:37.950> I'll

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
experiment around the next thing I'll

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.119 
experiment around the next thing I'll
talk<00:02:38.819> about<00:02:38.879> is<00:02:39.150> slides<00:02:39.680> it's<00:02:40.680> always<00:02:40.889> the<00:02:41.010> big

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
talk about is slides it's always the big

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.300 
talk about is slides it's always the big
controversy<00:02:41.549> what<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.209> use<00:02:42.420> glass<00:02:42.810> or<00:02:43.079> metal

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
controversy what to use glass or metal

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.429 
controversy what to use glass or metal
I'd<00:02:44.310> say<00:02:44.639> by<00:02:45.090> different<00:02:45.480> slides<00:02:45.720> experiment

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
I'd say by different slides experiment

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.199 
I'd say by different slides experiment
and<00:02:46.560> see<00:02:46.709> what<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:47.069> like<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.609> use<00:02:48.419> both<00:02:50.209> but

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
and see what you like I use both but

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.270 
and see what you like I use both but
what<00:02:51.389> I'd<00:02:51.510> say<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.870> general<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.709> about<00:02:52.859> glass

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
what I'd say in general is about glass

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.309 
what I'd say in general is about glass
is<00:02:53.669> you<00:02:54.030> want<00:02:54.239> thick<00:02:54.540> glass<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:55.169> for

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
is you want thick glass like for

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.569 
is you want thick glass like for
instance<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:55.739> is<00:02:55.919> from<00:02:56.159> a<00:02:56.310> Grey<00:02:56.549> Goose

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
instance this is from a Grey Goose

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.909 
instance this is from a Grey Goose
bottle<00:02:57.359> so<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:58.049> see<00:02:58.169> it's<00:02:58.319> a<00:02:58.349> very<00:02:58.379> thick

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
bottle so you can see it's a very thick

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.259 
bottle so you can see it's a very thick
glass<00:02:59.250> or<00:02:59.879> this<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.629> made<00:03:00.870> back<00:03:01.680> in<00:03:01.859> 84<00:03:02.760> out<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.180> a

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
glass or this I made back in 84 out of a

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.539 
glass or this I made back in 84 out of a
much<00:03:03.450> juice<00:03:03.689> wine<00:03:03.989> bottle<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:05.219> don't<00:03:05.280> even

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
much juice wine bottle and I don't even

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.099 
much juice wine bottle and I don't even
think<00:03:05.760> they<00:03:05.879> make<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.239> bottle<00:03:06.629> anymore<00:03:06.959> but

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
think they make this bottle anymore but

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.129 
think they make this bottle anymore but
it's<00:03:07.200> nice<00:03:07.349> thick<00:03:07.680> glass<00:03:08.120> or<00:03:09.120> here's<00:03:09.870> another

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
it's nice thick glass or here's another

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.229 
it's nice thick glass or here's another
one<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.379> friend<00:03:10.680> made<00:03:10.859> from<00:03:11.400> an<00:03:11.489> Italian<00:03:12.060> wine

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
one a friend made from an Italian wine

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.959 
one a friend made from an Italian wine
bottle<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.560> could<00:03:13.709> say<00:03:13.919> or<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.609> could<00:03:14.790> buy

duane allman corseted bottle which does
work<00:03:21.479> nice<00:03:21.720> but<00:03:22.019> it's<00:03:22.229> a<00:03:22.530> little<00:03:23.459> light<00:03:23.669> good

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
work nice but it's a little light good

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.949 
work nice but it's a little light good
for<00:03:24.629> electric<00:03:24.989> guitar<00:03:25.319> but<00:03:26.690> heavier<00:03:27.690> would<00:03:27.870> be

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
for electric guitar but heavier would be

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.349 
for electric guitar but heavier would be
better<00:03:28.139> for<00:03:28.260> ku<00:03:28.889> sticks<00:03:29.129> or<00:03:29.400> medicine<00:03:30.000> bottles

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359

short<00:03:54.930> because<00:03:55.319> they<00:03:55.439> just<00:03:55.650> want<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.859> play

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
short because they just want to play

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.920 
short because they just want to play
lead<00:03:56.519> lines<00:03:56.790> or<00:03:57.000> other<00:03:57.030> people<00:03:57.479> like<00:03:57.659> it<00:03:57.870> a

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
lead lines or other people like it a

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.229 
lead lines or other people like it a
little<00:03:58.109> longer<00:03:58.379> so<00:03:58.829> they<00:03:59.250> can<00:03:59.430> cover<00:03:59.669> all<00:03:59.909> six

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
little longer so they can cover all six

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.780 
little longer so they can cover all six
strings<00:04:00.889> and<00:04:01.889> again<00:04:02.129> you<00:04:02.250> have<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.549> shop

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
strings and again you have to shop

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.170 
strings and again you have to shop
around<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.359> find<00:04:03.989> what<00:04:04.439> size<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:05.220> like<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.609> like

these<00:04:08.340> fingers<00:04:08.819> to<00:04:09.120> fret<00:04:10.019> notes<00:04:10.259> other<00:04:10.680> people

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
these fingers to fret notes other people

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.710 
these fingers to fret notes other people

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.370 
you what works best the last thing I
like<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.449> address<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:19.019> finger<00:04:19.829> picks<00:04:21.380> there's

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
like to address is finger picks there's

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.159 
like to address is finger picks there's
two<00:04:22.560> kinds<00:04:22.979> is<00:04:23.130> metal<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.700> is<00:04:23.909> plastic<00:04:24.510> the

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
two kinds is metal and is plastic the

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.870 
two kinds is metal and is plastic the
one<00:04:25.320> thing<00:04:25.469> about<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.770> metal<00:04:26.070> is

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
one thing about the metal is

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.280 
one thing about the metal is
when<00:04:26.970> your<00:04:27.060> fingers<00:04:27.360> get<00:04:27.510> sweaty<00:04:27.870> they<00:04:28.050> seem

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
when your fingers get sweaty they seem

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.500 
when your fingers get sweaty they seem
to<00:04:28.410> come<00:04:28.590> off<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:29.490> plastics<00:04:30.060> stay<00:04:30.300> on<00:04:30.480> a

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
to come off the plastics stay on a

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.450 
to come off the plastics stay on a
little<00:04:30.840> tighter<00:04:31.170> and<00:04:31.470> are<00:04:31.800> actually<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.190> little

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
little tighter and are actually a little

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.910 
little tighter and are actually a little
longer<00:04:32.940> so<00:04:33.330> it's<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.660> little<00:04:34.080> easier<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.740> reach

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
longer so it's a little easier to reach

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.120 
longer so it's a little easier to reach
into<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.340> strings<00:04:36.470> so<00:04:37.470> again<00:04:37.770> you<00:04:37.920> just<00:04:38.040> have

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
into the strings so again you just have

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.550 
into the strings so again you just have
to<00:04:38.400> experiment<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:39.030> pretty<00:04:39.570> much<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:40.320> just

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
to experiment and pretty much you just

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.740 
to experiment and pretty much you just
wear<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:40.830> thumb<00:04:41.250> pick<00:04:41.520> on<00:04:41.730> this<00:04:41.910> behind<00:04:42.600> your

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
wear a thumb pick on this behind your

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.290 
wear a thumb pick on this behind your
thumb<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:43.050> course<00:04:43.260> and<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:44.040> wear<00:04:44.700> two<00:04:44.940> finger

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
thumb of course and you wear two finger

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.730 
thumb of course and you wear two finger
picks<00:04:45.570> one<00:04:45.750> on<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.900> index<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.440> one<00:04:46.530> on<00:04:46.650> the

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
picks one on the index and one on the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.220 
picks one on the index and one on the
middle<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.310> that's<00:04:48.300> all<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.660> really<00:04:48.810> need<00:04:49.110> to
