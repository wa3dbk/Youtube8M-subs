00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
that was pointed to a nicety that we

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.380 
that was pointed to a nicety that we
have<00:02:34.220> used<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.520> actually<00:02:34.670> allow<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.060> children

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
have used to actually allow the children

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.660 
have used to actually allow the children
to<00:02:35.570> develop<00:02:36.410> more<00:02:36.710> ownership<00:02:37.070> over<00:02:37.370> water

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
to develop more ownership over water

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.890 
to develop more ownership over water
that's<00:02:37.910> what<00:02:38.120> they<00:02:38.330> are<00:02:38.360> doing<00:02:38.480> especially

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
that's what they are doing especially

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.990 
that's what they are doing especially
through<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.350> nearly<00:02:39.740> they<00:02:40.160> can<00:02:40.460> access<00:02:40.850> their

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
through the nearly they can access their

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.110 
through the nearly they can access their
own<00:02:41.030> homework<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:41.930> spellings<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.790> mary-6<00:02:43.790> at

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
own homework and spellings and mary-6 at

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.000 
own homework and spellings and mary-6 at
that<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:44.450> they<00:02:44.570> can<00:02:44.780> actually<00:02:44.930> choose<00:02:45.830> what

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
that so they can actually choose what

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.890 
that so they can actually choose what
they<00:02:46.190> want<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.490> do<00:02:46.700> with<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:46.940> i-16<00:02:47.090> take<00:02:47.690> more

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
they want to do with the i-16 take more

00:02:47.900 --> 00:03:04.260 
they want to do with the i-16 take more
I<00:03:01.450> believe<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.630> gives<00:03:02.840> us<00:03:02.989> more<00:03:03.140> access<00:03:03.350> to

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
I believe it gives us more access to

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.370 
I believe it gives us more access to
find<00:03:05.270> out<00:03:05.450> what<00:03:05.630> our<00:03:05.780> children<00:03:05.989> are<00:03:06.290> actually

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
find out what our children are actually

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.410 
find out what our children are actually
learning<00:03:06.680> in<00:03:06.980> school<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.550> teachers<00:03:07.940> who<00:03:08.120> set

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
learning in school the teachers who set

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.900 
learning in school the teachers who set
up<00:03:08.630> clothes<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:10.130> you<00:03:10.220> children<00:03:10.459> have

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
up clothes so that you children have

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.850 
up clothes so that you children have
somewhere<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:11.390> go<00:03:11.600> somewhere<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.200> log<00:03:12.410> to<00:03:12.590> back

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
somewhere to go somewhere to log to back

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.250 
somewhere to go somewhere to log to back
from<00:03:13.160> having<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.640> viennese<00:03:14.090> had<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.660> massive

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
from having the viennese had a massive

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.350 
from having the viennese had a massive
impact<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.860> whole<00:03:16.040> school<00:03:16.370> even<00:03:16.640> for<00:03:16.880> home

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
impact on the whole school even for home

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.390 
impact on the whole school even for home
as<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:17.780> mentioned<00:03:18.230> homework<00:03:18.800> was<00:03:19.040> funny<00:03:19.250> on

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
as I mentioned homework was funny on

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.979 
as I mentioned homework was funny on
there<00:03:19.640> so<00:03:19.880> none<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.330> children<00:03:20.510> have<00:03:20.840> any

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
there so none of the children have any

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.820 
there so none of the children have any
excuse

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.850 

and<00:03:24.280> Ely<00:03:25.270> is<00:03:25.510> good<00:03:25.900> because<00:03:26.050> it's<00:03:26.620> got

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
and Ely is good because it's got

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.120 
and Ely is good because it's got
websites<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:31.570> can<00:03:31.900> see<00:03:32.140> like<00:03:32.350> different

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
websites and you can see like different

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.580 
websites and you can see like different
piece<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.490> work<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:34.170> pictures<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.440> then<00:03:35.560> you

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
piece of work and pictures and then you

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:43.680 
piece of work and pictures and then you
can<00:03:35.890> write<00:03:36.070> comments<00:03:36.340> on<00:03:36.700> it<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.180> see<00:03:42.660> well<00:03:43.660> I

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
can write comments on it to see well I

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.770 
can write comments on it to see well I
think<00:03:44.020> it's<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.650> good<00:03:44.800> idea<00:03:44.950> because<00:03:45.430> if<00:03:46.030> you

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
think it's a good idea because if you

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.690 
think it's a good idea because if you
don't<00:03:47.290> always<00:03:47.500> understand<00:03:48.280> something<00:03:48.580> in

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
don't always understand something in

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.500 
don't always understand something in
class<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.210> can<00:03:49.420> log<00:03:50.230> on<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:50.470> it's<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:52.360> it's

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
class you can log on and it's and it's

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.870 
class you can log on and it's and it's
another<00:03:52.810> way<00:03:53.020> to<00:03:53.050> run<00:03:53.560> over<00:03:53.950> with<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.640> it

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
another way to run over with you and it

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:08.230 
another way to run over with you and it
