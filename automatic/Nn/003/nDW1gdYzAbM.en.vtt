00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:05.890 
hey guys a male team from blind horse

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.290 
hey guys a male team from blind horse
knives<00:00:05.979> and<00:00:06.399> today<00:00:06.609> I'm<00:00:06.729> here<00:00:06.880> with<00:00:06.939> Brad

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:07.300 
knives and today I'm here with Brad

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.240

stall Smith from Peters he treat hey

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.500 
stall Smith from Peters he treat hey
Brad<00:00:09.490> how<00:00:09.790> you<00:00:09.849> doing<00:00:10.120> good<00:00:10.240> to<00:00:10.300> see<00:00:10.450> you

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510 
Brad how you doing good to see you

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.610 
Brad how you doing good to see you
brother<00:00:10.660> always<00:00:10.960> good<00:00:11.259> to<00:00:11.320> have<00:00:11.440> you<00:00:11.559> around

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
brother always good to have you around

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.620 
brother always good to have you around
but<00:00:12.610> let's<00:00:13.360> talk<00:00:13.509> about<00:00:13.570> optimum<00:00:14.349> hardness

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
but let's talk about optimum hardness

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.359 
but let's talk about optimum hardness
piece<00:00:16.630> of<00:00:16.810> steel<00:00:16.960> I<00:00:17.020> guess<00:00:17.350> let's<00:00:17.619> say<00:00:17.800> look<00:00:18.250> he

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
piece of steel I guess let's say look he

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.970 
piece of steel I guess let's say look he
said<00:00:18.520> oh<00:00:18.550> 1<00:00:18.910> it's<00:00:19.869> perfect<00:00:20.140> hardness<00:00:20.650> would<00:00:20.830> be

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
said oh 1 it's perfect hardness would be

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.900 
said oh 1 it's perfect hardness would be
different<00:00:21.340> than<00:00:21.519> CPM<00:00:22.179> 154<00:00:23.400> yeah<00:00:24.400> in<00:00:24.609> a<00:00:24.699> sense

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
different than CPM 154 yeah in a sense

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.999 
different than CPM 154 yeah in a sense
that's<00:00:25.150> true<00:00:26.640> optimum<00:00:27.640> hardness<00:00:28.089> I<00:00:28.660> like<00:00:29.650> to<00:00:29.800> I

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
that's true optimum hardness I like to I

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.589 
that's true optimum hardness I like to I
like<00:00:30.160> to<00:00:30.429> tell<00:00:30.609> people<00:00:30.669> that<00:00:31.089> you<00:00:31.240> if<00:00:31.449> you're

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
like to tell people that you if you're

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.920 
like to tell people that you if you're
using<00:00:31.810> any<00:00:32.290> piece<00:00:32.619> of<00:00:32.650> steel<00:00:33.010> that<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:34.480> might

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
using any piece of steel that you might

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.630 
using any piece of steel that you might
as<00:00:34.990> well<00:00:35.020> get<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.350> best<00:00:35.590> heat-treat<00:00:36.100> possible

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
as well get the best heat-treat possible

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.950 
as well get the best heat-treat possible
out<00:00:36.760> of<00:00:36.910> it<00:00:37.000> so<00:00:37.149> you<00:00:37.300> can<00:00:37.420> get<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.750> best

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
out of it so you can get the best

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.389 
out of it so you can get the best
performance<00:00:38.170> out<00:00:38.680> of<00:00:38.739> that<00:00:38.890> piece<00:00:39.100> of<00:00:39.250> steel

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
performance out of that piece of steel

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.250 
performance out of that piece of steel
why<00:00:39.670> not<00:00:39.850> use<00:00:40.090> it<00:00:40.270> to<00:00:40.420> one<00:00:40.629> hundred<00:00:40.719> percent<00:00:40.930> of

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
why not use it to one hundred percent of

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.080 
why not use it to one hundred percent of
its<00:00:41.379> capability<00:00:42.010> student<00:00:43.800> carbon<00:00:44.800> steel

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
its capability student carbon steel

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.979 
its capability student carbon steel
knives<00:00:48.059> generally<00:00:49.059> will<00:00:49.300> hold<00:00:49.690> an<00:00:49.809> edge<00:00:49.960> a

knives generally will hold an edge a

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.599 
knives generally will hold an edge a

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
little bit less at the same hardness

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.819 
little bit less at the same hardness

ultimate really perfect hardness depends

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.470 
ultimate really perfect hardness depends
on<00:01:00.730> what<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:02.320> knife<00:01:02.530> maker<00:01:03.030> wants<00:01:04.030> in<00:01:04.300> his

on what the knife maker wants in his

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.310 
on what the knife maker wants in his
steel<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:07.030> can<00:01:07.210> lower<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.720> hardness<00:01:08.049> a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320

you're<00:01:43.509> going<00:01:43.659> to<00:01:43.720> have<00:01:43.930> in<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.170> piece<00:01:44.380> of

you're going to have in a piece of

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.539 
carbon steel but you're also going to be
sacrificing<00:01:47.079> a<00:01:47.110> little<00:01:47.320> bit<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.500> toughness<00:01:47.710> on

the other side of things at the

stainless end i'm going to say the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.139 
stainless end i'm going to say the
optimum<00:01:53.920> hardest<00:01:54.340> for<00:01:54.520> stainless<00:01:54.790> knives

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
optimum hardest for stainless knives

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.959 
optimum hardest for stainless knives
would<00:01:55.840> be<00:01:55.990> anywhere<00:01:56.290> from<00:01:56.320> about<00:01:56.530> 59<00:01:57.219> to<00:01:57.430> 60<00:01:57.729> to

would be anywhere from about 59 to 60 to
rockwell<00:01:58.450> so<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:58.930> get<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.140> little

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
rockwell so you get a little

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.110 
rockwell so you get a little
a bit<00:02:00.380> more<00:02:00.640> you're<00:02:01.640> going<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:01.820> be<00:02:01.880> able<00:02:01.970> to

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
a bit more you're going to be able to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.250 
a bit more you're going to be able to
you're<00:02:02.420> gonna<00:02:02.510> be<00:02:02.600> able<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.840> hold<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.140> little

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
you're gonna be able to hold a little

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.960 
you're gonna be able to hold a little
bit<00:02:03.470> higher<00:02:03.650> hardness<00:02:04.040> on<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.340> stainless<00:02:04.760> knife

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
bit higher hardness on a stainless knife

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.130 
bit higher hardness on a stainless knife
and<00:02:05.510> still<00:02:05.720> have<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:05.990> be<00:02:06.020> pretty<00:02:06.380> tough<00:02:06.620> hmm<00:02:07.520> a

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
and still have it be pretty tough hmm a

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.029 
and still have it be pretty tough hmm a
little<00:02:09.140> tougher<00:02:09.440> than<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:09.590> would<00:02:09.830> at<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
little tougher than you would at the

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.580 
little tougher than you would at the
same<00:02:10.250> hardness<00:02:10.580> on<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.030> carbon-steel<00:02:11.480> knife<00:02:11.660> so

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
same hardness on a carbon-steel knife so

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.699 
same hardness on a carbon-steel knife so
it<00:02:12.740> really<00:02:12.980> all<00:02:13.220> depends<00:02:13.670> on<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.780> end<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.680> end

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
it really all depends on the end the end

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.110 
it really all depends on the end the end
user<00:02:16.069> right<00:02:16.780> what<00:02:17.780> steel<00:02:18.110> you're<00:02:18.380> using<00:02:18.680> and

user right what steel you're using and
how<00:02:20.120> tough<00:02:20.840> versus<00:02:21.440> how<00:02:21.560> hard<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.100> want<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.490> be

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
how tough versus how hard you want to be
