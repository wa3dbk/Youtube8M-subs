next to that guy who will jailbreak your
iPhone<00:06:01.630> there<00:06:01.810> will<00:06:01.900> now<00:06:02.020> be<00:06:02.080> a<00:06:02.229> street

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
iPhone there will now be a street

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.790

ophthalmologist<00:06:04.169> which<00:06:05.169> might<00:06:05.380> lead<00:06:05.500> is<00:06:05.650> a

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
ophthalmologist which might lead is a

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.710 
ophthalmologist which might lead is a
spillover<00:06:06.250> market<00:06:06.820> in<00:06:07.090> developed<00:06:07.450> countries

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
spillover market in developed countries

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.280 
spillover market in developed countries
as<00:06:07.870> well<00:06:07.990> so<00:06:08.380> on<00:06:08.530> that<00:06:08.830> promise<00:06:09.810> I'm<00:06:10.810> giving

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
as well so on that promise I'm giving

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.600 
as well so on that promise I'm giving
you<00:06:11.350> four<00:06:11.620> I<00:06:11.650> do<00:06:11.919> think<00:06:12.280> that<00:06:12.370> there's

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
you four I do think that there's

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.510 
you four I do think that there's
international<00:06:13.030> opportunity<00:06:13.690> here<00:06:13.810> I<00:06:14.520> agree

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
international opportunity here I agree

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.130 
international opportunity here I agree
with<00:06:15.640> that<00:06:15.790> David<00:06:16.090> and<00:06:16.270> I<00:06:16.419> would<00:06:16.750> expand<00:06:17.110> I

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
with that David and I would expand I

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.719 
with that David and I would expand I
hope<00:06:17.290> you<00:06:17.620> also<00:06:17.770> think<00:06:18.100> about<00:06:18.190> Android

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
hope you also think about Android

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.250 
hope you also think about Android
because<00:06:19.090> Android<00:06:19.540> is<00:06:19.690> probably<00:06:19.990> going<00:06:20.110> to<00:06:20.200> be

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
because Android is probably going to be

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.570 
because Android is probably going to be
the<00:06:20.350> more<00:06:20.470> prominent<00:06:20.830> platform<00:06:21.400> in<00:06:21.490> the

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
the more prominent platform in the

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.580 
the more prominent platform in the
emerging<00:06:21.940> countries<00:06:22.090> I<00:06:22.540> also<00:06:23.110> really<00:06:23.410> like

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
emerging countries I also really like

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.190 
emerging countries I also really like
that<00:06:23.620> there's<00:06:23.919> a<00:06:24.010> lot<00:06:24.310> of<00:06:24.460> IP<00:06:25.120> that<00:06:25.750> went<00:06:26.080> into

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
that there's a lot of IP that went into

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.170 
that there's a lot of IP that went into
this<00:06:26.440> and<00:06:27.040> I<00:06:27.070> also<00:06:27.220> really<00:06:27.580> like<00:06:27.760> the<00:06:27.940> fact

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
this and I also really like the fact

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.270 
this and I also really like the fact
that<00:06:28.330> is<00:06:28.510> unique<00:06:28.840> and<00:06:29.110> creative<00:06:29.410> and<00:06:29.800> so<00:06:29.979> I

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
that is unique and creative and so I

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.330 
that is unique and creative and so I
really<00:06:30.700> do<00:06:30.820> hope<00:06:31.030> it<00:06:31.090> succeeds<00:06:31.240> I<00:06:32.130> would<00:06:33.130> agree

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
really do hope it succeeds I would agree

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.159 
really do hope it succeeds I would agree
with<00:06:33.430> everything<00:06:34.060> that<00:06:34.270> they<00:06:34.630> said<00:06:34.900> I<00:06:34.930> think

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
with everything that they said I think

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:35.910 
with everything that they said I think
it's<00:06:35.260> a<00:06:35.320> really

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
it's a really

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.160 
it's a really
interesting<00:06:36.370> concept<00:06:36.790> and<00:06:37.240> and<00:06:37.720> I<00:06:38.110> think

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
interesting concept and and I think

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.480 
interesting concept and and I think
we'll<00:06:38.440> do<00:06:38.560> really<00:06:38.680> well<00:06:38.920> in<00:06:39.040> the<00:06:39.100> developed

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
we'll do really well in the developed

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.040 
we'll do really well in the developed
world<00:06:39.550> and<00:06:39.880> could<00:06:40.090> potentially<00:06:40.660> if<00:06:40.780> it<00:06:40.930> was

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
world and could potentially if it was

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.850 
world and could potentially if it was
not<00:06:41.290> medically<00:06:42.930> not<00:06:43.930> fda-approved<00:06:44.320> in<00:06:44.770> the

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
not medically not fda-approved in the

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
not medically not fda-approved in the
early<00:06:45.100> days<00:06:45.280> you<00:06:45.430> could<00:06:45.550> sell<00:06:45.670> it<00:06:45.760> as<00:06:45.850> a

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
early days you could sell it as a

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.530 
early days you could sell it as a
consumer<00:06:46.330> device<00:06:47.010> on<00:06:48.010> the<00:06:48.490> in<00:06:48.910> the<00:06:49.030> US<00:06:49.300> but<00:06:49.450> I

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
consumer device on the in the US but I

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.440 
consumer device on the in the US but I
think<00:06:49.690> it's<00:06:49.780> a<00:06:49.810> great<00:06:49.960> idea<00:06:51.060> yeah<00:06:52.060> I<00:06:52.090> mean<00:06:52.300> I<00:06:52.420> I

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:52.450 
think it's a great idea yeah I mean I I

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.090 
think it's a great idea yeah I mean I I
think<00:06:52.960> I'm<00:06:53.110> gonna<00:06:53.200> echo<00:06:53.440> everybody<00:06:53.860> said<00:06:54.070> I

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
think I'm gonna echo everybody said I

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.620 
think I'm gonna echo everybody said I
think<00:06:54.400> it's<00:06:54.550> a<00:06:54.730> fantastic<00:06:54.940> technology

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630 
think it's a fantastic technology

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.100 
think it's a fantastic technology
assuming<00:06:56.140> it<00:06:56.230> works<00:06:56.670> and<00:06:57.780> great<00:06:58.780> for<00:06:59.050> the

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
assuming it works and great for the

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.510 
assuming it works and great for the
international<00:06:59.680> market<00:06:59.710> I<00:07:00.220> think<00:07:00.250> the

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
international market I think the

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.370 
international market I think the
business<00:07:00.850> case<00:07:01.060> in<00:07:01.270> here<00:07:01.960> in<00:07:02.080> the<00:07:02.140> United

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
business case in here in the United

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.320 
business case in here in the United
States<00:07:02.620> would<00:07:02.830> need<00:07:03.040> a<00:07:03.070> lot<00:07:03.430> of<00:07:03.460> work<00:07:03.820> a<00:07:04.090> lot<00:07:04.150> of

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
States would need a lot of work a lot of

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.790 
States would need a lot of work a lot of
work<00:07:04.450> and<00:07:04.840> also<00:07:04.990> I<00:07:05.110> think<00:07:05.200> an<00:07:05.380> endorsement

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
work and also I think an endorsement

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.640 
work and also I think an endorsement
from<00:07:06.130> one<00:07:06.340> of<00:07:06.430> the<00:07:06.640> Optima<00:07:07.630> logic<00:07:08.050> societies

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650 
from one of the Optima logic societies

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.990 
from one of the Optima logic societies
would<00:07:08.830> be<00:07:09.040> a<00:07:09.070> would<00:07:09.400> be<00:07:09.520> a<00:07:09.550> great<00:07:09.820> asset<00:07:11.610> so<00:07:12.610> I

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
would be a would be a great asset so I

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050 
I see an enormous enormous benefit of

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.540 
I see an enormous enormous benefit of
this<00:07:20.290> in<00:07:20.590> those<00:07:20.800> kind<00:07:21.040> of<00:07:21.100> places<00:07:21.250> where<00:07:21.400> we

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
this in those kind of places where we

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.460 
this in those kind of places where we
bring<00:07:21.850> tons<00:07:22.180> of<00:07:22.330> glasses<00:07:22.510> but<00:07:22.840> often<00:07:23.110> times<00:07:23.320> I

can't get an ophthalmologists or an
optometrist<00:07:25.210> to<00:07:25.270> come<00:07:25.510> I<00:07:25.720> think<00:07:26.020> if<00:07:26.230> you<00:07:26.320> had

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440 
optometrist to come I think if you had

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.410 
optometrist to come I think if you had
early<00:07:26.800> wins<00:07:27.040> internationally<00:07:27.850> and<00:07:28.000> you've

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.420 
early wins internationally and you've

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.880 
early wins internationally and you've
showed<00:07:28.810> that<00:07:29.020> you<00:07:29.110> had<00:07:29.230> a<00:07:29.260> great<00:07:29.500> deal<00:07:29.860> of

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:29.890 
showed that you had a great deal of

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.000 
showed that you had a great deal of
uptake<00:07:30.430> and<00:07:30.610> provided<00:07:31.510> amazing<00:07:32.380> benefits<00:07:32.800> to

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.010 
uptake and provided amazing benefits to

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.830 
uptake and provided amazing benefits to
so<00:07:33.580> many<00:07:33.700> people<00:07:34.060> they<00:07:34.150> don't<00:07:34.180> have<00:07:34.450> glasses<00:07:34.780> I

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:34.840 
so many people they don't have glasses I

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.420 
so many people they don't have glasses I

think that could really give you a
toehold<00:07:37.060> and<00:07:37.240> show<00:07:37.480> people<00:07:37.690> that<00:07:37.990> in<00:07:38.230> America
