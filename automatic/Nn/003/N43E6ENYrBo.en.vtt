in<00:00:00.719> this<00:00:01.560> video<00:00:01.800> I'm<00:00:02.159> going<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.429> show<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.669> how

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.999 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.939> create<00:00:03.030> an<00:00:03.480> effect<00:00:03.780> in<00:00:03.899> Maya<00:00:04.140> similar<00:00:04.799> to

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
to create an effect in Maya similar to

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.509 
to create an effect in Maya similar to
the<00:00:05.310> conform<00:00:05.759> space<00:00:06.089> warp<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.569> 3ds<00:00:06.899> max<00:00:07.519> so

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
the conform space warp in 3ds max so

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.470 
the conform space warp in 3ds max so
real<00:00:08.670> quick<00:00:08.700> i'm<00:00:08.940> going<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.120> show<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.240> how<00:00:09.330> it

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
real quick i'm going to show you how it

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.110 
real quick i'm going to show you how it
works<00:00:09.510> in<00:00:09.809> 3ds<00:00:10.110> max<00:00:10.219> i'm<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.550> create<00:00:11.730> a

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
works in 3ds max i'm going to create a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.269 
works in 3ds max i'm going to create a
conform<00:00:12.660> space<00:00:13.019> warp<00:00:18.890> and<00:00:19.890> i'm<00:00:20.010> going<00:00:20.130> to

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
conform space warp and i'm going to

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.700 
conform space warp and i'm going to
choose<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.150> rap<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.660> object<00:00:22.199> i'm<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
choose the rap to object i'm going to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.660 
choose the rap to object i'm going to
select<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.570> mesh<00:00:24.570> right<00:00:24.840> here<00:00:25.550> now<00:00:26.550> i'm

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
select this mesh right here now i'm

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.060 
select this mesh right here now i'm
going<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.939> bind<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> space<00:00:28.529> warp<00:00:28.830> so

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
going to bind this to the space warp so

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.700 
going to bind this to the space warp so
it's<00:00:29.220> going<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.400> conform<00:00:29.939> its<00:00:30.179> shape<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
it's going to conform its shape to the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.119 
it's going to conform its shape to the
subject<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:36.690> there<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.020> are<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.860> I'm<00:00:38.010> moving

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
subject and there we are as I'm moving

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.740 
subject and there we are as I'm moving
around<00:00:38.399> you'll<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.030> conforming<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
around you'll see it's conforming to the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.979 
around you'll see it's conforming to the
object<00:00:39.989> underneath<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:41.540> we<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.690> create<00:00:42.899> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
object underneath it we can create a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.510 
object underneath it we can create a
similar<00:00:43.200> effect<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.680> Maya<00:00:43.860> using<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
similar effect in Maya using the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.779 
similar effect in Maya using the
transfer<00:00:44.940> attributes<00:00:45.539> tool<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:49.789> purposely

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
transfer attributes tool I purposely

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
transfer attributes tool I purposely
left<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.239> flat<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.020> i<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.230> show<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.410> how<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
left this flat so i can show you how to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.740 
left this flat so i can show you how to
create<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.280> terrain<00:00:53.730> bumpiness<00:00:54.360> look<00:00:54.629> in

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
create that terrain bumpiness look in

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.099 
create that terrain bumpiness look in
effect<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.280> use<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> script<00:00:56.760> called

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
effect I like to use a script called

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.660 
effect I like to use a script called
displace<00:00:58.109> d<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.680> available<00:00:58.829> from<00:00:59.190> creative

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
displace d it's available from creative

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.450 
displace d it's available from creative
crash<00:00:59.930> it<00:01:00.930> takes<00:01:01.140> an<00:01:01.289> image<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.039> displaces

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
crash it takes an image and it displaces

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.979 
crash it takes an image and it displaces
your<00:01:02.670> mesh<00:01:02.850> based<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> values<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.780> that

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
your mesh based on the values of that

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.590 
your mesh based on the values of that
image<00:01:04.189> it's<00:01:05.189> very<00:01:05.400> useful<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:06.000> should<00:01:06.479> be

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
image it's very useful it should be

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
image it's very useful it should be
standard<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.260> Maya<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:08.340> yet

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
standard with Maya but it's not yet

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.510 
standard with Maya but it's not yet
hopefully<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:09.060> day<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.299> will<00:01:09.390> be<00:01:10.250> all<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.400> do

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
hopefully one day it will be all you do

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.090 
hopefully one day it will be all you do
you<00:01:11.640> select<00:01:11.790> your<00:01:12.000> object<00:01:12.979> execute<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you select your object execute the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.039 
you select your object execute the
script<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.700> adds<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.119> displace<00:01:15.570> d<00:01:15.840> node

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
script and it adds this displace d node

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.230 
script and it adds this displace d node
going<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.140> access<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.619> node<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.150> for<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
going to access that node and for the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.090 
going to access that node and for the
color<00:01:21.450> I'm<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.530> assign<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.799> noise

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100

access<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.900> object<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.560> move<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:04.950> around

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
access this object and move it around

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.830 
access this object and move it around
and<00:02:05.370> you'll<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.700> updates<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.660> object

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and you'll see it updates to the object

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.140 
and you'll see it updates to the object
underneath<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.650> if<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.670> don't<00:02:08.790> want<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.060> be

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.150 
underneath it if you don't want to be

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.140 
underneath it if you don't want to be
exactly<00:02:09.720> right<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:10.260> top<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.710> one<00:02:11.150> there's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
exactly right on top of this one there's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.510 
exactly right on top of this one there's
a<00:02:12.270> couple<00:02:12.840> options<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.410> could<00:02:13.560> do<00:02:13.740> the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
a couple options you could do the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.580 
a couple options you could do the
easiest<00:02:14.850> one<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.360> go<00:02:15.560> access<00:02:16.560> the

a<00:02:27.510> little<00:02:27.630> bit<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.320> see<00:02:28.700> it's<00:02:29.700> moving

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
a little bit and you can see it's moving

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.160 
a little bit and you can see it's moving
and<00:02:30.210> bringing<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.510> back<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.750> where<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.080> started

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
down sit up to one if I move it this way

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.130 
down sit up to one if I move it this way
it's<00:02:40.860> going<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.070> go<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.370> way<00:02:41.840> but<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.930> want<00:02:43.110> to

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
it's going to go that way but I want to

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.370 
it's going to go that way but I want to
bring<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:44.270> above<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.330> object<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.260> i'll<00:02:46.320> just

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
bring it above the object so i'll just

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.150 
bring it above the object so i'll just
do<00:02:46.620> try<00:02:47.250> 1.1<00:02:49.040> there<00:02:50.040> we<00:02:50.160> go<00:02:51.800> that<00:02:52.800> looks<00:02:52.830> pretty

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
do try 1.1 there we go that looks pretty

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.810 
do try 1.1 there we go that looks pretty
good<00:02:54.680> once<00:02:55.680> you've<00:02:55.830> done<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.670> can

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
good once you've done this you can

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.930 
good once you've done this you can
continue<00:02:57.209> on<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.630> edit<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.110> for<00:02:59.100> example<00:02:59.550> we

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
continue on to edit this for example we

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.910 
continue on to edit this for example we
can<00:03:00.150> extrude<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.140> give<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.590> little<00:03:01.680> bit<00:03:01.830> of

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
can extrude it give it a little bit of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.540 
can extrude it give it a little bit of
thickness

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:15.380 

and<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.880> should<00:03:09.060> still<00:03:09.300> behave<00:03:09.990> just<00:03:10.290> fine<00:03:14.390> and

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
and it should still behave just fine and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
and it should still behave just fine and
a<00:03:15.480> cool<00:03:15.630> thing<00:03:15.810> with<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:16.020> transfer

to just flat objects here I've got a

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
share the same center point and I'm just

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.570 
share the same center point and I'm just
like<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.320> one<00:03:34.500> shift<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.190> select<00:03:35.430> this<00:03:35.520> one

like this one shift to select this one

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.350 
like this one shift to select this one
and<00:03:35.970> go<00:03:36.000> transfer<00:03:36.600> attributes<00:03:38.090> will<00:03:39.090> keep<00:03:39.270> the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
and go transfer attributes will keep the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.940 
and go transfer attributes will keep the
same<00:03:39.540> settings<00:03:39.900> with<00:03:40.050> it<00:03:40.140> before<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.470> you

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
same settings with it before so you

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.620 
same settings with it before so you
transfer<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.440> there<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.970> if<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.090> rotate<00:03:45.480> it

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
transfer and there it is if I rotate it

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.380 
transfer and there it is if I rotate it
around<00:03:46.459> it's<00:03:47.459> going<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.700> conform<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.300> the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
around it's going to conform to the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.180 
around it's going to conform to the
shape<00:03:48.420> underneath<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:49.260> once<00:03:49.620> again<00:03:49.740> I<00:03:50.010> can

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
shape underneath it and once again I can

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.410 
shape underneath it and once again I can
offset<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.730> little<00:03:50.850> bit<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.150> it's<00:03:51.270> not

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
offset it a little bit so it's not

00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:00.470 
offset it a little bit so it's not
exactly<00:03:51.810> on<00:03:51.990> top<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.380> it

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:14.880 

try<00:04:01.110> doing<00:04:01.260> all<00:04:01.440> three<00:04:01.650> here<00:04:03.980> there<00:04:04.980> we<00:04:05.310> go

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.150 

so<00:04:15.890> there<00:04:16.010> we<00:04:16.070> are<00:04:16.100> I<00:04:16.430> hope<00:04:16.790> this<00:04:16.940> was<00:04:17.120> helpful
