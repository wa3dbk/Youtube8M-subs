once you get up top you're gonna have to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.880 
once you get up top you're gonna have to
go<00:00:32.279> along<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.820> way<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:34.230> get<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
go along the way I'm going to get to the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.310 
go along the way I'm going to get to the
new<00:00:35.040> buildings<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.690> doing<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.780> little<00:00:36.809> strafe

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
new buildings and doing a little strafe

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.069 
new buildings and doing a little strafe
jump<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.800> takes<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.520> little<00:00:38.550> bit<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.079> practice

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
jump on takes a little bit of practice

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.840 
jump on takes a little bit of practice
for<00:00:40.110> me<00:00:40.379> because<00:00:40.530> i<00:00:40.620> always<00:00:40.860> miss<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.430> my<00:00:41.579> tank

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
for me because i always miss on my tank

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.130 
for me because i always miss on my tank
i'm<00:00:42.000> gonna<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.450> redo<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> whole<00:00:42.840> process

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
i'm gonna have to redo the whole process

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.290 
i'm gonna have to redo the whole process
but<00:00:43.590> once<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:44.250> past<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.579> stripe<00:00:45.000> jump

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
but once you get past that stripe jump

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.639 
but once you get past that stripe jump
part<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.750> go<00:00:45.930> all<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.320> way<00:00:46.350> along<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
part just go all the way along the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.110 
part just go all the way along the
buildings<00:00:47.039> where<00:00:47.129> I'm<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.430> right<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.700> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
buildings where I'm going right here you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.299 
buildings where I'm going right here you
can<00:00:48.329> see<00:00:48.450> my<00:00:48.539> friends<00:00:48.870> are<00:00:48.960> doing<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.559> little

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
can see my friends are doing a little

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.250 
can see my friends are doing a little
bit<00:00:50.430> harder<00:00:51.000> way<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.180> decided<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.840> take<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
bit harder way I decided to take the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
bit harder way I decided to take the
easier<00:00:52.649> way<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.699> go<00:00:53.879> along<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
easier way and just go along the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.760 
easier way and just go along the
buildings<00:00:54.539> are<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.989> along<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> little<00:00:55.559> sky

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
buildings are going along the little sky

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.950 
buildings are going along the little sky
barrier<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:57.210> had<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.840> this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
barrier I just had to go this like this

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.830 
barrier I just had to go this like this
is<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.170> little<00:00:58.440> bit<00:00:58.559> quicker<00:00:59.239> and<00:01:00.239> once<00:01:00.690> you're

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
is a little bit quicker and once you're

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.720 
is a little bit quicker and once you're
over<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.739> get<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> other<00:01:02.340> set<00:01:02.699> of

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
over here to get to the other set of

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.090 
over here to get to the other set of
buildings<00:01:02.960> just<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> mode<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.860> care

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
buildings just get a mode and a care

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.800 
buildings just get a mode and a care
package<00:01:05.280> pretty<00:01:05.760> simple<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.510> building

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
package pretty simple in this building

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.870 
package pretty simple in this building
because<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:07.140> usually<00:01:07.350> land<00:01:08.159> sideways<00:01:08.490> like

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
because they usually land sideways like

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.789 
because they usually land sideways like
this<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.299> don't<00:01:09.570> like<00:01:09.869> using<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> sideways

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
this I don't like using the sideways

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.399 
this I don't like using the sideways
care<00:01:11.100> packages<00:01:11.610> right<00:01:11.760> there<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.659> because<00:01:13.049> I

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
care packages right there just because I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.260 
care packages right there just because I
just<00:01:13.799> never<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.369> trust<00:01:14.640> him<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.119> like

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
just never can trust him so I just like

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.200 
just never can trust him so I just like
to<00:01:15.360> get<00:01:15.479> one<00:01:15.630> down<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.860> only<00:01:17.520> took<00:01:17.850> me

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
to get one down like this only took me

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.310 
to get one down like this only took me
three<00:01:18.659> care<00:01:18.900> packages<00:01:19.470> pretty<00:01:19.860> simple<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.369> do

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
three care packages pretty simple to do

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.510 
three care packages pretty simple to do
but<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.710> get<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.340> you're

going like watch across with your

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.800 
going like watch across with your
tactical<00:01:26.280> insertion<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.000> if<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.450> start<00:01:27.689> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
tactical insertion and if you start to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.450 
tactical insertion and if you start to
not<00:01:28.229> make<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.650> across<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:29.130> put<00:01:29.310> your

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
tactical insertion and place it down

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.109 
tactical insertion and place it down
before<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.350> hit<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.530> ground<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.189> everything

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
before you hit the ground and everything

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.640 
before you hit the ground and everything
be<00:01:33.299> good<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.869> go<00:01:33.960> along<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.350> buildings

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
be good you can go along the buildings

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.350 
be good you can go along the buildings
all<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.890> way<00:01:35.159> along<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> sides<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.060> build

hardest<00:02:05.780> part<00:02:06.110> in<00:02:06.380> here<00:02:06.800> because<00:02:06.980> if<00:02:07.340> your

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
hardest part in here because if your

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.400 
hardest part in here because if your

won't make it and I like this glitz just

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.500 
won't make it and I like this glitz just
because<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.680> it's<00:02:13.310> just<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.730> whole<00:02:13.910> process

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510
