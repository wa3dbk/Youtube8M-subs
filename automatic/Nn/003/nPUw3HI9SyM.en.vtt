the heat output on this heater what

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.879 
the heat output on this heater what
actually<00:01:35.509> has<00:01:35.659> two<00:01:35.899> heat<00:01:36.079> settings<00:01:36.319> on<00:01:36.679> high

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:36.889 
actually has two heat settings on high

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:40.330 
actually has two heat settings on high
as<00:01:37.100> 30<00:01:37.630> 6500<00:01:38.630> btus<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:39.259> on<00:01:39.679> low<00:01:39.859> it<00:01:40.009> goes<00:01:40.159> down

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
as 30 6500 btus and on low it goes down

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.849 
as 30 6500 btus and on low it goes down
to<00:01:40.490> 20,000<00:01:41.119> BTUs<00:01:41.509> it's<00:01:42.049> infinitely<00:01:42.499> variable

to 20,000 BTUs it's infinitely variable

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:44.529 
to 20,000 BTUs it's infinitely variable
between<00:01:43.280> those<00:01:43.429> two<00:01:43.609> heat<00:01:43.819> settings<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.359> on<00:01:44.509> a

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
between those two heat settings so on a

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:45.999 
between those two heat settings so on a
cool<00:01:44.780> night<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.139> can<00:01:45.289> turn<00:01:45.439> it<00:01:45.590> up<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:45.859> if

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
cool night you can turn it up and if

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.410 
cool night you can turn it up and if
it's<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.219> little<00:01:46.429> warmer<00:01:46.729> but<00:01:46.909> you<00:01:47.030> still<00:01:47.270> need

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
it's a little warmer but you still need

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.690 
it's a little warmer but you still need
to<00:01:47.630> take<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.020> edge<00:01:48.740> off<00:01:48.950> of<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.249> coldness

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
to take the edge off of that coldness

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.340 
to take the edge off of that coldness
you<00:01:50.060> just<00:01:50.329> turn<00:01:50.569> it<00:01:50.689> down<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.929> the<00:01:51.020> low<00:01:51.079> setting

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
you just turn it down to the low setting

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.929 
you just turn it down to the low setting
so<00:01:51.679> that<00:01:51.740> sounds<00:01:52.009> like<00:01:52.100> a<00:01:52.189> lot<00:01:52.369> of<00:01:52.399> heat<00:01:52.700> but

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
so that sounds like a lot of heat but

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.300 
so that sounds like a lot of heat but
how<00:01:53.209> effective<00:01:53.990> is<00:01:54.259> it<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.679> actually<00:01:54.859> keep<00:01:55.159> us

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
how effective is it and actually keep us

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.800 
how effective is it and actually keep us
warm<00:01:55.549> well<00:01:55.850> it's<00:01:55.969> very<00:01:56.090> effective<00:01:56.689> and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
warm well it's very effective and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.499 
warm well it's very effective and
because<00:01:57.109> we<00:01:57.259> brought<00:01:57.469> the<00:01:57.679> heat<00:01:57.920> down<00:01:58.159> low

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
because we brought the heat down low

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.429 
because we brought the heat down low
it's<00:01:59.509> much<00:01:59.689> more<00:01:59.869> effective<00:02:00.289> than<00:02:00.409> the

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
it's much more effective than the

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.870 
it's much more effective than the
traditional<00:02:00.979> mushroom<00:02:01.399> heater<00:02:01.609> because

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
traditional mushroom heater because

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.669 
traditional mushroom heater because
we've<00:02:02.359> incorporated<00:02:02.659> an<00:02:03.020> infrared<00:02:03.409> burner

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
we've incorporated an infrared burner

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.190 
we've incorporated an infrared burner
that<00:02:03.979> heats<00:02:04.819> like<00:02:05.029> the<00:02:05.179> Sun<00:02:05.389> it<00:02:05.630> actually<00:02:06.020> is

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
that heats like the Sun it actually is

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.650 
that heats like the Sun it actually is
radiant<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.130> heats<00:02:07.340> object<00:02:07.759> as<00:02:07.909> opposed<00:02:08.270> to

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
radiant and heats object as opposed to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.870 
radiant and heats object as opposed to
heat<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.229> what<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.619> does<00:02:09.770> is<00:02:09.979> it<00:02:10.100> puts<00:02:10.610> that

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
heat and what it does is it puts that

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.610 
heat and what it does is it puts that
heat<00:02:11.180> down<00:02:11.420> where<00:02:11.720> we<00:02:11.840> need<00:02:12.049> it<00:02:12.170> if<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.409> and<00:02:12.560> I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
heat down where we need it if you and I

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.020 
heat down where we need it if you and I
are<00:02:12.650> having<00:02:12.890> dinner<00:02:13.189> over<00:02:13.250> across<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.849> patio

warm<00:02:17.540> like<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.840> Sun<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:19.550> let's<00:02:19.730> take<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.000> look

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
warm like the Sun so let's take a look

you<00:02:35.570> know<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.810> seems<00:02:36.020> so<00:02:36.140> smart<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.890> have<00:02:37.010> this

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
you know it seems so smart to have this

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.620 
you know it seems so smart to have this
heat<00:02:37.340> source<00:02:37.550> down<00:02:37.610> here<00:02:37.940> at<00:02:38.000> body<00:02:38.180> level

heat source down here at body level

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.030 
heat source down here at body level
that's<00:02:38.840> really<00:02:39.110> effective<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.620> keeping<00:02:39.770> us

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
that's really effective in keeping us

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.580 
that's really effective in keeping us
warm<00:02:40.280> but<00:02:41.000> moving<00:02:41.360> up<00:02:41.450> here<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.720> love<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.380> fact

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
warm but moving up here I love the fact

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.380 
warm but moving up here I love the fact
that<00:02:42.650> there<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:42.980> light<00:02:43.430> up<00:02:43.730> here<00:02:44.000> tell<00:02:44.270> me<00:02:44.300> a

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
that there is a light up here tell me a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.090 
that there is a light up here tell me a
little<00:02:44.540> bit<00:02:44.660> about<00:02:44.900> how<00:02:45.110> this<00:02:45.260> operates<00:02:45.709> well

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
little bit about how this operates well

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.900 
little bit about how this operates well
we<00:02:46.220> are<00:02:46.310> talking<00:02:46.459> about<00:02:46.640> being

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
we are talking about being

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.670 
we are talking about being
multifunctional<00:02:47.780> right<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:48.290> we've<00:02:48.410> got<00:02:48.440> this

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
multifunctional right so we've got this

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.560 
multifunctional right so we've got this
great<00:02:48.739> heat<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.730> now<00:02:49.910> what<00:02:50.209> we've<00:02:50.330> done<00:02:50.360> is

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
great heat so now what we've done is

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.540 
great heat so now what we've done is
we've<00:02:50.840> incorporated<00:02:51.140> some<00:02:51.709> very<00:02:51.890> soft<00:02:52.190> mood

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
we've incorporated some very soft mood

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
the wall what this does is it just

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.460 
the wall what this does is it just
really<00:03:01.700> softens<00:03:01.970> it<00:03:02.360> it's<00:03:02.750> important<00:03:03.320> and

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
really softens it it's important and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.130 
really softens it it's important and
also<00:03:03.650> because<00:03:04.220> if<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.209> wind<00:03:05.420> blows<00:03:05.660> it's<00:03:05.930> wind

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
also because if the wind blows it's wind

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.140 
also because if the wind blows it's wind
resistant<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:06.769> in<00:03:06.890> case<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.220> gets<00:03:07.370> blown<00:03:08.000> out

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
resistant so in case it gets blown out

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.360 
resistant so in case it gets blown out
it<00:03:08.390> automatically<00:03:08.959> relights<00:03:09.440> itself<00:03:09.890> but<00:03:10.250> it

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
it automatically relights itself but it

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.880 
it automatically relights itself but it
puts<00:03:10.550> a<00:03:10.640> real<00:03:10.880> soft<00:03:11.330> glow<00:03:11.720> across<00:03:12.290> your<00:03:12.709> deck

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
puts a real soft glow across your deck

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.229 
puts a real soft glow across your deck
and<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:13.340> if<00:03:13.459> you're<00:03:13.580> entertaining<00:03:13.760> for<00:03:14.180> two

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
this is something that could really help

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.380
