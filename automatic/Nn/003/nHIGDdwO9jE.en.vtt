be<00:01:47.880> drawing<00:01:48.329> at<00:01:48.450> least<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.350> card<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.399> you're

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
be drawing at least one card so you're

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.030 
be drawing at least one card so you're
going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.759> plussing<00:01:51.360> at<00:01:51.570> least<00:01:51.899> once<00:01:52.290> but

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
going to be plussing at least once but

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.370 
going to be plussing at least once but
on<00:01:53.369> top<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.850> light<00:01:54.570> ones<00:01:54.840> obviously<00:01:54.990> have

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
on top of that light ones obviously have

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.200 
on top of that light ones obviously have
different<00:01:55.409> effects<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.219> graveyard<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.969> I

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
different effects in the graveyard and I

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.749 
different effects in the graveyard and I
feel<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.840> card<00:01:58.290> will<00:01:58.710> make<00:01:58.950> wolf<00:01:59.280> go<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
feel this card will make wolf go to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
feel this card will make wolf go to
three<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.540> these<00:02:00.840> decks<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.469> there's

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
three in these decks because there's

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.100 
three in these decks because there's
just<00:02:01.950> no<00:02:02.310> reason<00:02:02.549> not<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> wolf<00:02:03.719> has<00:02:03.960> got

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
just no reason not to wolf has got

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.780 
just no reason not to wolf has got
synergy<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> because<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.250> level<00:02:05.549> 4

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
synergy with it because it's a level 4

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.550 
synergy with it because it's a level 4
you<00:02:06.090> need<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.479> level<00:02:06.659> fours<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
you need to level fours for this and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.190 
you need to level fours for this and
just<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.429> general<00:02:08.489> it's<00:02:09.090> an<00:02:09.300> absolutely<00:02:09.899> great

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200

announced for this I'll do discussion on

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.550 
announced for this I'll do discussion on
it<00:02:35.490> later<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:36.420> basically<00:02:36.630> when<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.320> milled

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560

it later but basically when it's milled
you<00:02:37.830> are<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.010> JD<00:02:38.340> from<00:02:38.520> your<00:02:38.670> deck<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.030> if<00:02:39.120> we

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
you are the JD from your deck so if we

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.740 
you are the JD from your deck so if we
think<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:40.290> mill<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:41.070> this<00:02:41.310> ok<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.540> draw

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
think you mill with this ok so you draw

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.890 
think you mill with this ok so you draw
a<00:02:42.780> card<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.290> then<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.070> search<00:02:44.370> off<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:45.480> cards

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
a card and then you search off the cards

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.550 
a card and then you search off the cards
to<00:02:46.290> get<00:02:46.470> JD<00:02:46.830> u<00:02:47.280> plus<00:02:47.640> two<00:02:47.940> minimum<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.230> card

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
to get JD u plus two minimum this card

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.420 
to get JD u plus two minimum this card
seems<00:02:49.830> really<00:02:50.580> really<00:02:51.450> good<00:02:51.720> but<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.190> slight

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
seems really really good but the slight

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.110 
seems really really good but the slight
problem<00:02:53.880> is<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.960> an<00:02:55.170> OC<00:02:55.590> g<00:02:55.770> exclusive<00:02:56.760> now<00:02:57.090> I

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
problem is it is an OC g exclusive now I

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.790 
problem is it is an OC g exclusive now I
remember<00:02:57.750> someone<00:02:57.960> said<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.350> me<00:02:58.530> in<00:02:58.710> the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
remember someone said to me in the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.080 
remember someone said to me in the
comments<00:02:59.130> section<00:02:59.160> below<00:02:59.430> they<00:02:59.700> had<00:02:59.850> a<00:02:59.880> better

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
comments section below they had a better

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.790 
comments section below they had a better
be<00:03:00.270> for<00:03:00.450> me<00:03:00.540> because<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.900> didn't<00:03:01.140> say<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.410> car

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.930 
out there this one is an OC g exclusive
I<00:03:07.080> think<00:03:07.290> if<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.680> cards<00:03:08.070> number<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.520> 80<00:03:08.790> and

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
I think if a cards number is 80 and

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.180 
I think if a cards number is 80 and
above<00:03:09.150> it's<00:03:09.780> technically<00:03:10.230> an<00:03:10.380> OC<00:03:10.590> g<00:03:10.740> exclusive

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
above it's technically an OC g exclusive

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.440 
above it's technically an OC g exclusive
but<00:03:11.310> don't<00:03:11.460> quote<00:03:11.580> me<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.850> cot<00:03:12.150> mobile

but don't quote me on that cot mobile
that's<00:03:12.630> right<00:03:12.870> but<00:03:13.320> probably<00:03:13.620> not<00:03:13.860> going<00:03:14.010> to

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
that's right but probably not going to

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.470 
that's right but probably not going to
see<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.370> for<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.580> while<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:15.270> probably

see this for a while and it's probably

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.970 
see this for a while and it's probably

probably next year or the year after

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.900 
probably next year or the year after
because<00:03:21.600> there<00:03:21.989> are<00:03:22.140> still<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.530> lot<00:03:22.620> of

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
because there are still a lot of

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.090 
because there are still a lot of
exclusives<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.030> we<00:03:24.120> don't<00:03:24.270> have<00:03:24.680> but<00:03:25.680> it

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
exclusives that we don't have but it

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.710 
exclusives that we don't have but it
probably<00:03:26.640> will<00:03:26.940> be<00:03:27.090> at<00:03:27.209> least<00:03:27.270> two<00:03:27.600> years

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
probably will be at least two years

probably will be at least two years
before<00:03:28.110> we<00:03:28.170> get<00:03:28.350> this<00:03:28.530> i'd<00:03:28.770> say<00:03:28.980> probably<00:03:29.450> 2017

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
before we get this i'd say probably 2017

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.449 
before we get this i'd say probably 2017
we<00:03:30.630> get<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.810> world<00:03:31.020> superstars<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:32.040> second

we get a world superstars the second

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.750 
we get a world superstars the second
effect<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:33.090> also<00:03:33.660> really<00:03:34.080> good<00:03:34.290> because<00:03:35.250> not

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
effect is also really good because not

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.820 
effect is also really good because not
only<00:03:35.790> when<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.209> gets<00:03:36.390> destroyed<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.440> get<00:03:37.650> to

only when it gets destroyed you get to

only when it gets destroyed you get to

Milt's that are light want guards the

Milt's that are light want guards the
fact<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.120> says<00:03:45.330> cards<00:03:45.900> like<00:03:46.170> swan<00:03:46.440> cards

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
fact that it says cards like swan cards

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.830 
fact that it says cards like swan cards
it<00:03:47.010> doesn't<00:03:47.370> restrict<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.000> spell<00:03:48.540> monster

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
it doesn't restrict it to spell monster

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.060 
it doesn't restrict it to spell monster
a<00:03:49.050> trap<00:03:49.500> makes<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.640> just<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.269> much<00:03:51.720> better<00:03:52.320> it's

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
a trap makes it just so much better it's

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.729 
a trap makes it just so much better it's
a<00:03:53.220> generic<00:03:53.670> so<00:03:54.030> it's<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.209> generic<00:03:54.570> milk<00:03:55.140> so<00:03:55.650> if

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
a generic so it's a generic milk so if

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.500 
a generic so it's a generic milk so if
we<00:03:55.830> think<00:03:55.860> about<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.610> fur<00:03:56.820> nodes<00:03:57.060> can<00:03:57.300> use

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
we think about it and fur nodes can use

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.150 
we think about it and fur nodes can use
this<00:03:57.660> quite<00:03:57.930> well<00:03:58.200> because<00:03:58.500> all<00:03:58.920> they're

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
this quite well because all they're

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.550 
this quite well because all they're
doing<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.550> milling<00:04:00.239> let's<00:04:00.630> face<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:01.140> melling

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
doing is milling let's face it melling

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.460 
doing is milling let's face it melling
an<00:04:01.650> extra<00:04:01.920> 3<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.519> basically<00:04:02.880> six<00:04:03.330> just<00:04:04.320> off

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
an extra 3 and basically six just off

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.460 
an extra 3 and basically six just off
this<00:04:04.650> one<00:04:04.890> card<00:04:05.190> minimum<00:04:05.820> is<00:04:06.570> pretty<00:04:07.019> bloody

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
this one card minimum is pretty bloody

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.710 
this one card minimum is pretty bloody
good<00:04:07.920> i<00:04:08.340> think<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.700> card<00:04:08.910> overall<00:04:09.300> when<00:04:09.570> it

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
good i think the card overall when it

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.720 
good i think the card overall when it
eventually<00:04:09.989> does<00:04:10.470> come<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:10.950> TCG<00:04:11.550> we'll

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
eventually does come to the TCG we'll

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.540 
eventually does come to the TCG we'll
see<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:11.910> lot<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.150> play<00:04:12.420> with<00:04:13.230> lice<00:04:13.920> ones<00:04:14.220> getting

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
see a lot of play with lice ones getting

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.250 
see a lot of play with lice ones getting
all<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.850> support<00:04:15.209> I<00:04:15.480> think<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.870> might<00:04:16.019> see<00:04:16.230> a

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
all this support I think you might see a

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.240 
all this support I think you might see a
rise<00:04:16.530> in<00:04:16.560> them<00:04:16.859> again<00:04:17.190> if<00:04:18.530> decks<00:04:19.530> like<00:04:19.859> burning

rise in them again if decks like burning

guys<00:04:33.820> think<00:04:34.090> of<00:04:34.210> this<00:04:34.300> new<00:04:34.360> like<00:04:34.690> Swan<00:04:34.990> XYZ<00:04:35.680> the

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
guys think of this new like Swan XYZ the

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.860 
guys think of this new like Swan XYZ the
first<00:04:36.130> in<00:04:36.370> its<00:04:36.550> kind<00:04:36.940> which<00:04:37.570> i<00:04:37.630> think<00:04:37.720> is

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
first in its kind which i think is

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.360 
first in its kind which i think is
really<00:04:38.050> good<00:04:38.290> you<00:04:38.320> think<00:04:38.530> it's<00:04:38.830> alright<00:04:39.070> you

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
really good you think it's alright you

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.680 
really good you think it's alright you
think<00:04:39.730> it's<00:04:39.880> not<00:04:40.000> really<00:04:40.240> going<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.420> make<00:04:40.540> that

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
think it's not really going to make that

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.900 
think it's not really going to make that
much<00:04:40.870> of<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:41.050> difference<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.830> deck<00:04:42.250> so<00:04:42.850> I

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
much of a difference to the deck so I

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.770 
much of a difference to the deck so I
just<00:04:43.120> said<00:04:43.210> let<00:04:43.390> me<00:04:43.420> know<00:04:43.540> down<00:04:43.660> in<00:04:43.720> the
