00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.890
 something that has pissed off a lot 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.950
 wii users the desktop console 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.140
 of nintendo is the announcement of the delay 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.120
 watch docs by ubisoft what 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.630
 true is that everything has to be said is a 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.940
 delay that does not come at a good time or 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.160
 it is precisely wiiu what does not need 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.230
 is this kind of advertising but good and 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.390
 you know that we talked very recently 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.250
 that ubisoft had announced that whats 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.260
 docs will be released at some point 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.240
 included between the months of April and 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.890
 June those were the dates of 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.899
 approximate releases that were given 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.320
 but that the version of wii or would arrive 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:41.530
 later than the xbox 360 xbox one 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.149
 playstation 3 playstation 4 ipc that are 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.219
 the rest of the platforms that also go 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.800
 to enjoy this awesome watch 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.140
 good dogs well attention because ubisoft 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.050
 has spoken the French company has 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.940
 explained the following and have said we have 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.820
 taken the difficult decision to delay 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.070
 plus the release of watch docs in wii 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.440
 and to center the resources of the team 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.269
 where I can have the most benefit 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.820
 possible for our customers 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.150
 as for you be shop is an ad that 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.670
 do not 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.010
 nobody liked the truth is that a 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.020
 see you have to be careful what you 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.460
 says around this issue because yes that 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.190
 it's true that I do and one does not suit 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.140
 right now this type of advertising is worth 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.790
 the fact that such a title is delayed 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.190
 important as watch dogs that already 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.410
 We will see if it would sell copies in 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.390
 wii or not but of course with a delay 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.070
 will sell fewer copies that's clear 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.980
 It also has to be said that the version of 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.080
 wii of watts tops according to said and ubisoft 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.270
 in previous statements was going to be 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.570
 a version that rode between the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.060
 version of playstation 3 and xbox 360 and the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.340
 of playstation 4 and xbox one logically 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.010
 it can not be like the nexgen version 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.690
 because obviously you have everything u 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.550
 the necessary potential but yes that 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.920
 there would be something good in this regard and it is 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.120
 that would be a version that would take 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.250
 the technical possibilities of wiiu 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.020
 and with this I am saying that it would be 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.630
 a version higher than the playstation 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.460
 3 and xbox 360 then you have to see everything 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.560
 this in practice as always but 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.630
 well I have optimism I think this 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.260
 delay is because they want to adapt in 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.170
 conditions so let's say the port so 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.360
 say it from watts docs aui and do not do a 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.910
 botched port as seen in 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.800
 some occasions in certain titles in 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.390
 the nintendo tabletop console like this 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.000
 that we hope that delay in 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.430
 definitive is not a long time and 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.260
 especially that the title is not canceled 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.510
 although being and ubisoft I think that 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.400
 cancel is not going to cancel as it has 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.140
 could happen with other titles that 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.810
 delayed in wii u and then finally 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.240
 they ended up not going out like that 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.730
 aliens colonial marines so users 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.070
 of wii you know if you want yours 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.570
 watch docs version equal to deserve 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.520
 the penalty waits notwithstanding 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.500
 statements that he has offered and ubisoft 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.600
 The truth is that they leave us a little 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.030
 side if they really are 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.440
 saying clearly that wii or not 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.240
 interest 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.760
 priority console because obviously 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.260
 they are not making money with wii I think 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.210
 that ubisoft today what he is doing is 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.160
 support in some way water but 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.010
 logically the world of video games 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.900
 it's a business you see it as you see it and 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.030
 it has to be that way the console that more 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.390
 banda is the one that has the highest priority 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.390
 forever
