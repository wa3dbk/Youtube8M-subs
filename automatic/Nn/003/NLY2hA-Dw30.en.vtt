doing a work-in-progress what do you
like<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.869> lot<00:01:46.200> easier<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.680> me<00:01:46.979> than

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
like this is a lot easier for me than

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.460 
like this is a lot easier for me than
doing<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> cons<00:01:48.360> I've<00:01:48.600> usually<00:01:48.840> been<00:01:49.079> doing

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
doing the cons I've usually been doing

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.050 
doing the cons I've usually been doing
lately<00:01:49.619> where<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.280> actually<00:01:50.430> show<00:01:50.850> myself

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
lately where I can actually show myself

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.429 
lately where I can actually show myself
working<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> kit

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
working on the kit

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.889 
working on the kit
while<00:01:53.100> those<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.790> look<00:01:54.030> cool<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.390> camera<00:01:54.420> that

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
while those do look cool on camera that

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.600 
while those do look cool on camera that
are<00:01:55.020> kind<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.439> pain<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.920> butt<00:01:56.070> or<00:01:56.250> record

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
are kind of a pain on the butt or record

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.590 
are kind of a pain on the butt or record
so<00:01:56.969> figured<00:01:57.930> I'll<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.229> skip<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.710> time

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
so figured I'll just skip it this time

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
so figured I'll just skip it this time
so<00:02:00.600> anyway<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.020> guess<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.469> about<00:02:01.590> does<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:01.950> for

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
so anyway I guess that about does it for

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.429 
so anyway I guess that about does it for
this<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.909> short<00:02:03.390> little<00:02:03.570> video<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.960> with

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
this just a short little video and with

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.060 
this just a short little video and with
