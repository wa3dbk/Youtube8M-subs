meat<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:03.340> not<00:04:03.490> really<00:04:03.700> a<00:04:03.730> good<00:04:03.820> example<00:04:03.910> but

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
meat it's not really a good example but

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.850 
meat it's not really a good example but
I<00:04:04.600> think<00:04:04.960> you<00:04:05.200> get<00:04:05.320> what<00:04:05.350> I'm<00:04:05.530> saying<00:04:05.560> with

I think you get what I'm saying with

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.610 
I think you get what I'm saying with
that<00:04:05.890> they<00:04:06.850> both<00:04:07.060> are<00:04:07.270> chocolate<00:04:07.720> but<00:04:07.870> it's<00:04:08.410> so

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
that they both are chocolate but it's so

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.270 
that they both are chocolate but it's so
much<00:04:08.680> more<00:04:10.380> like<00:04:11.380> a<00:04:11.410> just<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:12.040> more

much more like a just a more
sophisticated<00:04:12.610> flavor<00:04:13.180> it's<00:04:13.450> not<00:04:13.570> just<00:04:13.930> like

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
sophisticated flavor it's not just like

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.170
