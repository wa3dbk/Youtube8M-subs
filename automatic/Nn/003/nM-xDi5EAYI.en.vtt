we're<00:00:30.060> learning<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.419> lot<00:00:30.599> about<00:00:30.810> amphibious

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499 
we're learning a lot about amphibious

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:39.620 
we're learning a lot about amphibious
operations

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.610 

amphibious<00:00:40.630> task<00:00:40.870> force<00:00:41.080> is<00:00:41.230> something<00:00:41.530> that

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
amphibious task force is something that

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.900 
amphibious task force is something that
the<00:00:41.740> government<00:00:41.770> directed<00:00:42.490> in<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.640> white

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910

the government directed in the white
paper<00:00:43.150> and<00:00:43.570> we<00:00:43.810> are<00:00:43.870> working<00:00:44.110> with<00:00:44.580> putting

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
paper and we are working with putting

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.520 
paper and we are working with putting
together<00:00:45.820> that<00:00:46.180> capability<00:00:46.450> over<00:00:47.200> the<00:00:47.290> next

together that capability over the next
couple<00:00:47.920> of<00:00:48.100> years<00:00:48.160> it's<00:00:48.940> actually<00:00:49.030> saying<00:00:49.450> a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
couple of years it's actually saying a

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.620 
couple of years it's actually saying a
deliberate<00:00:50.350> bringing<00:00:51.130> together<00:00:51.280> of<00:00:51.700> Navy<00:00:52.450> Air

task<00:00:55.660> force<00:00:55.930> so<00:00:56.350> that<00:00:56.500> we<00:00:56.590> can<00:00:56.800> actually<00:00:56.950> be

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
task force so that we can actually be

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.980 
task force so that we can actually be
effective<00:00:57.640> wherever<00:00:57.940> we<00:00:58.180> go<00:00:58.210> well<00:00:58.870> this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
effective wherever we go well this

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.220 
effective wherever we go well this
particular<00:00:59.110> exercise<00:00:59.890> is<00:01:00.160> one<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.580> larger

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
particular exercise is one of the larger

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.500 
particular exercise is one of the larger
emphasize<00:01:02.230> that<00:01:02.440> will<00:01:02.650> see<00:01:03.340> with<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.150> Marines

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
emphasize that will see with the Marines

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.900 
emphasize that will see with the Marines
you<00:01:04.870> can't<00:01:05.080> help<00:01:05.290> but<00:01:05.380> learn<00:01:05.530> from<00:01:06.280> them<00:01:06.550> they

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
you can't help but learn from them they

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.720 
you can't help but learn from them they
are<00:01:07.200> exceptionally<00:01:08.200> good<00:01:08.680> at<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.460> run

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
are exceptionally good at that the run

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.150 
are exceptionally good at that the run
command<00:01:10.180> post<00:01:10.600> exercise<00:01:10.780> so<00:01:11.440> that<00:01:11.470> you<00:01:11.979> can

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
command post exercise so that you can

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.920 
command post exercise so that you can
actually<00:01:12.310> see<00:01:12.490> how<00:01:12.850> it's<00:01:13.060> planned<00:01:13.390> how<00:01:13.750> it's

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
actually see how it's planned how it's

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.170 
actually see how it's planned how it's
operated<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.680> then<00:01:15.040> this<00:01:15.220> culminates<00:01:15.970> in<00:01:16.150> the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
operated and then this culminates in the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.880 
operated and then this culminates in the
layered<00:01:16.450> exercise<00:01:16.990> so<00:01:17.200> yes<00:01:17.380> it's<00:01:17.590> not<00:01:17.740> as<00:01:17.860> if

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
layered exercise so yes it's not as if

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.250 
layered exercise so yes it's not as if
everything's<00:01:18.430> been<00:01:18.640> worked<00:01:19.300> up<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.750> do<00:01:20.080> this

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
everything's been worked up to do this

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.170 
everything's been worked up to do this
one<00:01:20.470> big<00:01:20.680> landing<00:01:21.070> it's<00:01:21.280> all<00:01:21.550> those<00:01:21.760> phases

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
one big landing it's all those phases

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.120 
one big landing it's all those phases
and<00:01:22.630> all<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.020> support<00:01:23.410> issues<00:01:23.710> that<00:01:23.860> need<00:01:24.010> to

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
and all the support issues that need to

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.460 
and all the support issues that need to
go<00:01:24.250> through<00:01:24.810> equivalents<00:01:25.810> that<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:25.990> use<00:01:26.200> in

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
go through equivalents that you use in

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.750 
go through equivalents that you use in
pipes<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.950> different<00:01:27.250> it<00:01:27.400> can<00:01:27.550> always

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
pipes of different it can always

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.160 
pipes of different it can always
different<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.119> they'll<00:01:28.300> just<00:01:28.420> be<00:01:28.570> certain

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
different and they'll just be certain

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.230 
different and they'll just be certain
considerations<00:01:30.130> for<00:01:30.280> those<00:01:30.460> but<00:01:30.970> it's<00:01:31.090> really

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
considerations for those but it's really

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.600 
considerations for those but it's really
the<00:01:31.420> logistics<00:01:32.140> over<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.560> shore<00:01:32.830> bringing

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
the logistics over the shore bringing

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.270 
the logistics over the shore bringing
all<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:34.240> equipment<00:01:34.680> across<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.770> beachhead

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
all the equipment across the beachhead

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.070 
all the equipment across the beachhead
and<00:01:36.490> then<00:01:36.940> pushing<00:01:37.270> forward<00:01:37.540> from<00:01:37.660> there<00:01:37.840> is

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
and then pushing forward from there is

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.410 
and then pushing forward from there is
really<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:38.950> big<00:01:39.130> change<00:01:39.430> everything<00:01:40.119> that

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
really the big change everything that

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.210 
really the big change everything that
you<00:01:40.509> see<00:01:40.690> out<00:01:40.720> here<00:01:41.110> would<00:01:41.650> have<00:01:41.770> come<00:01:41.920> from<00:01:42.100> a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
you see out here would have come from a

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.060 
you see out here would have come from a
landing<00:01:42.550> craft<00:01:43.080> being<00:01:44.080> pushing<00:01:44.650> em<00:01:44.770> behind
