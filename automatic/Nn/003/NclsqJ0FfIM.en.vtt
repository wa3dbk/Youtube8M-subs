00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.660
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.070
 video in this new video I will show you a 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.360
 little about how to recover your 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.619
 character that have been erased in the 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.450
 good process that you have varied 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.740
 practically or that has entered your 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.000
 account another person with him has wanted and 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.650
 everything has happened and is today is of 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.180
 erase the characters in this step you 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.680
 I will teach how to recover your character 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.779
 well first of all I have to tell you 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.340
 that you must remember perfectly 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.930
 how were the names of all your 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.730
 character that have been erased and 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.140
 also that you have a 7 day process 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.579
 to be able to recover these characters 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.989
 that have been deleted after 7 days 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.329
 it's a bit more complicated 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.220
 recover them and then nothing will start 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.220
 with the tutorial on how to recover them 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.030
 well just go to the page 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.350
 soft we have to achieve with our 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.149
 account or with the account that has been 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.070
 deleted all characters does not matter 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.989
 my reaction out what name all 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.309
 the character but it is necessary very 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.430
 It is necessary that you remember all the 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.430
 Name (s 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.159
 the next step would be to go to support 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.689
 of reaction to notify our 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.429
 problem and it is very important that you know 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.890
 these four data of each of your 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:17.600
 characters of what his name was like 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.219
 type of character was the level of 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.200
 character that was and the date that was 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.149
 possibly deleted the date that was 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.819
 deleted you will notice because seeing 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.920
 the items good your trade history 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.200
 in post it will tell you if it has happened 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.390
 something will come out there the date that has been 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.459
 past and that same date will be the one 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.380
 well, it's supposed to be the same 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.569
 date that your character has been deleted and 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.250
 simply in this order that stuck there 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.959
 for example an example with one of my 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.670
 characters to be able to recover what 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:45.049
 lets put it in that order 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.000
 well it is not necessary in that order but 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.030
 what would make it more presentable and you would have a 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.200
 faster response and without much mess 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.459
 for good to be answered in 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.530
 less than seven days and then nothing 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.509
 we just put in that order and 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.179
 We hope they will respond to see what 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.530
 is what he tells us and then we go with what 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.530
 next that would be missing 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.899
 and once you've sent the letter you 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.330
 it should look something like this for 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.250
 that is or is well seen to be 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.810
 easier to understand and not everything 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.790
 followed and I do not expect anything that I have 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.080
 served this video and good if you want 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.120

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.850
 you can click on any of these 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.620
 links and it will take you to the video and then 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.819
 I do not say goodbye to you all
