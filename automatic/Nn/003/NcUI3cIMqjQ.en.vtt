with<00:03:00.050> warcraft<00:03:00.530> 3<00:03:00.830> but<00:03:01.010> i<00:03:01.040> think<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.459> was<00:03:01.550> for

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
with warcraft 3 but i think that was for

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.220 
with warcraft 3 but i think that was for
different<00:03:02.150> reasons<00:03:04.330> it's<00:03:05.330> not<00:03:05.450> quite<00:03:05.930> as<00:03:06.080> good

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
different reasons it's not quite as good

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.920 
different reasons it's not quite as good
a<00:03:06.290> spectator<00:03:06.860> sport<00:03:06.950> i<00:03:07.310> think<00:03:07.580> i<00:03:07.850> think<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:08.630> i

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
a spectator sport i think i think so i

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.780 
a spectator sport i think i think so i
don't<00:03:09.110> six<00:03:09.500> warcraft<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.190> what<00:03:10.400> are<00:03:10.519> 3<00:03:10.730> is

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
don't six warcraft to it what are 3 is

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.729 
don't six warcraft to it what are 3 is
now<00:03:10.910> dead<00:03:11.209> or<00:03:11.239> anything<00:03:11.720> but<00:03:12.049> i<00:03:12.110> think<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.650> is

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
now dead or anything but i think it is

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
Starcraft one is a good kind of casual

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.720

fun<00:05:09.930> multiplayer<00:05:10.290> game<00:05:10.800> yeah<00:05:11.010> they're<00:05:11.520> more

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
fun multiplayer game yeah they're more

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.020

into<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:11.970> mythology<00:05:12.600> of<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.720> game<00:05:12.960> um<00:05:14.000> so<00:05:15.000> I

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
into the mythology of the game um so I

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.760 
into the mythology of the game um so I
think<00:05:15.360> as<00:05:15.630> long<00:05:15.810> as<00:05:15.990> blizzard<00:05:16.290> covers<00:05:16.590> all<00:05:16.740> of

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
think as long as blizzard covers all of

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.460 
think as long as blizzard covers all of
its<00:05:16.950> basis<00:05:17.370> it<00:05:17.490> should<00:05:17.669> be<00:05:17.760> good<00:05:18.200> but<00:05:19.200> yeah

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
its basis it should be good but yeah

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.650 
its basis it should be good but yeah
yeah<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.550> know<00:05:20.640> I<00:05:20.669> think<00:05:20.970> that<00:05:21.330> they<00:05:21.479> will
