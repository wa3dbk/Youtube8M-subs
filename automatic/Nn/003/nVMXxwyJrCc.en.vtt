we go and we just make like a cube and
we<00:06:05.700> make<00:06:05.910> like<00:06:06.180> a<00:06:06.210> light<00:06:06.570> in<00:06:06.870> an<00:06:07.170> array

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
we make like a light in an array

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.430 
we make like a light in an array
and<00:06:08.470> we<00:06:09.340> drive<00:06:09.910> this<00:06:10.120> no<00:06:10.720> we<00:06:10.930> don't<00:06:11.080> the<00:06:11.230> array

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
and we drive this no we don't the array

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.950 
and we drive this no we don't the array
dragged<00:06:11.770> the<00:06:11.920> array<00:06:12.190> up<00:06:12.430> and<00:06:12.760> go<00:06:13.300> into<00:06:13.540> our<00:06:13.750> new

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.310 
dragged the array up and go into our new
one<00:06:14.200> and<00:06:14.710> hit<00:06:14.890> the<00:06:15.010> switch<00:06:15.930> nothing<00:06:16.930> happens

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
I figured out what I did wrong it's

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.130 
I figured out what I did wrong it's
because<00:06:24.340> the<00:06:24.490> other<00:06:24.640> one<00:06:24.910> was<00:06:25.150> interfering

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
because the other one was interfering

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.320 
because the other one was interfering
with<00:06:26.260> it<00:06:26.410> but<00:06:26.560> yeah<00:06:26.650> just<00:06:26.800> you<00:06:27.100> know<00:06:27.130> look<00:06:27.430> when

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
with it but yeah just you know look when

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.530 
with it but yeah just you know look when
I<00:06:28.360> deleted<00:06:28.780> it<00:06:28.960> it<00:06:29.140> does<00:06:29.440> work<00:06:29.830> so<00:06:30.700> if<00:06:31.270> you<00:06:31.360> want

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
I deleted it it does work so if you want

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.880 
I deleted it it does work so if you want
to<00:06:31.570> use<00:06:31.690> this<00:06:31.840> like<00:06:32.110> for<00:06:32.320> example<00:06:32.620> if<00:06:32.680> I<00:06:32.740> want

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890 
to use this like for example if I want

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.700 
to use this like for example if I want
to<00:06:32.950> get<00:06:33.040> rid<00:06:33.100> of<00:06:33.160> that<00:06:33.310> cube<00:06:33.580> go<00:06:33.850> back<00:06:34.060> into<00:06:34.480> the

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
to get rid of that cube go back into the

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.540 
to get rid of that cube go back into the
expresso<00:06:35.710> and<00:06:36.900> go<00:06:37.900> back<00:06:38.080> into<00:06:38.350> the<00:06:38.710> coffee

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
expresso and go back into the coffee

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.830 
expresso and go back into the coffee
editor<00:06:39.910> you<00:06:40.000> can<00:06:40.030> do<00:06:40.240> it<00:06:40.300> right<00:06:40.450> here<00:06:40.660> but

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
editor you can do it right here but

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:48.060 
editor you can do it right here but
change<00:06:41.560> this<00:06:42.180> to<00:06:43.180> cube<00:06:46.410> or<00:06:47.410> whatever<00:06:47.800> you<00:06:47.890> want

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
change this to cube or whatever you want

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.710 
change this to cube or whatever you want
and<00:06:48.250> now<00:06:48.400> if<00:06:48.640> we<00:06:49.530> try<00:06:50.530> it<00:06:50.910> the<00:06:51.910> cube<00:06:52.210> disappears

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
and now if we try it the cube disappears

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.080 
and now if we try it the cube disappears
so<00:06:53.680> I<00:06:53.740> hope<00:06:54.010> hopefully<00:06:54.340> you<00:06:54.640> guys<00:06:54.760> found<00:06:54.970> this
