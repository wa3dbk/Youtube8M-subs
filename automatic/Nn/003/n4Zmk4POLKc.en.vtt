00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.850
 how many times we miss a piece that we then have to wake up or import into 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.129
 over doing something I'll be there 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:12.449
 in my case I started an idea of ​​a scarf and it didn't come as I wanted 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.209
 I relax this piece 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.209
 I told myself what to do with it 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.579
 sometimes just look at things 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.900
 in a certain way to see us 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.359
 born or create something different 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.599
 the hammer - from gossip by putting it so I said 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.739
 how nice the idea can become a handbag 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.470
 one time 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.380
 I decided you for the Corfu handbag you can hear 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.420
 Scotland if you're shooting 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.420
 let it be without 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.620
 this time without the party 1 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.850
 I take a piece of meat and potatoes 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.840
 mine rather light if you find it even heavier better 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.490
 those with whom one makes love men's jackets on the shoulders the thicker one or 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.450
 from the beginning 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
 our case I didn't have this light 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.990
 we pray 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.420
 clearly with the side glue towards of a reverse of the note of our piece 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 of we will transform into a handbag 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.979
 we will pass the iron by pressing 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.330
 well above 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.070
 especially in the outer edges because they are the part that it is anyway 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.070
 setting where it will then tend to come off more easily directly 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.780
 once we have it 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.780
 it takes a few seconds to attack a veil 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.790
 we will put it 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.240
 from the side of the straight drawing open the 2 long demo bit 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.850
 we tell you the knit piece we had 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.040
 with firm cut 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.180
 also because now the maya does not move more clearly we have wires 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.780
 open below 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.110
 I hope to show you let's send invitations following a well knit 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.939
 precise. 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.079
 so much now 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.659
 I stop maya we don't need it because 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:16.849
 Latteri 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.920
 the signer prevents the mesh from falling 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:23.459
 we will do the same thing 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.459
 on the other side 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.859
 at the top where they were never open 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.439
 Also here 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.439
 let's try cagliari 1 2 laps 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.519
 here it is 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.269
 while before the rather soft manner rather 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.659
 sweater effect but to understand 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.549
 now with the key it is rather compact and the handbag begins to 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:54.909
 take the form 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.230
 I don't like handbags and we say perfect ones 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.890
 as I said before sweater between very very soft I like the tough 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.259
 stiff gums 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:09.579
 the illusion that I am working on the maria as the skin or any other fabric 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.279
 for which 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.049
 inside of 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:19.260
 on this side and the final lining I often put a piece of appellations 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:24.289
 in our case I had an app 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:29.430
 let's say a fabric of beauty and it's not really in the consistency that I wanted 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:34.419
 but I land - it gets very close this will make the bag remain 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.829
 rather rigid as we will see at the end 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:37.740
 for which 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.479
 support over intense 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.339
 that we had terrier state 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:44.859
 and I do the same thing with the belle 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.359
 that is, I create the contours 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.839
 this time I make them the same even if later with the sewing we will need them 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:53.719
 slightly smaller 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.719
 but we see it later 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.980
 now I have also cut the piece into leather and therefore we have 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.839
 a first piece to drink so much the most beautiful piece is that we have not finished 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.859
 while these two pieces will be dragunity together 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:14.729
 we also need the lining 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:19.359
 the part that will be seen of the bag then we prepare to cut the 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.270
 lining 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.509
 you make it mine to live mine in just shamo so i like to match 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.710
 colors always different shades in this case chosen a squared 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.490
 piedipull that calls 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.050
 let's say more or less the drawing the external green 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.530
 a jacks auction 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.050
 possessed by the dark metal it has a forehand obverse ie it leaves this part mussa 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.060
 it is determined which of the two parts is the right and reverse in our case 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.439
 apart from the ibrit part 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.979
 forever more blue output is more for jade tiles in our case 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.479
 maturity 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.379
 it's this one 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.539
 zara is a bit of a contradiction to the back of our bag 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.719
 we will complain a great deal upside down 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.669
 amp with the same technique as the verdena 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.059
 addò is to fa 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:19.800
 also because we like that we have the right handbag inside 

00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:20.589
 then 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:23.589
 put backhand against backhand 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.360
 Italian 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.200
 I hope 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.070
 here too dit succeed we try to save more possible stuff than that 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.289
 so the prices and costs are not easy 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.990
 but I go 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.969
 we must leave a certain margin because he is simpler boy 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:44.479
 for those not for very practical 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.479
 adjust what measures 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:50.900
 we follow the design of the bag 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.690
 we accept to leave an inch as it will become smaller 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.389
 I hope we have well defined trapezes on our Mayan pieces 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.580
 rt and that we took more solid 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.199
 the photo of the final 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.490
 and let's say this poor middle 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.860
 if now 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.110
 now we have to assemble them 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.550
 not having your own account
