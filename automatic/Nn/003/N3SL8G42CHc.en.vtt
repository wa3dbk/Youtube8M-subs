00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.180
 and then I came back again to make a 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.950
 video but rather a neighbor about the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.780
 very fast consumption 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.070
 I picked up an area where it is larger 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.640
 Speed ​​is not 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:23.820
 winning the seventh game to show 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.949
 here depending on the traffic 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.779
 developing the car well it has a 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.850
 excellent consumption of the car and also 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.899
 talking to him in the echo way in our 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.820
 City 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.399
 I do not see the need of others or 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.520
 that can put the motor in the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.539
 now is to take care because even individual 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.670
 in eco mode and the car engine is not 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:54.899
 so much in the echo system that appeared here 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.070
 here is that the car was shining with 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:03.300
 your band that instant consumption 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.840
 of the car and it drops to zero does not appear 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.640
 that the car stays on the rope free and calls 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.520
 basically a rtm 10 pointer on the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.520
 right time 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:23.850
 and here the car will get you 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:26.310
 do 12 three good fluids mean this 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.929
 little interval that walks you 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.750
 daily and I wanted to show that 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:37.740
 You 're with six you see in the magazines. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.200
 there all average consumption of the people 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.280
 I do not know how the test is done but here in the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.049
 my day to day I play however past 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.479
 for you who not long ago 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.299
 I did a video the same day. 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.610
 today that the car was averaging 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.459
 10.5 to 9 decimal 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.349
 walking more still but at this moment 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:08.780
 you get 11 on the line so if more 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:12.110
 car has a consumption grows absurdly 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.799
 especially when the eco mode 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.049
 parked 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:21.540
 this theme only you that way echo it 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:25.459
 helps a lot in 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.629
 the consumption of the square car on the island alone 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.579
 take your foot off the accelerator 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.060
 but you can not see this question 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.849
 you will have here will now engage the goals 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.750
 brake motor car automatically 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:45.269
 This 4th gear is going to do this. 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.609
 however you come back it is easy to give a small 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.579
 touch the car throttle back 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.980
 mode that now takes descent that does not 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.400
 You can do this newbie at the hotel. 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.019
 front is what 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.169
 But this is it, people are very 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:06.209
 consultation, and I really can 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:07.859
 keep above 12 means to the point of 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:13.700
 arrived right 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:13.700
 where I am and that's it worth
