00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
I think the logo pretty much says it all

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.200

time<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.840> load<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.470> that's<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:22.980> expected

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
time to load but that's to be expected

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.130
