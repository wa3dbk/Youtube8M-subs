iron<00:01:17.050> man<00:01:17.259> planners<00:01:17.590> when<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:17.770> just<00:01:18.069> thought

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
iron man planners when I just thought

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.949 
iron man planners when I just thought
it'd<00:01:18.340> be<00:01:18.369> kind<00:01:18.759> of<00:01:18.850> cool<00:01:18.910> to<00:01:19.090> control<00:01:19.569> a<00:01:19.599> lot<00:01:19.869> of

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
it'd be kind of cool to control a lot of

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.050 
it'd be kind of cool to control a lot of
the<00:01:20.020> aspects<00:01:20.440> of<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.649> car<00:01:20.860> with<00:01:21.670> your<00:01:21.700> voice

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
the aspects of the car with your voice

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.240 
the aspects of the car with your voice
and<00:01:22.899> connect<00:01:23.319> just<00:01:23.440> seemed<00:01:23.679> to<00:01:23.800> be<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:23.920> really

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
and connect just seemed to be a really

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.339 
and connect just seemed to be a really
nice<00:01:24.729> way<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.030> do<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.539> do<00:01:25.929> you<00:01:25.990> want<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.229> just

00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:26.349 
nice way to do that do you want to just

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:29.219 
nice way to do that do you want to just
focus<00:01:26.500> through<00:01:26.830> how<00:01:26.979> this<00:01:27.009> works<00:01:27.369> sure<00:01:28.229> when

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
focus through how this works sure when

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.169 
focus through how this works sure when
we<00:01:29.380> were<00:01:29.500> picking<00:01:29.860> stuff<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.459> do<00:01:30.640> some<00:01:30.940> of<00:01:30.970> them

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
we were picking stuff to do some of them

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.059 
we were picking stuff to do some of them
we<00:01:31.330> pick<00:01:31.750> just<00:01:32.110> because<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:32.619> would<00:01:32.740> be<00:01:32.860> cool

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
we pick just because it would be cool

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.639 
we pick just because it would be cool
yeah<00:01:33.550> so<00:01:34.179> say<00:01:34.360> for<00:01:34.390> instance<00:01:34.539> when<00:01:35.319> you<00:01:35.349> start

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
yeah so say for instance when you start

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.740 
yeah so say for instance when you start
the<00:01:35.740> game<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.099> engines<00:01:36.399> off<00:01:36.819> on<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.179> car<00:01:37.390> so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
the game the engines off on the car so

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.589 
the game the engines off on the car so
saying<00:01:38.229> engines<00:01:39.190> start<00:01:39.490> on<00:01:39.819> the<00:01:40.090> car<00:01:40.300> and

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:40.599 
saying engines start on the car and

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.830 
saying engines start on the car and
having<00:01:41.050> their<00:01:41.289> engine<00:01:41.619> star<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:43.090> is<00:01:43.240> kind<00:01:43.750> of

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
having their engine star it is kind of

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.600 
having their engine star it is kind of
cool<00:01:43.990> we<00:01:44.410> like<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.619> especially<00:01:44.800> when<00:01:45.520> you're

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
tasting so in a way you can actually

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.289 
tasting so in a way you can actually
eliminate<00:03:21.650> submenus<00:03:22.370> as<00:03:22.489> well<00:03:22.670> so<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.090> don't

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
eliminate submenus as well so you don't

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.690 
eliminate submenus as well so you don't
have<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.540> go<00:03:23.660> get<00:03:23.900> easy<00:03:24.109> drive<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.769> then<00:03:24.890> tires

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
have to go get easy drive and then tires

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.550 
have to go get easy drive and then tires
know<00:03:26.390> exactly<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:26.959> could<00:03:27.109> do<00:03:27.290> that<00:03:27.320> you<00:03:27.470> could

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
know exactly you could do that you could

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.080 
know exactly you could do that you could
say<00:03:27.920> if<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.190> just<00:03:28.459> say<00:03:28.579> tires<00:03:28.850> tires<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:31.090> up

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
say if you just say tires tires and up

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.060 
say if you just say tires tires and up
it<00:03:32.209> comes<00:03:32.450> that's<00:03:33.019> cool<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.739> then<00:03:33.859> you<00:03:33.950> can

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
it comes that's cool so then you can

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.410 
it comes that's cool so then you can
pick<00:03:34.190> your<00:03:34.340> different<00:03:34.640> tire<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:35.150> then<00:03:35.299> you

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
pick your different tire and then you

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.280 
pick your different tire and then you
can<00:03:35.540> say<00:03:35.750> drive<00:03:36.519> the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
can say drive the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.660 
can say drive the
so<00:03:39.290> when<00:03:39.409> you're<00:03:39.530> planning<00:03:39.950> keywords<00:03:40.430> for

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
so when you're planning keywords for

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.160 
so when you're planning keywords for
Kinect<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.420> have<00:03:41.629> to<00:03:41.719> be<00:03:41.810> careful<00:03:41.930> about

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
Kinect you have to be careful about

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.839 
Kinect you have to be careful about
which<00:03:42.469> words<00:03:42.829> you<00:03:43.010> choose<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.579> did<00:03:43.760> that

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
which words you choose and did that

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.000 
which words you choose and did that
affect<00:03:44.120> me<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.329> drive<00:03:44.569> menu<00:03:44.989> it's<00:03:45.469> the<00:03:45.620> exact

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
affect me to drive menu it's the exact

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.390 
affect me to drive menu it's the exact
and<00:03:46.249> you<00:03:46.790> know<00:03:46.939> we<00:03:47.239> looked<00:03:47.950> very<00:03:48.950> closely<00:03:49.069> or

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
and you know we looked very closely or

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.940 
and you know we looked very closely or
what<00:03:49.939> Microsoft<00:03:50.420> do<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.659> themselves<00:03:50.859> for<00:03:51.859> the

general xbox dashboard so they have a

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.770 
general xbox dashboard so they have a
little<00:03:55.250> glossary<00:03:55.579> of<00:03:55.700> terms<00:03:55.819> that<00:03:56.329> appear<00:03:56.540> so

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
when we bring a easy drive we have a our

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.690 
when we bring a easy drive we have a our

they have connect so Chris do you think

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.709 
they have connect so Chris do you think
using<00:04:07.790> connects<00:04:08.150> going<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.329> help<00:04:08.480> my<00:04:08.569> game

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:08.719 
using connects going to help my game

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:10.360 
using connects going to help my game
play<00:04:08.959> yeah<00:04:09.469> I<00:04:09.499> think<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:09.859> think<00:04:10.069> you'll<00:04:10.219> get

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
play yeah I think I think you'll get

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.099 
play yeah I think I think you'll get
more<00:04:10.549> use<00:04:10.760> of<00:04:10.790> using<00:04:11.180> easy<00:04:11.299> drive<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:11.900> then

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
more use of using easy drive and then

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.720 
more use of using easy drive and then
that<00:04:12.319> will<00:04:12.439> help<00:04:12.469> you<00:04:12.769> go<00:04:12.950> faster<00:04:12.980> jump

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
that will help you go faster jump

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.879 
that will help you go faster jump
further<00:04:14.000> win<00:04:14.540> more<00:04:14.689> races<00:04:15.079> set<00:04:15.349> faster<00:04:15.650> times

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
further win more races set faster times

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.129 
further win more races set faster times
so<00:04:16.519> yeah<00:04:16.789> I<00:04:16.820> think<00:04:16.940> generally<00:04:17.419> is<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:18.019> know

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
so yeah I think generally is you know

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:26.499 
so yeah I think generally is you know
that<00:04:18.410> would<00:04:18.560> connect<00:04:24.849> better<00:04:25.849> with<00:04:26.000> kinect

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:26.509 
that would connect better with kinect

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.919 
that would connect better with kinect
for<00:04:26.630> xbox<00:04:26.919> 360
