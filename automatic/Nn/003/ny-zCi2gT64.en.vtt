00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
of a runny solution that that kind of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
of a runny solution that that kind of
mixes<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.280> same<00:00:59.520> way<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.789> throw<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.210> in

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
mixes in the same way you throw it in

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.100 
mixes in the same way you throw it in
there<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.930> barrel<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.469> wheelbarrow<00:01:02.449> you<00:01:03.449> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
there in a barrel or wheelbarrow you you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.440 
there in a barrel or wheelbarrow you you
basically<00:01:04.320> take<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> cruel<00:01:05.309> sixty<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.270> it's

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
parts water and you basically just mix

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.359 
parts water and you basically just mix
it<00:01:12.930> together<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.590> leave<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:13.920> 20<00:01:14.340> minutes

you come back and you just mix it again
just<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.009> make<00:01:17.100> sure<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> really

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
instructions you need to have a certain

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.920 
instructions you need to have a certain
temperature<00:01:41.939> before<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.479> use<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> product

looking at here I act more Chani I rip
this<00:02:43.190> off<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.580> year<00:02:43.850> just<00:02:44.750> because<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:45.110> was

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
this off this year just because it was

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.010 
this off this year just because it was
kind<00:02:45.380> of<00:02:45.440> breaking<00:02:45.830> apart<00:02:45.920> in<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:46.990> try<00:02:47.990> to

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
kind of breaking apart in that so try to

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.330 
kind of breaking apart in that so try to
try<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.410> do<00:02:48.500> as<00:02:48.590> much<00:02:48.650> as<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:48.950> can<00:02:49.190> with

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
try and do as much as you can with

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.850 
try and do as much as you can with
concrete<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:50.600> motor<00:02:51.020> definitely<00:02:51.530> does<00:02:51.680> give

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
concrete the motor definitely does give

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.640 
concrete the motor definitely does give
it<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.980> nice<00:02:52.160> smooth<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.640> look<00:02:52.820> and<00:02:53.470> allows<00:02:54.470> you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
it a nice smooth the look and allows you

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.740 
it a nice smooth the look and allows you
to<00:02:54.800> apply<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.190> thoraseal<00:02:55.820> quite<00:02:56.180> nicely<00:02:56.390> but

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
to apply the thoraseal quite nicely but

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.480 
to apply the thoraseal quite nicely but
it<00:02:56.900> does<00:02:57.290> actually<00:02:57.500> break<00:02:57.800> apart<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:58.340> mean

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
it does actually break apart I mean

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.440 
it does actually break apart I mean
really<00:02:58.700> mortes<00:02:59.270> is<00:02:59.630> meant<00:03:00.020> to<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:01.670> sort<00:03:02.390> of

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
really mortes is meant to to is sort of

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.330 
really mortes is meant to to is sort of
hold<00:03:02.690> tall<00:03:03.050> bricks<00:03:03.380> together<00:03:03.590> not<00:03:04.070> not

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
hold tall bricks together not not

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.880 
hold tall bricks together not not
necessary<00:03:04.970> be<00:03:05.660> put<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:05.990> walls<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.410> expect<00:03:06.770> it

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
necessary be put on walls and expect it

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.100 
necessary be put on walls and expect it
to<00:03:07.010> last<00:03:07.160> but<00:03:07.610> in<00:03:08.090> some<00:03:08.270> cases<00:03:08.540> most<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:08.990> my

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
to last but in some cases most of my

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.770 
to last but in some cases most of my
walls<00:03:09.320> are<00:03:09.470> actually<00:03:10.090> still<00:03:11.090> do<00:03:11.270> have<00:03:11.420> mortar

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
walls are actually still do have mortar

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.140 
walls are actually still do have mortar
on<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.080> but<00:03:12.950> definitely<00:03:13.550> where<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.850> waterfall

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
on it but definitely where the waterfall

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.930 
on it but definitely where the waterfall
is<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.870> kind<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.200> where<00:03:15.380> it<00:03:15.500> kind<00:03:15.740> of<00:03:15.940> against

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
is is kind of where it kind of against

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.030 
is is kind of where it kind of against
took<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.150> lot<00:03:17.300> of<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.959> water<00:03:18.140> flow<00:03:18.410> for<00:03:18.709> two

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
took a lot of the the water flow for two

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.670 
took a lot of the the water flow for two
three<00:03:19.250> years<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:20.810> eventually<00:03:21.080> just<00:03:21.290> start

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
three years and to eventually just start

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.130 
three years and to eventually just start
deteriorating<00:03:22.070> so<00:03:22.730> I<00:03:22.970> basically<00:03:23.239> we<00:03:23.750> built<00:03:23.989> it

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
deteriorating so I basically we built it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.670 
deteriorating so I basically we built it
this<00:03:24.260> year<00:03:24.440> with<00:03:24.500> concrete<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:26.680> basically

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
this year with concrete and basically

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.770 
this year with concrete and basically
you<00:03:27.800> just<00:03:27.830> take<00:03:28.070> you<00:03:28.640> take<00:03:28.820> animation<00:03:29.600> what

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
you just take you take animation what

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.449 
you just take you take animation what
they<00:03:29.900> call<00:03:30.080> missionary<00:03:30.560> brushes<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.220> really

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
they call missionary brushes it really

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.130 
they call missionary brushes it really
just<00:03:31.610> looks<00:03:31.760> like<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.000> sort<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:32.750> miniature

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
just looks like a sort of miniature

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.490 
just looks like a sort of miniature
broom<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:34.720> any<00:03:35.720> hardware<00:03:36.020> store<00:03:36.140> should

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
broom and any hardware store should

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.380 
broom and any hardware store should
really<00:03:36.800> have<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.459> or<00:03:37.580> know<00:03:37.730> what<00:03:37.880> it<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.180> you

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
really have it or know what it is you

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.820 
really have it or know what it is you
can<00:03:38.570> google<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:39.020> is<00:03:39.140> called<00:03:39.350> a<00:03:39.410> missionary

handle<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:42.830> mix<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.640> then<00:03:43.700> you<00:03:44.000> basic

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
handle and you mix it and then you basic

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.390 
handle and you mix it and then you basic
mix<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:44.989> a<00:03:45.019> runny<00:03:45.200> solution<00:03:45.769> not<00:03:45.980> too<00:03:46.190> runny

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
mix it to a runny solution not too runny

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.150 
mix it to a runny solution not too runny
just<00:03:46.850> be<00:03:46.970> careful<00:03:47.390> again<00:03:47.680> it's<00:03:48.680> kind<00:03:48.920> of<00:03:48.980> like

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
just be careful again it's kind of like

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.979 
just be careful again it's kind of like
a<00:03:49.810> not<00:03:50.810> a<00:03:50.840> thick<00:03:51.170> paste<00:03:51.410> but<00:03:51.769> it's<00:03:52.720> it's<00:03:53.720> it's

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
a not a thick paste but it's it's it's

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.130 
a not a thick paste but it's it's it's
just<00:03:54.350> a<00:03:54.530> bit<00:03:54.709> more<00:03:55.600> thinner<00:03:56.600> than<00:03:56.780> than<00:03:57.110> a

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
just a bit more thinner than than a

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.190 
just a bit more thinner than than a
paste<00:03:57.440> would<00:03:57.590> be<00:03:58.180> so<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.360> when<00:03:59.720> once<00:03:59.959> you've

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
paste would be so and when once you've

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.380 
paste would be so and when once you've
got<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.440> right<00:04:00.470> consistency<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:02.150> just

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
got the right consistency you just

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.170 
got the right consistency you just
basically<00:04:03.190> brush<00:04:04.190> it<00:04:04.310> on<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:04.730> you<00:04:04.820> brush<00:04:05.030> it

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
basically brush it on so you brush it

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.000 
basically brush it on so you brush it
off<00:04:05.300> just<00:04:05.900> make<00:04:06.050> sure<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.680> the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
off just make sure that the the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.060 
off just make sure that the the
thoraseal<00:04:07.310> is<00:04:07.580> sort<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:08.380> paste<00:04:09.380> enough<00:04:09.769> that

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
thoraseal is sort of a paste enough that

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.770 
thoraseal is sort of a paste enough that
it's<00:04:10.400> running<00:04:10.610> enough<00:04:10.910> but<00:04:11.120> not<00:04:11.209> too<00:04:11.269> runny<00:04:11.570> if

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
it's running enough but not too runny if

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.850 
it's running enough but not too runny if
it's<00:04:11.930> too<00:04:12.080> runny<00:04:12.110> it's<00:04:12.440> not<00:04:12.530> going<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.739> work

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
it's too runny it's not going to work

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.370 
it's too runny it's not going to work
obviously<00:04:13.040> it's<00:04:13.880> too<00:04:14.060> thin<00:04:14.269> then<00:04:14.420> it<00:04:15.140> just

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
obviously it's too thin then it just

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.420 
obviously it's too thin then it just
needs<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.650> be<00:04:15.709> kind<00:04:16.010> of<00:04:16.100> that<00:04:18.430> consistency

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
needs to be kind of that consistency

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.789 
needs to be kind of that consistency
where<00:04:19.669> it's<00:04:20.269> rational<00:04:20.540> right<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:21.650> you

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
where it's rational right and you you

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.070 
where it's rational right and you you
you<00:04:22.039> you'll<00:04:22.280> kind<00:04:22.580> of<00:04:22.610> see<00:04:22.669> just<00:04:22.970> add<00:04:23.330> add<00:04:24.020> a

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
you you'll kind of see just add add a

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.540

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
little bit of water time not too much

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.279 
little bit of water time not too much
water

other thing you want to do is once once
the<00:04:38.569> thoraseal<00:04:38.840> is<00:04:39.080> drive<00:04:39.289> after<00:04:39.469> seven<00:04:39.830> days

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
the thoraseal is drive after seven days

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.339 
the thoraseal is drive after seven days
you<00:04:40.129> want<00:04:40.189> to<00:04:40.310> wash<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:40.460> with<00:04:40.729> salt<00:04:40.939> water

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349

you want to wash it with salt water
basically<00:04:42.349> I<00:04:42.469> take<00:04:42.590> a<00:04:42.650> pound<00:04:42.919> of<00:04:43.039> salt<00:04:43.219> throw

it doesn't doesn't allow you to allow
that<00:04:58.849> to<00:04:59.210> go<00:04:59.240> into<00:04:59.479> the<00:04:59.629> pond<00:04:59.870> right<00:04:59.990> so<00:05:00.289> you

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409 
that to go into the pond right so you

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:01.540 
that to go into the pond right so you
really<00:05:00.590> want<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.860> make<00:05:00.979> sure<00:05:01.009> that<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.400> walls

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550

really want to make sure that the walls
are<00:05:01.819> actually<00:05:02.330> clean<00:05:02.719> there<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.560> after<00:05:03.889> seven

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
are actually clean there and after seven

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:05.800 
are actually clean there and after seven
days<00:05:04.279> you<00:05:04.460> can<00:05:04.639> you<00:05:04.849> can<00:05:05.029> put<00:05:05.150> water<00:05:05.360> in<00:05:05.629> and

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
days you can you can put water in and

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.010 
days you can you can put water in and
start<00:05:06.529> using<00:05:06.710> your<00:05:06.949> point<00:05:07.240> as<00:05:08.240> I<00:05:08.599> mentioned

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
start using your point as I mentioned

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.730 
start using your point as I mentioned
that<00:05:09.889> the<00:05:10.069> curl<00:05:10.279> sexy<00:05:10.669> I<00:05:11.659> couldn't<00:05:12.650> really

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
that the curl sexy I couldn't really

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.990 
that the curl sexy I couldn't really
find<00:05:12.919> a<00:05:13.009> lot<00:05:13.039> of<00:05:13.250> information<00:05:13.430> on<00:05:13.789> it<00:05:13.909> they

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
find a lot of information on it they

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.399 
find a lot of information on it they
kind<00:05:14.180> of<00:05:14.210> recommend<00:05:14.629> to<00:05:14.689> use<00:05:14.810> it<00:05:14.930> with<00:05:15.020> Rocio

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
kind of recommend to use it with Rocio

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.129 
kind of recommend to use it with Rocio
to<00:05:16.279> me<00:05:16.430> I<00:05:16.490> think<00:05:16.699> it's<00:05:16.969> a<00:05:17.120> bit<00:05:17.270> of<00:05:17.360> a<00:05:17.449> scam<00:05:17.779> but

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
to me I think it's a bit of a scam but

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.420
