 in others william briga the one that also 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.739
 He was a fighter and he is an actor who is the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.239

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.840
 jbl who was the fighter who is now 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.670
 in ww and there are other names the only 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.290
 Latino in this country I want to tell you that 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.510
 not nothing more tense for your fight environment 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.520
 or style fights because here we are 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.450

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.220

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.950
 soon who tells you sports but at 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.080
 end of accounts is not an award that 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.480
 be given because it is the only one there is no 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.210
 very many in this country and in 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.980
 many in Latin America too and I think 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.280
 that also part of what have been my 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.170
 Friends of Bernardo RaÃºl Azkoitia who 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.460
 are have been an important part since 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.460
 what we have done in wrestling 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.530
 and you have been bet on this is not good 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.360
 he is a lost narrator is more me 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.330
 I would say that beyond the wrestling that 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.160
 your passion and collect mascaritas and 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.170
 skateboarding choice to all the belt cited 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.270
 if then everyone will believe the 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.600
 wrestling wants you to imagine anything 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.360
 more is a great but wonderful 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.640
 narrator of swimming and athletics I think 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.700
 that there is no other on the planet believe me 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.110
 I have heard many who have the emotion 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.989
 what do you have to tell in truth 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.239
 of that 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.810
 if you got the government first many 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.150
 Thank you 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.650
 thanks also thanks this 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.840
 sport but also has relied on 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.090
 all what we have done with the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.980
 wrestling and then we continue from here in 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.450
 forward with much desire also a 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.010
 recognition for the group 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.900
 international revolution for week or 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.200
 kallman for a dark frame if the octave 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.420
 best promotion that was given in the year 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.430
 and triple to was in the ninth place then 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.480
 It seems an independent company in a 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.919
 place as small as sand 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.109
 naucalpan that we have transmitted here 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.940
 I think it's also worth putting them to 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.070
 the sale and not if we are going to take them back 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.050
 Sundays at night that's the way it is and going to 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.669
 have a lot of struggle we have many 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.669
 surprises for you thank you very much 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.370

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.210
 [Applause] 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.510

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.260
 [Applause] 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.590

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.560
 same dose 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.310

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.280

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.160

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.389
 third plate on the beast 666 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.639
 it seems that an eye for an eye and a tooth for 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.419
 what the doctor wants to do 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.419
 junior middle Flying 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.850
