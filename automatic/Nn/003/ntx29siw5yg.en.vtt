because let's face it the aging arm in

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.660 
because let's face it the aging arm in
this<00:01:25.310> environment<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:27.740> especially

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
this environment is especially

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.770 
this environment is especially

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.430 
vulnerable to problems the aging eye is
something<00:01:33.350> that<00:01:33.500> would<00:01:33.620> be<00:01:34.900> something<00:01:35.900> easy

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
something that would be something easy

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.140

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
and more toxic I mean should we be

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.490 
and more toxic I mean should we be
starting<00:01:55.760> to<00:01:55.940> use<00:01:56.120> eye<00:01:56.420> support<00:01:56.660> and<00:01:57.320> the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
starting to use eye support and the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.620 
starting to use eye support and the
remedies<00:01:57.890> even<00:01:58.040> earlier<00:01:58.460> yes<00:01:59.120> I<00:01:59.360> would<00:01:59.479> use

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
remedies even earlier yes I would use

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.760 
remedies even earlier yes I would use
them<00:01:59.750> even<00:01:59.870> earlier<00:02:00.290> in<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.890> 40s<00:02:01.310> for<00:02:01.430> example

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
them even earlier in the 40s for example

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.109 
them even earlier in the 40s for example
you<00:02:03.770> know<00:02:03.890> can<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.220> get<00:02:04.369> lutein<00:02:04.700> in<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:04.880> diet

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
you know can you get lutein in the diet

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.990 
you know can you get lutein in the diet
of<00:02:05.930> course<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:06.470> can<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:07.280> know<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:07.880> think

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
of course you can you know I I think

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.719 
of course you can you know I I think
vegetarians<00:02:08.959> for<00:02:09.080> example<00:02:09.740> who<00:02:10.250> eat<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.429> lot<00:02:10.520> of
