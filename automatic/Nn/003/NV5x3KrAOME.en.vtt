00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.940
 I show you today is the ogs the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.259
 original grill system like the whole 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.260
 that works, let's see 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.119
 time it is very important that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.270
 we have a lid when grilling and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.880
 We have it on coal on gas 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.740
 and even on the elektrogrills and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.599
 Of course, the go anywhere of this 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.580
 world so the little grill is called 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.050
 Take along in the cover why that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.110
 that's how important I want you to be 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.940
 Show the following no matter how we do 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.250
 generate the energy in a grill 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.230
 whether with coal with gas or electro it is 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.960
 important that we heat so fast 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 and capture as well as possible 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.829
 means we do not want to leave them out 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.420
 For that we have a lid what happens 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.050
 The coal grill is as follows 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.210
 the heat rises in the charcoal grill 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.149
 swirls in the grill under the ball 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.370
 and allows a very even 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.280
 cook the grill product and only then 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.909
 Let's get the hot air out again 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.360
 out of the grill 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.510
 the same with gas the heat rises in 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.720
 gas grill on distributed we can 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.570
 use the heat optimally in the grill increases 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.930
 get up and go back to the gas grill 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.650
 out and very important how can we do that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.780
 regulate 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.229
 with gas, I think it's just us 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.329
 have the gags where we big on small 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.509
 or to rotate it big in coal 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.810
 we have a ventilation slide on top and 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.210
 an air and slide down the grill 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.340
 this is this here and there it is whole 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.049
 especially important with the lower one 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.570
 ventilation slide he regulates the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.509
 air intake in your grill and the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.670
 the top of the air outlet and that's huge 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.090
 important and everything when closed 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.220
 cover 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.770
 that is very important because we have to 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.920
 an air circulation in the ball grill 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.869
 that means you are doing it all down 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.030
 up and up you are always up 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.459
 the safe side that your grill one 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.530
 you want to sit very high temperature 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.239
 But in the long term, the temperature 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.360
 wanted to change something low 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.610
 have temperature 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.220
 then this performance principle is suitable 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.360
 like this I can air with that 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.400
 slide down 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.840
 the amount of oxygen in the grill 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.180
 go reduce 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.320
 that means I can do it less 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.860
 I do the same thing above, that is me 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.010
 Do it at the top of the fan and at the bottom of the fan 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.270
 exactly the same setting 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.640
 this will bring less oxygen 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.130
 in the grill the briquettes or the coal 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.440
 get less oxygen and glow 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.440
 therefore less and so I can with 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.540
 the lid with the og it all 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.150
 grill evenly and gently 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.150
 this is the ogs of weber
