00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.670
 good afternoon guys, youtube 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.030
 video lesson that I will be helping 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.300
 Do you have a problem with your android phone? 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.480
 the android system the tablet also 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.000
 you connect to the internet, put the password 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.439
 connects to the internet but can not 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.630
 to navigate a form or something else 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.630
 walks 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.519
 so I tried several tutorials regarding 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.679
 that some told me to play it and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.550
 switch the idea from the router to 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.129
 reset the router to change the password change 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 the network name but nothing helped me 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.730
 So you also went through this 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.700
 problem hum 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.399
 So she's here with me, I'm going to 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.219
 show how this is solved 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.149
 How are you going to solve the first one? 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.660
 step is you will have to find the ip of the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.489
 your router has to find ipê has 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.800
 two ways to do this I'll tell you 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.290
 show first then you come here 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.530
 start will search you type cmb 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:20.310
 does not enter and will appear on the black screen 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:23.460
 here you will type bitter with ip vai 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.250
 appear these values ​​here that you will 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.340
 find accurate and this is what the gateway 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:35.579
 standard here is the case of my 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:38.369
 computer 192.168 or 6.1 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.470
 note there your must be different from mine 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.500
 note there why you will need to use 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:49.200
 He 'll close it later and I can 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.790
 display the module mode for you 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.729
 also look for which is the following comes 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.450
 Do not worry about your internet here 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.280
 click here above will open central 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.579
 network sharing 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.630
 here is also the network connection 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:10.050
 the guinea you click here up here 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.680
 general appears details you click here 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.709
 in detail the details will also 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.040
 demonstrate your identity 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:24.450
 ipe fact of here then default gateway 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.709
 192.168.2.1 of honey 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.389
 the note of yours that you will use now 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.480
 then it's these values ​​you date to 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:36.230
 Who do you think that you're going to do? 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.889
 value you will annoy him like it is 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:49.879
 a a site then open here my google 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:49.879
 chrome or enter these values 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:05.489
 192.168.1.1 inter and will open here my 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.859
 router that in case my atp link you 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.139
 must have another brand 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:14.849
 so everyone probably asks for a login 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:17.129
 the tp link is this one admin and 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.620
 The password of me you type twice 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:28.500
 Same thing here and will enter 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:30.750
 so if you have another router 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.810
 search the internet for tutorials 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.479
 respect it or in the manual as well. 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.639
 probably the password and login will appear 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.949
 in general from your router 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.739
 In the case of honey in 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:46.079
 settings 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.720
 What we want to change is the door. 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.090
 voice that is here in that header you 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.720
 will find here the interface in the 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.759
 letter 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:02.599
 I'll click here and I'll find it here 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:02.599
 to the door that 's what we're going to change 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.519
 so here 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.109
 where is the primary dns and dn dns 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.599
 secondary are those values you 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.579
 will change here you must have some values 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:18.120
 different what are you going to do? 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.979
 change they will get here will 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.870
 select all and will 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:26.230
 same values as what I have here 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.690
 which is 8.8 1.8 with port 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.880
 after that on the bottom you will put 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.380
 these values ​​here 8.8 point 4.4 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.880
 exactly these values here you go 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.440
 vote after typing these values 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.870
 What are you going to do 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.810
 the screen it blinks because the 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.790
 network is updating every ten 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.980
 seconds then maybe complicated a 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.100
 little but it's normal to happen then 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:59.920
 you will dictate 8888 do not forget the 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:03.720
 8,844 put these in the secondary 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.910
 values ​​here you come save save here save 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.040
 go here getting network parameter 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.660
 only a message will appear that 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.310
 below that did not appear on mine because 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.240
 did not appear by mine already had these 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.160
 values 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.540
 so I'll show you now which message 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.210
 It will then appear that I will do 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:24.700

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:26.620
 just to give you a copy will appear 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.230
 this message that announced the change in 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.480
