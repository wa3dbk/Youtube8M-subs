00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.769
 so i have a theater mirror before 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.410
 to do and follow that I have now 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.700
 I tried six holes now 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.170
 birthday works great first 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.990
 i thought i imagine mine 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.150
 youtube and the other people 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.199
 do that and what you do 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.269
 actually it probably needs 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.390
 not like you just need a pastor in 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.150
 the better in the book what you live 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.640
 If you want an unfamiliar role 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:38.570
 the super handy here and the best 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.430
 of course a template from bous 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.020
 stinknormaler plastic there I have 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.090
 I made the whole bit easier 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.820
 I printed on paper as you 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.480
 that in front of the national one is always 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.590
 possible to train each other evenly 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:03.600
 and then how to show the holes board 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.650
 what you need is your water but 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.650
 sees the hole 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.960
 sentient beings 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.659
 And so you have to change 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.880
 be careful that you only have the flight from the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.039
 Cordless screwdriver does not press itself 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.429
 and by hand but just walk 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.429
 to let 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.740
 always march water 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.080
 good luck 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:48.400
 from room through the city to see her 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.540
 this was the last week made list 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.540
 reflects so far finished
