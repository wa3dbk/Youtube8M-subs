00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
you need to make them work let's go to

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.539 
you need to make them work let's go to
unbox<00:02:31.230> these<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.709> see<00:02:31.980> what<00:02:32.129> they<00:02:32.280> look<00:02:32.310> like

unbox these to see what they look like

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.550 
unbox these to see what they look like
the<00:02:33.239> systems<00:02:33.720> are<00:02:33.840> these<00:02:34.019> similar<00:02:34.349> in<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
the systems are these similar in the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.410 
the systems are these similar in the
cabling<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.250> we'll<00:02:35.400> just<00:02:35.640> open<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.000> Xbox

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
cabling so we'll just open the Xbox

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.809 
cabling so we'll just open the Xbox
since<00:02:36.720> that's<00:02:36.870> what<00:02:37.049> we<00:02:37.170> normally<00:02:37.349> use<00:02:37.819> here

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
since that's what we normally use here

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.580 
since that's what we normally use here
would<00:02:39.000> be<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.239> cable<00:02:39.599> that<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.840> would<00:02:39.989> use<00:02:40.200> to

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
would be the cable that you would use to

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.160 
would be the cable that you would use to
convert<00:02:40.950> for<00:02:41.459> beats<00:02:41.790> or<00:02:42.060> iPhone<00:02:42.629> so<00:02:42.989> those

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
convert for beats or iPhone so those

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.080 
convert for beats or iPhone so those
will<00:02:43.319> plug<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:43.980> do<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.250> cabling<00:02:44.640> for<00:02:44.700> you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
will plug in and do the cabling for you

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.839 
will plug in and do the cabling for you
this<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.440> thing<00:02:47.129> that<00:02:47.190> would<00:02:47.400> work<00:02:47.579> in

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
this is the thing that would work in

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.380 
this is the thing that would work in
this<00:02:48.090> case<00:02:48.359> for<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.810> xbox<00:02:49.379> with<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.459> xbl

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
this case for the xbox with the xbl

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.809 
this case for the xbox with the xbl
system<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.620> can<00:02:52.799> chat<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.430> do<00:02:53.670> all

that good stuff and of course there'll

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.000 
that good stuff and of course there'll
be<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.280> similar<00:02:56.700> one<00:02:56.879> for<00:02:56.940> your<00:02:57.239> PlayStation
