00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:04.702
Are you satisfied with the response of motorists to this motto gathering?

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:10.803
Considering it's Friday, organizers are delighted.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.101
Yes it was very difficult to arrange all this in a short while, in about a month,

00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:26.073
but really we are delighted with the response of our colleagues, friends, comrades. From Macedonia and Bulgaria

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:37.950
and from all over Serbia. There are people from Jagodina and from Velika Plana from Paracin, Cicevac, Cuprija ... So that really means,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.703
response is good.
-Can you say, at the moment, how much motorists

00:00:42.703 --> 00:00:48.833
are here at the Bovansko lake?
-And in a our assessment, I hope to have something

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:54.124
around 200 bikes.
-Today is Friday, do you expect some number of bikes

00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:58.917
to appear tomorrow?
-Oh yes, tomorrow is weekend, I expect at least twice as much bikes

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:08.823
so we expect the number of to reach at least

00:01:08.823 --> 00:01:15.043
400 bikes, which is entirely, for this organization and for the first time enough.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:24.344
-Beside of parade of angry machines and skillful bikers, attenders of this gathering will have a chance to enjoy the performance

00:01:24.558 --> 00:01:31.422
of some rock bands, which bands are going to perform and when?
-We planned two bands for tonight, first one comes

00:01:31.422 --> 00:01:38.837
from Aleksinac, "ORION BAND"
and second one is from Nis, "NIGHT BONS BLUES BAND"

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:48.660
and tomorrow, tomorrow will be performing three groups, those two i mentioned and special guests of the evening

00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:55.683
"BLUES DELIVERS" from Pancevo.
-In general, you are probably happy with this gathering for now

00:01:55.683 --> 00:02:02.156
if all goes well, you'll probably organize a similar meeting next year.

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:09.706
-We hope so, we hope this period of the year will enter the official motto Association of Serbia

00:02:09.706 --> 00:02:17.415
calendar so, much better organization will be reqired.

00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:21.766
And these are members of the motorcycle club

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:28.458
people who are really much deserving for all what is happening, so I say

00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:32.547
for next year and will need much more serious and better organization

00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:43.872
and we expect greater support of municipality and normally private businesses from Aleksinac who again met our expectations.

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:46.788
-Thank you for your interview.
