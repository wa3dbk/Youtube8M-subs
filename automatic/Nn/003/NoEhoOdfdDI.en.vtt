00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
or a thicker mix or you're using more

or a thicker mix or you're using more
alcohol<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.710> cocktail<00:01:32.009> type<00:01:32.909> mix<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
alcohol in a cocktail type mix and you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.340 
alcohol in a cocktail type mix and you
would<00:01:33.990> turn<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.530> bit<00:01:35.450> also<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:36.990> too

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
would turn it up a bit also if it is too

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.880 
would turn it up a bit also if it is too
icy

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
icy

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.499 
icy
then<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.159> would<00:01:38.280> turn<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.670> more<00:01:38.880> towards<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
then you would turn it more towards the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.080 
then you would turn it more towards the
number<00:01:39.630> 1<00:01:39.930> mark<00:01:40.220> this<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.369> where<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> sensor

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
number 1 mark this is where the sensor

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.700 
number 1 mark this is where the sensor
is<00:01:42.119> behind<00:01:42.899> these<00:01:43.680> screws<00:01:44.720> in<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.590> you

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
is behind these screws in here so if you

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.499 
is behind these screws in here so if you
take<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.040> backing<00:01:47.250> plate<00:01:47.549> off<00:01:47.820> you'll<00:01:48.060> see<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
take this backing plate off you'll see a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.210 
take this backing plate off you'll see a
little<00:01:49.170> roller<00:01:49.350> sensor<00:01:49.950> which<00:01:50.659> basically

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
little roller sensor which basically

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.280 
little roller sensor which basically
controls<00:01:53.220> how<00:01:53.490> often<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.149> gearbox<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
controls how often the gearbox and the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.130 
controls how often the gearbox and the
freezing<00:01:55.619> mechanism<00:01:56.549> cut<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.570> out<00:01:57.719> to

freezing mechanism cut in and out to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.069 
freezing mechanism cut in and out to
create<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.680> ice<00:01:58.799> slushy<00:01:59.189> mix<00:01:59.490> if<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.509> wish<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
create the ice slushy mix if you wish to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.190 
create the ice slushy mix if you wish to
replace<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:02.280> roller<00:02:02.820> centre<00:02:03.570> mechanism

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
replace the roller centre mechanism

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.119 
replace the roller centre mechanism
