00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.320
 information 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.110
 British here goes 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:04.160
 Okay, that's a very big one here 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:10.370
 very special beer and that way 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:12.650
 qinglin mentioned 66 percent alcohol very much 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.950
 strong beer and you can also see a 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.900
 color so that everyone talks reha what i do 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:30.880
 still had was something like that 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:33.270
 amber yes just right super 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.370
 and 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:41.760
 yes and taste can really 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:46.450
 let me see so I find a small 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:52.600
 caramel note and departure easily 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:05:00.730
 bitter but it is not overly 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:03.610
 nasty or yes, everything is very high 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.160
 priced with their special special 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.700
 reserve from here and only the highest 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:14.650
 quality and right here the witch open 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:17.320
 theses and here is the full moon 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.570
 at the full moon it actually bottled 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.660
 is the second time that I have a full moon 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.990
 I had that product I had 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.860
 that full moon water was good too 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.620
 full moon was dissipated here immediately 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.300
 I do not know if I need it 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.800
 now a witch transformed or again 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:42.450
 What I realize was too slow and 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.030
 makes fun of this topic 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:48.100
 Health actually gives that 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:52.150
 Healthy saying that you are not anymore 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:55.720
 drink as three to four units 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.430
 what should I find something confusing 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.970
 because you still say that as well 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:05.130
 could see prompt so about three 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.130
 up to four distances 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:17.530
 until a quarter soja is and sees 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.930
 Of course, very stylish, I think 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.550
 not so cheap I did drugs in porz 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.580
 to buy 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:27.009
 but well what wants to have chic that 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.919
 is really verso be beer friends and 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:33.490
 what I'm going to beer tasting together 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:36.190
 scraping or something, or if you are then 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.680
 hits and departed with what to wanted 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.590
 you would have to take that bit like that 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.020
 that's how it is once we become that 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:48.970
 allmedia tastes a lot worse 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:53.350
 In addition, it fell and was a lot 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:56.979
 Bitter time, broker and that reported 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:07:04.180
 so here is something good for kim collins 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:06.130
 treat video you will find that you have 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.580
 ever such player special super 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:13.289
 edition drunk what that me know 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.289
