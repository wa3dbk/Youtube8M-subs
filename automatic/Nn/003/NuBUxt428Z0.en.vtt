00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.989
 was the time in which the man was composed what they sang and the women 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.009
 only sang the feminine emancipation in the street 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:07.700
 music 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.700
 is the theme of nelson motta's column 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.630
 in relation to May 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.749

 they are increasingly powerful are heads of state ministers ex-president 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.339
 of large corporations 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.369
 then in all professions 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.670
 and often 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.280
 are more competent than men 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.120
 but ular pop music 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.000
 it was always a male territory 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.020
 with the singers interpreting what the composers described praianos 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 but this is also changing fast 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.960

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.560

 hand-picked 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.179
 but she does the lyrics, I'm always the last word 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.070
 I do in Brazil Mariza many country so much success 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.550
 not only because she is a great interpreter 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.650
 but also an inspired composer who created her own repertoire 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 and knows how to choose very well in his tours 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 just as it came since Robinho 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.400
 since Christmas 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.400

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:46.040
 It was all in the life of a composer in Brazil. 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:55.219
 'chiquinha gonzaga' was much more than a songwriter of great talents 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.039
 and one of the founders of the Brazilian carnival 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:03.009
