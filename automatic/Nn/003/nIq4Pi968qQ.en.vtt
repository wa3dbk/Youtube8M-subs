hey guys welcome back to another video

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.430 
hey guys welcome back to another video
today<00:00:03.300> I'm<00:00:03.540> going<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.750> be<00:00:03.810> talking<00:00:03.990> about<00:00:04.290> a

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
today I'm going to be talking about a

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.829 
today I'm going to be talking about a
subject<00:00:04.859> that<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.310> find<00:00:05.839> absolutely

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
subject that I find absolutely

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.919 
subject that I find absolutely
fascinating<00:00:06.980> and<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:09.120> doctrine<00:00:09.750> of

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
fascinating and that is the doctrine of

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.390 
fascinating and that is the doctrine of
signatures<00:00:12.679> so<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.799> doctrine<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.190> signatures

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
signatures so the doctrine of signatures

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.420 
signatures so the doctrine of signatures
is<00:00:14.969> basically<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.809> idea<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:17.190> different

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
is basically the idea that different

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.910 
is basically the idea that different
foods<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.240> plants<00:00:18.810> resemble<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> part<00:00:19.830> of

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
foods and plants resemble the part of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.130 
foods and plants resemble the part of
the<00:00:19.980> body<00:00:20.189> or<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.730> physiological<00:00:21.689> function

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the body or the physiological function

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.160 
the body or the physiological function
of<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.320> body<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.130> heals<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.960> this<00:00:24.960> idea

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
of the body that it heals and this idea

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.410 
of the body that it heals and this idea
has<00:00:25.619> really<00:00:26.070> given<00:00:26.250> me<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.609> deeper<00:00:27.060> connection

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
has really given me a deeper connection

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.529 
has really given me a deeper connection
to<00:00:27.779> my<00:00:28.019> food<00:00:28.289> I'm<00:00:28.970> constantly<00:00:29.970> looking<00:00:30.390> at

to my food I'm constantly looking at

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.060 
to my food I'm constantly looking at
different<00:00:30.900> fruits<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.410> vegetables<00:00:31.859> and

part<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.010> body<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.280> think<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.610> looks<00:00:35.850> like

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and what part of the body I think it

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.940 
and what part of the body I think it
could<00:00:38.040> possibly<00:00:38.309> nourish<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.390> heal<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.410> it's

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
could possibly nourish and heal so it's

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.310 
could possibly nourish and heal so it's
just<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:41.550> cool<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.870> feel<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.170> it's

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so first off we have one of my favorite

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.120 
so first off we have one of my favorite
foods<00:01:23.219> in<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> world<00:01:23.789> and<00:01:24.179> avocado<00:01:24.899> and<00:01:25.380> if

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
foods in the world and avocado and if

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.249 
foods in the world and avocado and if
you<00:01:26.280> look<00:01:26.429> closely<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.270> avocado<00:01:27.750> actually

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
you look closely the avocado actually

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.499 
you look closely the avocado actually
resembles<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.979> woman's<00:01:29.369> uterus<00:01:29.509> it's

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
resembles a woman's uterus it's

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.419 
resembles a woman's uterus it's
basically<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.319> shape<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.860> pregnant<00:01:32.340> belly

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
basically the shape of a pregnant belly

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.700 
basically the shape of a pregnant belly
and<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.119> has<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> pit<00:01:33.689> which<00:01:34.109> I<00:01:34.319> guess<00:01:34.500> would

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
and it has a pit which I guess would

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.980 
and it has a pit which I guess would
resemble<00:01:35.069> the<00:01:35.369> fetus<00:01:35.759> inside<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.450> womb<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
resemble the fetus inside the womb and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.679 
resemble the fetus inside the womb and
avocados<00:01:37.950> are<00:01:38.159> really<00:01:38.429> high<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.789> folate<00:01:39.179> which

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
avocados are really high in folate which

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.779 
avocados are really high in folate which
supports<00:01:40.259> reproductive<00:01:40.950> health<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.429> is

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
supports reproductive health and is

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.639 
supports reproductive health and is
essential<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:42.479> growing<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.020> healthy<00:01:43.380> fetus

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
essential for growing a healthy fetus

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.699 
essential for growing a healthy fetus
and<00:01:44.039> preventing<00:01:44.549> birth<00:01:44.759> defects<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.709> believe

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
and preventing birth defects and believe

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.949 
and preventing birth defects and believe
it<00:01:46.829> or<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.490> takes<00:01:47.789> exactly<00:01:48.030> nine<00:01:48.750> months

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
it or not it takes exactly nine months

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.469 
it or not it takes exactly nine months
to<00:01:49.200> grow<00:01:49.319> an<00:01:49.500> avocado<00:01:49.740> which<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.789> course<00:01:50.819> is

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
to grow an avocado which of course is

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.050 
to grow an avocado which of course is
how<00:01:51.689> long<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.049> takes<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.409> fetus<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.950> develop<00:01:53.429> so

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
how long it takes a fetus to develop so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.809 
how long it takes a fetus to develop so
I<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:54.599> that's<00:01:54.929> pretty<00:01:55.170> cool<00:01:55.590> next<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.670> we

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
I think that's pretty cool next up we

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.219 
I think that's pretty cool next up we
have<00:01:56.970> another<00:01:57.179> one<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> my<00:01:57.569> favorite<00:01:57.959> foods

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
have another one of my favorite foods

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.440 
have another one of my favorite foods

is the organ that monitors and controls

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.240 
is the organ that monitors and controls
our<00:03:42.660> blood<00:03:42.900> sugar<00:03:43.200> by<00:03:43.560> secreting<00:03:43.980> the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
potatoes have actually been shown to

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.150 
potatoes have actually been shown to

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
stabilize our blood sugar levels

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.100 
stabilize our blood sugar levels
probably<00:03:50.730> due<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.910> its<00:03:51.240> high<00:03:51.420> fiber<00:03:51.660> content

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110

probably due to its high fiber content
and<00:03:52.710> yeah<00:03:53.550> I<00:03:53.760> love<00:03:54.090> sweet<00:03:54.300> potatoes<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.900> could
