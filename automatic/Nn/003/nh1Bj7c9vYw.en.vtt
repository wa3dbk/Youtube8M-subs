the<00:03:47.060> front<00:03:47.329> of<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.569> hair<00:03:47.780> instead<00:03:48.680> of

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
the front of the hair instead of

00:03:48.739 --> 00:04:00.270 
the front of the hair instead of
braiding<00:03:51.790> all<00:03:52.790> right<00:03:53.209> down

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.260 

I<00:04:00.870> think<00:04:01.870> with<00:04:02.320> a<00:04:02.350> Dutch<00:04:02.590> braid<00:04:02.860> as<00:04:03.100> well<00:04:03.340> it

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
I think with a Dutch braid as well it

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.710 
I think with a Dutch braid as well it
creates<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.840> illusion<00:04:04.990> of<00:04:05.410> thicker<00:04:05.620> hair<00:04:06.040> you

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
creates the illusion of thicker hair you

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.030 
creates the illusion of thicker hair you
can<00:04:07.720> um<00:04:09.150> do<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.180> Dutch<00:04:10.780> braid<00:04:10.810> so<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:11.860> hair

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
can um do a Dutch braid so that the hair

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.760 
can um do a Dutch braid so that the hair
looks<00:04:12.220> thicker<00:04:12.340> as<00:04:12.760> well<00:04:13.380> then<00:04:14.380> you<00:04:14.500> get<00:04:14.620> to

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
looks thicker as well then you get to

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.280 
looks thicker as well then you get to
the<00:04:14.860> bottom<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.430> can<00:04:15.760> either<00:04:15.970> grab<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.480> whole

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
the bottom you can either grab the whole

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.550 
the bottom you can either grab the whole
piece<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.950> put<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:18.730> up<00:04:18.940> in<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.660> braid<00:04:19.900> or<00:04:20.470> you

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
piece and put it up in the braid or you

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.870 
piece and put it up in the braid or you
can<00:04:20.709> just<00:04:20.859> leave<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.100> little<00:04:21.430> bit<00:04:21.579> out<00:04:21.700> it

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880
