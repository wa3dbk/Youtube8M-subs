mizu<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.310> small<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.210> thin<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.810> have

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
mizu is so small and thin then you have

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.499 
mizu is so small and thin then you have
big<00:01:43.350> ol<00:01:43.530> Haru<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.310> whaling<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.119> her<00:01:45.299> like

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
big ol Haru just whaling on her like

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.389 
big ol Haru just whaling on her like

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
that I don't really find it funny and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.130 
that I don't really find it funny and
then<00:01:47.549> they<00:01:47.700> try<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.000> play<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.450> off<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.869> it's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
then they try and play it off like it's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.039 
then they try and play it off like it's
a<00:01:49.290> comedic<00:01:50.100> relief<00:01:50.280> moment<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.149> I'm<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.780> just

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
a comedic relief moment and I'm not just

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.950 
a comedic relief moment and I'm not just
saying<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:53.159> not<00:01:53.399> funny<00:01:53.729> when<00:01:53.850> guys<00:01:54.659> hit

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
saying that it's not funny when guys hit

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.359 
saying that it's not funny when guys hit
girls<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.470> not<00:01:55.530> funny<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.040> other<00:01:56.189> way

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
girls it's not funny the other way

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.370 
girls it's not funny the other way
around<00:01:56.490> either<00:01:56.969> I'm<00:01:57.240> equally<00:01:57.719> against<00:01:58.170> male

around either I'm equally against male

around either I'm equally against male
bashing<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.159> leads<00:01:59.430> me<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.670> some<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
bashing this leads me to some of the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.389 
bashing this leads me to some of the
problems<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.899> had<00:02:01.170> with<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> series<00:02:01.770> Haru

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
problems that I had with a series Haru

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.690 
problems that I had with a series Haru
is<00:02:02.820> unrealistically<00:02:03.950> uncontrollable<00:02:04.950> yes<00:02:05.460> it

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
is unrealistically uncontrollable yes it

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.760 
is unrealistically uncontrollable yes it
is<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.000> funny<00:02:06.329> at<00:02:06.509> first<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.409> feel<00:02:07.740> that

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
is really funny at first but I feel that

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.580 
is really funny at first but I feel that
his<00:02:08.129> static<00:02:08.580> unchanging<00:02:08.810> character<00:02:09.810> pushes

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
his static unchanging character pushes

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.530 
his static unchanging character pushes
the<00:02:10.770> plot<00:02:11.069> progression<00:02:11.280> back<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.060> square<00:02:12.300> one

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the plot progression back to square one

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.490 
the plot progression back to square one
we<00:02:12.750> learn<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> bit<00:02:13.319> of

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
we learn a bit of

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.590 
we learn a bit of
these<00:02:13.740> other<00:02:13.950> characters<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:14.790> see<00:02:15.000> small

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
these other characters and we see small

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.450 
these other characters and we see small
changes<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.380> their<00:02:16.530> thought<00:02:16.830> patterns<00:02:17.070> and

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
changes in their thought patterns and

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.520 
changes in their thought patterns and
granted<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.450> do<00:02:18.720> learned<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.110> little<00:02:19.260> bit<00:02:19.410> about

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
granted we do learned a little bit about

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.560 
granted we do learned a little bit about
harus<00:02:20.220> past<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:20.760> he<00:02:20.850> stays<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.540> same

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
harus past but he stays the same

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.740 
harus past but he stays the same
character<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.470> feel<00:02:22.740> like<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.580> plot<00:02:24.030> rides

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
character and I feel like the plot rides

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.810 
character and I feel like the plot rides
on<00:02:24.990> his<00:02:25.140> shoulders<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.860> because<00:02:26.220> he<00:02:26.370> stays<00:02:26.640> the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
on his shoulders so because he stays the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.190 
on his shoulders so because he stays the
same<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.240> feels<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.810> plot<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.170> just

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
same it feels like the plot is just

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.960 
same it feels like the plot is just
spinning<00:02:28.710> its<00:02:28.830> wheels<00:02:28.980> going<00:02:29.340> nowhere<00:02:29.820> in

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
spinning its wheels going nowhere in

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.850 
spinning its wheels going nowhere in
fact<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.540> felt<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:31.050> both<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.650> main

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
fact I felt like both of the main

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.100 
fact I felt like both of the main
characters<00:02:32.400> had<00:02:32.580> very<00:02:32.820> static<00:02:33.360> personalities

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
characters had very static personalities

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.050 
characters had very static personalities
more<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:34.590> Haru<00:02:34.890> than<00:02:35.220> me<00:02:35.340> zoo<00:02:35.400> me<00:02:35.790> zoo's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
more so Haru than me zoo me zoo's

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.180 
more so Haru than me zoo me zoo's
character<00:02:36.510> progresses<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.110> bit<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.800> always

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
character progresses a bit but I always

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.220 
character progresses a bit but I always
had<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.490> feeling<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:39.090> when<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.780> know<00:02:39.990> this

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
had this feeling like when you know this

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.900 
had this feeling like when you know this
girl<00:02:40.470> that's<00:02:40.770> dating<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.340> scum<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.820> earth

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
girl that's dating the scum of the earth

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.520 
girl that's dating the scum of the earth
and<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.360> think<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.690> yourself<00:02:42.750> what<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.350> hell

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
and you think to yourself what the hell

is wrong with her Haru on the other hand
I<00:02:45.540> feel<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.900> only<00:02:46.080> fit<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.530> be<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.709> support

I feel is only fit to be a support

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.770 
I feel is only fit to be a support
character<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.880> don't<00:02:48.090> understand<00:02:48.630> why

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
character and I don't understand why

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.600 
character and I don't understand why
anyone<00:02:49.290> would<00:02:49.620> like<00:02:49.830> him<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.280> that's<00:02:50.489> the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
anyone would like him and that's the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.610 
anyone would like him and that's the
thing<00:02:50.790> about<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.150> series<00:02:51.510> most<00:02:52.080> of<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.380> male

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
thing about the series most of the male

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.770 
thing about the series most of the male
characters<00:02:53.100> are<00:02:53.250> solely<00:02:53.640> attracted<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.360> mizu

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
characters are solely attracted to mizu

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.380 
characters are solely attracted to mizu
while<00:02:55.380> most<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.220> female<00:02:56.640> characters<00:02:56.670> are

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
while most of the female characters are

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
solely attracted to Haru there were a

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.270 
solely attracted to Haru there were a
few<00:03:00.300> minor<00:03:00.630> exceptions<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.739> where<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> few

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
few minor exceptions to this where a few

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.979 
few minor exceptions to this where a few
of<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.459> side<00:03:02.700> characters<00:03:03.239> were<00:03:03.390> interested

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
of the side characters were interested

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.870 
of the side characters were interested
in<00:03:04.110> each<00:03:04.260> other<00:03:04.380> but<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.130> wasn't<00:03:05.430> very<00:03:05.580> small

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
in each other but it wasn't very small

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.000 
in each other but it wasn't very small
doses<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.570> think<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.050> series<00:03:07.260> would<00:03:07.560> benefit

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
doses I think this series would benefit

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.380 
doses I think this series would benefit
from<00:03:08.160> having<00:03:08.370> more<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.970> support

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
from having more of the support

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.210 
from having more of the support
characters<00:03:09.900> fall<00:03:10.380> in<00:03:10.590> love<00:03:10.770> with<00:03:10.950> each<00:03:10.980> other

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
characters fall in love with each other

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.010 
characters fall in love with each other
that<00:03:11.550> would<00:03:11.670> make<00:03:11.880> their<00:03:12.300> world<00:03:12.660> more

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
that would make their world more

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.620 
that would make their world more
believable<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.070> realistic<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.850> Haru<00:03:15.239> I'm

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.090 
mostly positive I felt that the story
took<00:04:24.450> a<00:04:24.660> bit<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.320> turn<00:04:25.590> down

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.260 
grows I felt that it was ultimately
unbelievable<00:04:41.220> because<00:04:41.730> we<00:04:41.910> have<00:04:42.060> two
