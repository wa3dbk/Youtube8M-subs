00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.680 
on this are give it some time people I
think<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.489> they're<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.820> ready<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.180> reveal

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
think that they're not ready to reveal

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.510 
think that they're not ready to reveal
the<00:01:00.989> ultimate<00:01:01.350> jutsu<00:01:01.620> which<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.980> basically

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the ultimate jutsu which is basically

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.960 
the ultimate jutsu which is basically
right<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.270> naruto<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.199> even<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.129> sasuke<00:01:05.729> side

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
right for naruto and even on sasuke side

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120 
right for naruto and even on sasuke side
that's<00:01:06.689> not<00:01:06.960> even<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> right<00:01:07.409> Ultimate<00:01:07.979> Jutsu

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that's not even the right Ultimate Jutsu

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.320 
that's not even the right Ultimate Jutsu
they<00:01:08.460> should<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.760> given<00:01:09.090> him<00:01:09.210> because

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
they should be given him because

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
they should be given him because
considering<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.170> happened<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.920> final

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
considering what happened in the final

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.160 
considering what happened in the final
fight<00:01:11.490> between<00:01:11.700> naruto<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.390> sasuke<00:01:12.540> they

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
fight between naruto and sasuke they

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.240 
fight between naruto and sasuke they
both<00:01:13.470> should<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.740> getting<00:01:14.070> something

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
both should be getting something

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.590 
both should be getting something
different<00:01:14.790> than<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.390> they<00:01:15.540> were

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600

displayed<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.740> demo<00:01:16.979> now<00:01:17.549> why<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.330> think

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
displayed in the demo now why I think

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.380 
displayed in the demo now why I think
they<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.259> not<00:01:19.470> released<00:01:19.799> these<00:01:20.790> basically

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
they have not released these basically

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.929 
they have not released these basically

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
naruto and sasuke but they said there

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.880 
naruto and sasuke but they said there
but<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.840> basically<00:02:00.990> meant<00:02:01.439> they<00:02:01.590> were<00:02:01.649> going

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
but that basically meant they were going

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.030 
but that basically meant they were going
to<00:02:01.950> go<00:02:02.070> up<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.670> point<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.689> game<00:02:04.040> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
to go up to that point in the game the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.649 
to go up to that point in the game the
reason<00:02:05.490> they<00:02:05.640> didn't<00:02:05.909> show<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.360> probably

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
reason they didn't show it was probably

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.999 
reason they didn't show it was probably
because<00:02:06.780> they're<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.140> ready<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.619> show<00:02:07.829> it

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
because they're not ready to show it

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.119 
because they're not ready to show it
even<00:02:08.819> though<00:02:09.060> they<00:02:09.810> spoil<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> lot<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.709> lot<00:02:10.739> of

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
even though they spoil a lot a lot of

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.900 
even though they spoil a lot a lot of

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
first trailer as the last final trailer

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.740 
first trailer as the last final trailer
the<00:02:39.340> launch<00:02:39.550> trailer<00:02:39.850> so<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.180> know<00:02:40.480> in<00:02:40.600> our

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
the launch trailer so you know in our

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.570 
the launch trailer so you know in our
tone<00:02:40.960> sasuke<00:02:41.380> clash<00:02:41.620> in<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.860> first<00:02:42.130> trailer<00:02:42.340> i

think that will continue off in the last

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.170 
think that will continue off in the last
