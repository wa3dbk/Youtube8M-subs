00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
do this then you can like keep stacking

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.620 
do this then you can like keep stacking
the<00:02:02.399> ice<00:02:02.520> whenever<00:02:02.910> if<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.270> want<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.600> that

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
second one has to be ice super super

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
second one has to be ice super super
important<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.820> want<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.509> want

water thing going by then you know you
guys<00:02:19.709> did<00:02:19.920> right<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.310> can<00:02:20.400> actually<00:02:20.519> just

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
guys did right you can actually just

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.750 
guys did right you can actually just

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
delete all the blocks surrounding it so

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.680 
delete all the blocks surrounding it so
it's<00:02:23.880> really<00:02:23.970> easy<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.269> that's<00:02:24.510> kind<00:02:24.660> of

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
it's really easy so that's kind of

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
going until you the fire started then we

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.289 
going until you the fire started then we
want<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.920> do<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.220> when<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.549> can<00:02:38.700> set<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> foot

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
and stealing flutter and then there you

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.650 
and stealing flutter and then there you
go<00:02:41.010> nearly<00:02:41.310> as<00:02:41.400> top<00:02:41.760> lock<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.180> really<00:02:42.330> want<00:02:42.510> to

go nearly as top lock and really want to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.900 
go nearly as top lock and really want to
and<00:02:42.870> then<00:02:43.410> eventually<00:02:43.769> like<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.310> ice<00:02:44.700> will

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and then eventually like the ice will

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.800 
and then eventually like the ice will
melt<00:02:44.940> if<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.269> guys<00:02:45.360> want<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.630> give<00:02:45.720> you

melt if you guys want to give you

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.870 
melt if you guys want to give you
glowstone<00:02:46.260> can<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.070> double<00:02:47.400> stack<00:02:47.670> this

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
glowstone can like double stack this

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.750 
glowstone can like double stack this
thing<00:02:48.090> right<00:02:48.330> here<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.780> then<00:02:49.350> eventually<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
thing right here and then eventually the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.030 
thing right here and then eventually the
glowstone<00:02:51.120> can<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:51.480> melt<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> ice<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.049> I

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
glowstone can like melt the ice and I

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.410 
glowstone can like melt the ice and I
don't<00:02:53.400> know<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:53.610> works<00:02:53.760> with<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.970> cool<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.299> I'll

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
don't know it works with a cool but I'll

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.990 
don't know it works with a cool but I'll
keep<00:02:54.600> in<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.840> she<00:02:55.320> don't<00:02:55.500> really<00:02:55.680> need<00:02:55.799> it

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
keep in it she don't really need it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.420 
keep in it she don't really need it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
because um once you're above water you

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.710 
because um once you're above water you
can<00:02:59.579> only<00:02:59.640> see<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.910> ice<00:03:00.030> at<00:03:00.150> all<00:03:00.239> but<00:03:00.420> once<00:03:00.660> you

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
can only see the ice at all but once you

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.750 
can only see the ice at all but once you
go<00:03:00.810> back<00:03:00.930> any<00:03:01.140> time<00:03:01.280> excuse<00:03:02.280> right<00:03:02.370> there<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.730> I

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.370 
go back any time excuse right there so I
know<00:03:03.299> it's<00:03:03.480> kind<00:03:03.600> of<00:03:03.630> cool<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.019> thought<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.290> is

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
know it's kind of cool I thought this is

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.430 
know it's kind of cool I thought this is
a<00:03:04.440> nice<00:03:04.650> little<00:03:04.829> trick<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.840> like<00:03:07.049> do<00:03:07.260> some
