problems that they have is there a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.960 
problems that they have is there a
little<00:01:06.570> bit<00:01:06.780> thick<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.619> little<00:01:08.220> bit<00:01:08.340> bulky<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
little bit thick a little bit bulky and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.410 
little bit thick a little bit bulky and
for<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:09.990> reason<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> same

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
for that reason this one it's the same

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
think there are other nicer cases with

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.910 
think there are other nicer cases with
better<00:01:17.490> materials<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:19.350> don't<00:01:19.560> they're

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
better materials but they don't they're

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.030 
better materials but they don't they're

case is as you can see when you put it
up<00:01:47.670> at<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> highest<00:01:48.320> angle<00:01:49.850> it's<00:01:50.850> almost<00:01:51.210> 90

it's<00:01:52.380> about<00:01:52.439> i'd<00:01:53.100> say<00:01:53.130> probably<00:01:53.310> 80<00:01:53.970> 75<00:01:54.780> degree

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
it's about i'd say probably 80 75 degree

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.469 
it's about i'd say probably 80 75 degree
angle<00:01:55.530> something<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.149> it's<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.299> lot

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
angle something like that it's a lot

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.649 
angle something like that it's a lot
sturdier<00:01:57.979> it's<00:01:58.979> got<00:01:59.159> more<00:01:59.430> angles<00:01:59.969> that's

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
sturdier it's got more angles that's

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.380 
sturdier it's got more angles that's
even<00:02:00.990> more<00:02:01.020> sturdy<00:02:01.700> just<00:02:02.700> by<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.880> nature<00:02:03.090> of

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
even more sturdy just by the nature of

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.990 
even more sturdy just by the nature of
physics<00:02:03.869> now<00:02:04.020> these<00:02:04.200> two<00:02:04.500> aren't<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:05.549> stick

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
physics now these two aren't don't stick

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.080 
physics now these two aren't don't stick
in<00:02:06.180> as<00:02:06.329> well<00:02:06.740> but<00:02:07.740> they<00:02:08.069> work<00:02:08.310> they're<00:02:08.849> fine

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
in as well but they work they're fine

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.620 
in as well but they work they're fine
and<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.959> one<00:02:10.020> down<00:02:10.950> here

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
and then this one down here

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.900 
and then this one down here
and<00:02:12.840> then<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.680> course<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:14.070> can<00:02:14.250> use<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.490> at<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
and then of course you can use it at the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.090 
and then of course you can use it at the
lowest<00:02:15.060> level<00:02:15.570> which<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.620> way<00:02:16.740> I've<00:02:16.890> been

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
lowest level which is the way I've been

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.980 
lowest level which is the way I've been
using<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.430> lot<00:02:17.460> or<00:02:17.910> at<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.420> level<00:02:18.750> that's

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
using a lot or at that level that's

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.870 
using a lot or at that level that's
still<00:02:19.200> my<00:02:19.500> preferred<00:02:20.330> angle<00:02:22.310> as<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.550> can<00:02:23.670> see

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
still my preferred angle as you can see

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.520 
still my preferred angle as you can see
it<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:26.250> has<00:02:26.460> these<00:02:26.700> edges<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.870> pops<00:02:28.230> into

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
it it has these edges that it pops into

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.090 
it it has these edges that it pops into
place<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.360> they're<00:02:30.360> very<00:02:30.390> strong<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.590> fact

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
place and they're very strong in fact

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.880 
place and they're very strong in fact
really<00:02:32.700> almost<00:02:33.030> hard<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.480> get<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.410> go<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:34.710> I've

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
really almost hard to get to go in I've

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.590 
really almost hard to get to go in I've
got<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.220> case<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.880> ipad<00:02:36.210> in<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.420> little

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
got the case in of the ipad in a little

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.790 
got the case in of the ipad in a little
bit<00:02:36.690> backwards<00:02:37.050> right<00:02:37.170> now<00:02:37.350> with<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> volume

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
bit backwards right now with the volume

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.740 
bit backwards right now with the volume
button<00:02:38.250> down<00:02:38.790> there<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.210> normally<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.660> would

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
button down there but normally it would

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.310 
button down there but normally it would
be<00:02:39.840> out<00:02:39.960> here<00:02:40.230> if<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.500> put<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:40.890> right<00:02:42.170> just<00:02:43.170> go

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
be out here if I put it in right just go

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:51.020 
be out here if I put it in right just go
ahead<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.530> do<00:02:43.710> that<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:50.670> what<00:02:50.910> you

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
ahead and do that so is that what you

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.950 
ahead and do that so is that what you
can<00:02:51.210> see<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:54.000> get<00:02:54.120> access<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.780> all<00:02:54.930> of

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
can see that you get access to all of

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.160 
can see that you get access to all of
your<00:02:55.170> ports<00:02:55.730> without<00:02:56.730> any<00:02:57.660> difficulty<00:02:58.410> at<00:02:58.680> all

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
your ports without any difficulty at all

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.910 
your ports without any difficulty at all
power<00:03:01.170> button<00:03:01.590> headphones<00:03:03.710> it's<00:03:04.710> a<00:03:04.800> lot

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
power button headphones it's a lot

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.580 
power button headphones it's a lot
theater<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.280> lot<00:03:05.460> lighter<00:03:06.260> still<00:03:07.260> has<00:03:07.410> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
theater a lot lighter still has the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.370 
theater a lot lighter still has the
protective<00:03:08.420> inside<00:03:09.420> which<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.960> think<00:03:10.230> that's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
protective inside which I think that's

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.190 
protective inside which I think that's
even<00:03:10.530> better<00:03:10.770> than<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.070> in<00:03:11.220> case<00:03:11.750> cases<00:03:12.750> has

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
even better than the in case cases has

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.380 
even better than the in case cases has
that<00:03:13.800> part<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.460> just<00:03:14.490> kind<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:14.850> clamps<00:03:15.360> down

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
that part that just kind of clamps down

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.050 
that part that just kind of clamps down
into<00:03:15.780> place<00:03:15.990> I<00:03:16.280> would<00:03:17.280> say<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.460> this<00:03:17.790> is

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
into place I would say that this is

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.670 
into place I would say that this is
probably<00:03:18.390> now<00:03:18.900> my<00:03:19.500> favorite<00:03:19.860> case<00:03:20.250> with<00:03:20.670> one

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
probably now my favorite case with one

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.920 
probably now my favorite case with one
minor<00:03:22.680> problem<00:03:23.070> which<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:24.120> hope<00:03:24.420> doesn't<00:03:24.660> turn

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
minor problem which I hope doesn't turn

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.400 
minor problem which I hope doesn't turn
into<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.170> major<00:03:25.950> one<00:03:27.110> unfortunately<00:03:28.110> these

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
into a major one unfortunately these

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.000 
into a major one unfortunately these
edges<00:03:28.980> are<00:03:29.190> kind<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.520> cracking<00:03:30.920> there's<00:03:31.920> one

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
edges are kind of cracking there's one

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.010 
edges are kind of cracking there's one
right<00:03:32.310> here<00:03:32.670> I'm<00:03:33.120> hoping<00:03:33.420> it's<00:03:33.570> just<00:03:33.630> going<00:03:33.990> to

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
right here I'm hoping it's just going to

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.230 
right here I'm hoping it's just going to
be<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.290> edges<00:03:34.590> which<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:34.980> can<00:03:35.160> live<00:03:35.340> with<00:03:35.580> you

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
be the edges which I can live with you

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.700 
be the edges which I can live with you
know<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.390> case<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.840> going<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.050> wear<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.500> little

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
know a case is going to wear in a little

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.130 
know a case is going to wear in a little
bit<00:03:37.860> but<00:03:38.460> I'm<00:03:38.550> noticing<00:03:38.880> even<00:03:39.750> now<00:03:39.900> there's

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
bit but I'm noticing even now there's

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.730 
bit but I'm noticing even now there's
more<00:03:40.380> than<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.590> thought<00:03:40.800> there<00:03:41.040> were<00:03:41.160> one<00:03:41.910> there

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
more than I thought there were one there

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.890 
more than I thought there were one there
one<00:03:43.740> there<00:03:43.770> one<00:03:44.930> there<00:03:47.209> is<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.420> big<00:03:48.660> dish

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
one there one there is that a big dish

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.760 
one there one there is that a big dish
issue<00:03:49.370> well<00:03:50.370> at<00:03:50.640> this<00:03:50.880> point<00:03:51.000> only<00:03:51.620> having<00:03:52.620> had

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
issue well at this point only having had

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.040 
issue well at this point only having had
this<00:03:52.920> for<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.190> little<00:03:53.400> under<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:54.480> week<00:03:54.570> well

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
this for a little under a week well

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.560 
this for a little under a week well
about<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.320> right<00:03:55.680> out<00:03:55.800> a<00:03:55.830> week<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.390> don't<00:03:57.390> think

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
about a right out a week I don't think

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.470 
about a right out a week I don't think
it's<00:03:57.990> going<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.320> be<00:03:58.410> but<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.250> don't<00:03:59.520> know<00:03:59.640> so

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
it's going to be but I don't know so

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.150 
it's going to be but I don't know so
that<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.780> one<00:04:00.990> caveat<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.709> would<00:04:01.830> have<00:04:01.980> is

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
that is one caveat that I would have is

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.449 
that is one caveat that I would have is
you<00:04:02.970> know<00:04:03.410> look<00:04:04.410> at<00:04:04.560> yours<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:05.010> if<00:04:05.070> it<00:04:05.190> starts

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
you know look at yours and if it starts

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.949 
you know look at yours and if it starts
wearing<00:04:05.700> pretty<00:04:06.030> quickly<00:04:06.330> you<00:04:06.570> may<00:04:06.690> want<00:04:06.930> to

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
wearing pretty quickly you may want to

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.380 
wearing pretty quickly you may want to
go<00:04:07.080> ahead<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.290> return<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.640> but<00:04:08.640> if<00:04:08.970> that's<00:04:09.240> the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
go ahead and return it but if that's the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.150 
go ahead and return it but if that's the
only<00:04:09.420> problem<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:10.350> it's<00:04:10.470> just<00:04:10.800> on<00:04:10.980> those

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
only problem and it's just on those

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.610 
only problem and it's just on those
edges<00:04:11.580> I'm<00:04:12.270> not<00:04:12.630> worried<00:04:12.930> i<00:04:13.080> think<00:04:13.320> this<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:13.590> a

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
edges I'm not worried i think this is a

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.430 
edges I'm not worried i think this is a
great<00:04:14.130> case<00:04:14.459> this<00:04:14.610> is<00:04:14.820> my<00:04:15.000> favorite<00:04:15.540> case<00:04:16.140> it

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
great case this is my favorite case it

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.800 
great case this is my favorite case it
is<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.830> one<00:04:17.010> going<00:04:17.459> forward<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:18.359> unless<00:04:18.570> i'm

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
is the one going forward that unless i'm
