and<00:00:03.179> so<00:00:03.449> both<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:04.049> command<00:00:04.710> module<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.339> lunar

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
and so both the command module the lunar

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.880 
and so both the command module the lunar
module<00:00:05.730> have<00:00:06.270> made<00:00:06.450> their<00:00:06.690> 14th<00:00:07.200> revolution

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
module have made their 14th revolution

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.860 
module have made their 14th revolution
around<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.429> other<00:00:08.580> side<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.120> Moon<00:00:09.599> are

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
around on the other side of the Moon are

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.900 
around on the other side of the Moon are
now<00:00:10.080> on<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.620> side<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.160> moon<00:00:11.340> if<00:00:11.580> we<00:00:11.610> had

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
now on this side of the moon if we had

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.850 
now on this side of the moon if we had
the<00:00:11.940> glass<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.690> strong<00:00:12.960> enough<00:00:13.110> perhaps<00:00:13.530> we

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
the glass is strong enough perhaps we

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.980 
the glass is strong enough perhaps we
could<00:00:14.070> see<00:00:14.549> them<00:00:14.730> passing<00:00:15.299> across<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.809> moon

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
could see them passing across the moon

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.109 
could see them passing across the moon
they've<00:00:16.260> just<00:00:16.470> come<00:00:16.740> into<00:00:17.190> sight<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.699> it

was<00:07:49.490> one<00:07:49.640> of<00:07:49.670> the<00:07:49.820> concerns<00:07:50.180> before<00:07:50.930> they

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:51.260 
was one of the concerns before they

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.750
