them<00:00:13.469> at<00:00:13.650> mirror<00:00:14.009> match<00:00:14.219> ups<00:00:14.460> when<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.790> say

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
them at mirror match ups when I say

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.230 
them at mirror match ups when I say
mirror<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.240> mean<00:00:15.269> like<00:00:15.570> ZBC<00:00:16.350> PvP<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.130> TV<00:00:17.490> t<00:00:17.640> it

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
mirror I mean like ZBC PvP and TV t it

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.730 
mirror I mean like ZBC PvP and TV t it
has<00:00:18.359> billions<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.900> strategies<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.439> can<00:00:19.470> do

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
has billions of strategies you can do

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.279 
has billions of strategies you can do
and<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.330> game<00:00:21.570> will<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.810> exploiting

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
what how how this game happened and it

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.319 
what how how this game happened and it
can<00:00:34.320> change<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.920> biller<00:00:35.100> as<00:00:35.489> possible<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.090> be

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
can change the biller as possible to be

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.500 
can change the biller as possible to be
changed<00:00:36.719> because<00:00:37.340> well<00:00:38.340> according<00:00:38.940> again<00:00:39.270> you

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
changed because well according again you

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.670 
changed because well according again you
have<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.690> basically<00:00:39.809> retaliate<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.590> at

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
have to basically retaliate to you at

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.160 
have to basically retaliate to you at
your<00:00:40.800> opponent<00:00:41.160> does<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.540> that's<00:00:42.930> why<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
your opponent does and so that's why the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.720 
your opponent does and so that's why the
build<00:00:43.410> order<00:00:43.710> does<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.190> change<00:00:44.370> its<00:00:44.579> not

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
build order does have to change its not

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.060 
build order does have to change its not
like<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.770> sort<00:00:47.010> of

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
like it can it can just be one sort of

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.060 
like it can it can just be one sort of
build<00:00:47.250> order<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.930> nothing<00:00:48.930> else<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.559> but

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
build order and nothing else to it but

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.920

really important now as you can see i'm
doing<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> triple<00:01:55.530> Asheville<00:01:55.950> order<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.759> might

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
doing a triple Asheville order you might

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.010 
doing a triple Asheville order you might
be<00:01:57.000> wondering<00:01:57.149> why<00:01:57.360> I'm<00:01:57.509> doing<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
be wondering why I'm doing that the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.380 
be wondering why I'm doing that the
reason<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.649> because<00:01:58.680> he<00:01:59.640> did<00:01:59.939> he

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
reason for that is because he did he

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.660 
reason for that is because he did he
made<00:02:00.600> us<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.960> hatchery<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.829> expansion<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.579> I'm

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
made us a hatchery as expansion and I'm

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.880 
made us a hatchery as expansion and I'm
sure<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.119> because<00:02:03.649> there's<00:02:04.649> no<00:02:04.770> other

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
sure of that because there's no other

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.590 
sure of that because there's no other
possible<00:02:05.310> place<00:02:05.520> unless<00:02:05.850> besides<00:02:06.240> his<00:02:06.390> choke

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
possible place unless besides his choke

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.169 
possible place unless besides his choke
that<00:02:07.140> he'd<00:02:07.259> put<00:02:07.439> his<00:02:07.469> expansion<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.250> since<00:02:09.060> he

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
that he'd put his expansion and since he

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.449 
that he'd put his expansion and since he
did<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.509> 12<00:02:10.020> hatch<00:02:10.200> border<00:02:10.649> I'm<00:02:10.890> free<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.250> do<00:02:11.430> a

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
gonna wait for speed to be finished and

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.380 
gonna wait for speed to be finished and
when<00:04:19.650> that's<00:04:19.829> finished<00:04:19.890> this<00:04:20.760> game<00:04:20.910> will<00:04:21.359> be

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
when that's finished this game will be

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.450 
when that's finished this game will be
over<00:04:21.510> because<00:04:21.959> there's<00:04:22.680> no<00:04:23.070> possible<00:04:23.400> way

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
over because there's no possible way

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.950 
over because there's no possible way
honestly<00:04:23.669> constantly<00:04:24.270> produces<00:04:24.660> railings

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
honestly constantly produces railings

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.540 
honestly constantly produces railings
and<00:04:25.080> even<00:04:25.740> if<00:04:25.830> he<00:04:25.890> does<00:04:26.039> constantly<00:04:26.340> produce

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
and even if he does constantly produce

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.500 
and even if he does constantly produce
red<00:04:26.849> wings<00:04:27.030> then

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
red wings then

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.540 
red wings then
oh<00:04:27.570> well<00:04:28.530> he's<00:04:28.680> not<00:04:28.800> getting<00:04:29.040> any<00:04:29.100> more<00:04:29.280> drones

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
oh well he's not getting any more drones

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
so I have no worry about him being a

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.690 
so I have no worry about him being a
headache<00:04:31.110> on<00:04:31.320> economically<00:04:31.890> so<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:32.310> why<00:04:32.490> bad

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
headache on economically so that why bad

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.610 
headache on economically so that why bad
expansion<00:04:33.150> he<00:04:33.240> has<00:04:33.360> right<00:04:33.450> now<00:04:33.540> is<00:04:33.750> totally

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
expansion he has right now is totally

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.260 
expansion he has right now is totally
pointless<00:04:35.220> because<00:04:35.610> it's<00:04:35.910> not<00:04:36.030> doing

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
pointless because it's not doing

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.700 
pointless because it's not doing
anything<00:04:36.450> it's<00:04:36.750> not<00:04:36.900> getting<00:04:37.080> him<00:04:37.260> any<00:04:37.380> extra

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710
