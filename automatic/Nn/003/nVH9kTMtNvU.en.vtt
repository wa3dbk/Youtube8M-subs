on I'm a mono guy I've always fish mono

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.829 
on I'm a mono guy I've always fish mono
of<00:00:34.989> in<00:00:35.110> fishing<00:00:35.410> mono<00:00:35.559> for<00:00:35.769> 30<00:00:35.920> years<00:00:36.660> if<00:00:37.660> it's

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
of in fishing mono for 30 years if it's

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.570 
of in fishing mono for 30 years if it's
my<00:00:37.989> style<00:00:38.230> I'm<00:00:38.589> usually<00:00:38.710> finesse<00:00:39.129> I'm<00:00:39.460> usually

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
my style I'm usually finesse I'm usually

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.000 
my style I'm usually finesse I'm usually
trying<00:00:39.910> to<00:00:40.089> get<00:00:40.870> baits<00:00:41.080> to<00:00:41.320> run<00:00:41.500> shallower<00:00:41.920> and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
trying to get baits to run shallower and

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.240 
trying to get baits to run shallower and
all<00:00:42.129> that<00:00:43.019> don't<00:00:44.019> fish<00:00:44.199> flow<00:00:44.440> much<00:00:44.710> don't<00:00:45.100> fish

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
all that don't fish flow much don't fish

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.549 
all that don't fish flow much don't fish
braid<00:00:45.550> much<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.989> I'm<00:00:47.080> pretty<00:00:47.199> much<00:00:47.320> an<00:00:47.500> expert

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
braid much so I'm pretty much an expert

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.609 
braid much so I'm pretty much an expert
on<00:00:47.890> monitor<00:00:48.420> now<00:00:49.420> mono<00:00:49.660> is<00:00:49.930> a<00:00:50.170> really<00:00:50.500> good

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:50.619 
on monitor now mono is a really good

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:53.009 
on monitor now mono is a really good
line<00:00:50.799> and<00:00:51.129> it<00:00:51.489> is<00:00:51.519> a<00:00:51.970> really<00:00:52.510> really<00:00:52.629> strong

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
line and it is a really really strong

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.100 
line and it is a really really strong
line<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:54.250> drawback<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.850> it<00:00:55.600> absorbs<00:00:55.780> water

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
line the drawback is it absorbs water

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.820 
line the drawback is it absorbs water
and<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:57.760> is<00:00:57.940> affected<00:00:58.390> by<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:59.140> UV<00:00:59.379> rays<00:00:59.559> of<00:00:59.799> the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
and it is affected by the UV rays of the

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.090 
and it is affected by the UV rays of the
Sun<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.390> it's<00:01:01.510> very<00:01:01.690> important<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.260> know<00:01:02.379> when

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
Sun so it's very important to know when

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.690 
Sun so it's very important to know when
to<00:01:03.129> switch<00:01:03.460> out<00:01:03.699> your<00:01:04.059> mono<00:01:04.900> line<00:01:05.250> now<00:01:06.250> I<00:01:06.280> use

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
to switch out your mono line now I use

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.679 
to switch out your mono line now I use
in<00:01:06.909> fact<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.330> lobe<00:01:07.510> is<00:01:07.659> green<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:10.360> key<00:01:10.570> of

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
in fact the lobe is green but the key of

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:11.940 
in fact the lobe is green but the key of
wanting<00:01:10.900> to<00:01:10.930> switch<00:01:11.049> it<00:01:11.260> out<00:01:11.380> will<00:01:11.560> work<00:01:11.740> with

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
wanting to switch it out will work with

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.580 
wanting to switch it out will work with
any<00:01:12.490> color<00:01:12.700> line<00:01:12.909> and<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:14.140> is<00:01:14.320> when<00:01:14.560> it

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
any color line and that is when it

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.520 
any color line and that is when it
starts<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.010> get<00:01:15.220> light<00:01:15.430> I<00:01:16.170> will<00:01:17.170> show<00:01:17.380> you<00:01:17.439> a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
starts to get light I will show you a

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.030 
starts to get light I will show you a
picture<00:01:17.710> of<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:18.759> my<00:01:19.000> reels<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:20.350> one<00:01:20.830> on<00:01:20.950> the

fished three or four hours almost every
day<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.730> one<00:01:27.880> on<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.030> right<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.660> in<00:01:28.870> fact

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
day the one on the right is in fact

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.270 
day the one on the right is in fact
brand<00:01:30.100> new<00:01:30.190> line<00:01:30.370> that<00:01:30.640> I've<00:01:31.420> been<00:01:31.690> fished<00:01:31.900> yet

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
brand new line that I've been fished yet

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.200 
brand new line that I've been fished yet
now<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.340> can<00:01:33.520> see<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.760> difference<00:01:34.030> in<00:01:34.150> the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
now you can see the difference in the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.140 
now you can see the difference in the
color<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.560> left<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.220> lot<00:01:36.460> lighter<00:01:36.820> than

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
color on the left is a lot lighter than

rule<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:47.979> thumb<00:01:48.190> with<00:01:48.430> mono<00:01:49.240> line<00:01:49.530> it'll<00:01:50.530> work

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
rule of thumb with mono line it'll work

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.920 
rule of thumb with mono line it'll work
with<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:50.979> low<00:01:51.490> vis<00:01:51.670> it'll<00:01:52.060> work<00:01:52.180> with<00:01:52.360> clear

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
with the low vis it'll work with clear

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.290 
with the low vis it'll work with clear
or<00:01:53.229> clear<00:01:53.530> blue<00:01:53.770> or<00:01:53.890> whatever<00:01:54.010> but<00:01:54.430> what<00:01:55.180> you

start<00:01:55.540> seeing<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:55.930> getting<00:01:56.140> light<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:57.520> means

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
start seeing it getting light that means

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.520 
start seeing it getting light that means
it's<00:01:57.940> absorbed<00:01:58.330> some<00:01:58.479> water<00:01:58.720> it's<00:01:59.080> it's<00:01:59.320> got

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
it's absorbed some water it's it's got

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.130 
it's absorbed some water it's it's got
damaged<00:01:59.979> from<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.190> UV<00:02:00.460> rays<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:01.210> it's<00:02:01.870> a<00:02:01.960> lot

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
damaged from the UV rays and it's a lot

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.730 
damaged from the UV rays and it's a lot
weaker<00:02:02.320> than<00:02:02.620> it<00:02:02.830> originally<00:02:03.790> was<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:05.530> mono

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
weaker than it originally was this mono

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.770 
weaker than it originally was this mono
line<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.280> fact<00:02:06.460> very<00:02:06.700> strong<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.600> when<00:02:07.750> you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
line is in fact very strong and when you

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.630 
line is in fact very strong and when you
keep<00:02:08.049> it<00:02:08.170> fresh<00:02:08.379> trust<00:02:09.310> me

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
keep it fresh trust me

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.850 
keep it fresh trust me
I<00:02:09.670> put<00:02:10.569> fresh<00:02:10.720> line<00:02:10.959> on<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.260> get<00:02:11.349> snagged<00:02:11.590> and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
I put fresh line on and get snagged and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.619 
I put fresh line on and get snagged and
