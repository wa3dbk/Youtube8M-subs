so just make sure if you're gonna go

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.720 
so just make sure if you're gonna go
this<00:02:10.050> route<00:02:10.350> when<00:02:10.590> cutting<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.160> masking<00:02:11.580> off

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
this route when cutting and masking off

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.800 
this route when cutting and masking off
the<00:02:11.880> connector<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.330> don't<00:02:12.510> put<00:02:12.660> too<00:02:12.780> much

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the connector you don't put too much

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.900 
the connector you don't put too much
pressure<00:02:12.990> because<00:02:13.740> if<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.010> also<00:02:14.340> scratch<00:02:14.730> the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
pressure because if you also scratch the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.480 
pressure because if you also scratch the
connector<00:02:15.360> but<00:02:15.930> slice<00:02:16.140> into<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.830> might<00:02:17.310> not

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
connector but slice into it it might not

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.670 
connector but slice into it it might not
work<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:18.150> just<00:02:18.720> be<00:02:18.900> very<00:02:19.140> very<00:02:19.320> careful

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
work so just just be very very careful

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
can peel it off and retry the process so

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.870

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
it can be a permanent solution if we

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.890 
it can be a permanent solution if we
never<00:03:46.130> peel<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.580> off<00:03:46.730> so<00:03:47.000> that's<00:03:47.360> that's<00:03:47.780> why

rewards<00:04:49.810> cards<00:04:50.139> I'm<00:04:50.260> gonna<00:04:50.410> be<00:04:50.470> using<00:04:50.680> right

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
rewards cards I'm gonna be using right

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.710 
rewards cards I'm gonna be using right
here<00:04:51.040> I'm<00:04:51.430> gonna<00:04:51.580> go<00:04:51.730> ahead<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:51.940> scrape<00:04:52.389> it<00:04:52.600> on

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
here I'm gonna go ahead and scrape it on

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.800 
here I'm gonna go ahead and scrape it on
without<00:04:53.610> scratching<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.880> surface<00:04:55.270> of<00:04:55.630> my

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
without scratching the surface of my

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.330 
without scratching the surface of my
Plasti<00:04:56.290> Dip<00:04:56.320> that's<00:04:56.710> probably<00:04:56.980> gonna<00:04:57.130> be<00:04:57.250> the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
Plasti Dip that's probably gonna be the

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.070 
Plasti Dip that's probably gonna be the
hardest<00:04:57.370> part<00:04:57.940> but<00:04:58.120> it's<00:04:58.240> really<00:04:58.750> not<00:04:59.020> that

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
hardest part but it's really not that

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.710 
hardest part but it's really not that
difficult<00:04:59.500> so<00:05:00.100> right<00:05:00.880> here<00:05:01.150> looks<00:05:01.419> to<00:05:01.510> be

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
difficult so right here looks to be

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.530 
difficult so right here looks to be
about<00:05:01.870> Center<00:05:02.440> go<00:05:03.070> ahead<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:03.639> peel<00:05:03.910> off<00:05:04.150> the

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
about Center go ahead and peel off the

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.980 
about Center go ahead and peel off the
backing<00:05:04.990> application<00:05:05.919> to<00:05:06.220> of<00:05:06.490> my<00:05:06.720> decal<00:05:07.720> and

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
backing application to of my decal and

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.500 
backing application to of my decal and
then<00:05:08.590> I'm<00:05:08.680> going<00:05:08.979> to<00:05:09.040> simply<00:05:09.460> fold<00:05:10.330> that

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
then I'm going to simply fold that

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.540 
then I'm going to simply fold that
behind<00:05:10.960> and<00:05:11.410> we're<00:05:11.950> gonna<00:05:12.070> go<00:05:12.250> ahead<00:05:12.370> and

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
behind and we're gonna go ahead and

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.920 
behind and we're gonna go ahead and
replace<00:05:13.060> right<00:05:13.840> about<00:05:15.030> right<00:05:16.030> about<00:05:16.180> there<00:05:16.570> no

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
replace right about right about there no

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
the tech Johnson came up so I'm going to

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.129 
the tech Johnson came up so I'm going to
go<00:05:32.500> ahead<00:05:32.770> and<00:05:33.010> simply<00:05:33.729> peel<00:05:34.330> that<00:05:34.540> off<00:05:34.600> it's

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
go ahead and simply peel that off it's

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.560 
go ahead and simply peel that off it's
barely<00:05:35.380> even<00:05:35.530> placed<00:05:35.950> on<00:05:36.220> and<00:05:36.550> right<00:05:37.030> now<00:05:37.270> that

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
barely even placed on and right now that

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.350 
barely even placed on and right now that
everything<00:05:38.080> is<00:05:38.229> off<00:05:38.500> boom<00:05:39.220> the<00:05:39.700> tech<00:05:39.910> Johnson

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
everything is off boom the tech Johnson

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.950 
everything is off boom the tech Johnson
logo<00:05:40.720> is<00:05:40.930> now<00:05:41.140> on<00:05:41.350> the<00:05:41.470> center<00:05:41.770> of<00:05:41.890> my<00:05:42.039> SSD<00:05:42.960> not

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
logo is now on the center of my SSD not

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.230 
logo is now on the center of my SSD not
that<00:05:44.200> centered<00:05:44.620> though<00:05:44.800> so<00:05:45.310> maybe<00:05:46.000> have<00:05:46.180> a

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
that centered though so maybe have a

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.940 
that centered though so maybe have a
better<00:05:46.419> way<00:05:46.600> of<00:05:46.630> applying<00:05:46.960> your<00:05:47.320> decals<00:05:47.770> to

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
better way of applying your decals to

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.050 
better way of applying your decals to
make<00:05:48.100> them<00:05:48.220> a<00:05:48.310> little<00:05:48.370> more<00:05:48.580> centered<00:05:48.789> but<00:05:48.940> I

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
make them a little more centered but I

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.100 
make them a little more centered but I
think<00:05:49.240> that<00:05:49.330> looks<00:05:49.510> a<00:05:49.630> heck<00:05:49.810> of<00:05:49.870> a<00:05:49.960> lot<00:05:50.050> better

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
think that looks a heck of a lot better

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.590 
think that looks a heck of a lot better
so<00:05:50.830> let's<00:05:50.979> go<00:05:51.100> ahead<00:05:51.190> and<00:05:51.580> put<00:05:52.000> this<00:05:52.120> back<00:05:52.360> into

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
so let's go ahead and put this back into

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.029 
so let's go ahead and put this back into
the<00:05:52.750> case<00:05:52.780> and<00:05:53.289> let's<00:05:53.440> see<00:05:53.530> how<00:05:53.650> she<00:05:53.710> looks

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
the case and let's see how she looks

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.460 
the case and let's see how she looks
side<00:05:54.610> paneling<00:05:55.330> off<00:05:55.570> of<00:05:55.840> the<00:05:55.930> case<00:05:56.200> we're

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
side paneling off of the case we're

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.500 
side paneling off of the case we're
gonna<00:05:56.530> go<00:05:56.770> ahead<00:05:57.010> and<00:05:57.130> seat<00:05:57.490> the<00:05:57.520> SSD<00:05:58.210> where<00:05:58.390> it

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
gonna go ahead and seat the SSD where it

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.409 
gonna go ahead and seat the SSD where it
needs<00:05:58.690> to<00:05:58.810> be<00:05:58.919> then<00:05:59.919> we're<00:06:00.070> going<00:06:00.280> to<00:06:00.340> grab<00:06:01.180> our

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
needs to be then we're going to grab our

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.159 
needs to be then we're going to grab our
SSD<00:06:01.990> screws<00:06:02.500> and<00:06:03.120> we're<00:06:04.120> gonna<00:06:04.240> we're<00:06:05.080> gonna

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
SSD screws and we're gonna we're gonna

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.080 
SSD screws and we're gonna we're gonna
screw<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:06.010> SSD<00:06:08.610> sometimes<00:06:09.610> I<00:06:09.700> think<00:06:09.760> I'm
