this<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.049> mark<00:00:07.379> 1<00:00:07.589> Ford<00:00:07.919> Focus<00:00:08.460> in<00:00:08.639> which<00:00:09.210> the

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
this is a mark 1 Ford Focus in which the

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.600 
this is a mark 1 Ford Focus in which the
accelerator<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.080> not<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.620> standard<00:00:11.130> size<00:00:11.340> and

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610

not<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.150> standard<00:00:12.630> shape<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.710> why<00:00:13.830> we

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
not a standard shape and this is why we

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.160 
not a standard shape and this is why we
need<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.280> drill<00:00:14.549> these<00:00:14.700> pedals<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.269> just<00:00:15.990> use<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
need to drill these pedals on just use a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.410 
need to drill these pedals on just use a
screw<00:00:16.470> driver<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:17.070> unbolt<00:00:17.430> these<00:00:17.730> 5<00:00:18.000> screws

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
screw driver to unbolt these 5 screws

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.140 
screw driver to unbolt these 5 screws
remove<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.170> panel<00:00:19.520> just<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> screwdriver

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
remove the panel just get a screwdriver

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.070 
remove the panel just get a screwdriver
to<00:00:21.359> get<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.539> over<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> lip<00:00:26.689> next<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.810> need<00:00:27.960> to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
to get it over the lip next we need to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.290 
to get it over the lip next we need to
disconnect<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.680> accelerator<00:00:29.220> cable<00:00:29.460> from

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
disconnect the accelerator cable from

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.030 
disconnect the accelerator cable from
the<00:00:30.449> accelerator<00:00:30.869> pedal<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.500> pull<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the accelerator pedal just pull the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.209 
the accelerator pedal just pull the
cable<00:00:32.340> sideways<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.829> release<00:00:34.829> from<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
cable sideways and release from the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.930 
cable sideways and release from the
pedal<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:36.090> remove<00:00:36.450> these<00:00:36.690> three<00:00:37.110> nuts<00:00:37.850> it's<00:00:38.850> a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
pedal now remove these three nuts it's a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.190 
pedal now remove these three nuts it's a
10<00:00:39.120> millimeter<00:00:41.510> now<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.780> lift<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.050> pedal

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
10 millimeter now you can lift the pedal

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.940 
10 millimeter now you can lift the pedal
off<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:45.840> reason<00:00:46.110> why<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.440> remove<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
off the reason why we remove the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.040 
off the reason why we remove the
accelerator<00:00:47.399> pedal<00:00:47.550> not<00:00:48.420> only<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.780> make<00:00:48.930> it

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
accelerator pedal not only to make it

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.590 
accelerator pedal not only to make it
easier<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.379> drill<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.920> also<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> avoid<00:00:51.210> hitting

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
easier to drill is also to avoid hitting

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.869 
easier to drill is also to avoid hitting
some<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.110> cross<00:00:52.350> members<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.579> pedal

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
some of the cross members in the pedal

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.400 
some of the cross members in the pedal
which<00:00:54.000> give<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> strength<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.260> we're

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
which give it the strength so we're

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.770 
which give it the strength so we're
going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> try<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> line<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.309> two<00:00:56.550> holes<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
going to try to line up two holes to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.080 
going to try to line up two holes to
avoid<00:00:58.079> these<00:00:58.320> areas<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.039> what<00:00:59.850> we're<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
avoid these areas so what we're going to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.760 
avoid these areas so what we're going to
do<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.420> take<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.719> aftermarket<00:01:01.170> pedal<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
do is take the aftermarket pedal and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.549 
do is take the aftermarket pedal and
line<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.520> accelerator<00:01:03.059> pedal

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
line it up with the accelerator pedal

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.620 
line it up with the accelerator pedal
mark<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.040> accelerator<00:01:05.489> pedal<00:01:05.700> areas

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
mark on the accelerator pedal areas

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.990 
mark on the accelerator pedal areas
which<00:01:06.869> avoid<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> cross<00:01:07.590> members<00:01:08.040> next<00:01:08.790> we

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
which avoid the cross members next we

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.550 
which avoid the cross members next we
need<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.240> select<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.659> drill<00:01:09.990> bit<00:01:10.140> which<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
need to select a drill bit which is the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.440 
need to select a drill bit which is the
same<00:01:10.830> size<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.280> screw<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:12.060> are<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.360> to
