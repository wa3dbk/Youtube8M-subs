blue<00:00:14.519> tile<00:00:14.849> which<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.480> talked<00:00:15.660> about<00:00:15.690> last<00:00:15.960> time

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
blue tile which I talked about last time

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.250 
blue tile which I talked about last time
I<00:00:16.730> think<00:00:17.730> they<00:00:17.940> use<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> same<00:00:18.270> high<00:00:18.630> keys<00:00:18.930> here

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
I think they use the same high keys here

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.160 
I think they use the same high keys here
but<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.189> inspired<00:00:20.699> by<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.420> that's

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
but this is inspired by that so that's

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.050 
but this is inspired by that so that's
pretty<00:00:22.439> much<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> same<00:00:23.070> thing<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.640> can't<00:00:23.880> all

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
pretty much the same thing you can't all

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.779 
pretty much the same thing you can't all
your<00:00:24.420> windows<00:00:25.130> they<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.250> different<00:00:26.460> modes

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
your windows they have different modes

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.810 
your windows they have different modes
here<00:00:27.000> i<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> vertical<00:00:28.470> trial<00:00:28.740> mode<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
here i have the vertical trial mode the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.519 
here i have the vertical trial mode the
floating<00:00:30.210> one<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.449> like<00:00:30.630> normally<00:00:31.289> how<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
floating one is like normally how you

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.250 
floating one is like normally how you
would<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:33.210> then<00:00:33.390> horizontal<00:00:34.110> you

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
would have it and then horizontal you

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.860 
would have it and then horizontal you
can<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.620> from<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:36.149> extension

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
can do that from here to this extension

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.950 
can do that from here to this extension
they<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.890> click<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.390> right<00:00:39.390> so

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
they have you can click on it right so

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.810 
they have you can click on it right so
for<00:00:40.379> example<00:00:40.410> let's<00:00:41.540> say<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.660> open<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:43.020> few

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
for example let's say we open a few

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.529 
for example let's say we open a few
stuff<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.059> these<00:00:45.420> pad<00:00:45.690> or<00:00:46.700> you<00:00:47.700> know<00:00:47.850> home

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
stuff like these pad or you know home

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.900 
stuff like these pad or you know home
folder<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.110> right<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.190> how<00:00:50.309> floating

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
folder here right this is how floating

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.299 
folder here right this is how floating
would<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.719> normal<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.920> when

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
would be like it just normal but when

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.680 
would be like it just normal but when
you<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:54.440> save<00:00:55.440> vertical<00:00:55.980> here<00:00:56.510> it<00:00:57.510> will<00:00:57.629> be

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
you do save vertical here it will be

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.540 
you do save vertical here it will be
laid<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.070> open<00:00:59.340> more

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
laid it out like that and you open more

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.549 
laid it out like that and you open more
programs<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.629> should<00:01:01.620> add<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:04.379> layout

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
programs it should add it to the layout

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.630 
programs it should add it to the layout
so<00:01:05.250> as<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.760> close<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.860> maximize<00:01:07.860> or<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.520> know

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
so as you close and maximize or you know

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.380 
so as you close and maximize or you know
get<00:01:08.909> rid<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.060> programs<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.000> actually

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
get rid of programs you can actually

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.170 
get rid of programs you can actually
tolerate<00:01:12.960> automatically<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.970> i<00:01:15.060> said

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
tolerate automatically and like i said

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.280 
tolerate automatically and like i said
they<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.390> different<00:01:15.659> modes<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.080> right<00:01:16.259> now

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
they have different modes so right now

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.770 
they have different modes so right now
we're<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.680> vertical<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.420> flooding

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
we're in the vertical and the flooding

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.270 
we're in the vertical and the flooding
one<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.990> normal<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.650> then<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
one is normal and then you have the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.340 
one is normal and then you have the
horizontal<00:01:21.030> one<00:01:21.150> here<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.049> don't<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.259> to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
horizontal one here so you don't have to

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.380 
horizontal one here so you don't have to
use<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
use this one here to do it you can

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.090 
use this one here to do it you can
actually<00:01:24.509> use<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.900> high<00:01:25.020> key<00:01:25.259> right<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:25.979> is

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
actually use the high key right now is

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.899 
actually use the high key right now is
ctrl<00:01:26.610> G<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.390> switch<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:29.040> horizontal<00:01:29.250> one

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
ctrl G to switch to the horizontal one

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.200 
ctrl G to switch to the horizontal one
alright<00:01:30.380> but<00:01:31.380> wouldn't<00:01:31.740> use<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> vertical<00:01:32.909> for

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
alright but wouldn't use a vertical for

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.109 
alright but wouldn't use a vertical for
this<00:01:33.920> they<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.189> some<00:01:35.369> other<00:01:35.490> high<00:01:35.790> keys

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
this they do have some other high keys

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.940 
this they do have some other high keys
to<00:01:37.100> switch<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.280> around<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.259> windows<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.680> tab

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
to switch it around so windows and tab

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.580 
to switch it around so windows and tab
key<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.670> move<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.360> next<00:01:42.509> window<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.439> right

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
key is to move to next window so right

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.109 
key is to move to next window so right
now<00:01:43.619> we're<00:01:43.860> working<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.430> web<00:01:44.850> browser
