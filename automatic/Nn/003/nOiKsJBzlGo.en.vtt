2012 based on innovations 5 by 5 is no
them<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.880> most<00:00:18.090> compact<00:00:18.920> yeah<00:00:19.920> that's<00:00:20.310> not

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
them the most compact yeah that's not

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.130 
them the most compact yeah that's not
actually<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:22.020> way<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:24.140> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
actually this one way this is just the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.290 
actually this one way this is just the
actually<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.949> best<00:00:26.130> version<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.699> but

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
actually the best version we have but

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.529 
actually the best version we have but
it's<00:00:28.289> about<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.769> box<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.330> let's<00:00:30.330> see<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
it's about the box and let's see it

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:40.670 
it's about the box and let's see it
opening

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.350 

yeah<00:00:41.680> so<00:00:42.129> it's<00:00:42.309> really<00:00:42.550> quick<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.899> you<00:00:44.050> can<00:00:44.109> see

yeah so it's really quick as you can see
and<00:00:46.680> yeah<00:00:47.680> it's<00:00:47.920> seamless<00:00:48.190> of<00:00:48.909> course<00:00:49.949> and

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
and yeah it's seamless of course and

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.759 
and yeah it's seamless of course and

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
yeah let's see if closing should i press

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:04.009 
yeah let's see if closing should i press
I<00:01:01.350> increase<00:01:02.350> this<00:01:02.559> Pearson's<00:01:03.070> other<00:01:03.219> side

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
I increase this Pearson's other side

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.149 
I increase this Pearson's other side
goodbye<00:01:05.019> ah<00:01:05.610> yeah<00:01:06.610> so<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.420> wiring<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.830> third

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
goodbye ah yeah so the wiring this third

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.630 
goodbye ah yeah so the wiring this third
place<00:01:09.460> is<00:01:10.440> right<00:01:11.440> there<00:01:11.710> it's<00:01:11.950> all<00:01:12.100> good<00:01:12.280> these

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
place is right there it's all good these

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.359 
place is right there it's all good these
like<00:01:13.270> it's<00:01:13.600> not<00:01:13.750> it's<00:01:14.530> look<00:01:14.770> at<00:01:14.860> this<00:01:14.979> version

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
like it's not it's look at this version

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.779 
like it's not it's look at this version
stuff<00:01:15.670> because<00:01:15.970> sara<00:01:16.210> is<00:01:16.360> just<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.840> redstone<00:01:17.789> so

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
stuff because sara is just a redstone so

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.800 
stuff because sara is just a redstone so
is<00:01:19.420> 410<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.259> so<00:01:20.590> it's<00:01:20.770> 5<00:01:21.990> 105<00:01:22.990> long<00:01:23.259> and<00:01:23.530> 10

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
is 410 and so it's 5 105 long and 10

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.309 
is 410 and so it's 5 105 long and 10
plus<00:01:25.810> 5y<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.380> temple<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.729> 20<00:01:28.509> home<00:01:28.690> play<00:01:28.899> well

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
plus 5y the temple and 20 home play well

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:33.240 
plus 5y the temple and 20 home play well
this<00:01:29.590> version<00:01:29.799> is<00:01:30.009> 25<00:01:30.630> yeah<00:01:31.679> it's<00:01:32.679> very<00:01:33.009> very

this version is 25 yeah it's very very

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.880 
this version is 25 yeah it's very very
reliable<00:01:33.789> it<00:01:34.000> works<00:01:34.270> almost<00:01:34.869> everywhere<00:01:35.590> and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
reliable it works almost everywhere and

reliable it works almost everywhere and
in<00:01:36.130> all<00:01:36.250> directions<00:01:36.399> and<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:38.110> course<00:01:38.170> it

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
in all directions and of course it

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.649 
in all directions and of course it

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
see when it's a well we have tutorial no

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.990 
see when it's a well we have tutorial no
well<00:01:56.320> yes<00:01:56.469> way<00:01:56.710> yeah<00:01:57.189> but<00:01:57.430> this<00:01:57.640> is<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
well yes way yeah but this is the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.370 
well yes way yeah but this is the
possible<00:01:58.479> portion<00:01:58.899> if<00:01:59.200> we<00:01:59.409> fly<00:01:59.920> over<00:02:00.250> here

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
possible portion if we fly over here

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.969 
possible portion if we fly over here
there<00:02:02.380> is<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:02.890> porcupine<00:02:03.609> portion<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:05.289> God

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
there is a porcupine portion and God

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:14.789 
there is a porcupine portion and God
joint<00:02:11.730> from<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.910> game<00:02:13.090> regarding<00:02:13.840> okay<00:02:14.560> but

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
joint from the game regarding okay but

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.259 
joint from the game regarding okay but
this<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:18.070> actually<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.700> most<00:02:18.910> compact

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
this is the actually the most compact

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.160 
this is the actually the most compact
one<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:20.190> 550<00:02:21.190> +<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.600> first<00:02:22.870> type<00:02:23.140> of

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
one this is 550 + so the first type of

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.319 
one this is 550 + so the first type of
500,000<00:02:24.160> plugs<00:02:24.400> yeah<00:02:25.859> yeah<00:02:26.859> we<00:02:27.220> made<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:27.579> 90

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
500,000 plugs yeah yeah we made this 90

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.150 
500,000 plugs yeah yeah we made this 90
high<00:02:28.510> instead<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.320> 20<00:02:30.480> yeah<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:33.040> is

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
high instead of 20 yeah so this is

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.190 
high instead of 20 yeah so this is
actually<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.579> most<00:02:33.609> compact<00:02:34.209> but<00:02:34.569> we<00:02:34.870> haven't

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
actually the most compact but we haven't

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.520 
actually the most compact but we haven't
tested<00:02:35.380> its<00:02:35.799> reliability<00:02:36.459> yes<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.359> it's<00:02:38.290> just

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
tested its reliability yes and it's just

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.800 
tested its reliability yes and it's just
a<00:02:38.650> little<00:02:38.829> bit<00:02:39.010> slower<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.730> stuff<00:02:40.630> like<00:02:40.750> that

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
a little bit slower and stuff like that

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.809 
a little bit slower and stuff like that
it<00:02:41.109> actually<00:02:41.350> takes<00:02:41.769> more<00:02:42.040> redstone<00:02:42.250> than<00:02:42.670> the

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
it actually takes more redstone than the

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.150 
it actually takes more redstone than the
other<00:02:42.940> one<00:02:44.819> yes<00:02:46.019> it's<00:02:47.019> reliable<00:02:47.769> then<00:02:47.979> we'll

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
other one yes it's reliable then we'll

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.820 
other one yes it's reliable then we'll
release

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
release

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.310 
release
just<00:02:49.310> wanted<00:02:50.710> it's<00:02:51.710> true<00:02:51.980> yeah<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.480> well

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
just wanted it's true yeah and well

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.810 
just wanted it's true yeah and well
actually<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.860> detection<00:02:55.250> pretty<00:02:55.580> nice

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
actually the detection pretty nice

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.850 
actually the detection pretty nice
because<00:02:56.240> it's<00:02:56.480> actually<00:02:57.110> more<00:02:57.320> in<00:02:57.440> sync<00:02:57.800> than

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
because it's actually more in sync than

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.700 
because it's actually more in sync than
the<00:02:58.130> other<00:02:58.280> one<00:02:58.550> but<00:02:59.060> we<00:02:59.780> don't<00:03:00.140> know<00:03:00.410> if<00:03:00.560> it's

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
the other one but we don't know if it's

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.160 
the other one but we don't know if it's
reliable<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.520> or<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.480> works<00:03:02.750> in<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.050> other

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
reliable and or it works in the other
