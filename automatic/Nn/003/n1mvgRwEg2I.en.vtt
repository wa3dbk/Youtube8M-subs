plasticity exhibit here at science
museum<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.290> london<00:00:55.820> as<00:00:56.820> an<00:00:57.059> example<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.719> an

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
museum in london as an example of an

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.290 
museum in london as an example of an
application<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.680> plastics<00:00:59.160> machine<00:00:59.969> itself

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
application of plastics machine itself

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.689 
application of plastics machine itself
is<00:01:00.540> made<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.900> acrylic<00:01:01.050> sheets<00:01:01.699> snap

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
is made out of acrylic sheets snap

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.820 
is made out of acrylic sheets snap
together<00:01:02.909> so<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.839> a<00:01:03.930> very<00:01:03.960> sort<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.470> i<00:01:04.619> think

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
together so it's a very sort of i think

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.100 
together so it's a very sort of i think
is<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:05.070> attractive<00:01:05.399> use<00:01:06.149> of<00:01:06.390> plastics<00:01:06.899> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
is very attractive use of plastics and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.630 
is very attractive use of plastics and
it's<00:01:07.470> also<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.740> machine<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.250> build

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
it's also a machine that can build

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.580 
it's also a machine that can build
objects<00:01:09.119> out<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.390> plastic<00:01:09.810> surface<00:01:10.350> it's

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
objects out of plastic surface it's

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.550 
objects out of plastic surface it's
using<00:01:10.979> epoxy<00:01:11.250> zor<00:01:11.850> using<00:01:12.409> something<00:01:13.409> like

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
using epoxy zor using something like

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.660 
using epoxy zor using something like
superglue<00:01:14.270> call<00:01:15.270> acrylic<00:01:15.659> glue<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:17.640> can

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
superglue call acrylic glue you can

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.249 
superglue call acrylic glue you can
build<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.149> three-dimensional<00:01:18.780> objects<00:01:19.110> by

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
build up three-dimensional objects by

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.520 
build up three-dimensional objects by
depositing<00:01:19.770> material<00:01:19.920> layer<00:01:20.550> by<00:01:20.759> layer<00:01:20.789> and

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
depositing material layer by layer and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.249 
depositing material layer by layer and
so<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.679> both<00:01:22.920> an<00:01:23.429> application<00:01:24.149> of<00:01:24.420> plastics

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
so it's both an application of plastics

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.800 
so it's both an application of plastics
and<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.920> device<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.910> can<00:01:27.210> build<00:01:27.390> plastic

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and a device that can build plastic

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.330 
and a device that can build plastic
we're<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.649> on<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.039> verge<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.700> having<00:01:30.330> people

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
we're just on the verge of having people

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.529 
we're just on the verge of having people
complete<00:01:32.340> enough<00:01:32.580> machines<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:33.149> we<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.360> see

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
complete enough machines that we can see

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.499 
complete enough machines that we can see
something<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.259> building<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.850> I've<00:01:36.060> done

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
something that building so I've done

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
something that building so I've done
most<00:01:36.690> of<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.899> building<00:01:37.259> myself<00:01:37.409> thus<00:01:38.070> far<00:01:38.310> but

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
most of the building myself thus far but

there's a couple of doctors in Innsbruck
Austria<00:02:06.510> who<00:02:07.410> built<00:02:07.890> their<00:02:08.070> own<00:02:08.100> machine<00:02:08.460> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
Austria who built their own machine and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.920 
Austria who built their own machine and
they're<00:02:08.820> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> use<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.210> to<00:02:09.330> make<00:02:09.450> surgical

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
they're going to use it to make surgical

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.350 
they're going to use it to make surgical
models<00:02:10.290> so<00:02:10.830> they<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.100> kind<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.370> do<00:02:12.060> some

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
models so they can kind of do some

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.280 
models so they can kind of do some
pre-surgical<00:02:12.960> studies<00:02:14.900> there's<00:02:15.900> an<00:02:16.080> art

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290

variety of materials just for her her
own<00:02:24.830> research<00:02:25.280> room<00:02:25.550> states

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.590 

right<00:02:29.950> now<00:02:30.100> but<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.460> objects<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.120> make<00:02:31.330> are

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
right now but the objects I make are

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.640 
right now but the objects I make are
typically<00:02:34.470> demonstrations<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.560> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
typically demonstrations of the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.800 
typically demonstrations of the
capability<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:36.130> machine<00:02:36.460> so<00:02:36.850> for<00:02:37.240> me<00:02:37.360> it's

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
capability of machine so for me it's

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.390 
capability of machine so for me it's
been<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:38.140> little<00:02:38.320> bit<00:02:38.500> tricky<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:38.800> be<00:02:39.160> very

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
been a little bit tricky to be very

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.370 
been a little bit tricky to be very
creative<00:02:39.810> because<00:02:40.810> I'm<00:02:40.930> always<00:02:41.140> been

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
creative because I'm always been

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.020 
creative because I'm always been
concerned<00:02:41.680> about<00:02:41.860> showing<00:02:42.400> people<00:02:42.430> what<00:02:42.820> they

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
concerned about showing people what they

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.330 
concerned about showing people what they
do<00:02:43.890> instead<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:44.920> spending<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.060> lot<00:02:46.210> of<00:02:46.240> time

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
do instead of spending a lot of time

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.940 
do instead of spending a lot of time
just<00:02:47.790> letting<00:02:48.030> my<00:02:48.120> imagination<00:02:48.590> but<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.650> built

radio<00:04:07.440> collars<00:04:07.890> for<00:04:08.430> cheap<00:04:09.420> actually<00:04:09.840> what

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
radio collars for cheap actually what

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.080 
radio collars for cheap actually what

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
they call it as I'm cell phone and so

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.409 
they call it as I'm cell phone and so
that<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.540> sheep<00:04:16.410> owner<00:04:16.620> can<00:04:17.209> track<00:04:18.209> the
