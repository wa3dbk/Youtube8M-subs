00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hello to you again this maxim 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.670
 master us put out after so much 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.500
 months when my last video came out 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.199
 but nothing just get under split I already 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.960
 not new and releasing them becomes 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.670
 stupid and pointless but still i'm trying 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.990
 really trying to come up with some 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.240
 fresh idea execute breaking the idea that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.560
 we are such that everyone enjoyed watching 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.890
 but as long as long as is necessary to remove and letsplei 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.280
 i want to play wolking dead 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.469
 because it is coming soon 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.980
 the second part of this game I didn't play 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.610
 first as so I think it is better to go 1 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.300
 that somehow understand the meaning of this game understand 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.030
 plot 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.489
 it is exactly the mechanics of the game, I still think 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.140
 part will be very similar to the first and she 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.640
 will be no worse all the more come out 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.809
 sixth episode 400 days saving it 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.619
 will go to arrange the issue of ocenden 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.799
 and actually I want you 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.140
 written in the comments 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.939
 would you like to see my passage 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.670
 with my options because I know what 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.290
 the plot is nonlinear 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.930
 for five episodes I don't know 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.450
 How much will it be in the series ? 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.590
 Thirty-five pieces so it will come out minutes 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.090
 20 each 25 years old so approximately 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.250
 write your comments would 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.560
 to see or not because probably 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.270
 half have already looked at somebody 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.610
 channels so what do you want me to write though 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.500
 even for 1 person but do not take off 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.579
 it will be nice yet I appeared 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.280
 small little idea 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.090
 I will release the information of this month one video 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.070
 Well, I think but they will be cool but about it 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.799
 I will say nothing to the former and still forgot to say 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.719
 we are exactly 500 thank you very much 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.549
 that stay with me on the channel all this 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.549
