00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.940 
right now because I haven't thrown
anything<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.020> max<00:01:31.320> enchantment

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
anything in and the max enchantment

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.100 
anything in and the max enchantment
level<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.340> 50<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> max<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.540> go<00:01:33.689> up<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.810> is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
level is 50 so the max I can go up to is

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.200 
level is 50 so the max I can go up to is
50<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.860> wanted<00:01:35.100> sharpness<00:01:35.520> 5<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.000> for

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
50 so if I wanted sharpness 5 and for

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.359 
50 so if I wanted sharpness 5 and for
example<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.780> see<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.110> smite<00:01:37.500> smite<00:01:37.740> in

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
example you can see that smite smite in

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.149 
example you can see that smite smite in
bane<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.909> arthropods<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.740> fades<00:01:40.950> out

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
bane of arthropods kind of fades out

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.090 
bane of arthropods kind of fades out
because<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.759> actually<00:01:41.909> not<00:01:42.450> use

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
because you can actually not use

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.469 
because you can actually not use
sharpness<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.369> smite<00:01:44.790> or<00:01:45.000> any<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.329> these

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
sharpness and smite or any of these

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.380 
sharpness and smite or any of these
together<00:01:45.869> which<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.590> kind<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.100> weird<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:48.000> yeah

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
together which is kind of weird but yeah

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.060 
together which is kind of weird but yeah
so<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.750> example<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.259> want<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.590> throw<00:01:49.799> up<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
so for example if I want to throw up and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.920 
so for example if I want to throw up and
knock<00:01:50.250> back<00:01:50.520> all<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> way<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.420> knock<00:01:51.720> back

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
knock back all the way up to knock back

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.880 
knock back all the way up to knock back
to<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.470> fire<00:01:52.710> aspect<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.320> looting<00:01:55.320> 3

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
to you and fire aspect to and looting 3

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.190 
to you and fire aspect to and looting 3
and<00:01:56.189> unbreaking<00:01:56.880> 3<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.899> see<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.170> e

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and unbreaking 3 you can see the e

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.620 
and unbreaking 3 you can see the e
enchantment<00:01:58.920> cost<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.310> 93<00:01:59.820> in<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.000> maxes<00:02:00.450> jam

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
enchantment cost is 93 in the maxes jam

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.300 
enchantment cost is 93 in the maxes jam
the<00:02:00.780> level<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.110> 5000<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.619> don't<00:02:01.979> know<00:02:02.070> if<00:02:02.159> that's

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the level is 5000 I don't know if that's

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.530 
the level is 5000 I don't know if that's
a<00:02:02.399> glitch<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:02.939> let's<00:02:03.090> see<00:02:03.180> if<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.420> enchant

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
a glitch but let's see if I can enchant

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.810 
a glitch but let's see if I can enchant
it<00:02:03.840> oh<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.990> actually<00:02:04.259> can't<00:02:04.590> enchant<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.790> uh

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
it oh I actually can't enchant it so uh

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.940 
it oh I actually can't enchant it so uh
yeah<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.479> guess<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.960> max<00:02:07.229> enchantment<00:02:07.920> level

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
yeah I guess the max enchantment level

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.529 
yeah I guess the max enchantment level
thing<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.640> don't<00:02:08.700> know<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.090> might<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.360> for

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
thing I don't know that might be for

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.520 
thing I don't know that might be for
something<00:02:09.720> different<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.349> see<00:02:10.500> I

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
something different but you can see I

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.619 
something different but you can see I
have<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:10.950> super<00:02:11.459> Opie<00:02:11.819> sword<00:02:12.150> now<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.540> it

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
have this super Opie sword now that it

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:12.920 
have this super Opie sword now that it
cost

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
cost

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.599 
cost
I<00:02:12.959> mean<00:02:13.079> 92<00:02:13.560> levels<00:02:13.890> buy<00:02:14.040> them<00:02:14.189> in<00:02:14.280> creative

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:14.609 
I mean 92 levels buy them in creative

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.009 
I mean 92 levels buy them in creative
mode<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.969> it<00:02:15.090> doesn't<00:02:15.359> really<00:02:15.480> matter<00:02:15.719> now

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
mode so it doesn't really matter now

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.569 
mode so it doesn't really matter now
you're<00:02:16.439> probably<00:02:16.620> wondering<00:02:17.040> how<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.310> heck

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
you're probably wondering how the heck

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.459 
you're probably wondering how the heck
do<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.819> craft<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:18.359> thing<00:02:18.599> well<00:02:18.840> there's<00:02:19.290> two

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
do you craft this thing well there's two

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.619 
do you craft this thing well there's two
ways<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.769> craft<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.129> can<00:02:20.280> actually<00:02:20.640> craft<00:02:21.329> the

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
ways to craft you can actually craft the

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.479 
ways to craft you can actually craft the
whole<00:02:21.989> table<00:02:22.409> itself<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.129> by<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.250> way<00:02:23.400> the

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
whole table itself and by the way the

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.610 
whole table itself and by the way the
crafting<00:02:23.879> recipes<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.689> will<00:02:24.870> throw<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
crafting recipes I will throw on the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.530 
crafting recipes I will throw on the
screen<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.579> can<00:02:26.609> craft<00:02:26.909> the<00:02:27.060> whole<00:02:27.180> table

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
screen you can craft the whole table

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.110 
screen you can craft the whole table
itself<00:02:27.900> or<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:28.829> you<00:02:28.950> already<00:02:29.069> have<00:02:29.250> crafted<00:02:29.969> a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
itself or if you already have crafted a

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.699 
itself or if you already have crafted a
normal<00:02:30.569> enchantment<00:02:31.079> table<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.349> can<00:02:31.469> craft

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
normal enchantment table you can craft

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.800 
normal enchantment table you can craft
this<00:02:31.950> little<00:02:32.250> table<00:02:32.430> upgrade<00:02:33.000> thing<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.420> you

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
this little table upgrade thing and you

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.619 
this little table upgrade thing and you
can<00:02:33.959> go<00:02:34.079> up<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.500> shift<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:36.209> can<00:02:36.359> click

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
can go up to it shift and you can click

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.720 
can go up to it shift and you can click
it<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.260> turns<00:02:37.560> into<00:02:37.829> one<00:02:38.159> which<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.519> pretty

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
it and it turns into one which is pretty

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.280 
it and it turns into one which is pretty
cool<00:02:38.909> so<00:02:39.090> there's<00:02:39.239> two<00:02:39.420> ways<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.629> can<00:02:39.930> kind<00:02:40.139> of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
cool so there's two ways you can kind of

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.959 
cool so there's two ways you can kind of
make<00:02:40.469> it<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:41.099> craft<00:02:41.310> tables<00:02:41.700> or<00:02:41.909> the

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
make it and the craft tables or the

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.000 
make it and the craft tables or the
crafting<00:02:42.359> recipes<00:02:42.750> will<00:02:43.530> probably<00:02:43.859> already

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
crafting recipes will probably already

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.170 
crafting recipes will probably already
on<00:02:44.219> your<00:02:44.370> screen<00:02:44.579> so<00:02:44.909> same<00:02:45.810> goes<00:02:46.079> for<00:02:46.109> um

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
on your screen so same goes for um

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.220 
on your screen so same goes for um
diamond<00:02:48.180> chess<00:02:48.389> place<00:02:48.629> if<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.840> want<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.079> throw

diamond chess place if you want to throw

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.599 
diamond chess place if you want to throw
a<00:02:49.290> diamond<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:49.560> put<00:02:49.919> it<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.129> there<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.400> course

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
a diamond just put it in there of course

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.610 
a diamond just put it in there of course
the<00:02:51.169> enchantments<00:02:52.169> are<00:02:52.260> going<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.530> be

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the enchantments are going to be

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.409 
the enchantments are going to be
different<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.010> like<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.370> was<00:02:53.519> saying<00:02:53.730> with<00:02:54.359> the

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
different and like I was saying with the

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.319 
different and like I was saying with the
non<00:02:55.290> vanilla<00:02:56.060> enchantments<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.180> can

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
non vanilla enchantments you can

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.690 
non vanilla enchantments you can
actually<00:02:57.540> throw<00:02:58.019> in<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.980> mod<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.669> adds

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700
