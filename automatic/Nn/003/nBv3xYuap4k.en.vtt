00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.389
 thank you very much, good evening, I am very 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.789
 foolish when making decisions when I'm 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.080
 in times of danger 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.910
 the other day I was walking megan 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.920
 to hunt 2 mid-block the means and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.740
 obanos I do run I do that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.300
 I cross streets I use case 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.720
 I see in the face and I'm saying even 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.189
 Street 1 we can tune stations 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.140
 They are from horror movies 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.610
 where protagonists take these 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.559
 stupid decisions for example are 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.180
 chasing with a chainsaw type 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.750
 tower to close the door and leans 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.750
 white comes with the chainsaw 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.500
 this pay to put puts me in the 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.730
 little chain they open the door and it appears that 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.290
 It's going to be a rug on your forehead 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.200
 the best are those that are thrown down 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.620
 of the bed is pulled down on the bed with 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.620
 the chainsaw 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.519
 but I do not want to hook the bedspread 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:13.320
 dollar 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:16.219
 but that's why I said I'm very scathing and 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.710
 time to draw my blood and I am also 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:23.149

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.149

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:32.040
 the first time he tells me if you sit there 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.510

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.880
 that happiness in me is a problem 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.770
 for my partner more than anything we can not 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.000

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.920

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.020
