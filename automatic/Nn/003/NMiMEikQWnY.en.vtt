anything like that and it sticks out so

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.830 
anything like that and it sticks out so
there's<00:01:34.079> plenty<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.470> clearance<00:01:35.360> for<00:01:36.360> using<00:01:36.720> it

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
there's plenty of clearance for using it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.600 
there's plenty of clearance for using it
to<00:01:37.049> grind<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.650> knives<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:40.320> pads<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:41.100> just

sandpaper I get them at flea markets and
places<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.810> it's<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.930> roll<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.619> know

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
places like that it's a roll you know

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.679 
places like that it's a roll you know
that<00:01:49.829> looks<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.689> probably

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that looks like this this is probably

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.899 
that looks like this this is probably
half<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.320> size<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.189> was<00:01:53.369> when<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> bought

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.289 
half the size that it was when I bought
it<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.780> think<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.560> paid<00:01:55.770> $5.00<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:57.030> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
it I think I paid $5.00 for that and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.770 
it I think I paid $5.00 for that and
then<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.979> know<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.520> cut<00:02:00.149> them<00:02:00.360> out<00:02:00.479> like

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
then you know you just cut them out like

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.959 
then you know you just cut them out like
this<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> course<00:02:01.740> or<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.640> can<00:02:02.790> see

noise<00:02:23.440> it's<00:02:24.430> really<00:02:24.820> smooth<00:02:25.360> when<00:02:25.780> it

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
noise it's really smooth when it

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.130 
noise it's really smooth when it
operates<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:28.210> can<00:02:28.390> do<00:02:28.570> a<00:02:28.840> lot<00:02:29.110> of

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
operates and you can do a lot of

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.810 
operates and you can do a lot of
different<00:02:29.500> kinds<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.740> grinding<00:02:30.130> on<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.460> I've

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820

it's flat ground this knife could be

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.890 
it's flat ground this knife could be
made<00:04:20.080> entirely<00:04:20.890> on<00:04:21.310> that<00:04:21.370> little<00:04:22.030> grinder<00:04:22.690> it

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
made entirely on that little grinder it

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.170 
made entirely on that little grinder it
would<00:04:23.080> take<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.470> little<00:04:23.650> more<00:04:23.860> time<00:04:24.090> start<00:04:25.090> out

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
would take a little more time start out

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.560 
would take a little more time start out
with<00:04:25.360> you<00:04:25.600> know<00:04:25.720> heavy<00:04:25.930> coarse<00:04:26.229> grit
