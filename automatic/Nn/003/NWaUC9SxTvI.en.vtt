00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.550 
later and the pool pump so 1600 gallon
per<00:02:35.160> hour<00:02:36.320> now<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.350> put<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.769> white<00:02:38.040> mouth<00:02:38.310> on<00:02:38.580> this

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
per hour now I put a white mouth on this

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.410 
per hour now I put a white mouth on this
because<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.830> read<00:02:41.040> online<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.459> somewhere

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
because I read online that somewhere

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.780 
because I read online that somewhere
that<00:02:42.750> it's<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:44.010> would<00:02:44.160> be<00:02:44.280> good<00:02:44.580> but

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
that it's a that it would be good but

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.220 
that it's a that it would be good but
the<00:02:44.910> problem<00:02:45.300> with<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.690> because<00:02:45.870> these

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
the problem with it is because these

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.670 
the problem with it is because these
pools<00:02:47.420> going<00:02:48.420> an<00:02:48.630> angle<00:02:49.140> from<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.500> top

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
pools going an angle from the top

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.470 
pools going an angle from the top
because<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.190> moves<00:02:50.519> back<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.150> forth<00:02:51.390> like

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
because this moves back and forth like

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.600 
because this moves back and forth like
this<00:02:51.870> okay<00:02:52.350> they<00:02:52.530> have<00:02:52.650> an<00:02:52.769> angle<00:02:53.100> they<00:02:53.250> tend

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
this okay they have an angle they tend

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.360 
this okay they have an angle they tend
to<00:02:53.730> lean<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:55.230> white<00:02:55.470> mouth<00:02:55.739> doesn't<00:02:56.190> work

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
to lean in the white mouth doesn't work

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.630 
to lean in the white mouth doesn't work
as<00:02:56.579> good<00:02:56.640> as<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.060> should<00:02:58.070> you<00:02:59.070> have<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.459> keep

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
as good as this should you have to keep

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.580 
as good as this should you have to keep
the<00:03:00.480> water<00:03:01.640> above<00:03:02.640> popping<00:03:03.510> under<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.230> mouth

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
the water above popping under the mouth

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.340 
the water above popping under the mouth
and<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.760> doesn't<00:03:06.060> suck<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.450> water<00:03:06.630> then<00:03:07.049> that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
and it doesn't suck the water then that

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.720 
and it doesn't suck the water then that
means<00:03:07.530> you'd<00:03:07.680> put<00:03:07.860> less<00:03:08.070> water<00:03:08.340> in<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.610> pool

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
means you'd put less water in the pool

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.550 
means you'd put less water in the pool
because<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.180> got<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.390> keep<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.600> lower<00:03:09.780> but

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
because you got to keep it lower but

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.100 
because you got to keep it lower but
what<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.709> did<00:03:11.010> was<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.610> kind<00:03:12.329> of<00:03:12.510> disconnected

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
what I did was I kind of disconnected

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.440 
what I did was I kind of disconnected
that<00:03:13.290> on<00:03:13.530> there<00:03:13.680> as<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:13.980> see<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:15.209> put

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
that on there as you can see and I put

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.890 
that on there as you can see and I put
the<00:03:15.570> original<00:03:15.950> hose<00:03:16.950> on<00:03:17.250> there<00:03:17.519> or<00:03:18.239> for<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
the original hose on there or for the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.380 
the original hose on there or for the
suction<00:03:19.320> now<00:03:19.799> what<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.370> did<00:03:20.610> was<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.880> bought<00:03:21.150> this

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
suction now what I did was I bought this
