I'm just going to mix the regular cure
recipe<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.290> then<00:00:10.410> I'll<00:00:10.559> only<00:00:10.769> use<00:00:11.040> about<00:00:11.219> 80%

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
recipe and then I'll only use about 80%

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.539 
recipe and then I'll only use about 80%
of<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.440> cure<00:00:13.650> recipe<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.190> can<00:00:14.309> see<00:00:14.519> I

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
of it so the cure recipe you can see I

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.180 
of it so the cure recipe you can see I
store<00:00:14.969> my<00:00:15.299> curing<00:00:15.780> salt<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.500> really<00:00:17.010> should

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
store my curing salt I really should

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.980 
store my curing salt I really should
have<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.340> Poisson<00:00:17.880> symbol<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.539> because<00:00:18.810> if

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
have a Poisson symbol on it because if

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.900 
have a Poisson symbol on it because if
you<00:00:19.140> eat<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.590> like<00:00:19.830> regular<00:00:20.310> salt<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.789> would

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
you eat this like regular salt it would

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.450 
you eat this like regular salt it would
probably<00:00:21.270> kill<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.689> but<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.740> keep<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.100> way<00:00:23.250> up

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
probably kill you but we keep it way up

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.099 
probably kill you but we keep it way up
on<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.670> top<00:00:23.970> shelf<00:00:24.300> where<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> kids<00:00:24.779> can't

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
on the top shelf where the kids can't

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.839 
on the top shelf where the kids can't
get<00:00:25.320> at<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.890> make<00:00:26.099> sure<00:00:26.130> nobody<00:00:26.820> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
get at it and I make sure nobody is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.230 
get at it and I make sure nobody is
going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.359> misidentify<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:28.380> two<00:00:29.340> teaspoons<00:00:29.970> of

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
going to misidentify it two teaspoons of

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.889 
going to misidentify it two teaspoons of
curing<00:00:31.230> salt<00:00:32.870> this<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:33.930> for<00:00:34.290> five<00:00:34.530> pounds<00:00:35.899> and

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
curing salt this is for five pounds and

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.750 
curing salt this is for five pounds and
then<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.200> got<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:37.530> regular<00:00:37.920> coarse<00:00:38.219> salt<00:00:38.460> no

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
then I got my regular coarse salt no

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.910 
then I got my regular coarse salt no
iodine<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.660> use<00:00:39.780> kosher<00:00:40.050> salt<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.770> can

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
iodine you can use kosher salt you can

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.630 
iodine you can use kosher salt you can
use<00:00:40.950> coarse<00:00:41.370> salt<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.710> a<00:00:43.879> 1/4<00:00:44.879> cup<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.390> that

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
use coarse salt and a 1/4 cup of that

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.279 
use coarse salt and a 1/4 cup of that
for<00:00:47.640> five<00:00:47.879> pounds<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.600> I've<00:00:48.690> only<00:00:48.870> got<00:00:48.960> four

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
for five pounds and I've only got four

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.560 
for five pounds and I've only got four
pounds<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.920> said<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:50.670> over<00:00:50.850> four<00:00:51.270> so

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
pounds like I said a little over four so

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
pounds like I said a little over four so
I'll<00:00:51.750> remove<00:00:52.260> some<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.190> want<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
I'll remove some of it and you want to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.689 
I'll remove some of it and you want to
use<00:00:53.610> part<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.600> rather<00:00:55.559> than<00:00:55.920> try<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.250> just

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
use part of it rather than try to just

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.939 
use part of it rather than try to just
adjust<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.360> amount<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.930> curing<00:00:58.350> salt<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
adjust the amount of curing salt the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.340 
adjust the amount of curing salt the
curing<00:00:59.250> salt<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> only<00:00:59.940> part<00:01:00.149> that's

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
curing salt is the only part that's

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.930 
curing salt is the only part that's
dangerous<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> use<00:01:01.649> too<00:01:01.890> much<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:02.579> even<00:01:02.850> if

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
dangerous to use too much of but even if

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.780 
dangerous to use too much of but even if
you<00:01:03.030> use<00:01:03.260> 20%<00:01:04.260> more<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.100> not<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you use 20% more it's not going to be a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.660 
you use 20% more it's not going to be a
big<00:01:06.030> issue<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.960> actually<00:01:07.260> use<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
big issue it's if you actually use the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.270 
big issue it's if you actually use the
whole<00:01:09.270> quarter<00:01:09.869> cup<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.200> salt<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.710> curing<00:01:11.010> salt

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
whole quarter cup of salt as curing salt

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.980 
whole quarter cup of salt as curing salt
then<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.700> would<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:11.970> an<00:01:12.090> issue<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.750> might

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
then it would be an issue and you might

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.960 
then it would be an issue and you might
actually<00:01:13.229> kill<00:01:13.590> somebody<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.640> don't<00:01:14.820> want

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
actually kill somebody so you don't want

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.890 
actually kill somebody so you don't want
to<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:17.150> all<00:01:18.150> right<00:01:18.210> let's<00:01:18.330> see<00:01:18.689> how<00:01:18.810> it

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
to do that all right let's see how it

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.440 
to do that all right let's see how it
goes

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
goes

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.219 
goes
all<00:01:21.450> right<00:01:21.630> then<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> quarter<00:01:22.409> cup<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
all right then a quarter cup of the

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:32.749 
all right then a quarter cup of the
brown<00:01:25.229> sugar<00:01:25.259> ah<00:01:27.350> come<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.560> there

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.460 

there<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:33.509> quarter<00:01:33.960> cup<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.140> brown<00:01:34.350> sugar

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
there we go quarter cup of brown sugar

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:44.810 
there we go quarter cup of brown sugar
and<00:01:37.159> just<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.340> finish<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.700> off<00:01:41.210> 1/4<00:01:42.210> cup<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and just to finish it off 1/4 cup of the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.929 
and just to finish it off 1/4 cup of the
old<00:01:44.970> maple<00:01:45.329> syrup<00:01:46.049> piece<00:01:49.399> there<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.549> go<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
old maple syrup piece there we go a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.969 
old maple syrup piece there we go a
quarter<00:01:51.329> cup<00:01:54.229> I'm<00:01:55.229> going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.829> lick

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
quarter cup I'm going to have to lick

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.969 
quarter cup I'm going to have to lick
that<00:01:56.189> off<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> counter<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.590> am<00:01:58.740> not

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that off the counter and I am not

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.270 
that off the counter and I am not
kidding

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.840 

so<00:02:03.550> that's<00:02:03.790> about<00:02:04.000> 40<00:02:04.630> peppercorns<00:02:05.410> that<00:02:05.850> I'm

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
so that's about 40 peppercorns that I'm

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.320 
so that's about 40 peppercorns that I'm
going<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.470> grind<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.830> pulverize<00:02:09.610> them<00:02:10.149> with

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
going to grind to pulverize them with

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.280 
going to grind to pulverize them with
the<00:02:10.539> pestle<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:10.960> mortar<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:13.540> can't<00:02:14.050> do<00:02:14.260> a

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
the pestle and mortar you can't do a

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.890 
the pestle and mortar you can't do a
proper<00:02:14.590> video<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.910> right<00:02:16.090> now<00:02:16.300> because<00:02:16.600> I'm

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
much let's go with half of that that's

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.890 
much let's go with half of that that's
probably<00:02:33.690> oh<00:02:35.100> good<00:02:36.100> let's<00:02:37.030> measure<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.540> just

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
probably oh good let's measure that just

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.610 
probably oh good let's measure that just
to<00:02:38.020> be<00:02:38.170> certain<00:02:39.570> well<00:02:40.570> dang<00:02:40.840> me<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:41.440> was

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
to be certain well dang me and that was

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.680 
to be certain well dang me and that was
exactly<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.250> teaspoon<00:02:42.820> I<00:02:43.060> got<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.300> pretty<00:02:43.510> good

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
exactly a teaspoon I got a pretty good

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.470 
exactly a teaspoon I got a pretty good
eye<00:02:43.900> I<00:02:43.930> have<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.620> say<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.610> I'm<00:02:45.850> going<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.209> shake

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.890 
eye I have to say so I'm going to shake
in<00:02:46.750> about<00:02:47.760> half<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.480> we're<00:02:49.690> going<00:02:49.810> to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
in about half of that so we're going to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.840 
in about half of that so we're going to
say<00:02:50.080> 1/2<00:02:50.440> teaspoon<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.190> freshly<00:02:51.459> ground

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
uncommon tits the only reason for

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.089 
uncommon tits the only reason for
removing<00:05:08.720> it<00:05:08.870> is<00:05:09.050> that<00:05:09.260> it<00:05:09.440> looks<00:05:09.620> better<00:05:09.830> if

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
removing it is that it looks better if

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:11.890 
removing it is that it looks better if
you<00:05:10.220> remove<00:05:10.580> it<00:05:10.729> let's<00:05:11.389> see<00:05:11.539> what<00:05:11.570> that<00:05:11.720> looks

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
you remove it let's see what that looks

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.210 
you remove it let's see what that looks
like<00:05:13.810> so<00:05:14.810> this<00:05:14.990> shows<00:05:15.320> you<00:05:15.560> that<00:05:15.740> this<00:05:16.010> is<00:05:16.190> a

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
like so this shows you that this is a

just through the side that would have

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.900 
just through the side that would have
been<00:05:20.690> not<00:05:20.780> closer<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.470> neck<00:05:21.760> bunch<00:05:22.760> of
