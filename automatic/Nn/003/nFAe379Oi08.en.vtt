about a long time this game was pretty

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.670 
about a long time this game was pretty
early<00:00:13.650> on<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.219> gameboy<00:00:15.230> library<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.320> remember

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
early on the gameboy library I remember

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.460 
early on the gameboy library I remember
seeing<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.220> over<00:00:17.580> priced<00:00:18.180> at<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> local<00:00:19.140> store

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.169 
and never actually ever appealed to me
that<00:00:24.119> much<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.140> don't<00:00:27.650> understand<00:00:28.650> this

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
that much just I don't understand this

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.860 
that much just I don't understand this
some<00:00:30.179> kind<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.449> puzzle<00:00:30.689> game<00:00:32.180> yeah<00:00:33.180> okay<00:00:33.630> now<00:00:33.840> I

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
some kind of puzzle game yeah okay now I

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.549 
some kind of puzzle game yeah okay now I
remember

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
remember

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.850 
remember
you<00:00:34.860> got<00:00:35.040> these<00:00:35.250> shapes<00:00:36.410> you<00:00:37.410> got<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.680> figure

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
you got these shapes you got to figure

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.529 
you got these shapes you got to figure
out<00:00:38.070> how<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:39.680> get<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> exit<00:00:41.280> each<00:00:41.430> level

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:57.319 

there<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.629> go<00:00:54.289> get<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.469> idea<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.039> think<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
there we go get the idea I think you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.660 
there we go get the idea I think you
know<00:00:57.449> levels<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.710> more<00:00:58.890> difficult<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.430> they

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
know levels get more difficult as they

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.689 
know levels get more difficult as they
go<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.180> think<00:01:01.050> they<00:01:01.170> add<00:01:01.320> some<00:01:01.739> new<00:01:01.949> aspects<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
go I think they add some new aspects to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.980 
go I think they add some new aspects to
the<00:01:02.789> puzzles<00:01:03.710> it's<00:01:04.710> mainly<00:01:04.949> moving<00:01:05.880> shapes<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the puzzles it's mainly moving shapes to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.280 
the puzzles it's mainly moving shapes to
get<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:08.280> wrong<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.290> hit

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
get out and I get that one wrong so hit

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:21.679 
get out and I get that one wrong so hit
the<00:01:10.320> old<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:11.130> button<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.540> redo<00:01:19.640> easy<00:01:20.640> no<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.210> did

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the old a button just redo easy no I did

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.070 
the old a button just redo easy no I did
start<00:01:21.960> out<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> easy<00:01:22.590> Maps<00:01:23.869> maybe<00:01:24.869> I'll

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
start out on the easy Maps maybe I'll

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.170 
start out on the easy Maps maybe I'll
jump<00:01:25.380> out<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:27.799> let's<00:01:28.799> jump<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.579> floor

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
jump out and let's jump up to floor

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.140 
jump out and let's jump up to floor
eight<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:31.860> try<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> curves<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.729> used<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
eight to try the curves I have used to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.270 
eight to try the curves I have used to
the<00:01:33.360> difference<00:01:36.200> I'm<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.259> too<00:01:37.619> different

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the difference I'm not too different

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.340 
the difference I'm not too different
this<00:01:38.840> simplifies<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> little<00:01:40.590> bit<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
this simplifies it a little bit is that

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.690 
this simplifies it a little bit is that
that<00:01:43.350> little<00:01:43.560> angle<00:01:43.920> thing<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.250> doing

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that little angle thing is doing

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.550 
that little angle thing is doing
whatever<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.570> don't<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.350> big<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
whatever I don't think it's that big a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:02:01.069 
whatever I don't think it's that big a
deal<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:48.020> think<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.110> got<00:01:49.259> myself<00:01:49.470> stuck<00:02:00.079> I'm

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
deal I think we got myself stuck I'm

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.450 
deal I think we got myself stuck I'm
gonna<00:02:01.259> go<00:02:01.409> I'm<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.710> gonna
