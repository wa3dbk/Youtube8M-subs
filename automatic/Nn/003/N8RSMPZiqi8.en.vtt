00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.710
 Hi, I'm a girl and welcome to 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.109
 another video of what organizes there is a 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.010
 time ago I earned from a student 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.949
 this cube with works of art 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.189
 So you're going to play with him? 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.939
 stirring and new works of art are appearing 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.029
 art 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.790
 today I will teach to do if cube as 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.160
 Suggestions for Valentine's Day more 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.620
 depending on the image you place and 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.469
 It's a gift for anyone 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.480
 the right place to decorate the house 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.460
 open a child's toy everything goes 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.250
 depending on the image you choose 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.309
 I bought and the wooden cubes the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.070
 exact size of my here each one has 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.770
 three and a half for three and a half but you 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.760
 can choose whether they want to make it smaller or 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.710
 bigger 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.620
 I bought those excuses I went to 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.899
 store that sells wood is to ask for it 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.600
 cut it cut very well for me 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.810
 It's the size I wanted, I'm going to do it. 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.280
 the following way I'm going to put the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.780
 cubes 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.240
 that way and I'll take care of this tape 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.750
 here it is a masking tape but she it in 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.250
 kraft is a very good strong tape and I 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.250
 I'll close the whole cube. 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.120
 I think it was missing too. 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:55.860
 I'm going to cut the excess already involves these 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:04.800
 four packs are still missing and this is 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:08.280
 this one I'm going to do now developed 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.640
 if you get some burr you take it well 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.640
 right 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.110
 now it's going to be the same to make an origami 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.590
 It is not difficult but it is important to follow 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.770
 Every step in the end, it's all right, I'll go. 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.060
 accompanying mine here to be able to show 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.000
 for you 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:33.930
 so this first side we will go 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.670
 make a vertical coke right in the middle 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.650
 companion the cubes 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:45.350
 Now I'm going to turn forward. 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.350
 This one I'm going to cut horizontally 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:03:02.250
 and only this part that for me the part of 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:06.720
 Up I'll cut the middle 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:12.690
 as if it were one I'll turn you one more 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:16.610
 time and again I will do that which 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.610
 a horizontal cut 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:27.060
 and a cut to half of my share 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.990
 from above one more time that I will turn you 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.990
 again he 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.410
 wonder if I'll make the text that 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.720
 He'll stay upside down for me. 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:44.990
 being straight for you was converted into 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:48.910
 a horizontal cut and a cut in that 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.910
 part that is closer than me 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.190
 so here I already have again with 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:05.630
 this ship zon such've walked around inter 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:07.459
 Now I 'm going to turn to my left and 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.060
 here I have another cut in the 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.060
 horizontal 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.320
 now I'm going to have to turn the part of 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.100
 down because all this back I already 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.930
 made 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:26.090
 So I 'm going to turn around like this. 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.720
 complete and I'll make another cut in the 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.720
 horizontal 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:41.370
 so now I already have 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.150
 it 's assembled now one more time I go 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.150
 pass the tape on everything 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.220
 now an entire horizontal cut 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:16.850
 an entire frontal cortex and a cut in the 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:21.920
 Half full here I'll fingernail 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:24.640
 see right that the currency is 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.500
 among a curious 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.460
 now I'll see the other side the side of 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:35.660
 low then I will turn completely 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:45.740
 I'll come, I'll just have to do this. 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:50.060
 cutting is that vertical and now has the 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:52.960
 last side that is what stands in the middle 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.960
 this here 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:07.030
 so here I'm going to go through this again 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.030
 that I'm going to make a vertical cut 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:20.479
 and 2 horizontal ones one below the 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:26.619
 first robot of the first line and cube and 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:26.619
 another wants 1st 2nd 3rd and above fourth 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:35.439
 now it's ready 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.539
 the cube structure is ready 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.699
 from here you will decide the 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:51.650
 what will they do if they follow the suggestions 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.379
 Valentine's Day, let's just go to the 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:58.129
 decoration a gift for a friend one 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:07:02.090
 child I chose some pictures 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:04.789
 it was in print and happy to print in 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.520
 an optical material count 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:09.650
 this whole pressure here costs 15 reais 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.400
 You're going to need six photos. 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.349
 and three rectangular photos but 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.830
 that the tango is exactly twice the 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:22.610
 square as my idea that the 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:24.319
 protection addresses I have separated several photos 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.960
 it's mine and my husband's 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:30.319
 you will paste the photo on each side and 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.400
 the same records and there it is 

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:33.919
 ready 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.180
 so I already wrap the whole cube with the 

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:38.810
 Photos 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:41.150
 Only, how come the help is made of wood and 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:44.930
 the cut is not so accurate sometimes leftover 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:47.330
 A bit of a laugh, so what I 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:50.650
 I 'm going to do it with a stiletto 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.650
 those little pieces that are left over 

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:58.219
 the present is ready for my 

00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:00.800
