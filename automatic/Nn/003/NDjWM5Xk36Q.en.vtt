00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.610
 Hello welcome picture facebook friends 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.130
 Today I am back in York 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.390
 and news because I asked him 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.400
 man how do you do yours 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.750
 razor sharp the time where I am today 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.180
 but I'll show you the ones meant today 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.570
 with commercial knife makes the 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.949
 wearing clinic you 're well the robbery 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.660
 a lot of material from the bell 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.100
 does it for the championship so if 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.809
 now you have your tens then fair 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.820
 or so hand-forged expensive knives 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.769
 made rather like grinding stone for 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.199
 painter commercial household old 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.409
 they will show you the variant we 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.629
 the simply super sharp duty to 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.260
 better steffen groth two things so betz 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.820
 steel and others is one 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.920
 razor-sharp I do not even have that 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:03.860
 Full son his wife klinger in it 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:05.570
 seen you can watch perfectly 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.130
 great as the things looks and 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.049
 continues to lose directly under the video 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.810
 I would have to search for a long time so the two 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.360
 things need red blunt knives 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.180
 better by chance is dull and 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.920
 makes me totally easy to do and 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.920
 Now you are dreaming about this knife 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.840
 sharper or a headset knife here 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.800
 but even better is how lying after all 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.020
 is the risk of injury is gone 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.930
 that has to blows high then stands 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.220
 puts the every sharpness and shoots 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:41.360
 over him you already hear something like that 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:43.070
 bit of material gives the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.610
 also prohibits super with such relative 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.610
 give way 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.380
 she really did forge right 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.530
 it breaks more than 10 to 15 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.900
 sound like perfect that will be the a 656 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.290
 above and now they have a lot 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.510
 Experienced here so beautiful 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.590
 a nice profile not always 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.450
 comes as direct to the metal 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.710
 play out and now you should 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.840
 not yet cut off with it 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.220
 Now we have to clover everyone again 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.040
 degree he has placed upon 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.880
 pull it off 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.580
 farewell is now just takes 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.480
 better now the whetstone probably about 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.370
 45 degrees angle and then pulls practically 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.870
 so over here with certain pressure and 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.380
 is always changing from both sides 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.459
 once twice i had such a bit 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.200
 which dissolves so much metal 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:45.280
 or by this is created free 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:47.290
 the goal was the former dug off so 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.209
 and even the game had finished so 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.650
 It does not take two minutes to get there 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.220
 razor sharp probably does not have 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.970
 a music that I have optimize 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.030
 now the afl last time at once 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.200
 I cut out the friends clean 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.610
 Hope you had to have fun with it now 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.500
 the video from perhaps as the or 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.480
 especially how to better relatively quickly 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.519
 can get spicy 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.989
 have the link to the individual sharp 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.769
 I am under direct when so if the 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.010
 not yet home then otherwise 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.830
 look at my metro or in that 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.459
 Loading your trust where is gets 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.720
 otherwise I am always happy about the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.160
 thumb up over the one or two 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.810
 other benevolent comments and how 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.480
 said is not for top knife but 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.030
 only for simple knives otherwise 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.430
 like to have an abo until next time 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.430
