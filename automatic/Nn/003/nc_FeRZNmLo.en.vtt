going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.469> show<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.650> how<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.860> format<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.309> hard

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
going to show you how to format a hard

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.269 
going to show you how to format a hard
drive<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:15.059> Linux<00:00:15.680> let's<00:00:16.680> go<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.890> our<00:00:16.920> Linux

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
drive in Linux let's go to our Linux

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.720 
drive in Linux let's go to our Linux
command<00:00:17.609> line<00:00:22.220> and<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> very<00:00:23.460> first<00:00:23.550> thing

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
command line and the very first thing

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.160 
command line and the very first thing
we're<00:00:23.850> going<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.359> do<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> change

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
we're going to do is do a change

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.529 
we're going to do is do a change

directory to the slash de Vie folder

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.660 
directory to the slash de Vie folder
let's<00:00:30.539> do<00:00:30.689> an<00:00:30.810> LS<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.500> do<00:00:32.460> SD<00:00:33.030> star<00:00:34.430> this<00:00:35.430> shows

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
let's do an LS and do SD star this shows

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.010 
let's do an LS and do SD star this shows
you<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.850> drives<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.300> are<00:00:36.450> connected

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
you the drives that are connected

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.470 
you the drives that are connected
I<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.530> SD<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.920> which<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.579> our<00:00:38.730> first<00:00:39.210> hard

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
I have SD a which is our first hard

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.049 
I have SD a which is our first hard
drive<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.899> primary<00:00:40.350> one<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.280> has<00:00:41.489> several

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
drive the primary one and it has several

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.319 
drive the primary one and it has several
partitions<00:00:42.690> I'd<00:00:43.680> then<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.160> SD<00:00:44.460> B<00:00:44.910> which<00:00:45.149> is

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
partitions I'd then have SD B which is

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.240 
partitions I'd then have SD B which is
our<00:00:45.480> second<00:00:45.899> hard<00:00:46.079> drive<00:00:46.350> I'm<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
our second hard drive I'm going to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.979 
our second hard drive I'm going to
format<00:00:47.550> SD<00:00:47.789> B<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.640> let's<00:00:51.239> run<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> CF

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
format SD B to do so let's run the CF

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.340 
format SD B to do so let's run the CF
disk<00:00:52.320> command<00:00:52.710> my<00:00:53.399> sang<00:00:53.730> sudo<00:00:54.180> CF<00:00:54.780> disk<00:00:56.300> and

disk command my sang sudo CF disk and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.850

back to the command line what we're
going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.710> now<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.070> format<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.759> hard

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
going to do now is format that hard

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.630 
going to do now is format that hard
drive<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.009> want<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.340> sudo<00:01:43.310> mkfs<00:01:44.310> which

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.690 
drive so we want to do sudo mkfs which
is<00:01:44.820> make<00:01:45.060> filesystem<00:01:46.399> space<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.990> then<00:01:48.990> SD<00:01:49.700> b1

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
is make filesystem space and then SD b1

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.850 
is make filesystem space and then SD b1
which<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.600> first<00:01:51.810> partition<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.560> hard
