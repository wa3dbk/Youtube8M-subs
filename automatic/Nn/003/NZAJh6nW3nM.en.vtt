00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 general well in this new video 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.340
 you will understand and again we have a rumor 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.219
 is that there could be a new character 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.889
 playable in its trilingual poems and this 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.780
 character could be this innocent side 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.029
 as we know in your pre mariotto and the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.220
 world is what Paraguay is coming from 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.670
 excellent game of November one of the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.369
 best think so good year for the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.050
 truth is that it is rumored that it could 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.040
 have a fifth character and it could be 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.310
 this good side good let's see this image 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.310
 as you can see several circles and 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.650
 well now well 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.130
 what was in the circles in four 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.130
 circles commenting on four characters 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.110
 playable that shawn marion and stepping on everything and 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.060
 Well now let's look at what the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.390
 purple as you see in this image more 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.400
 great because in the first it is said that 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.040
 it could be the icon of the lives of another 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.890
 character with crown number two 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.500
 could show some character that has 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.000
 suffered some damage 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.190
 that can be a little mario or they say 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.580
 that could be a little clue too 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.670
 it could be small stella too and the 3 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.729
 no doubt mind is wake as we will know and 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.490
 the last square that could well be 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.640
 the leader of the gang says he and 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.369
 well these are the rumors could be 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.500
 which stele is the fifth character or 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.470
 it could also be that in the first 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.280
 check whether the wake is in the second 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.860
 the little one and in the one over there 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.080
 be this the normal good these are 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.330
 Unconfirmed rumors could be that 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.690
 this link to a new playable character 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.840
 is the fifth character likely to be 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.549
 can move with the game pigeons or good 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.830
 15 years in a normal character that 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.409
 we could use it good people to me 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.720
 I do not like the idea so much, but I do 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.180
 yes I would have a great time I would like to 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.360
 use quite this the wake seems to me 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.009
 a very good character of nintendo 1 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.479
 Many people would not like it too 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.550
 because they say I'm giving in a box 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.530
 so much but I think that this is a 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.140
 character that called me everything I think and 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.120
 I could use it very well in this game and 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.130
 good people but they liked this 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.720
