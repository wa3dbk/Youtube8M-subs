just<00:02:32.209> by<00:02:32.329> yourself<00:02:32.420> once<00:02:32.870> beginning<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:33.890> I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
just by yourself once beginning and I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
just by yourself once beginning and I
wanted<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.310> play<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.489> under<00:02:34.700> tempo<00:02:35.079> here<00:02:37.030> here
