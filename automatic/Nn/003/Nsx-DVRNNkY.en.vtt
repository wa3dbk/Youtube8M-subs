00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.270
 how about youtube people here we are 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.850
 with another video and then now presenting 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.660
 this chapter that is the penultimate the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.520
 next is going to be the last 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.610
 Unfortunately, they do not read the next one. 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.020
 to teach cancer combos and combos that 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.970
 you can use here I'm going to talk about 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.329
 how to recharge water is peron 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.550
 I'm a little bad 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.670
 I feel a little bad because a long time ago 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.589
 hot and good where I live in the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.780
 part of mexico does a lot for this 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.030
 era or how strange because sometimes I do not know 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.909
 it rains or whatever it is very bipolar but 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.559
 this is not the theme and the weather the most 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.059
 very extreme and it is very hot or 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.159
 currently good now well and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.979
 start with the subject because here they 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.320
 I will teach how to recharge the tricks 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:02.309
 easier and what you have to carry the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.610
 luck as you see this is a fight that 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.830
 the characters I did not choose them the time 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.830
 first I did not choose anyone they entered 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.250
 how can you tell them I am in the and 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.500
 large and do not choose and a reinforcement that 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.950
 I could say that it works or that it is a 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.689
 little gay as how are you going there was the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.689
 damn name of this character 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:33.640
 the joke is that no matter what the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.540
 trunks as they see neither the forms for 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.090
 recharging the trunks is not running 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.120
 and unfortunately I wanted to apply the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.100
 power but it does not work like you know 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.700
 you do not have to run when you 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.159
 have to 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.860
 recharge the logs the only thing you have 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.219
 what to do is to hit you a little 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.439
 run that you hit a bit but have 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:59.020
 your reinforcements to help you from that 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.030
 attack and it will recharge a little faster 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.460
 or a thing when you play against the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.340
 computer she will be recharged 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.429
 the trunks right away does not matter that to 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.010
 she has spent very borrowed 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.019
 all though they run the data who 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.230
 they are going to recharge them faster because 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.180
 is the computer that many will already know 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.190
 but the computer has the advantage in 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.430
 just that and here when I play this musician 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.140
 of bertÃ­n is on a par in those in the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.140
 replacement of logs as you will know 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.719
 lucky sometimes you can change 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.390
 because the truth sometimes I do not know 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:37.099
 recharge my trunks and say what fart 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.430
 because some of my friends beat me 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:43.069
 for that reason and therefore be able to be winning but 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.319
 unfortunately I can 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.300
 I do not recharge my trunks 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.519
 minute of substitution for the best 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.980
 said a man more good the name 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.680
 normal that you could tell the youtube 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.750
 of the institution as you see there I thought 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.930
 that they are going to apply the power to me and as they see 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.730
 and will see I'm losing good if I was going 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.730
 losing for a long time 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.830
 and as you can see, I do not have logs 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.080
 how do you see this is a way and I do not know how 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.520
 you can recharge the trunks by attacking 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.980
 or running or they can hit you that's 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.990
 depending that can be will and on and 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.490
 It may vary depending on luck 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.800
 you have to recharge the trunks 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.900
 here here I am not teaching anything or 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.820
 a trick or guide but I'm 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.070
 doing as a manual type in this 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.320
 chapter of what you could do to make 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.640
 your trunk will be required faster what 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.830
 first thing that they have to do is that 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.950
 They know how to have a bit of luck because that 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.560
 It's very influencing that video games are not 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.770
 your daily life could you tell how they see 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.200
 there 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:54.620
 I have a little less d 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.940
 of trunk of life but unfortunately 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.700
 in that the moment that the 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.910
 trunks to my adversary and for sure 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.489
 He started crying because I beat him like 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.680
 they know luck can be on your side and 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.690
 As you can see, I chose this game because 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.280
 true the truth then unfortunately 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.989
 I almost win as you see here is 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.200
 reflecting something that is recharged and you can 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.580
 attacking can vary a lot this as they see 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.270
 here they recharged themselves to attack him 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.039
 this may vary depending on how the 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.409
 context that they are because sometimes here 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.810
 It is very rare that you recharge something and 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:35.000
 As you know, my luck is horrible 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.400
 unfortunately you can not here 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.169
 do here I am with sas that consists that 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.629
 is that behind school as in this 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.909
 tried to get pregnant all the 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:46.610
 trunks or u2 replacement as you see 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:49.460
 now I have now I am running and as 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.040
 they see it recharge a little slower but 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.710
 It may vary depending 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.830
 young at the time they hit me they 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.150
 they started to recharge or I do not know 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.700
 about how much time I had thing 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.230
 if I find an approximate time for 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.940
 that this from recharge all the tricks 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.650
 I will put in the description please 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.290
 read the description to see other videos 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.390
 and my social networks so that we are at 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.400
 so much of good they are aware of my 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.070
 videos and that maybe I already have a 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.810
 application for google chrome but that 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.330
 you can see it description and 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.220
 unfortunately 18 videos because it's 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.410
 busy at school and I think about trying 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.710
 to do more but, as you know, it's very 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.390
 difficult and for some videos and by 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.770
 what was written by the anime 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.590
 unfortunately I have to wait 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.150
 because unfortunately I do not have 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.640
 a lot of time now but they are going to be 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.160
 my vacation with him I'm with kimi 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.620
 magician now if I forget the name 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.470
 this character with the route can be 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.870
 say the one that I tell you the otaku car 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.430
 because it is more or less looks like that 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.850
 back school as 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:57.720
 also applying powers if they can 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:06:00.260
 I do not know this about the and well how 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.520
 work the trunks can vary a lot 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.680
 depending on how you can tell them is 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.560
 map character because the truth sometimes 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.140
 I try one and it works with me 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.970
 character and I treat him should deal with 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:16.380
 another character on how the 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:18.510
 tricks faster and it does not work for me and what 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.970
 tried to try another day and sometimes not 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.740
 it works and I have to use another technique 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.260
 but unfortunately this of the trunks 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.300
 it's very difficult to master I'm going to leave 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.000
 in the description other tips to be able 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.800
 you memories in the trunks and the 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.840
 name as you could say and the 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.480
 seconds that have to wait 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.850
 because they are seconds not minutes because 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.310
 to recharge and then almost 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.400
 just the video was not short and at the same time 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.660
 a little simple forgive me but 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.030
 unfortunately I have things to do and 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.730
 see you in the next video and what 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.370
 good and left me the new Xbox 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.800
 it's very happy that the xbox one does not 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.780
 called infinity and durango any x 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.940
 name they were going to put 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.680
 also against spam characters you can 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.900
 be something more difficult that is to fall back on 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.870
 the trunks because unfortunately they 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:11.020
 they work to no more power and also another 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.550
 thing to them to recharge them 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.350
 the trunks is also difficult navas 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.300
 throwing lecuna jce against the 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.980
 computer can be entered and it can be 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.860
 one of equal and I say goodbye grows 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.120
 helped this tip and can subscribe 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.120
 cellay favorites and goodbye
