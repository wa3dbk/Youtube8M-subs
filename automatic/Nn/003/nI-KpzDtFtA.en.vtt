very deep a typical example would be

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.339 
very deep a typical example would be
along<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:28.080> area<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:29.269> you<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.810> lot<00:00:31.199> of

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
along this area here you have a lot of

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.090 
along this area here you have a lot of
very<00:00:32.160> susceptible<00:00:32.820> points<00:00:33.480> from<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
very susceptible points from here up to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.880 
very susceptible points from here up to
the<00:00:35.550> elbow<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:37.140> can't<00:00:37.410> get<00:00:37.560> up<00:00:37.680> and

the elbow but you can't get up and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.790 
the elbow but you can't get up and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
because when you push them does nothing

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.380 
because when you push them does nothing
and<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.100> he<00:00:41.190> shots<00:00:41.400> exist<00:00:41.790> any<00:00:42.030> creates

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
that out of your hand alright so what

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.690 
that out of your hand alright so what
you<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.650> to<00:02:10.680> do<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.010> you<00:02:11.130> have<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.310> create<00:02:11.520> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
you have to do is you have to create a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.990 
you have to do is you have to create a
reaction<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.690> strike

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
reaction so you strike

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.770 
reaction so you strike
now<00:02:14.570> he's<00:02:14.750> open<00:02:15.490> yeah<00:02:16.490> because<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.420> can<00:02:17.600> see

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
now he's open yeah because you can see

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.440 
now he's open yeah because you can see
the<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.260> stiffness<00:02:18.920> reaction<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.910> really

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
the the stiffness reaction that really

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.380 
the the stiffness reaction that really
brings<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.900> back<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.260> body<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:23.180> is

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
brings it back to the body in this is

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.780 
brings it back to the body in this is
strike<00:02:23.780> upwards<00:02:24.170> he<00:02:24.650> was<00:02:24.770> in<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.980> tongue<00:02:25.220> if

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
strike upwards he was in the tongue if

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.860 
strike upwards he was in the tongue if
strike<00:02:26.120> upwards<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:27.290> yet<00:02:27.710> by<00:02:28.280> not<00:02:29.000> trying<00:02:29.690> to

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
strike upwards and yet by not trying to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.890 
strike upwards and yet by not trying to
focus<00:02:30.110> on<00:02:30.500> one<00:02:30.800> area<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:32.210> have<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.450> build<00:02:32.750> your

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
focus on one area you have to build your

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.230 
focus on one area you have to build your
skills<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.740> point<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.160> where<00:02:34.700> when<00:02:35.090> he's

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
skills to the point of where when he's

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.110 
skills to the point of where when he's
punching<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:36.380> punch<00:02:36.830> at<00:02:37.190> his<00:02:37.580> punch<00:02:37.880> and

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
punching you can punch at his punch and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.030 
punching you can punch at his punch and
you<00:02:38.390> can<00:02:38.510> be<00:02:38.600> assured<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:39.080> getting<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:39.860> he's

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
you can be assured of getting it so he's

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.580 
you can be assured of getting it so he's
fit<00:02:40.190> he's<00:02:40.220> punching<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.910> me<00:02:41.060> okay<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:41.990> you<00:02:42.440> can

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
fit he's punching to me okay and you can

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.500 
fit he's punching to me okay and you can
take<00:02:42.800> that<00:02:42.830> finger<00:02:43.220> off<00:02:43.460> and<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:44.000> brings<00:02:44.270> in

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
take that finger off and this brings in

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.140 
take that finger off and this brings in
another<00:02:44.690> skill<00:02:45.500> altogether<00:02:46.070> which<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.850> not

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
another skill altogether which is not

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.240 
another skill altogether which is not
going<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.360> be<00:02:47.420> covered<00:02:47.720> on<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:48.470> set<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.800> DVDs

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
going to be covered on this set of DVDs

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.560 
going to be covered on this set of DVDs
but<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:50.570> brings<00:02:51.110> in<00:02:51.290> another<00:02:51.740> area<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.570> bone

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
but it brings in another area of bone

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.360 
but it brings in another area of bone
breaking<00:02:54.110> because<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.740> to<00:02:54.860> say<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:55.190> is

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
breaking because this is to say this is

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.910 
breaking because this is to say this is
the<00:02:55.490> same<00:02:55.700> concept<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:57.020> have<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.650> soften

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
the same concept so you have to soften

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.500 
the same concept so you have to soften
your<00:02:58.160> technique<00:02:58.550> so<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:59.209> has<00:02:59.390> the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
your technique so that it has the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.780 
your technique so that it has the
maximum<00:02:59.690> effect<00:03:00.290> for<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:00.980> minimum<00:03:01.340> amount<00:03:01.400> of

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
maximum effect for the minimum amount of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.330 
maximum effect for the minimum amount of
effort<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.320> when<00:03:03.320> you<00:03:03.440> say<00:03:03.620> how<00:03:03.770> many<00:03:03.950> strikes

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
effort so when you say how many strikes

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.930 
effort so when you say how many strikes
forward

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
forward

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.760

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
now on the next one you're using a

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.890 
now on the next one you're using a
slapping<00:04:09.709> technique<00:04:10.070> rather<00:04:10.850> than<00:04:11.150> using<00:04:11.600> a

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
slapping technique rather than using a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.560 
slapping technique rather than using a
specific<00:04:12.459> knuckle<00:04:13.459> strike<00:04:13.730> you're<00:04:14.180> using<00:04:14.360> a

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
specific knuckle strike you're using a

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.330 
specific knuckle strike you're using a
slapping<00:04:14.959> technique<00:04:15.290> so<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.530> bring<00:04:16.220> it

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
slapping technique so you bring it

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.170 
slapping technique so you bring it
across<00:04:17.049> okay<00:04:18.080> and<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:19.070> slap<00:04:19.340> causes<00:04:20.030> a

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
across okay and the slap causes a

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.969 
across okay and the slap causes a
different<00:04:20.720> type<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:20.900> reaction<00:04:21.530> you're

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
different type of reaction you're

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.730 
different type of reaction you're
striking<00:04:22.370> friend<00:04:22.820> here<00:04:23.210> on<00:04:23.360> this<00:04:24.050> area<00:04:24.320> here

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
striking friend here on this area here

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.860 
striking friend here on this area here
this<00:04:25.400> area<00:04:25.760> here<00:04:26.000> is<00:04:26.030> very<00:04:26.270> rich<00:04:26.479> in<00:04:26.510> nerve

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
this area here is very rich in nerve

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.430 
this area here is very rich in nerve
endings

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
endings

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.770 
endings
as<00:04:27.500> all<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.130> nerves<00:04:28.310> have<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.670> come<00:04:28.880> true<00:04:29.210> the

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
as all the nerves have to come true the

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.530 
as all the nerves have to come true the
bones<00:04:30.020> on<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.500> elbow<00:04:30.770> that<00:04:31.330> stretched<00:04:32.330> around

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
bones on the elbow that stretched around

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
bones on the elbow that stretched around
they<00:04:32.960> come<00:04:33.170> through<00:04:33.500> so<00:04:34.340> when<00:04:34.610> they<00:04:34.730> come<00:04:34.940> true

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
they come through so when they come true

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.380 
they come through so when they come true
they<00:04:36.560> are<00:04:36.710> still<00:04:37.010> under<00:04:37.370> tension<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.300> it

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
they are still under tension and it

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.490 
they are still under tension and it
doesn't<00:04:38.600> matter<00:04:38.690> whether<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.020> arm<00:04:39.170> is<00:04:39.320> bent

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
doesn't matter whether the arm is bent

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.980 
doesn't matter whether the arm is bent
or<00:04:39.740> whether<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.610> is<00:04:40.820> straightened<00:04:41.510> out<00:04:41.570> rigid

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
or whether it is straightened out rigid

or whether it is straightened out rigid
and<00:04:42.170> the<00:04:43.130> best<00:04:43.310> thing<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.580> do<00:04:43.760> is<00:04:43.850> for<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.090> catch

it in a natural motion because when you
catch<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.390> in<00:04:47.480> motion<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:48.440> hyper<00:04:48.800> flexes<00:04:49.370> so

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
catch it in motion it hyper flexes so

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.940 
catch it in motion it hyper flexes so
you<00:04:50.360> get<00:04:50.570> an<00:04:50.690> over<00:04:51.020> stretching<00:04:51.320> of<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.590> joint

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
you get an over stretching of the joint

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.740 
you get an over stretching of the joint
and<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.580> damage<00:04:52.880> is<00:04:53.000> being<00:04:53.150> done<00:04:53.240> there<00:04:53.600> as

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750
