somewhat like a checkerboard or maybe a
Stratego<00:00:57.180> board<00:00:57.449> because<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.289> does<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.649> what

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
Stratego board because it does have what

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.130 
Stratego board because it does have what
seems<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.460> water<00:00:59.789> hazards<00:01:00.390> the

instruction sheet is all in German and I

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.310 
instruction sheet is all in German and I

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
don't understand it

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.380 
don't understand it
I'm<00:01:04.739> hoping<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.460> fans<00:01:05.760> might<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:06.240> able<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
I'm hoping that my fans might be able to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.219 
I'm hoping that my fans might be able to
put<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.780> into<00:01:07.700> HD<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.000> maybe<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:10.020> able<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
put this into HD and maybe be able to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.830 
put this into HD and maybe be able to
translate<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.920> little<00:01:11.130> bit<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:11.939> me<00:01:12.150> do

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
translate a little bit of this for me do

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.600 
translate a little bit of this for me do
you<00:01:12.900> think<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.950> might<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.369> little

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
you think that this might be a little

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.810 
you think that this might be a little
too<00:01:14.760> extreme<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.689> jeepersmedia<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
too extreme for jeepersmedia to have a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.700 
too extreme for jeepersmedia to have a
board<00:01:18.150> game<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.570> was<00:01:18.689> actually<00:01:19.110> played<00:01:19.470> as

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
board game that was actually played as

board game that was actually played as
part<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:22.140> Nazi<00:01:22.560> regime<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.400> their

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
part of the Nazi regime and their

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.359 
part of the Nazi regime and their
military<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.710> don't<00:01:25.710> know<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.189> with

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
military I don't know what to do with

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.190 
military I don't know what to do with
this<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.270> very<00:01:27.330> strange

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
this this is very strange

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.660 
this this is very strange
I<00:01:28.350> don't<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:28.920> how<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> translate<00:01:29.369> these

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
I don't know how to translate these

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.819 
I don't know how to translate these
directions<00:01:30.270> maybe<00:01:31.049> I'll<00:01:31.200> figure<00:01:31.470> out<00:01:31.619> some

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
directions maybe I'll figure out some

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.440 
directions maybe I'll figure out some
way<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.920> upload<00:01:32.340> them<00:01:32.490> onto<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.820> internet<00:01:33.240> so

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
way to upload them onto the internet so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.149 
way to upload them onto the internet so
someone<00:01:33.750> could<00:01:33.869> tell<00:01:34.049> me<00:01:34.140> how<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.470> played<00:01:34.829> or

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
someone could tell me how it's played or

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.700 
someone could tell me how it's played or
if<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.659> into<00:01:36.869> high-definition

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
if you can get this into high-definition

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
if you can get this into high-definition
enough<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.460> put<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> comment<00:01:39.180> section

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
enough and put in the comment section

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.289 
enough and put in the comment section
what<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.710> game<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.040> about<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.850> how<00:01:42.119> it's

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
what this game is about and how it's
