basically<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.120> glitch<00:00:36.420> allows<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.870> to

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
basically what this glitch allows you to

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.380 
basically what this glitch allows you to
do<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.410> pretty<00:00:37.890> much<00:00:38.070> war<00:00:38.370> breach<00:00:38.640> anything<00:00:39.210> in

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
do is pretty much war breach anything in

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.450 
do is pretty much war breach anything in
the<00:00:39.510> map<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.230> very<00:00:40.530> useful<00:00:40.829> but

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the map it's very useful but

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
the map it's very useful but
unfortunately<00:00:42.210> isn't<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> use<00:00:42.989> of

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
unfortunately isn't one of the use of

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.049 
unfortunately isn't one of the use of
glitches<00:00:43.469> I've<00:00:43.770> ever<00:00:43.950> uploaded<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.670> that

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
glitches I've ever uploaded and that

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.729 
glitches I've ever uploaded and that
pretty<00:00:45.270> much<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> reason<00:00:46.230> why<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.440> has

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
pretty much is the reason why this has

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.860 
pretty much is the reason why this has
been<00:00:46.860> uploaded<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.370> my<00:00:47.550> second<00:00:47.940> channel<00:00:48.000> so

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
been uploaded to my second channel so

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.450 
been uploaded to my second channel so

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
what you are going to be doing is pretty

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.010 
what you are going to be doing is pretty
much<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.820> into<00:00:51.059> any<00:00:51.239> corner<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.840> want

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
much going into any corner that you want

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.630 
much going into any corner that you want
to<00:00:52.079> wall<00:00:52.379> breach<00:00:52.620> you're<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> place

to wall breach you're going to place

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.100 
to wall breach you're going to place
down<00:00:53.879> your<00:00:54.030> turbine<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:54.870> you're<00:00:54.989> going

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
down your turbine and what you're going

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.319 
down your turbine and what you're going
to<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.770> how<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.010> zombie<00:00:56.489> shield<00:00:56.760> what

you're going to start by lag switch

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700 
you're going to start by lag switch
yourself<00:01:06.240> now<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.530> correctly

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
yourself now if you do this correctly

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.590 
yourself now if you do this correctly
you<00:01:08.159> will<00:01:08.280> wall<00:01:08.549> breach<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.180> as<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.570> see

what<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.060> pretty<00:01:18.240> much<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.869> this

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
what you can pretty much do with this

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.260 
what you can pretty much do with this
glitch<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.380> go<00:01:19.680> into<00:01:19.890> any<00:01:20.070> corner<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.090> get

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
glitch is go into any corner and you get

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.090 
glitch is go into any corner and you get
a<00:01:21.299> good<00:01:21.509> chance<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.900> war<00:01:22.140> breaching<00:01:22.560> anything

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
a good chance of war breaching anything

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310 
a good chance of war breaching anything
it's<00:01:23.340> pretty<00:01:23.909> useful<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.689> patience
