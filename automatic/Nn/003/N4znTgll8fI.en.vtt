 where I will show you that some have me 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.540
 told to make a tutorial of how it is 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.540

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.490

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.350
 the point one files are installed though 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.590
 you have to be careful when you go to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.539
 install and use the program 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.239
 because the boys if you miss something 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.680
 risks damaging your wii ok 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.480
 so in practice what you need the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.680

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:59.610
 of your troubles you need to install 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.610
 roll the retina inside 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.659
 enough that the mavs have to have 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.290

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.690
 manager when given to install the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.250
 modification of the wii 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.280
 there are so many you can download from 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.560
 a blue browser or from a book then 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.890

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.890

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.150
 ok once done let's go on a burn 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.150
 in 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:08.450
 now that we're just burning in the then or 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:10.759
 we open directly from what was ok though 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.470
