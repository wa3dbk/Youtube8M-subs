hi<00:00:01.469> i'm<00:00:01.740> william<00:00:01.979> spaniel<00:00:02.669> let's<00:00:02.970> learn<00:00:03.090> some

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hi i'm william spaniel let's learn some

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.789 
hi i'm william spaniel let's learn some
game<00:00:03.449> theory<00:00:03.689> today<00:00:04.259> we're<00:00:04.410> gonna<00:00:04.500> go<00:00:04.650> over

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
game theory today we're gonna go over

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.860 
game theory today we're gonna go over
the<00:00:05.160> forward<00:00:05.460> induction<00:00:06.029> solution<00:00:06.450> concept

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
the forward induction solution concept

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.500 
the forward induction solution concept
in<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.470> game<00:00:07.680> I<00:00:07.919> like<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.189> call<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.970> pub<00:00:09.240> hunt

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
in a game I like to call the pub hunt

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.950 
in a game I like to call the pub hunt
now<00:00:10.349> forward<00:00:10.800> induction<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:12.240> very<00:00:12.690> powerful

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
now forward induction is a very powerful

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.200 
now forward induction is a very powerful
solution<00:00:13.679> concept<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.250> extensive<00:00:14.700> form<00:00:14.910> games

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
solution concept in extensive form games

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.260 
solution concept in extensive form games
it<00:00:15.660> allows<00:00:16.080> us<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.440> make<00:00:17.090> very<00:00:18.090> specific

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
it allows us to make very specific

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.240 
it allows us to make very specific
predictions<00:00:19.199> about<00:00:19.439> what<00:00:19.710> will<00:00:19.830> happen<00:00:19.859> in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
predictions about what will happen in

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.429 
predictions about what will happen in
equilibrium<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.570> unfortunately<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.350> can

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
equilibrium but unfortunately it can

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.470 
equilibrium but unfortunately it can
also<00:00:22.590> result<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.310> some<00:00:23.699> pretty<00:00:24.060> crazy

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
also result in some pretty crazy

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.179 
also result in some pretty crazy
outcomes<00:00:25.080> which<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.830> might<00:00:26.010> not<00:00:26.130> actually

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
outcomes which we might not actually

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.419 
outcomes which we might not actually
believe<00:00:26.820> are<00:00:27.000> plausible<00:00:27.269> it's<00:00:28.230> also<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.130> last

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
believe are plausible it's also the last

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.640 
believe are plausible it's also the last
thing<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.939> cover<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.570> chapter<00:00:31.080> 2<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.349> my

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
thing I cover in chapter 2 of my

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.639 
thing I cover in chapter 2 of my
textbook<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:34.020> think<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.559> pretty

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
textbook so if you think this is pretty

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.229 
textbook so if you think this is pretty
interesting<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.280> recommend<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.760> go<00:00:35.880> check<00:00:35.910> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
interesting I recommend you go check it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.229 
interesting I recommend you go check it
out<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:37.530> links<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
out and the links to that are in the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.630 
out and the links to that are in the
video<00:00:39.420> description<00:00:39.920> so<00:00:40.920> let's<00:00:41.250> get<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> this

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
video description so let's get to this

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.910 
video description so let's get to this
game<00:00:41.850> now<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:43.200> called<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> pub<00:00:43.710> hunt

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
game now it's called the pub hunt

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.500 
game now it's called the pub hunt
unsurprisingly<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:44.940> going<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.300> based

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
unsurprisingly it's going to be based

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.270 
unsurprisingly it's going to be based
off<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> stag<00:00:46.140> hunt<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.649> you'll<00:00:47.010> remember

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
off of the stag hunt if you'll remember

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.680 
off of the stag hunt if you'll remember
back<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.579> when<00:00:47.820> we<00:00:47.940> covered<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.300> stag<00:00:48.510> hunt

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
back to when we covered the stag hunt

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.569 
back to when we covered the stag hunt
the<00:00:49.140> stag<00:00:49.379> hunt<00:00:49.559> was<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.829> simultaneous<00:00:50.129> move

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
the stag hunt was a simultaneous move

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.869 
the stag hunt was a simultaneous move
game<00:00:51.350> that<00:00:52.350> well<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.160> happened<00:00:53.430> player<00:00:53.610> 1

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
game that well what happened player 1

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.060 
game that well what happened player 1
and<00:00:54.239> player<00:00:54.420> 2<00:00:54.660> both<00:00:55.079> choose<00:00:55.379> whether<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.860> hunt

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and player 2 both choose whether to hunt

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.099 
and player 2 both choose whether to hunt
a<00:00:56.219> stag<00:00:56.579> simultaneously<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.809> based<00:00:58.020> upon

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
a stag simultaneously and based upon

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.990 
a stag simultaneously and based upon
their<00:00:58.320> choices<00:00:58.559> they<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> payoffs<00:00:59.879> that

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
their choices they get the payoffs that

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
their choices they get the payoffs that
you<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.809> screen<00:01:01.140> there<00:01:01.399> we<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.579> draw

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you see on your screen there we can draw

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.820 
you see on your screen there we can draw
this<00:01:02.910> out<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.359> an<00:01:03.780> extensive<00:01:04.170> form<00:01:04.350> game<00:01:04.379> it's

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
this out as an extensive form game it's

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.679 
this out as an extensive form game it's
just<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.700> strategic<00:01:06.119> forum<00:01:06.360> game<00:01:06.510> when

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
just like the strategic forum game when

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.179 
just like the strategic forum game when
we<00:01:06.750> look<00:01:06.900> at<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> matrix

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
we look at it in a matrix

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.060 
we look at it in a matrix
it's<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.760> drawn<00:01:08.939> out<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> game<00:01:09.510> tree

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
it's just drawn out as a game tree

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.980 
it's just drawn out as a game tree
regardless<00:01:11.070> when<00:01:12.000> we're<00:01:12.420> looking<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
regardless when we're looking at the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
regardless when we're looking at the
equilibria<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:14.100> see<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.640> there<00:01:14.820> are<00:01:14.909> two

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
equilibria we see that there are two

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.480 
equilibria we see that there are two
pure<00:01:15.360> strategy<00:01:15.780> Nash<00:01:15.960> equilibria<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.189> stag

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
pure strategy Nash equilibria the stag

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.760 
pure strategy Nash equilibria the stag
stag<00:01:17.780> equilibrium<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.049> rabbit<00:01:19.409> rabbit

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
stag equilibrium and the rabbit rabbit

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.740 
stag equilibrium and the rabbit rabbit
equilibrium<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.670> then<00:01:20.850> there's<00:01:21.060> also<00:01:21.210> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
equilibrium and then there's also a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.719 
equilibrium and then there's also a
mixed<00:01:22.049> strategy<00:01:22.140> Nash<00:01:22.530> equilibrium<00:01:23.189> where

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.950 
mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where
they<00:01:24.150> randomize<00:01:24.720> between<00:01:25.500> stag<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.280> rabbit

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
they randomize between stag and rabbit

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.780 
they randomize between stag and rabbit
now<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.170> video<00:01:28.320> I'm<00:01:28.950> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> claim

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
now in this video I'm going to claim

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.690 
now in this video I'm going to claim
that<00:01:29.850> merely<00:01:30.780> by<00:01:31.110> adding<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.740> strategy<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.579> is

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
that merely by adding a strategy that is

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.390 
that merely by adding a strategy that is
not<00:01:33.090> played<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.840> equilibrium<00:01:34.530> we'll<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.280> able

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
not played in equilibrium we'll be able

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.679 
not played in equilibrium we'll be able
to<00:01:35.579> narrow<00:01:36.450> our<00:01:36.930> solution<00:01:37.799> from<00:01:38.460> all<00:01:38.939> sorts<00:01:39.600> of

to narrow our solution from all sorts of
well<00:01:39.990> there's<00:01:40.259> three<00:01:40.470> different<00:01:40.560> solutions

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
well there's three different solutions

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.440 
well there's three different solutions
there's<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.520> stag<00:01:41.700> stag<00:01:41.729> solution<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
there's the stag stag solution the

a<00:03:40.830> bit<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.130> dilemma<00:03:41.400> we<00:03:42.030> know<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.450> if

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
a bit of a dilemma we know that if

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.440 
a bit of a dilemma we know that if
player<00:03:42.930> 1<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:43.799> hunting<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.190> stag<00:03:44.459> player<00:03:45.180> 2

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
player 1 is hunting a stag player 2

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.449 
player 1 is hunting a stag player 2
would<00:03:45.630> rather<00:03:45.870> hunt<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.320> stag<00:03:46.530> since<00:03:46.860> this<00:03:46.980> 3<00:03:47.340> is

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
would rather hunt a stag since this 3 is

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.880 
would rather hunt a stag since this 3 is
greater<00:03:47.700> than<00:03:47.910> this<00:03:48.090> -<00:03:48.390> but<00:03:49.140> if<00:03:49.290> player<00:03:49.560> 1<00:03:49.769> is

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
greater than this - but if player 1 is

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.070 
greater than this - but if player 1 is
hunting<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.250> rabbit<00:03:50.700> she'll<00:03:51.450> want<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.720> hunt<00:03:51.930> a

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
hunting a rabbit she'll want to hunt a

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.140 
hunting a rabbit she'll want to hunt a
rabbit<00:03:52.500> as<00:03:52.680> well<00:03:52.950> since<00:03:53.340> this<00:03:53.489> one<00:03:53.760> is<00:03:53.880> greater

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
rabbit as well since this one is greater

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.199 
rabbit as well since this one is greater
than<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.480> zero<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.200> what<00:03:55.769> player<00:03:56.040> 2<00:03:56.070> does<00:03:56.760> is

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
than the zero so what player 2 does is

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.180 
than the zero so what player 2 does is
completely<00:03:58.080> dependent<00:03:58.590> on<00:03:58.650> what<00:03:58.860> player<00:03:59.160> 1

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
completely dependent on what player 1

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.690 
completely dependent on what player 1
did<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:01.140> dilemma<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.830> player<00:04:02.340> 2<00:04:02.549> doesn't

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
did the dilemma is that player 2 doesn't

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.240 
did the dilemma is that player 2 doesn't
actually<00:04:03.060> observe<00:04:03.570> this<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:04.830> she<00:04:04.860> doesn't

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
actually observe this and so she doesn't

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.920 
actually observe this and so she doesn't
know<00:04:05.549> whether<00:04:05.850> player<00:04:06.180> one's<00:04:06.390> hunting<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.690> stag

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
know whether player one's hunting a stag

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.539 
know whether player one's hunting a stag
or<00:04:07.110> hunting<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.440> rabbit<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:07.890> so<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.459> know

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
or hunting a rabbit and so you know

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:09.770 
or hunting a rabbit and so you know
maybe<00:04:08.730> there<00:04:08.940> should<00:04:09.090> be<00:04:09.150> some<00:04:09.299> uncertainty

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
maybe there should be some uncertainty

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.170 
maybe there should be some uncertainty
about<00:04:09.810> what<00:04:10.260> player<00:04:10.530> 2<00:04:10.560> should<00:04:11.100> do<00:04:11.250> but<00:04:12.030> I'm

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
about what player 2 should do but I'm

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.820 
about what player 2 should do but I'm
actually<00:04:12.330> gonna<00:04:12.510> claim<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:13.110> player<00:04:13.440> 2

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
actually gonna claim that player 2

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.289 
actually gonna claim that player 2
should<00:04:14.610> be<00:04:14.850> able<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.500> decipher<00:04:16.500> or<00:04:16.979> infer<00:04:17.489> what

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
should be able to decipher or infer what

should be able to decipher or infer what
player<00:04:18.570> 1<00:04:18.600> is<00:04:18.989> hunting<00:04:19.410> purely<00:04:20.340> based<00:04:20.549> off<00:04:20.760> of

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
player 1 is hunting purely based off of

player 1 is hunting purely based off of

hunt and to do this know
what<00:04:25.970> happens<00:04:26.390> when<00:04:27.170> player<00:04:27.470> one<00:04:27.800> hunts<00:04:28.130> a

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
what happens when player one hunts a

going to the pub well this 2.5 here is

player one hunts a rabbit so it doesn't

actually seem very reasonable for player

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.010 
actually seem very reasonable for player

situation that player one does better by

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
hunting a rabbit than he does by going

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.490 
hunting a rabbit than he does by going
to<00:05:01.640> the<00:05:01.760> pub<00:05:02.000> so<00:05:02.360> really<00:05:02.990> he<00:05:03.140> should<00:05:03.320> never

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
to the pub so really he should never

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.230 
to the pub so really he should never
want<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:03.860> play<00:05:03.980> rabbit<00:05:04.430> he<00:05:04.640> should<00:05:04.850> just<00:05:05.030> place

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
want to play rabbit he should just place

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.480 
want to play rabbit he should just place
a<00:05:05.600> pub<00:05:06.020> instead<00:05:06.500> of<00:05:06.650> rabbit<00:05:06.980> if<00:05:07.100> you<00:05:07.220> were<00:05:07.370> to

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
a pub instead of rabbit if you were to

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.720 
a pub instead of rabbit if you were to
ever<00:05:07.610> play<00:05:07.820> rabbit<00:05:08.830> but<00:05:09.830> given<00:05:10.280> that's<00:05:10.430> the

ever play rabbit but given that's the

case if player two sees player one
hunting<00:05:13.760> she<00:05:14.150> should<00:05:14.330> be<00:05:14.420> able<00:05:14.570> to<00:05:14.690> infer<00:05:14.960> that

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
hunting she should be able to infer that

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.820 
hunting she should be able to infer that
player<00:05:15.770> 1<00:05:16.100> is<00:05:16.340> choosing<00:05:16.400> stag<00:05:17.180> because<00:05:18.020> well

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
player 1 is choosing stag because well

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.040 
player 1 is choosing stag because well
there's<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:19.190> reasonable<00:05:19.880> outcome<00:05:20.000> here<00:05:20.510> so<00:05:20.720> if

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
there's a reasonable outcome here so if

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.800 
there's a reasonable outcome here so if
player<00:05:21.770> two<00:05:22.220> hunts<00:05:22.580> a<00:05:22.640> stag<00:05:22.910> player<00:05:23.300> one<00:05:23.540> gets

player two hunts a stag player one gets

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.620

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
could possibly get a higher utility here

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.360 
could possibly get a higher utility here
than<00:05:32.510> his<00:05:32.930> pub<00:05:33.200> outcome<00:05:33.560> by<00:05:33.710> hunting<00:05:34.040> a<00:05:34.100> stag

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
than his pub outcome by hunting a stag

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.190 
than his pub outcome by hunting a stag
predicated<00:05:35.240> on<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.420> fact<00:05:35.450> that<00:05:35.690> player<00:05:35.960> 2

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
predicated on the fact that player 2

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.930 
predicated on the fact that player 2
would<00:05:36.350> actually<00:05:36.740> want<00:05:36.980> to<00:05:37.250> hunt<00:05:37.460> a<00:05:37.520> stag<00:05:37.730> as

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
would actually want to hunt a stag as

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.120 
would actually want to hunt a stag as
well<00:05:38.120> so<00:05:38.360> it's<00:05:38.810> reasonable<00:05:39.470> for<00:05:39.500> player<00:05:39.800> 1<00:05:40.100> to

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
well so it's reasonable for player 1 to

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.210 
well so it's reasonable for player 1 to
hunt<00:05:40.520> a<00:05:40.640> stag<00:05:40.880> if<00:05:41.530> he<00:05:42.530> doesn't<00:05:42.800> go<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:43.010> pub

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
hunt a stag if he doesn't go to the pub

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.830 
hunt a stag if he doesn't go to the pub
it's<00:05:43.460> not<00:05:43.700> reasonable<00:05:43.940> for<00:05:44.270> him<00:05:44.450> to<00:05:44.510> hunt<00:05:44.750> a

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
it's not reasonable for him to hunt a

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.500 
it's not reasonable for him to hunt a
rabbit<00:05:45.170> if<00:05:45.260> he<00:05:45.350> doesn't<00:05:45.590> go<00:05:45.650> to<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.770> pub<00:05:46.010> so<00:05:46.880> it

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
rabbit if he doesn't go to the pub so it

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.310 
rabbit if he doesn't go to the pub so it
should<00:05:48.020> be<00:05:48.820> a<00:05:49.820> player<00:05:50.390> 2<00:05:50.660> should<00:05:50.900> be<00:05:51.020> able<00:05:51.110> to

player 2 will hunt a stag as well he'll

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789 
have a unique solution here where player

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:44.840 
have a unique solution here where player
one<00:06:42.180> hunts<00:06:42.600> a<00:06:42.660> stag<00:06:42.930> player<00:06:43.710> to<00:06:44.039> immediately

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
one hunts a stag player to immediately

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.930 
one hunts a stag player to immediately
infers<00:06:45.360> that<00:06:45.389> he's<00:06:45.720> hunting<00:06:46.080> a<00:06:46.169> stag<00:06:46.410> and

infers that he's hunting a stag and

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.580 
infers that he's hunting a stag and
therefore<00:06:47.940> player<00:06:48.150> two<00:06:48.449> hunts<00:06:48.900> a<00:06:49.020> stag<00:06:49.319> as

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
therefore player two hunts a stag as

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.460 
therefore player two hunts a stag as
well<00:06:49.889> so<00:06:50.389> essentially<00:06:51.389> what<00:06:51.539> we<00:06:51.660> are<00:06:51.720> doing<00:06:52.199> in

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
well so essentially what we are doing in

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.909 
well so essentially what we are doing in
this<00:06:52.590> case<00:06:52.860> is<00:06:53.130> applying<00:06:53.880> a<00:06:54.889> type<00:06:55.889> of

this case is applying a type of

this case is applying a type of
dominance<00:06:56.729> and<00:06:57.240> it<00:06:58.169> seems<00:06:58.620> reasonable<00:06:58.830> in

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
dominance and it seems reasonable in

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.909 
dominance and it seems reasonable in
this<00:06:59.430> particular<00:06:59.940> case<00:07:00.240> but<00:07:00.990> when<00:07:01.380> we<00:07:01.590> start

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
this particular case but when we start

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.520 
this particular case but when we start

at<00:07:11.610> in<00:07:11.789> a<00:07:11.849> textbook<00:07:12.180> at<00:07:12.539> a<00:07:12.599> game<00:07:13.050> of<00:07:13.199> chicken<00:07:13.349> we

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:14.099 
at in a textbook at a game of chicken we

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:17.240 
at in a textbook at a game of chicken we
quickly<00:07:14.370> comment<00:07:14.729> to<00:07:15.270> unreasonable<00:07:16.080> or<00:07:16.590> maybe

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
quickly comment to unreasonable or maybe

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.529 
quickly comment to unreasonable or maybe
unreasonable<00:07:17.880> is<00:07:17.940> a<00:07:17.970> bit<00:07:18.120> too<00:07:18.270> strong<00:07:18.479> a

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 
unreasonable is a bit too strong a

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:21.920 
unreasonable is a bit too strong a
reward<00:07:18.960> but<00:07:19.169> very<00:07:19.620> strange<00:07:20.340> solutions<00:07:21.240> based

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
reward but very strange solutions based

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.439 
reward but very strange solutions based
off<00:07:22.199> of<00:07:22.229> what<00:07:22.740> was<00:07:22.979> a<00:07:23.280> seemingly<00:07:24.090> reasonable

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:24.449 
off of what was a seemingly reasonable

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:26.990 
off of what was a seemingly reasonable
intuition<00:07:25.440> this<00:07:25.560> idea<00:07:25.919> a<00:07:26.009> forward<00:07:26.520> induction

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 
intuition this idea a forward induction

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.610 
intuition this idea a forward induction
that<00:07:27.660> all<00:07:27.960> past<00:07:28.289> play<00:07:28.680> was<00:07:29.130> rational<00:07:29.930> so<00:07:30.930> I

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 
that all past play was rational so I

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.920 
that all past play was rational so I
think<00:07:32.460> this<00:07:32.759> game<00:07:32.909> is<00:07:33.090> pretty<00:07:33.240> neat<00:07:33.509> I<00:07:33.690> hope

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930 
think this game is pretty neat I hope

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.600 
think this game is pretty neat I hope
you<00:07:34.139> did<00:07:34.289> too

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:34.610 
you did too

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.920 
you did too
you<00:07:35.610> can<00:07:35.940> if<00:07:36.210> you<00:07:36.270> want<00:07:36.479> to<00:07:36.539> know<00:07:36.630> more<00:07:36.870> about

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:36.930 
you can if you want to know more about

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.899 
you can if you want to know more about
foreign<00:07:37.650> induction<00:07:38.009> as<00:07:38.130> I<00:07:38.250> said<00:07:38.460> look<00:07:38.729> at<00:07:38.789> the

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:38.909 
foreign induction as I said look at the

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:40.969 
foreign induction as I said look at the
video<00:07:39.150> about<00:07:39.449> battle<00:07:39.780> of<00:07:39.900> sexes<00:07:40.229> or<00:07:40.440> go<00:07:40.770> check

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:40.979 
video about battle of sexes or go check

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:43.370 
video about battle of sexes or go check
out<00:07:41.099> the<00:07:41.220> textbook<00:07:41.639> either<00:07:42.330> way<00:07:42.599> I<00:07:42.630> am<00:07:43.110> done

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 
out the textbook either way I am done

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.830 
out the textbook either way I am done
for<00:07:43.770> now<00:07:43.919> I<00:07:44.280> hope<00:07:44.490> you<00:07:44.639> enjoyed<00:07:44.880> this<00:07:45.060> and<00:07:45.360> take

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 
for now I hope you enjoyed this and take

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.669 
for now I hope you enjoyed this and take
