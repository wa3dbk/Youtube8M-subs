00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello today i will tell you about 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.460
 your favorite tribulation which can 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.730
 make home at home by yourself 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.219
 it's very simple the main thing is that your skin 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.080
 will always look great it 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.640
 It did not clog pores they call to me 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.400
 somehow can cause some kind of allergy 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.010
 No, well, at least an allergy can be here 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.539
 probably for coffee since it is a scrub 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.760
 coffee and so and say that she 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.520
 need 1 here is such a small 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.250
 capacity as you see it is quite 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.500
 little don't know how many here 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.379
 milliliters look for what it is but such 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.040
 jar, I found myself at home as Nathan 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.480
 to achieve 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:51.210
 ground coffee is better than coffee help itself 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.850
 from ordinary coffee which is just 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.059
 sold in grains and also to us 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.590
 it is needed here 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.339
 olive oil well in principle mass you 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.930
 You can be used any but I have yet 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.320
 as you can see just unsuccessfully installed 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.689
 the camera is exactly such a company and so 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.420
 First I will say what you need to do first 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:23.310
 we take any spoon and put it somewhere 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.560
 well, about that much coffee and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.540
 we need sugar forgot about satan 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.390
 ordinary sugar itself which thought 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.329
 everyone has a house and we put it somewhere 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.030
 about 1 to 1, there should be an amount 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.350
 sugar now do it all and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.810
 mix until smooth consistency 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.799
 In principle, it is better to have a little sugar 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.470
 more then this can all be better 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.409
 rather peel off exfoliate 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.659
 overall would get to cope with 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.420
 the roughness of your skin and sugar, I still 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.729
 I reported a little bit like this 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.140
 here is the mass to do a lot because 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.950
 what on hit 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.869
 there water sugar glue 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.830
 get out all the way from some kind of garbage 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:14.290
 then we take the oil should be quite 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.290
 I will try to show a little hour 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.269
 quite a bit of oil otherwise 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.010
 and start stirring and I mix 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.440
 specially the back of the spoon is not 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.140
 so more convenient if suddenly you 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:33.890
 overdo it with oil as it will help and 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:35.840
 I made some coffee now 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.819
 that is, increase roughly speaking 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:48.890
 proportions some more coffee and some more 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:51.920
 sugars are once again mixed principle 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.780
 it should be neither straight nor swim 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.049
 oil naturally it must be very 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.340
 dry weight 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.500
 in no way used 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.239
 vegetable oil is not easy and the case is not 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.400
 use sunflower oil only 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:09.019
 olive olive oil is very good 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.489
 have a good effect on the skin 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:16.970
 it becomes softer elastic and 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:19.880
 struggling also this oil acne on the face 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.600
 so help please principle 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.560
 tom scavo 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:31.250
 at any age can be used 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:33.709
 that's what we got as you see with 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.480
 I coped with a lot of oil 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.450
 that is to say roughly simply added to 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.200
 diet and so here is a wonderful 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:47.090
 means we got this here 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.980
