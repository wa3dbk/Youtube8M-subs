in the video mode in this video I will

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.829 
in the video mode in this video I will
try<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.360> cover<00:00:12.690> everything<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:14.509> in<00:00:15.509> order<00:00:15.660> to

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
try to cover everything so in order to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.680 
try to cover everything so in order to
correctly<00:00:16.350> expose<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.980> Nikon<00:00:17.369> d50<00:00:17.910> 100<00:00:18.420> for<00:00:18.660> a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
correctly expose the Nikon d50 100 for a

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.990 
correctly expose the Nikon d50 100 for a
video<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.680> first<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.279> go<00:00:20.580> into<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
video we first have to go into the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.450 
video we first have to go into the
shooting<00:00:21.359> menu<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.070> select<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> ISO

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
shooting menu and select the ISO

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.500 
shooting menu and select the ISO
sensitivity<00:00:23.880> settings<00:00:26.119> we<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.390> make

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
sensitivity settings we have to make

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.410 
sensitivity settings we have to make
sure<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.930> they<00:00:28.109> are<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.970> also<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.300> have

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
sure that they are on and also we have

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.380 
sure that they are on and also we have
to<00:00:30.570> select<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> maximum<00:00:31.199> sensitivity

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
to select the maximum sensitivity

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.490 
to select the maximum sensitivity
personally<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.420> will<00:00:33.660> not<00:00:33.809> suggest<00:00:34.020> going

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
personally I will not suggest going

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.150 
personally I will not suggest going
above<00:00:34.920> 1250<00:00:35.989> because<00:00:36.989> after<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.950> grain

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
above 1250 because after that the grain

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.660 
above 1250 because after that the grain
becomes<00:00:38.550> far<00:00:38.850> too<00:00:39.030> obvious<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.250> this<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.430> set

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
becomes far too obvious so this is set

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.470 
becomes far too obvious so this is set
to<00:00:41.809> 1600<00:00:42.829> we're<00:00:43.829> okay<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.610> then<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to 1600 we're okay and then we have to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.590 
to 1600 we're okay and then we have to
select<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.840> minimum<00:00:46.140> shutter<00:00:46.590> speed<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.600> one

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
select the minimum shutter speed and one

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.799 
select the minimum shutter speed and one
fiftieth<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.379> second<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.789> best<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.660> get

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
fiftieth of a second is the best to get

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.080 
fiftieth of a second is the best to get
that<00:00:52.079> movie<00:00:52.469> look<00:00:52.649> even<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.610> are<00:00:53.820> shooting

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that movie look even if you are shooting

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.750 
that movie look even if you are shooting
in<00:00:54.300> 30<00:00:54.539> frames<00:00:54.899> per<00:00:54.989> second<00:00:55.559> Vincent<00:00:56.280> la<00:00:56.430> foret

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
in 30 frames per second Vincent la foret

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.110 
in 30 frames per second Vincent la foret
has<00:00:57.260> suggested<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.370> one<00:00:59.370> fiftieth<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
has suggested that one fiftieth of a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.599 
has suggested that one fiftieth of a
second<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.600> good<00:01:01.140> even<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.649> 30<00:01:02.129> frames<00:01:02.489> per

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
second is good even for 30 frames per

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.060 
second is good even for 30 frames per
second<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:03.960> important<00:01:04.559> because<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
second this is important because it

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.940 
second this is important because it
works<00:01:05.489> only<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:06.150> aperture<00:01:06.900> priority<00:01:07.170> mode<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
works only in aperture priority mode and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.890 
works only in aperture priority mode and
this<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> mode<00:01:08.880> which<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.720> most

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
this is the mode which is the most

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.710 
this is the mode which is the most
functional<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.650> terms<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.100> video<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
functional in terms of video on the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.890 
functional in terms of video on the
Nikon<00:01:13.080> d50<00:01:13.530> 100<00:01:14.100> let's<00:01:15.000> say<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
Nikon d50 100 let's say we have to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.510 
Nikon d50 100 let's say we have to
correctly<00:01:16.259> expose<00:01:17.930> that<00:01:18.930> wall<00:01:19.400> with<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
correctly expose that wall with the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.770 
correctly expose that wall with the
trophies<00:01:21.210> our<00:01:22.490> first<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.610> all<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:24.119> punch<00:01:24.450> end

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
trophies our first of all we punch end

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.539 
trophies our first of all we punch end
to<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.860> exposure<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.320> focus<00:01:28.860> right

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.070 

that's<00:01:32.549> about<00:01:32.759> right

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.880 

now<00:01:36.650> we<00:01:36.770> have<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:37.040> adjust<00:01:37.220> exposure<00:01:38.770> when<00:01:39.770> the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
now we have to adjust exposure when the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.070 
now we have to adjust exposure when the
minimum<00:01:40.280> shutter<00:01:40.520> speed<00:01:40.880> is<00:01:41.090> one<00:01:41.480> fiftieth<00:01:41.900> of

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
minimum shutter speed is one fiftieth of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.810 
minimum shutter speed is one fiftieth of
a<00:01:42.230> second<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.820> camera<00:01:44.300> will<00:01:44.720> automatically

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
a second the camera will automatically

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.030 
a second the camera will automatically
heighten<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.000> ISO<00:01:47.720> in<00:01:48.350> order<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:48.800> get<00:01:48.950> the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
heighten the ISO in order to get the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.270 
heighten the ISO in order to get the
correct<00:01:49.190> exposure<00:01:50.080> when<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.230> reaches<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.770> ISO

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
correct exposure when it reaches the ISO

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.080 
correct exposure when it reaches the ISO
limit<00:01:52.790> which<00:01:53.450> we've<00:01:53.690> set<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.490> 1600<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.670> will

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
limit which we've set to 1600 it will

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.890 
limit which we've set to 1600 it will
then<00:01:56.360> proceed<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:57.580> reduce<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:59.420> shutter<00:01:59.660> speed

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
then proceed to reduce the shutter speed

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.170 
then proceed to reduce the shutter speed

I<00:03:32.530> like<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.739> say<00:03:33.920> that<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.250> Nikon<00:03:34.640> d50<00:03:35.120> 100<00:03:35.600> has

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
I like to say that the Nikon d50 100 has

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.550 
I like to say that the Nikon d50 100 has
semi-automatic<00:03:37.040> video<00:03:37.280> exposure<00:03:38.140> ok<00:03:39.140> so<00:03:39.200> we

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
semi-automatic video exposure ok so we

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.160 
semi-automatic video exposure ok so we
see<00:03:39.769> that<00:03:39.980> we<00:03:40.730> have<00:03:40.760> not<00:03:41.060> yet<00:03:41.570> reached<00:03:41.810> our

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
see that we have not yet reached our

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.690 
see that we have not yet reached our
exposure<00:03:42.950> limit<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:43.810> mean<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:45.020> ISO<00:03:45.410> limit<00:03:45.740> we

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
exposure limit I mean the ISO limit we

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.540 
exposure limit I mean the ISO limit we
can<00:03:46.730> then<00:03:47.090> move<00:03:47.300> this<00:03:47.510> rectangle

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
can then move this rectangle

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.490 
can then move this rectangle
the<00:03:49.670> left<00:03:49.880> side<00:03:50.210> no<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.080> is<00:03:51.230> too<00:03:51.350> much

the left side no that is too much

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.680 
the left side no that is too much
