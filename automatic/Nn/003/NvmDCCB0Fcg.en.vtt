00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
first video I don't even remember what

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.170 
first video I don't even remember what
it<00:02:50.040> was<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.460> be<00:02:50.490> honest<00:02:50.760> with<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:50.970> I'm<00:02:51.060> not

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
it was to be honest with you I'm not

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
gonna lie here I'm kind of unsure as to

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.030 
gonna lie here I'm kind of unsure as to
whether<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.940> dupatte<00:02:54.750> this<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.260> film<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.770> or

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
whether to dupatte this and film it or

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.370 
whether to dupatte this and film it or
not<00:02:56.280> making<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.880> video<00:02:57.090> takes<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.690> good<00:02:58.080> week

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
not making the video takes a good week

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.920 
not making the video takes a good week
for<00:02:58.410> me<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:59.550> it<00:03:00.060> would<00:03:00.240> take<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> lot<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.720> work

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
for me so it would take a lot of work

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.660 
for me so it would take a lot of work
and<00:03:01.170> if<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.590> guys<00:03:01.710> don't<00:03:01.860> even<00:03:01.980> want<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.400> and

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
and if you guys don't even want it and

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.310 
and if you guys don't even want it and
that<00:03:02.880> would<00:03:03.000> be<00:03:03.030> pointless<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.810> don't<00:03:04.140> want<00:03:04.260> to

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
that would be pointless I don't want to

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.720 
that would be pointless I don't want to
make<00:03:04.440> videos<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.980> guys<00:03:05.100> don't<00:03:05.370> want<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.520> see

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730
