00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
then you I've never had a apparently you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
then you I've never had a apparently you
had<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.980> real<00:00:50.129> deal<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.760> Turkey<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.809> they

had at the real deal in Turkey but they

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
had at the real deal in Turkey but they
basically<00:00:52.530> they<00:00:52.980> sit<00:00:53.160> there<00:00:53.190> beating<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.850> well

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
basically they sit there beating it well

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.270 
basically they sit there beating it well
right<00:00:54.449> before<00:00:54.539> they<00:00:54.780> serve<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.039> act

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
right before they serve it and the act

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.099 
right before they serve it and the act
of<00:00:56.489> beating<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.300> these<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.960> guess

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
of beating it with these kind of I guess

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.810 
of beating it with these kind of I guess
they're<00:00:58.289> kind<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.530> spoon<00:00:58.949> sticks<00:00:59.250> right<00:00:59.520> they

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
they're kind of spoon sticks right they

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.549 
they're kind of spoon sticks right they
feed<00:01:00.030> them<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.359> becomes<00:01:00.870> extremely<00:01:01.170> stretchy

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
feed them it becomes extremely stretchy

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.299 
feed them it becomes extremely stretchy
and<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.920> has<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> snap<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> bite<00:01:03.229> now

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
and it has a snap to it like a bite now

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
and it has a snap to it like a bite now
this<00:01:05.309> powder<00:01:05.580> you're<00:01:06.119> not<00:01:06.240> allowed<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> import

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
this powder you're not allowed to import

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.109 
this powder you're not allowed to import
it<00:01:07.140> into<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.979> u.s.<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:08.310> exported<00:01:08.970> out<00:01:09.030> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
it into the u.s. not exported out of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.700 
it into the u.s. not exported out of
Turkey<00:01:09.270> actually<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.530> not

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
Turkey actually because it's not

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.200 
Turkey actually because it's not
technically<00:01:11.250> endangered<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.000> there's<00:01:12.119> not

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
technically endangered but there's not

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
technically endangered but there's not
enough<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.869> even<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.290> satisfy<00:01:13.799> satisfy<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
enough of it even to satisfy satisfy the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
enough of it even to satisfy satisfy the
demand<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.150> turkey<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:15.960> don't<00:01:16.170> allow<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
demand and turkey so they don't allow to

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.580 
demand and turkey so they don't allow to
be<00:01:16.560> exported<00:01:17.009> right<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:19.049> happens<00:01:19.409> is

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
be exported right so so what happens is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.679 
be exported right so so what happens is
is<00:01:19.830> there's<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:20.909> these<00:01:21.000> people<00:01:21.210> who<00:01:21.390> try<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
is there's all these people who try to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.350 
is there's all these people who try to
come<00:01:21.780> up<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.580> new<00:01:23.580> ways<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.240> without

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
come up with new ways to do it without

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.670 
come up with new ways to do it without
using<00:01:24.689> your<00:01:24.810> compiler<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.439> they<00:01:25.530> use<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
using your compiler and they use a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
using your compiler and they use a
variety<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.220> different<00:01:26.310> hydrocolloids<00:01:27.000> we

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
variety of different hydrocolloids we

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.359 
variety of different hydrocolloids we
have<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> couple<00:01:28.080> different<00:01:28.290> recipes<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.040> then

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
have a couple different recipes and then

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.340 
have a couple different recipes and then
one<00:01:29.579> day<00:01:29.610> though<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.540> blended<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> bunch

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
one day though we just blended a bunch

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.170 
one day though we just blended a bunch

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
so you want to be careful so we actually

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.179 
so you want to be careful so we actually
want<00:01:57.049> them<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.229> get<00:01:57.320> all<00:01:57.439> gluey<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:57.979> right<00:01:58.159> now

you're<00:01:58.399> putting<00:01:58.579> the<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.179> steamed<00:01:59.659> potatoes

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259

into<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.710> crème<00:02:00.890> anglaise<00:02:01.159> I<00:02:01.460> think<00:02:02.299> it's

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
into the crème anglaise I think it's

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.969 
into the crème anglaise I think it's
going<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.570> need<00:02:02.689> more<00:02:02.840> than<00:02:02.899> that<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:09.649> can<00:02:09.800> see

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
going to need more than that you can see

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.089 
going to need more than that you can see
as<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.130> pours<00:02:10.429> its<00:02:10.789> gluey<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.860> liquid

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
as it pours its gluey the liquid

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.470 
as it pours its gluey the liquid
nitrogen<00:02:13.280> just<00:02:13.489> flies<00:02:13.700> out<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.239> have<00:02:14.390> to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
nitrogen just flies out so you have to

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.240 
nitrogen just flies out so you have to
be<00:02:14.599> more<00:02:15.140> careful<00:02:15.380> making<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:16.010> kind<00:02:16.160> of

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
be more careful making this kind of

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.530 
be more careful making this kind of
liquid<00:02:16.489> nitrogen<00:02:16.519> ice<00:02:16.849> cream<00:02:17.120> then<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.390> do

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
liquid nitrogen ice cream then you do

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.100 
liquid nitrogen ice cream then you do
making<00:02:17.870> normal<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.230> connection<00:02:19.810> nitrogen<00:02:20.810> I

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
making normal the connection nitrogen I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.460 
making normal the connection nitrogen I
mean<00:02:21.380> if<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.739> hits<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.250> is<00:02:22.549> it<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:23.470> paint
