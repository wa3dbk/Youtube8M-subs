yeah so I'm Nick Kingston um I started

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.869 
yeah so I'm Nick Kingston um I started
cloud<00:00:03.449> fab<00:00:03.720> is<00:00:03.870> basically<00:00:04.490> yeah<00:00:05.490> in<00:00:05.850> between

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
cloud fab is basically yeah in between

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.940 
cloud fab is basically yeah in between
like<00:00:06.330> if<00:00:06.420> you<00:00:06.480> ever<00:00:06.509> used<00:00:06.779> pinocho<00:00:07.290> for<00:00:07.710> 3d

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
like if you ever used pinocho for 3d

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.589 
like if you ever used pinocho for 3d
printing<00:00:07.980> we're<00:00:08.519> actually<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.880> ones<00:00:09.059> who<00:00:09.330> who

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
printing we're actually the ones who who

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.940 
printing we're actually the ones who who
have<00:00:09.719> serviced<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.679> interestingly

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
have serviced you so interestingly

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.799 
have serviced you so interestingly
enough<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.639> then<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:11.790> did<00:00:11.910> injection<00:00:12.389> molding

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
enough and then we did injection molding

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.440 
enough and then we did injection molding
as<00:00:13.320> well<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.860> could<00:00:13.980> submit<00:00:14.340> geometry<00:00:15.269> to

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
as well so you could submit geometry to

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.760 
as well so you could submit geometry to
us<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:15.719> tell<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.080> if<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.289> was<00:00:16.410> actually

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
us we tell you if it was actually

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.560 
us we tell you if it was actually
possible<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.220> make<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.699> then<00:00:18.090> send<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.449> off

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
possible to make and then send it off

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.390 
possible to make and then send it off
but<00:00:18.960> um<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.560> actually<00:00:19.590> recently<00:00:19.949> just<00:00:20.189> sold

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
but um we actually recently just sold

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.980 
but um we actually recently just sold
cloud<00:00:20.640> fab<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.180> now<00:00:21.300> I'm<00:00:21.420> kind<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.750> free

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
cloud fab so now I'm kind of a free

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.439 
cloud fab so now I'm kind of a free
agent<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:23.220> then<00:00:23.580> before<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.090> did<00:00:24.269> hack

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
agent and then before that I did hack

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.759 
agent and then before that I did hack
Pittsburgh<00:00:24.869> which<00:00:24.990> was<00:00:25.109> Pittsburgh's<00:00:25.500> hacker

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
Pittsburgh which was Pittsburgh's hacker

spacers<00:00:26.310> where<00:00:26.460> I'm<00:00:26.550> from<00:00:26.609> originally<00:00:27.150> um<00:00:27.390> I

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
spacers where I'm from originally um I

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.410 
spacers where I'm from originally um I
want<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.619> start<00:00:28.890> though<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.849> there's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
want to start though on this there's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.269 
want to start though on this there's
your<00:00:30.539> card<00:00:30.810> loom<00:00:31.170> because<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> lot<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.070> times

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
your card loom because a lot of times

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.799 
your card loom because a lot of times
right<00:00:32.489> now<00:00:32.640> we're<00:00:32.820> talking<00:00:33.180> about<00:00:33.270> how

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
right now we're talking about how

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.420 
right now we're talking about how
digital<00:00:34.290> technologies<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.100> be<00:00:35.160> brought<00:00:35.309> into

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
digital technologies can be brought into

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.430 
digital technologies can be brought into
manufacturing<00:00:35.840> but<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.290> really

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
manufacturing but what have really

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.869 
manufacturing but what have really
hasn't<00:00:37.559> been<00:00:37.680> said<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.219> manufacturing

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
hasn't been said is that manufacturing

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.030 
hasn't been said is that manufacturing
actually<00:00:39.690> made<00:00:39.960> digital<00:00:40.440> technologies

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
actually made digital technologies

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.560 
actually made digital technologies
because<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> jacquard<00:00:41.969> loom<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
because the jacquard loom is like the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.650 
because the jacquard loom is like the
first<00:00:42.780> punch<00:00:43.110> card<00:00:43.500> operated<00:00:44.460> device<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.329> this

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
first punch card operated device so this

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.940 
first punch card operated device so this
is<00:00:45.809> actually<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.289> kind<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> great<00:00:46.739> great

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
is actually it's kind of the great great

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.979 
is actually it's kind of the great great
grandfather<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.789> both<00:00:47.969> computers<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
grandfather of both computers and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.990 
grandfather of both computers and
factory<00:00:49.829> automation<00:00:49.980> all<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> same

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
factory automation all in the same

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.569 
factory automation all in the same
machine<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.600> kind<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.899> crazy<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.219> what<00:00:53.550> I

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
machine it's kind of crazy and so what I

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
machine it's kind of crazy and so what I
want<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.850> bring<00:00:53.940> new<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> talk<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:55.110> I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
want to bring new in this talk is I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.840 
want to bring new in this talk is I
think<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.340> take<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> lot<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
think that we can take a lot of the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.490 
think that we can take a lot of the
analogies<00:00:57.180> from<00:00:57.480> computer<00:00:57.899> science<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.410> how

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
analogies from computer science and how

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.900 
analogies from computer science and how
we<00:00:58.559> did<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> internet<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.370> pretty<00:00:59.850> much

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
we did the internet and pretty much

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.060 
we did the internet and pretty much
reapply<00:01:00.510> them<00:01:00.690> back<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.140> manufacturing<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
reapply them back to manufacturing and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.160 
reapply them back to manufacturing and
you<00:01:02.640> know<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> call<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> lamp<00:01:03.510> stack<00:01:03.899> so

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
you know what I call a lamp stack so

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.950 
you know what I call a lamp stack so
what<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> server<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.570> right<00:01:06.780> now

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
what we have on on a server so right now

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.780 
what we have on on a server so right now
everyone's<00:01:07.350> been<00:01:07.470> mentioning<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.950> gap<00:01:08.280> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
everyone's been mentioning this gap so

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.399 
everyone's been mentioning this gap so
you<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.030> companies<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.450> Toyota<00:01:09.810> they<00:01:10.260> can

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
you have companies like Toyota they can

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.600 
you have companies like Toyota they can
make<00:01:10.560> these<00:01:10.680> cars<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.340> what<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> think

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
make these cars you know what I think

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.480 
make these cars you know what I think
relatively<00:01:12.090> cheap<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> parts<00:01:13.220> by<00:01:14.220> doing

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
relatively cheap for the parts by doing

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.219 
relatively cheap for the parts by doing
ridiculous<00:01:14.640> amounts<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.540> automation<00:01:15.900> you

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
ridiculous amounts of automation you

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.990 
ridiculous amounts of automation you
know<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.560> tons<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.159> tooling<00:01:17.520> robots

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
know they have tons of tooling robots

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
know they have tons of tooling robots
and<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.299> sorts<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.540> fun<00:01:18.750> stuff<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.320> then<00:01:19.770> at

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and all sorts of fun stuff and then at

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.200 
and all sorts of fun stuff and then at
the<00:01:19.920> bottom<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.430> ton<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.759> little<00:01:20.909> job

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the bottom we have a ton of little job

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.679 
the bottom we have a ton of little job
shops<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.590> can't<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:22.920> stuff<00:01:23.159> cheap

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
shops and you can't get stuff cheap

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.700 
shops and you can't get stuff cheap
usually<00:01:24.689> from<00:01:24.900> those<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.290> things<00:01:25.500> you

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
usually from those kind of things you

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.170 
usually from those kind of things you
have<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> go<00:01:26.130> somewhere<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.729> between<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.090> so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
have to go somewhere in between it so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.240 
have to go somewhere in between it so
then<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.420> go<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.780> China<00:01:28.350> right<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:29.100> that's

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
then we go to China right now but that's

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.069 
then we go to China right now but that's
kind<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.520> hard<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.820> do<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.689> we're<00:01:30.900> trying<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
kind of hard to do so we're trying to

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.440 
kind of hard to do so we're trying to
figure<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.500> how<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.159> gap<00:01:32.520> solved

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
figure out is how to get this gap solved

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.940 
figure out is how to get this gap solved
and<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.720> there's<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> bunch<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.140> interfaces

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and so there's a bunch of interfaces

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.069 
and so there's a bunch of interfaces
into<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.659> look<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.960> know

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
into this so you can look at you know

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.510 
into this so you can look at you know
your<00:01:37.229> Google's<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.860> whatnot<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.430> you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
your Google's and whatnot just like you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.090 
your Google's and whatnot just like you
know<00:01:38.640> call<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.329> do<00:01:39.540> your<00:01:39.659> leg<00:01:39.840> work<00:01:40.100> companies

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
know call and do your leg work companies

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.830 
know call and do your leg work companies
like<00:01:41.159> MFG<00:01:41.729> came<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.329> make<00:01:42.479> sort<00:01:42.780> of

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
like MFG came up that make sort of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.660 
like MFG came up that make sort of
expose<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.500> entire<00:01:43.799> things<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.460> see

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
expose the entire things you can see

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.670 
expose the entire things you can see
companies<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.630> reviews<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.229> kind<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.470> thing

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
companies and reviews that kind of thing

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.980 
companies and reviews that kind of thing
of<00:01:47.490> course<00:01:47.700> we've<00:01:47.820> seen<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> lot<00:01:48.030> about<00:01:48.180> PCH<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
of course we've seen a lot about PCH and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.480 
of course we've seen a lot about PCH and
all<00:01:49.170> their<00:01:49.649> experience<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.220> bring<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
all their experience that bring to the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.450 
all their experience that bring to the
table<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:51.270> guys<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.659> protem<00:01:52.079> old<00:01:52.310> they<00:01:53.310> let

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
table then guys like protem old they let

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.520 
table then guys like protem old they let
you<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.610> injection<00:01:54.060> molding<00:01:54.360> almost<00:01:55.170> fully

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
you do injection molding almost fully

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.230 
you do injection molding almost fully
automatically<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:56.850> guys<00:01:57.060> like

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
automatically and then guys like

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.149 
automatically and then guys like
Pinocchio<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.200> know<00:01:58.229> designs

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
Pinocchio you can just you know designs

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.850 
Pinocchio you can just you know designs
in<00:01:59.399> parts<00:01:59.759> come<00:01:59.969> out<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.329> very<00:02:00.630> very<00:02:00.960> close<00:02:01.590> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
in parts come out so very very close to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.959 
in parts come out so very very close to
the<00:02:02.040> metal<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.460> what<00:02:02.820> you're<00:02:02.939> basically

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the metal so what you're basically

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.030 
the metal so what you're basically
seeing<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.990> engineer<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.530> getting<00:02:04.770> closer

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
seeing is the engineer is getting closer

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.370 
seeing is the engineer is getting closer
and<00:02:05.219> closer<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:06.090> manufacturing<00:02:07.049> via

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and closer to manufacturing via

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
and closer to manufacturing via
technology<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:08.190> each<00:02:08.340> one<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.610> these<00:02:08.729> steps

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
technology in each one of these steps

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.180 
technology in each one of these steps
and<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.989> my<00:02:10.110> sort<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.440> prediction<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and so my sort of prediction is in the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.550 
and so my sort of prediction is in the
future<00:02:11.370> we're<00:02:11.670> going<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.879> see<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.209> technology

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
future we're going to see the technology

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.320 
future we're going to see the technology
the<00:02:13.650> digital<00:02:13.980> stuff<00:02:14.160> coming<00:02:14.760> up<00:02:14.849> this<00:02:15.060> stack

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
the digital stuff coming up this stack

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330 
the digital stuff coming up this stack
into<00:02:15.569> higher<00:02:15.810> orders<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.410> complexity<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.190> not

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
into higher orders of complexity so not

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.339 
into higher orders of complexity so not
just<00:02:17.550> say<00:02:18.030> laser<00:02:18.300> cutting<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:18.810> 3d<00:02:19.020> printing

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
just say laser cutting and 3d printing

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.110 
just say laser cutting and 3d printing
but<00:02:19.470> into<00:02:19.709> things<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:20.520> an<00:02:20.670> EDM<00:02:20.970> machine

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
but into things like like an EDM machine

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.699 
but into things like like an EDM machine
as<00:02:21.480> was<00:02:21.630> mentioned<00:02:21.750> earlier<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.349> no<00:02:22.590> one

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
as was mentioned earlier that no one

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.280 
as was mentioned earlier that no one
even<00:02:22.739> uses<00:02:23.280> now<00:02:23.489> we<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.599> actually<00:02:24.750> get<00:02:25.080> that

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
even uses now we can actually get that

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.150 
even uses now we can actually get that
useful<00:02:25.800> for<00:02:26.069> regular<00:02:26.760> people<00:02:26.910> um<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.620> one<00:02:29.130> of

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
useful for regular people um so one of

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.740 
useful for regular people um so one of
things<00:02:29.250> we<00:02:29.400> look<00:02:29.580> at<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.239> I'm<00:02:30.420> sure<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.630> lot

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
things we look at is is I'm sure a lot

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.330 
things we look at is is I'm sure a lot
of<00:02:30.810> guys<00:02:31.019> know<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> lamp<00:02:31.560> stack<00:02:31.860> but<00:02:32.130> if<00:02:32.250> you

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
of guys know the lamp stack but if you

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.009 
of guys know the lamp stack but if you
don't<00:02:32.610> basically<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.510> whole<00:02:33.599> modern

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
don't basically the whole modern

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.990 
don't basically the whole modern
internet<00:02:34.380> runs<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.830> some<00:02:35.130> version<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.730> this

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
internet runs on some version of this

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.699 
internet runs on some version of this
and<00:02:36.239> basically<00:02:36.360> when<00:02:36.900> they<00:02:36.989> say<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> stack

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
and basically when they say a stack

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.890 
and basically when they say a stack
there's<00:02:38.340> these<00:02:38.489> layers<00:02:38.849> that<00:02:39.150> take<00:02:39.390> different

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
there's these layers that take different

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.839 
there's these layers that take different
tasks<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.800> they<00:02:40.950> put<00:02:41.280> them<00:02:41.400> together<00:02:41.519> and

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
tasks and they put them together and

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.339 
tasks and they put them together and
then<00:02:41.970> they<00:02:42.209> make<00:02:42.660> sure<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.110> know<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
then they make sure that you know the

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.320 
then they make sure that you know the
Linux<00:02:43.860> can<00:02:44.040> operate<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.489> server<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.180> that's

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
Linux can operate the server so that's

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.550 
Linux can operate the server so that's
like<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.569> operating<00:02:45.959> system<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.350> then<00:02:46.440> each

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
like the operating system and then each

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.670 
like the operating system and then each
one<00:02:46.769> builds<00:02:47.190> on<00:02:47.310> different<00:02:48.019> you<00:02:49.019> know<00:02:49.140> tasks

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
one builds on different you know tasks

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.710 
one builds on different you know tasks
of<00:02:49.830> abstraction<00:02:50.489> up<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.209> what<00:02:51.299> I<00:02:51.360> think<00:02:51.420> we<00:02:51.569> can

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
of abstraction up so what I think we can

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.240 
of abstraction up so what I think we can
do<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:51.959> manufacturing<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.069> sort<00:02:53.220> of

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
do in manufacturing and this is sort of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.130 
do in manufacturing and this is sort of
the<00:02:53.340> list<00:02:53.519> I'm<00:02:53.640> going<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.819> go<00:02:53.940> through<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.600> we

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
the list I'm going to go through is we

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.210 
the list I'm going to go through is we
can<00:02:55.290> go<00:02:55.410> through<00:02:55.440> each<00:02:55.769> one<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:55.980> these<00:02:56.069> by

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
can go through each one of these by

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.180 
can go through each one of these by
abstracting<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.180> machines<00:02:57.959> by<00:02:58.500> automating

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
abstracting the machines by automating

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.130 
abstracting the machines by automating
the<00:02:59.280> machines<00:02:59.670> by<00:03:00.000> networking<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.780> machines

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
the machines by networking the machines

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.289 
the machines by networking the machines
compiling<00:03:01.920> our<00:03:02.010> designs<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.790> machines

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
compiling our designs to the machines

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.180 
compiling our designs to the machines
and<00:03:03.599> then<00:03:03.870> debugging<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.709> think<00:03:04.980> those<00:03:05.160> are

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
and then debugging I think those are

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.370 
and then debugging I think those are
pretty<00:03:05.489> much<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.760> same<00:03:06.049> things<00:03:07.049> that<00:03:07.170> we<00:03:07.260> do

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
pretty much the same things that we do

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.960 
pretty much the same things that we do
in<00:03:07.500> software<00:03:07.890> we<00:03:08.370> can<00:03:08.489> bring<00:03:08.640> those<00:03:08.730> now<00:03:08.910> to

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
in software we can bring those now to

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.440 
in software we can bring those now to
hardware<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.780> we're<00:03:10.380> pretty<00:03:10.530> close<00:03:11.330> so<00:03:12.330> let

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
hardware and we're pretty close so let

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.300 
hardware and we're pretty close so let
me<00:03:12.540> start<00:03:12.599> and<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.440> abstractions<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.160> mean

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
me start and the abstractions I mean

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.770 
me start and the abstractions I mean
this<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.519> just<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.730> regular<00:03:14.910> milling<00:03:15.390> machine

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
this is just a regular milling machine

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.750 
this is just a regular milling machine
and<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.530> think<00:03:16.590> what<00:03:16.799> we<00:03:16.890> can<00:03:17.040> be<00:03:17.160> able<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.459> do<00:03:17.579> is

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
and I think what we can be able to do is

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.060 
and I think what we can be able to do is
these<00:03:17.940> machines<00:03:18.329> have<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:19.320> no<00:03:19.410> control<00:03:19.739> it

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
these machines have you no control it

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.770 
these machines have you no control it
but<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.220> guy<00:03:20.370> has<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:20.790> be<00:03:20.820> there<00:03:21.150> doing<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.690> you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
but a guy has to be there doing it you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.569 
but a guy has to be there doing it you
know<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:21.900> can't<00:03:22.320> remotely<00:03:22.680> say<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.100> want<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.519> go

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
know I can't remotely say I want to go

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.490 
know I can't remotely say I want to go
into<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.820> machine<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.540> think<00:03:25.170> we're<00:03:25.320> going<00:03:25.410> to

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
into that machine I think we're going to

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.340 
into that machine I think we're going to
be<00:03:25.590> able<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.980> do<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.579> so<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.989> first<00:03:28.200> step

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
be able to do that and so the first step

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.110 
be able to do that and so the first step
is<00:03:28.650> sort<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.920> let's<00:03:29.130> take<00:03:29.430> these<00:03:29.579> machines<00:03:29.970> and

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
is sort of let's take these machines and

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.940 
is sort of let's take these machines and
then<00:03:30.209> get<00:03:30.540> them<00:03:30.750> abstracted<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:31.680> we<00:03:31.799> can

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
then get them abstracted so we can

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.640 
then get them abstracted so we can
access<00:03:32.880> them<00:03:33.030> remotely<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.690> then<00:03:34.319> after

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
access them remotely and then after

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.900 
access them remotely and then after
we've<00:03:34.769> got<00:03:34.950> all<00:03:35.160> these<00:03:35.310> different<00:03:35.489> commands

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
we've got all these different commands

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.550 
we've got all these different commands
and<00:03:36.120> everything<00:03:36.390> we<00:03:36.510> can<00:03:36.660> use<00:03:36.900> we<00:03:37.200> can<00:03:37.350> start

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
and everything we can use we can start

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.559 
and everything we can use we can start
saying<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.459> what<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.910> software<00:03:39.120> guys<00:03:39.390> have

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
saying and what the software guys have

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.330 
saying and what the software guys have
already<00:03:39.780> done<00:03:39.930> by<00:03:40.560> saying<00:03:40.859> let's<00:03:41.069> just<00:03:41.220> write

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
already done by saying let's just write

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.770 
already done by saying let's just write
a<00:03:41.370> function<00:03:41.609> for<00:03:42.000> this<00:03:42.120> or<00:03:42.329> a<00:03:42.359> script<00:03:42.720> that

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
a function for this or a script that

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.330 
a function for this or a script that
does<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.139> automatically<00:03:43.709> so<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.010> don't<00:03:44.190> have<00:03:44.250> to

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
does it automatically so I don't have to

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.039 
does it automatically so I don't have to
you<00:03:44.579> know<00:03:44.700> recalibrate<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.510> machine<00:03:45.840> every

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
you know recalibrate the machine every

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.199 
you know recalibrate the machine every
time<00:03:46.260> load<00:03:46.530> parts<00:03:46.980> let's<00:03:47.639> just<00:03:47.819> do<00:03:47.910> that<00:03:47.940> fully

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
time load parts let's just do that fully

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.050 
time load parts let's just do that fully
automatically<00:03:48.750> um<00:03:49.579> so<00:03:50.579> once<00:03:50.790> we<00:03:50.940> have<00:03:51.030> it

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
automatically um so once we have it

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.270 
automatically um so once we have it
automated<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:51.989> think<00:03:52.530> what<00:03:52.650> we<00:03:52.739> can<00:03:52.889> do<00:03:53.040> is<00:03:53.160> we

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
automated I think what we can do is we

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.920 
automated I think what we can do is we
can<00:03:53.310> start<00:03:53.670> getting<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.510> machines<00:03:54.810> and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
can start getting the machines and

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.440 
can start getting the machines and
putting<00:03:55.079> them<00:03:55.139> together<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.530> we<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.799> these

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
putting them together so we have these

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.910 
putting them together so we have these
interfaces<00:03:57.450> in<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.109> factory<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.799> will

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
interfaces in the factory that will

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.500 
interfaces in the factory that will
allow<00:03:59.069> us<00:03:59.100> to<00:03:59.280> build<00:03:59.579> kind<00:03:59.790> of<00:03:59.850> a<00:03:59.910> flexible

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
allow us to build kind of a flexible

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.210 
allow us to build kind of a flexible
line<00:04:00.750> on<00:04:01.019> demand<00:04:01.410> so<00:04:01.650> right<00:04:01.799> now<00:04:01.829> all<00:04:02.100> this

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
line on demand so right now all this

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.500 
line on demand so right now all this
stuff<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.549> kind<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.819> manual<00:04:03.030> either<00:04:03.359> have<00:04:03.480> a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
stuff is kind of manual either have a

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.840 
stuff is kind of manual either have a
line<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.900> set<00:04:04.170> up<00:04:04.319> or<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:05.370> can<00:04:05.549> kind<00:04:05.700> of<00:04:05.730> bring

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
line you set up or you can kind of bring

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.819 
line you set up or you can kind of bring
it<00:04:05.940> around<00:04:06.090> by<00:04:06.359> hand<00:04:06.720> but<00:04:07.440> what<00:04:07.560> can<00:04:07.650> happen

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
it around by hand but what can happen

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.650 
it around by hand but what can happen
now<00:04:08.130> is<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:08.400> can<00:04:08.519> actually<00:04:08.549> have<00:04:09.030> them<00:04:09.209> using

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
now is we can actually have them using

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.599 
now is we can actually have them using
both<00:04:09.810> manual<00:04:10.200> automation<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.190> moving<00:04:11.400> stuff

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
both manual automation and moving stuff

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.569 
both manual automation and moving stuff
around<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.920> automation<00:04:13.920> you<00:04:14.160> get<00:04:14.280> from<00:04:14.459> you

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
around and automation you get from you

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.250 
around and automation you get from you
know<00:04:14.670> digital<00:04:14.940> technologies<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.870> go<00:04:15.989> it<00:04:16.079> so<00:04:16.169> we

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
know digital technologies to go it so we

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.779 
know digital technologies to go it so we
can<00:04:16.350> go<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.590> entire<00:04:16.680> way<00:04:17.250> down<00:04:18.650> so<00:04:19.650> once<00:04:20.609> we

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
can go the entire way down so once we

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:21.949 
can go the entire way down so once we
have<00:04:20.880> all<00:04:20.940> these<00:04:21.030> things<00:04:21.180> network<00:04:21.570> just<00:04:21.840> like

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
have all these things network just like

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.719 
have all these things network just like
in<00:04:22.080> regular<00:04:22.770> computers<00:04:23.159> we<00:04:23.250> had<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:23.400> problem

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
in regular computers we had this problem

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.800 
in regular computers we had this problem
that<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.090> lot<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.390> guys<00:04:24.479> were<00:04:24.690> probably

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
that a lot of you guys were probably

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.230 
that a lot of you guys were probably
already<00:04:25.140> thinking<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.860> okay<00:04:26.280> machines<00:04:26.849> run

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
already thinking of okay machines run

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.339 
already thinking of okay machines run
this<00:04:27.389> already<00:04:27.750> but<00:04:27.960> who's<00:04:28.139> going<00:04:28.289> to

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349

actually<00:04:30.569> proto<00:04:30.870> there's<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.110> lot<00:04:31.199> of<00:04:31.229> these

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
actually proto there's a lot of these

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
setup costs that come each way we're

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.610 
setup costs that come each way we're
having<00:04:33.389> a<00:04:33.539> guy<00:04:33.690> have<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.870> do<00:04:34.110> this<00:04:34.319> but

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
having a guy have to do this but

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.920 
having a guy have to do this but
software<00:04:35.580> had<00:04:35.819> the<00:04:35.940> same<00:04:36.150> problem<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.750> back

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
software had the same problem and back

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.420 
software had the same problem and back
in<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.139> day<00:04:37.349> you<00:04:37.800> had<00:04:37.919> to<00:04:37.979> know<00:04:38.099> a<00:04:38.130> lot<00:04:38.310> about

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
in the day you had to know a lot about

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.430 
in the day you had to know a lot about
computers<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:39.090> math<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.660> even<00:04:39.870> program

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
computers and math to even program

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.620 
computers and math to even program
anything<00:04:40.830> but<00:04:41.550> with<00:04:41.759> the<00:04:41.849> compiler<00:04:42.419> you<00:04:42.569> know

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
anything but with the compiler you know

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.240 
anything but with the compiler you know
you<00:04:42.750> take<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:42.900> simple<00:04:43.289> human<00:04:43.889> readable

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
you take a simple human readable

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.460 
you take a simple human readable
language<00:04:44.639> in<00:04:44.759> code<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.419> you<00:04:45.990> can<00:04:46.020> pilot<00:04:46.380> a

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
language in code and you can pilot a

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.589 
language in code and you can pilot a
binary<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:47.190> in<00:04:47.759> manufacturer<00:04:48.389> we<00:04:48.479> have

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
binary and in manufacturer we have

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.089 
binary and in manufacturer we have
something<00:04:48.930> kind<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.259> like<00:04:49.410> that<00:04:49.590> called<00:04:49.800> cam

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
something kind of like that called cam

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.309 
something kind of like that called cam
computer-aided<00:04:50.759> manufacturing<00:04:51.139> they<00:04:52.139> can

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
computer-aided manufacturing they can

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.260 
computer-aided manufacturing they can
take<00:04:52.500> a<00:04:52.710> CAD<00:04:52.919> file<00:04:53.190> like<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.490> human<00:04:53.849> readable

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
take a CAD file like the human readable

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.080 
take a CAD file like the human readable
3d<00:04:54.930> object<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.710> then<00:04:56.069> turn<00:04:56.280> it<00:04:56.310> into<00:04:56.520> say<00:04:56.819> G

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
3d object and then turn it into say G

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.640 
3d object and then turn it into say G
code<00:04:57.300> which<00:04:57.479> is<00:04:57.630> like<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.780> milling<00:04:58.319> machines

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
code which is like the milling machines

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.710 
code which is like the milling machines
language<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.970> think<00:05:00.180> we<00:05:00.240> can<00:05:00.330> do<00:05:00.449> this<00:05:00.479> for

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
language and I think we can do this for

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.540 
language and I think we can do this for
each<00:05:00.900> step<00:05:01.319> along<00:05:01.349> the<00:05:01.590> way<00:05:01.770> so<00:05:01.919> eventually<00:05:02.310> we

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
each step along the way so eventually we

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.219 
each step along the way so eventually we
could<00:05:02.669> compile<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.210> design<00:05:03.509> to<00:05:03.720> a<00:05:03.750> mold

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
could compile the design to a mold

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.899 
could compile the design to a mold
without<00:05:04.830> having<00:05:05.069> to<00:05:05.130> have<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.280> mold<00:05:05.550> engineer

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
without having to have a mold engineer

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:07.580 
without having to have a mold engineer
in<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.030> way<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.479> in<00:05:06.870> this<00:05:06.960> way<00:05:07.199> we<00:05:07.409> can<00:05:07.440> sort

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
in the way and in this way we can sort

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.290 
in the way and in this way we can sort
of<00:05:07.830> empower<00:05:08.220> everyone<00:05:08.669> from<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.210> know<00:05:09.270> the

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
of empower everyone from you know the

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.420 
of empower everyone from you know the
engineering<00:05:09.840> level<00:05:10.020> direct<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:10.889> the<00:05:10.949> metal<00:05:11.310> on

engineering level direct to the metal on
the<00:05:11.580> floor<00:05:11.849> we<00:05:12.000> don't<00:05:12.150> have<00:05:12.240> actually

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
the floor we don't have actually

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.360 
the floor we don't have actually
interact<00:05:12.960> with<00:05:13.110> tons<00:05:13.380> of<00:05:13.530> these<00:05:13.680> sort<00:05:14.340> of

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
interact with tons of these sort of

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.040 
interact with tons of these sort of
intermediaries<00:05:15.210> um<00:05:17.180> there<00:05:18.180> we<00:05:18.300> go<00:05:18.449> so<00:05:18.960> you

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
intermediaries um there we go so you

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.939 
intermediaries um there we go so you
know<00:05:19.110> this<00:05:19.229> is<00:05:19.259> the<00:05:19.380> beautiful<00:05:19.500> thing<00:05:19.830> in

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
know this is the beautiful thing in

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.379 
know this is the beautiful thing in
programming<00:05:20.460> like<00:05:20.610> we<00:05:20.699> can<00:05:20.849> just<00:05:20.880> write

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
programming like we can just write

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.120 
programming like we can just write
something<00:05:21.840> hit<00:05:22.020> go<00:05:22.319> and<00:05:22.349> we<00:05:22.740> get<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:22.889> syntax

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
something hit go and we get a syntax

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.710 
something hit go and we get a syntax
tear<00:05:23.610> you<00:05:23.759> know<00:05:23.819> instantly<00:05:24.300> so<00:05:24.479> this<00:05:24.599> is

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
tear you know instantly so this is

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.290 
tear you know instantly so this is
seconds<00:05:25.289> for<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.830> design<00:05:26.190> loop<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:27.060> know<00:05:27.150> in

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
seconds for the design loop you know in

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.550 
seconds for the design loop you know in
manufacturing<00:05:27.870> you<00:05:27.990> got<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.169> do<00:05:28.259> all<00:05:28.319> these

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
manufacturing you got to do all these

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.559 
manufacturing you got to do all these
people<00:05:28.620> that's<00:05:29.220> like<00:05:29.430> months<00:05:30.000> by<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.360> time

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 
people that's like months by the time

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.420 
people that's like months by the time
you<00:05:30.720> have<00:05:30.810> all<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.139> stuff<00:05:31.349> debugged<00:05:31.860> why

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
you have all the stuff debugged why

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.790 
you have all the stuff debugged why
can't<00:05:32.669> we<00:05:32.789> debunk<00:05:33.210> a<00:05:33.810> simulation<00:05:34.349> program

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
can't we debunk a simulation program

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.620 
can't we debunk a simulation program
we're<00:05:35.039> using<00:05:35.219> direct<00:05:36.000> access<00:05:36.389> to<00:05:36.449> the

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
we're using direct access to the

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.999 
we're using direct access to the
machines<00:05:36.930> that<00:05:37.080> give<00:05:37.259> you<00:05:37.380> errors<00:05:37.740> you<00:05:37.949> know

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
machines that give you errors you know

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:39.770 
machines that give you errors you know
all<00:05:38.190> this<00:05:38.310> is<00:05:38.490> not<00:05:38.639> exposed<00:05:39.090> because<00:05:39.570> each

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
all this is not exposed because each

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.749 
all this is not exposed because each
layer<00:05:40.349> of<00:05:40.590> manufacturing<00:05:41.250> is<00:05:41.460> sort<00:05:41.729> of

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
layer of manufacturing is sort of

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.060 
layer of manufacturing is sort of
abstracted<00:05:42.330> behind<00:05:42.599> people<00:05:42.930> so<00:05:43.650> I<00:05:43.680> think<00:05:43.800> we

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
abstracted behind people so I think we

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.040 
abstracted behind people so I think we
can<00:05:44.190> do<00:05:44.370> that<00:05:44.479> and<00:05:45.479> so<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:45.659> guess<00:05:45.870> I'll<00:05:46.020> just

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
can do that and so I guess I'll just

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.420 
can do that and so I guess I'll just
finish<00:05:46.349> up<00:05:46.590> I<00:05:46.740> think<00:05:46.800> that<00:05:47.070> we<00:05:47.159> don't<00:05:47.250> just

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
finish up I think that we don't just

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.820 
finish up I think that we don't just
need<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.789> have<00:05:48.360> digital<00:05:48.810> you<00:05:49.169> know<00:05:49.289> additive

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
need to have digital you know additive

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.830 
need to have digital you know additive
manufacturing<00:05:49.889> like<00:05:50.610> you<00:05:50.820> know<00:05:50.909> from<00:05:51.360> shopbop

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
manufacturing like you know from shopbop

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.969 
manufacturing like you know from shopbop
there's<00:05:52.139> a<00:05:52.199> bunch<00:05:52.440> of<00:05:52.500> different<00:05:52.560> types<00:05:52.889> of

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
there's a bunch of different types of

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.050 
there's a bunch of different types of
manufacturing<00:05:53.490> we<00:05:53.580> need<00:05:53.699> to<00:05:53.759> think<00:05:53.820> of<00:05:53.969> this

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
manufacturing we need to think of this

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.969 
manufacturing we need to think of this
holistically<00:05:54.630> from<00:05:54.870> like<00:05:55.020> glass<00:05:55.560> blowing

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
holistically from like glass blowing

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.860 
holistically from like glass blowing
machines<00:05:56.460> all<00:05:56.699> the<00:05:56.729> way<00:05:56.880> to<00:05:56.940> C&amp;C<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:57.599> stuff<00:05:57.750> we

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
machines all the way to C&amp;C and stuff we

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.170 
machines all the way to C&amp;C and stuff we
know<00:05:57.960> today<00:05:58.169> this<00:05:59.009> stuff<00:05:59.219> will<00:05:59.310> be<00:05:59.460> abstracted

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
know today this stuff will be abstracted

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.700 
know today this stuff will be abstracted
will<00:06:00.360> be<00:06:00.449> able<00:06:00.509> to<00:06:00.630> use<00:06:00.870> it<00:06:00.900> and<00:06:01.199> much<00:06:01.289> more<00:06:01.560> on

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
will be able to use it and much more on

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.649 
will be able to use it and much more on
the<00:06:02.219> middle<00:06:02.520> way<00:06:02.729> and<00:06:03.120> this<00:06:03.419> is<00:06:03.479> going<00:06:03.599> to

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
the middle way and this is going to

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:05.360 
the middle way and this is going to
empower<00:06:03.900> engineers<00:06:04.409> and<00:06:04.830> all<00:06:05.039> the<00:06:05.159> different

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
empower engineers and all the different

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.200 
empower engineers and all the different
barriers<00:06:05.580> we<00:06:05.699> talked<00:06:05.880> about<00:06:06.000> from<00:06:06.120> the

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
barriers we talked about from the

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.820 
barriers we talked about from the
inventory<00:06:06.719> problems<00:06:06.990> the<00:06:07.349> set-up<00:06:07.530> cost

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
inventory problems the set-up cost

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.620 
inventory problems the set-up cost
problems<00:06:08.310> these<00:06:08.759> things<00:06:08.880> are<00:06:09.060> really<00:06:09.210> just<00:06:09.479> a

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
problems these things are really just a

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.330 
problems these things are really just a
lot<00:06:09.990> of<00:06:10.139> engineering<00:06:10.440> time<00:06:10.830> that<00:06:11.039> goes<00:06:11.159> into

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
lot of engineering time that goes into

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.100 
lot of engineering time that goes into
it<00:06:11.520> which<00:06:11.729> if<00:06:12.000> you<00:06:12.090> had<00:06:12.270> to<00:06:12.389> hand<00:06:12.659> write<00:06:12.750> stuff

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
it which if you had to hand write stuff

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.230 
it which if you had to hand write stuff
at<00:06:13.259> a<00:06:13.319> compiler<00:06:13.800> would<00:06:13.919> be<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:14.130> same<00:06:14.340> thing<00:06:14.370> so

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
at a compiler would be the same thing so

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.749 
at a compiler would be the same thing so
we<00:06:15.330> can<00:06:15.449> eliminate<00:06:15.690> these<00:06:16.139> costs<00:06:16.740> by<00:06:16.889> making

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
we can eliminate these costs by making

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.309 
we can eliminate these costs by making
these<00:06:17.880> arias<00:06:18.270> layers<00:06:18.449> of<00:06:18.599> automation<00:06:18.930> and

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 
these arias layers of automation and

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.529 
these arias layers of automation and
making<00:06:19.590> a<00:06:19.710> lamp<00:06:19.919> stack<00:06:20.190> of<00:06:20.430> manufacturing<00:06:21.090> so

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
making a lamp stack of manufacturing so

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:22.520 
making a lamp stack of manufacturing so
I<00:06:21.569> guess<00:06:21.659> they'll<00:06:21.840> say<00:06:21.990> that<00:06:22.139> I<00:06:22.169> think

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
I guess they'll say that I think

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.200 
I guess they'll say that I think
manufacturing<00:06:23.219> we<00:06:23.340> can<00:06:23.490> rebuild<00:06:23.639> it<00:06:23.909> and<00:06:24.060> we

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
manufacturing we can rebuild it and we

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.749 
manufacturing we can rebuild it and we
have<00:06:24.360> the<00:06:24.539> technology<00:06:24.690> and<00:06:25.639> thanks<00:06:26.639> for

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
have the technology and thanks for

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.090 
have the technology and thanks for
having<00:06:26.909> me<00:06:26.969> out
