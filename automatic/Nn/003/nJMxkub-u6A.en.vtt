you read up about sort of heat gaskets

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.020 
you read up about sort of heat gaskets
they're<00:02:10.039> gonna<00:02:10.160> tell<00:02:10.429> ya<00:02:11.260> clean<00:02:12.260> dry<00:02:12.470> surface

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
they're gonna tell ya clean dry surface

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.710 
they're gonna tell ya clean dry surface
that's<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.150> must<00:02:14.890> clean<00:02:15.890> out<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.190> bolt<00:02:16.370> holes

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
that's a must clean out the bolt holes

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.140 
that's a must clean out the bolt holes
that's<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.870> must

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
that's a must

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.550 
that's a must
that's<00:02:20.150> two<00:02:20.480> things<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.930> certainly<00:02:21.290> have<00:02:21.440> to

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
that's two things you certainly have to

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.520 
that's two things you certainly have to
do<00:02:21.740> on<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:22.340> particular<00:02:22.700> engine<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:24.200> bolts

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
do on this particular engine the bolts

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.949 
do on this particular engine the bolts
are<00:02:24.680> talked<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.280> yield<00:02:25.670> bolts<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.480> you

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
are talked to yield bolts so you

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.570 
are talked to yield bolts so you
wouldn't<00:02:27.170> use<00:02:27.350> those<00:02:27.530> again<00:02:27.860> fear<00:02:28.370> that

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
wouldn't use those again fear that

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.710 
wouldn't use those again fear that
they'll<00:02:28.730> stretch<00:02:30.010> as<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:32.240> default

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
they'll stretch as it is the default

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.010 
they'll stretch as it is the default
tension<00:02:33.140> is<00:02:33.260> 25<00:02:33.910> pounds<00:02:34.910> per<00:02:35.060> square<00:02:35.090> foot

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
tension is 25 pounds per square foot

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.150 
tension is 25 pounds per square foot
and<00:02:39.750> it's<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.960> first<00:02:41.350> stage<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.860> then<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.010> go

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
and it's the first stage and then you go

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.070 
and it's the first stage and then you go
to<00:02:42.190> three<00:02:42.490> stages<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:43.150> 90<00:02:43.480> degrees

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
to three stages of 90 degrees

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.180 
to three stages of 90 degrees
boom<00:02:44.290> boom<00:02:44.740> boom<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:47.440> figure<00:02:47.710> that's<00:02:47.800> pretty

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
boom boom boom you figure that's pretty

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.750 
boom boom boom you figure that's pretty
that's<00:02:48.460> a<00:02:48.610> pretty<00:02:48.820> fair<00:02:49.060> old<00:02:49.270> piece<00:02:50.080> of<00:02:50.760> talk

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
that's a pretty fair old piece of talk

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.910 
that's a pretty fair old piece of talk
beyond<00:02:52.150> involves<00:02:52.630> but<00:02:52.870> that's<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.650> way<00:02:53.770> they

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
beyond involves but that's the way they

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.370 
beyond involves but that's the way they
designed<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.720> now<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.780> was<00:02:56.020> saying<00:02:56.260> about

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
designed it now I was saying about

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.410 
designed it now I was saying about
putting<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:57.850> know<00:02:58.020> clean<00:02:59.020> dry<00:02:59.200> surface<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
putting you know clean dry surface and

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.270 
putting you know clean dry surface and
in<00:03:01.540> all<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.750> all<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.260> situations<00:03:02.920> you'll<00:03:03.100> see

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
in all of all this situations you'll see

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.900 
in all of all this situations you'll see
on<00:03:03.430> on<00:03:05.820> most<00:03:06.820> engine<00:03:07.210> shops<00:03:07.450> or<00:03:07.600> whatever<00:03:08.910> you

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
on on most engine shops or whatever you

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.340 
on on most engine shops or whatever you
never<00:03:10.090> put<00:03:10.270> anything<00:03:10.420> on<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.750> surface<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.260> the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
never put anything on the surface to the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.560 
never put anything on the surface to the
gasket<00:03:11.770> no<00:03:11.920> put<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.190> glue<00:03:12.550> or<00:03:13.000> anything<00:03:13.330> like

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
gasket no put it glue or anything like

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.020 
gasket no put it glue or anything like
that<00:03:14.070> actually<00:03:15.070> worked<00:03:15.400> with<00:03:15.520> a<00:03:15.640> bike<00:03:15.850> that

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
that actually worked with a bike that

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.210 
that actually worked with a bike that
thought<00:03:16.210> it<00:03:16.330> was<00:03:16.450> great<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.780> put<00:03:17.070> grease<00:03:18.070> on

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
thought it was great to put grease on

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.860 
thought it was great to put grease on
each<00:03:18.370> cylinder<00:03:18.670> he<00:03:18.880> person<00:03:19.240> and<00:03:19.510> he<00:03:19.600> flopped

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
each cylinder he person and he flopped

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.360 
each cylinder he person and he flopped
because<00:03:20.110> we<00:03:20.320> put<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.560> gasket<00:03:20.770> on<00:03:21.040> because<00:03:21.280> it

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
because we put the gasket on because it

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.830 
because we put the gasket on because it
was<00:03:21.460> easier<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.820> replace<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.330> head<00:03:22.480> gasket

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
was easier to replace the head gasket

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
was easier to replace the head gasket
when<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.050> boys<00:03:23.260> why<00:03:24.250> did<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.550> blow<00:03:24.670> do<00:03:25.420> it

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
when it boys why did it blow do it

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.360 
when it boys why did it blow do it
anyway<00:03:26.860> here's<00:03:27.430> what<00:03:27.490> I<00:03:27.640> was<00:03:27.700> going<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:27.970> say

not now all right they were like

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.740 
not now all right they were like
horsepower<00:04:03.880> engines<00:04:04.270> and<00:04:04.450> they<00:04:04.540> were<00:04:04.600> looking

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
horsepower engines and they were looking

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.120 
horsepower engines and they were looking
for<00:04:05.200> a<00:04:05.260> reason<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:06.090> resolve<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.330> that<00:04:08.130> gasket

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
for a reason to resolve to that gasket

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.430 
for a reason to resolve to that gasket
well<00:04:09.510> I've<00:04:10.510> been<00:04:10.660> doing<00:04:10.900> this<00:04:10.960> for<00:04:11.170> thirty

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
well I've been doing this for thirty

well I've been doing this for thirty
years<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:12.010> guess<00:04:12.220> use<00:04:12.460> on<00:04:12.610> this<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.660> goes

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
years I guess use on this and it goes

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.810 
years I guess use on this and it goes
against<00:04:14.230> all<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.680> rules<00:04:14.860> but<00:04:15.100> just<00:04:15.460> goes<00:04:15.640> to

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
against all the rules but just goes to

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.010 
against all the rules but just goes to
show<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.210> and<00:04:16.510> I've<00:04:16.600> never<00:04:16.840> had<00:04:16.989> a

both the block I'm going to put the

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.990 
both the block I'm going to put the
gasket<00:04:39.500> on<00:04:39.800> I'll<00:04:40.070> put<00:04:40.400> it<00:04:40.490> around<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.790> gasket

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
gasket on I'll put it around the gasket

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.340 
gasket on I'll put it around the gasket
as<00:04:41.270> well<00:04:41.450> I<00:04:41.630> won't<00:04:41.840> put<00:04:42.020> it<00:04:42.110> around<00:04:42.170> the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
as well I won't put it around the

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.840 
as well I won't put it around the
sealing<00:04:42.740> ring<00:04:42.890> because<00:04:43.130> that's<00:04:43.280> a<00:04:43.370> steel<00:04:43.640> ring

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
sealing ring because that's a steel ring

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:51.640 
sealing ring because that's a steel ring
and<00:04:44.120> that<00:04:45.050> does<00:04:45.200> it<00:04:45.350> sound<00:04:45.560> job<00:04:46.750> but<00:04:47.750> uh<00:04:50.650> what

head<00:07:21.310> back<00:07:21.490> on<00:07:22.409> and<00:07:27.270> I'll<00:07:28.270> get<00:07:28.449> it<00:07:28.539> making<00:07:28.780> a

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 
head back on and I'll get it making a

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.460 
head back on and I'll get it making a
noise<00:07:28.960> again

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470 
noise again

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.930 
noise again
once<00:07:29.830> I've<00:07:29.979> done<00:07:30.069> that<00:07:30.130> I<00:07:30.310> might<00:07:30.550> even<00:07:30.669> have<00:07:30.819> to

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:30.940 
once I've done that I might even have to

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.200 
once I've done that I might even have to
pull<00:07:31.120> ass<00:07:31.210> up<00:07:31.360> off<00:07:31.509> this<00:07:31.659> thing<00:07:31.870> yet<00:07:32.050> because

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.210 
pull ass up off this thing yet because

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.339 
pull ass up off this thing yet because
it's<00:07:34.210> a<00:07:34.270> little<00:07:34.419> hard<00:07:34.539> to<00:07:34.840> distinguish

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:35.349 
it's a little hard to distinguish

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:37.469 
it's a little hard to distinguish
whether<00:07:35.590> or<00:07:35.800> not<00:07:35.889> there<00:07:36.099> was<00:07:36.220> a<00:07:36.300> banging<00:07:37.300> in

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 
whether or not there was a banging in

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:38.909 
whether or not there was a banging in
the<00:07:37.539> bottom<00:07:37.840> or<00:07:38.020> of<00:07:38.289> course<00:07:38.530> I've<00:07:38.710> tossed

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 
the bottom or of course I've tossed

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:40.409 
the bottom or of course I've tossed
Reggie<00:07:39.190> the<00:07:39.400> gasket<00:07:39.789> where<00:07:39.940> it's<00:07:40.120> all<00:07:40.240> going

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:40.419 
Reggie the gasket where it's all going

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:41.730 
Reggie the gasket where it's all going
out<00:07:40.569> of<00:07:40.690> shape<00:07:40.870> it's<00:07:41.080> been<00:07:41.139> hitting<00:07:41.530> on<00:07:41.620> the

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:41.740 
out of shape it's been hitting on the

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.790 
out of shape it's been hitting on the
piston<00:07:42.719> when<00:07:43.719> I<00:07:43.810> say<00:07:43.990> hitting<00:07:44.229> on<00:07:44.319> the<00:07:44.409> piston

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 
piston when I say hitting on the piston

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.860 
piston when I say hitting on the piston
you<00:07:44.889> can<00:07:45.039> see<00:07:45.190> how<00:07:45.340> far<00:07:46.180> it<00:07:46.300> was<00:07:46.360> overhanging

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:46.870 
you can see how far it was overhanging

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.469 
you can see how far it was overhanging
in<00:07:47.080> this<00:07:47.229> in<00:07:47.530> the<00:07:47.650> cylinder<00:07:48.009> wall<00:07:48.190> and<00:07:49.090> that<00:07:49.270> is

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479 
in this in the cylinder wall and that is

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:53.029 
in this in the cylinder wall and that is
flush<00:07:50.039> so<00:07:51.039> it<00:07:51.190> had<00:07:51.310> to<00:07:51.340> bang<00:07:51.610> at<00:07:52.330> the<00:07:52.389> bank

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 
flush so it had to bang at the bank

00:07:53.039 --> 00:08:00.110 
flush so it had to bang at the bank
