00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
you the new PI face control and display

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.040 
you the new PI face control and display
so<00:00:14.379> today<00:00:15.040> I'm<00:00:15.309> just<00:00:15.429> going<00:00:15.610> to<00:00:15.639> show<00:00:15.849> you<00:00:16.050> how

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
so today I'm just going to show you how

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.130 
so today I'm just going to show you how
to<00:00:17.110> set<00:00:17.350> it<00:00:17.380> up<00:00:17.619> and<00:00:17.949> what<00:00:18.369> I'll<00:00:18.609> do<00:00:19.140> so

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
to set it up and what I'll do so

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.109 
to set it up and what I'll do so
controlling<00:00:20.650> display<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:22.240> a<00:00:22.769> LCD<00:00:23.769> display

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
controlling display is a LCD display

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.310 
controlling display is a LCD display
which<00:00:25.119> will<00:00:25.300> display<00:00:25.599> status<00:00:26.050> information

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
which will display status information

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.230 
which will display status information
for<00:00:26.859> the<00:00:26.920> Raspberry<00:00:27.189> Pi<00:00:27.220> and<00:00:27.849> then<00:00:27.970> a<00:00:28.029> series

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
for the Raspberry Pi and then a series

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.839 
for the Raspberry Pi and then a series
of<00:00:28.480> buttons<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.920> you<00:00:29.980> can<00:00:30.010> use<00:00:30.160> to<00:00:30.490> interact

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
of buttons that you can use to interact

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.609 
of buttons that you can use to interact
with<00:00:31.179> the<00:00:31.599> Raspberry<00:00:31.840> Pi<00:00:31.869> it's<00:00:32.140> also<00:00:32.320> got<00:00:32.529> an

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
with the Raspberry Pi it's also got an

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.710 
with the Raspberry Pi it's also got an
infrared<00:00:32.830> receiver<00:00:33.040> so<00:00:33.970> it's<00:00:34.210> really<00:00:34.390> easy<00:00:34.690> to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
infrared receiver so it's really easy to

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.570 
infrared receiver so it's really easy to
set<00:00:35.020> up<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.470> I'm<00:00:35.650> just<00:00:35.830> going<00:00:35.980> to<00:00:36.040> run<00:00:36.430> you

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
set up and I'm just going to run you

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.010 
set up and I'm just going to run you
through<00:00:36.610> a<00:00:36.820> short<00:00:36.880> video<00:00:37.330> showing<00:00:37.420> how<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:37.780> do

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
through a short video showing how to do

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.780 
through a short video showing how to do
it<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.910> first<00:00:40.090> thing<00:00:40.300> we<00:00:40.390> do<00:00:40.540> is<00:00:41.470> we<00:00:41.730> with<00:00:42.730> the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
it so first thing we do is we with the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.340 
it so first thing we do is we with the
Raspberry<00:00:43.060> Pi<00:00:43.120> turned<00:00:43.480> up<00:00:43.690> we<00:00:43.840> just<00:00:43.960> put<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.260> on

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
Raspberry Pi turned up we just put it on

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.250 
Raspberry Pi turned up we just put it on
so<00:00:44.620> that's<00:00:44.710> nice<00:00:44.950> and<00:00:45.160> simple<00:00:45.490> just<00:00:46.260> connect

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
so that's nice and simple just connect

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
so that's nice and simple just connect
up<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:47.500> rescue<00:00:47.740> PI<00:00:47.920> as<00:00:48.190> usual<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.160> got

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
up the rescue PI as usual so you got

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.260 
up the rescue PI as usual so you got
Network<00:00:52.800> keyboard

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:07.289 

nice<00:00:59.570> power

typing - 3 and they've got spikes then I

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.210 
typing - 3 and they've got spikes then I
need<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.290> tell<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.620> where<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.890> sample

need to tell you where the sample

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.860 
need to tell you where the sample
program<00:03:58.549> at<00:03:58.670> ease<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.209> sample<00:03:59.510> program

program at ease and the sample program

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:08.920 
program at ease and the sample program
is<00:04:00.049> user<00:04:00.860> so<00:04:01.810> us<00:04:02.810> are<00:04:03.190> /<00:04:04.420> yeah<00:04:05.420> /<00:04:07.480> doc
