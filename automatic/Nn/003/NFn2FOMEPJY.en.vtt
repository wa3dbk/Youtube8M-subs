can<00:01:39.509> they<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.750> about<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.799> some

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
can they do about it so I have some

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.880 
can they do about it so I have some
thoughts<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.549> own<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.970> think<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:43.710> game

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
thoughts on my own I think that the game

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.580 
thoughts on my own I think that the game
probably<00:01:44.130> has<00:01:44.549> enough<00:01:45.180> big<00:01:45.630> maps<00:01:45.899> built<00:01:46.200> into

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
probably has enough big maps built into

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.280 
probably has enough big maps built into
it<00:01:46.740> already<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.759> when<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> next<00:01:48.780> map<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
it already so when the next map have to

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.469 
it already so when the next map have to
come<00:01:49.470> out<00:01:49.649> I'll<00:01:49.979> look<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:50.850> small<00:01:51.210> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
come out I'll look for more small and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.160 
come out I'll look for more small and
medium<00:01:51.840> sized<00:01:52.079> Maps<00:01:52.380> than<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.220> had<00:01:53.430> today

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
medium sized Maps than we had today

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.139 
medium sized Maps than we had today
another<00:01:55.170> thing<00:01:55.350> I'd<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:55.979> from<00:01:56.880> black

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
another thing I'd like to see from black

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.170 
another thing I'd like to see from black
ops<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.829> more<00:01:58.829> colorful<00:01:59.040> Maps<00:01:59.460> now<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.969> might

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
ops is more colorful Maps now this might

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.990 
ops is more colorful Maps now this might
just<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.540> me<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.590> find<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.399> color<00:02:02.640> set

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
just be me but I find that the color set

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.340 
just be me but I find that the color set
that's<00:02:03.210> used<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.840> course<00:02:04.020> I'm<00:02:04.229> playing

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
that's used of course I'm playing

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.420 
that's used of course I'm playing
nuketown<00:02:04.770> which<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.009> actually<00:02:05.280> pretty

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
nuketown which is actually pretty

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.240 
nuketown which is actually pretty
attractive<00:02:05.700> map<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.240> my<00:02:06.360> mind<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.829> color

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
attractive map in my mind but the color

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.420 
attractive map in my mind but the color
set<00:02:08.550> used<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:10.020> lot<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.379> black<00:02:10.560> ops<00:02:10.739> maps<00:02:11.009> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
set used in a lot of black ops maps and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.400 
set used in a lot of black ops maps and
a<00:02:11.489> lot<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.640> world<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.940> war<00:02:12.090> map

black<00:02:37.010> ops<00:02:37.310> add<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.640> few<00:02:38.030> more<00:02:38.060> maps<00:02:38.450> where<00:02:38.900> you

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
black ops add a few more maps where you

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.810 
black ops add a few more maps where you
know<00:02:39.410> your<00:02:39.560> jaw<00:02:39.740> just<00:02:39.770> dropped<00:02:40.220> remember<00:02:40.670> when

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
know your jaw just dropped remember when

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.780 
know your jaw just dropped remember when
the<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.480> cod<00:02:41.690> 4<00:02:41.960> maps<00:02:42.140> came<00:02:42.440> out<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:43.610> was<00:02:43.700> like

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
the the cod 4 maps came out it was like

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.520 
the the cod 4 maps came out it was like

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
they took these old maps and made them

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.160 
they took these old maps and made them
great<00:02:48.890> yeah<00:02:49.430> they<00:02:49.940> played<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.570> same<00:02:50.750> they

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
great yeah they played the same they

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.650 
great yeah they played the same they
took<00:02:51.470> some<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.830> best<00:02:52.010> old<00:02:52.220> maps<00:02:52.460> and<00:02:52.790> they

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
took some of the best old maps and they

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.270 
took some of the best old maps and they
played<00:02:53.930> just<00:02:54.200> as<00:02:54.320> well<00:02:54.500> as<00:02:54.620> they<00:02:54.740> always<00:02:54.950> did

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
played just as well as they always did

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.860 
played just as well as they always did
but<00:02:56.650> they<00:02:57.650> looked<00:02:57.890> better<00:02:58.040> than<00:02:58.280> ever<00:02:58.460> so<00:02:58.870> I'd

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
but they looked better than ever so I'd

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.510 
but they looked better than ever so I'd
like<00:03:00.020> to<00:03:00.080> see<00:03:00.290> black<00:03:00.500> ops<00:03:00.710> add<00:03:00.980> some<00:03:01.280> maps

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
like to see black ops add some maps

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.120 
like to see black ops add some maps
Bailey<00:03:02.390> should<00:03:02.570> have<00:03:02.720> more<00:03:02.870> colors<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.560> I

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
Bailey should have more colors and I

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.530 
Bailey should have more colors and I
think<00:03:04.160> they<00:03:04.460> should<00:03:04.640> be<00:03:04.760> small<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.210> medium

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
think they should be small to medium

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.300 
think they should be small to medium
size<00:03:05.780> another<00:03:06.380> thing<00:03:06.500> black<00:03:06.680> ops<00:03:06.890> could<00:03:07.130> do

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
size another thing black ops could do

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.370 
size another thing black ops could do
that<00:03:07.760> would<00:03:07.910> improve<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.690> way<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:08.990> game<00:03:09.230> is

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
that would improve the way this game is

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.680 
that would improve the way this game is
playing<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:10.340> put<00:03:10.640> a<00:03:10.670> higher<00:03:10.910> emphasis<00:03:11.150> on

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
playing is put a higher emphasis on

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.320 
playing is put a higher emphasis on
getting<00:03:11.870> six<00:03:12.260> people<00:03:12.560> in<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.770> game<00:03:13.240> part<00:03:14.240> of

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
getting six people in the game part of

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.390 
getting six people in the game part of
the<00:03:14.390> problem<00:03:14.870> is<00:03:15.050> you<00:03:15.290> know<00:03:15.920> they<00:03:16.040> have<00:03:16.190> lots

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
the problem is you know they have lots

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.060 
the problem is you know they have lots
of<00:03:16.520> big<00:03:16.670> maps<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.530> along<00:03:18.530> with<00:03:18.709> those<00:03:18.830> big

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
of big maps and along with those big

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.180 
of big maps and along with those big
maps<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.520> often<00:03:19.850> have<00:03:20.000> games<00:03:20.300> that<00:03:21.190> devolve

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
maps you often have games that devolve

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.640 
maps you often have games that devolve
into<00:03:22.520> three<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.570> three<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:23.840> four<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.440> four

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
into three and three and four and four

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.520 
into three and three and four and four
matches<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.660> they're<00:03:26.660> just<00:03:26.900> too<00:03:27.080> big<00:03:27.290> to

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
matches and they're just too big to

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.590 
matches and they're just too big to
support<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.220> kind<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.580> gameplay<00:03:28.790> and

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
support that kind of gameplay and

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.720 
support that kind of gameplay and
especially<00:03:30.200> sorry<00:03:30.740> I<00:03:30.890> play<00:03:31.340> with<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.520> team<00:03:31.700> a

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
especially sorry I play with the team a

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.920 
especially sorry I play with the team a
lot<00:03:31.940> all<00:03:32.120> my<00:03:32.209> friends<00:03:32.510> know<00:03:32.660> this<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:34.930> because

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
lot all my friends know this and because

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.080 
lot all my friends know this and because
of<00:03:35.959> that<00:03:36.110> I<00:03:36.500> think<00:03:36.980> we're<00:03:37.280> more<00:03:37.459> likely<00:03:37.910> to

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
of that I think we're more likely to

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.330 
of that I think we're more likely to
have<00:03:38.240> guys<00:03:38.690> on<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:38.990> other<00:03:39.020> team<00:03:39.260> back<00:03:39.740> out<00:03:39.980> and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
have guys on the other team back out and

you know not to haze them too much for

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.840 
you know not to haze them too much for
you<00:03:42.140> because<00:03:42.350> they're<00:03:43.130> up<00:03:43.280> against<00:03:43.640> guys<00:03:43.790> who

and the last thing I'd like to see from

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.620 
and the last thing I'd like to see from
black<00:05:16.100> ops<00:05:16.280> especially<00:05:17.120> right<00:05:17.330> now<00:05:17.360> because

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
black ops especially right now because

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.240 
black ops especially right now because
it's<00:05:17.870> sort<00:05:18.020> of<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.140> undisputed<00:05:18.650> king<00:05:19.100> of

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
it's sort of the undisputed king of

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.770 
it's sort of the undisputed king of
first-person<00:05:19.820> shooters<00:05:20.090> you<00:05:20.180> can<00:05:20.390> support<00:05:20.690> a

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
first-person shooters you can support a

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.300 
first-person shooters you can support a
lot<00:05:20.930> of<00:05:20.960> playlists<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:21.620> think<00:05:22.190> it'd<00:05:22.280> be

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
lot of playlists I think it'd be

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.800 
lot of playlists I think it'd be
interesting<00:05:22.400> if<00:05:22.970> they<00:05:23.060> did<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.240> playlist<00:05:23.480> where

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
interesting if they did a playlist where

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.230 
interesting if they did a playlist where
killstreak<00:05:24.290> stacked<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:25.190> know<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:25.880> can<00:05:26.060> play

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
killstreak stacked you know you can play

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.580 
killstreak stacked you know you can play
it<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.450> way<00:05:26.570> that<00:05:26.600> they<00:05:26.870> designed<00:05:27.230> it<00:05:27.350> the<00:05:27.470> way

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
it the way that they designed it the way

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.560 
it the way that they designed it the way
it<00:05:27.710> is<00:05:27.800> now<00:05:28.010> or<00:05:28.670> you<00:05:29.000> could<00:05:29.150> go<00:05:29.300> over<00:05:29.390> to<00:05:29.480> a

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
it is now or you could go over to a

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.570 
it is now or you could go over to a
playlist<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:30.260> try<00:05:30.560> stacking<00:05:31.100> kill<00:05:31.310> streaks

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
playlist and try stacking kill streaks

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.250 
playlist and try stacking kill streaks
and<00:05:31.820> that<00:05:32.390> you<00:05:32.840> know<00:05:32.900> that'd<00:05:33.050> be<00:05:33.140> an

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
and that you know that'd be an

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.450 
and that you know that'd be an
interesting<00:05:33.320> alternative<00:05:33.710> I<00:05:34.070> wonder<00:05:34.310> how

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
interesting alternative I wonder how

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.820 
interesting alternative I wonder how
modern<00:05:35.060> warfare<00:05:35.210> would<00:05:35.510> play<00:05:35.720> out<00:05:35.900> if<00:05:36.140> you<00:05:36.650> had

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
modern warfare would play out if you had

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.320 
modern warfare would play out if you had
stackable<00:05:37.400> kill<00:05:37.550> streaks<00:05:37.790> so<00:05:37.940> you<00:05:38.030> could<00:05:38.180> have

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
stackable kill streaks so you could have

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.390 
stackable kill streaks so you could have
you<00:05:38.540> know<00:05:38.570> bare-bones<00:05:39.100> traditional<00:05:40.100> and

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
you know bare-bones traditional and

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.220 
you know bare-bones traditional and
stacking<00:05:40.730> kill<00:05:41.060> streaks<00:05:41.330> I<00:05:41.540> think<00:05:41.990> that'd<00:05:42.110> be

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
stacking kill streaks I think that'd be

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.230 
stacking kill streaks I think that'd be
a<00:05:42.260> pretty<00:05:42.530> neat<00:05:42.710> update<00:05:43.160> and<00:05:43.430> see<00:05:43.610> if<00:05:43.730> it<00:05:44.090> makes

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
a pretty neat update and see if it makes

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:52.460 
a pretty neat update and see if it makes
black<00:05:44.450> ops<00:05:44.660> really<00:05:44.930> site<00:05:45.140> you<00:05:45.380> know<00:05:45.470> exciting

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.530
