00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.609
 There are those who think that having sugar in 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.309
 high blood is something that only has to 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.560
 worry people with diabetes and 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.240
 that's a serious mistake since keeping 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.880
 for a long time the level of sugar 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.679
 in high blood can make you 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:23.500
 you also end up developing diabetes 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:26.200
 welcome to the reef 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.810
 the saying goes that we only remember 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.670
 santa barbara when it thunders and that's 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.640
 something that we have to change little by little 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.420
 because prevention is the best weapon 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.010
 that we have before any ailment by 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.379
 so much for those who want 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.860
 prevent as for those who already need 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.550
 heal here we have 7 foods that come down 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:52.420
 the level of blood sugar 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.449
 1 the cinnamon important for pre people 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.040
 diabetes or type 2 diabetes and 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.070
 like anyone who wants 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.220
 control sugar intake of cinnamon 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.320
 or your fasting extract lowers the level of 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.520
 blood glucose 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.950
 2 the blueberry this fruit works two 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.200
 different ways on the one hand helps 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.780
 secrete insulin that is the one that controls 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.240
 the level of blood glucose and on the other 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.690
 part promotes the absorption of glucose 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.600
 on the part of the cells this double 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.550
 action makes the cranberry one of 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.410
 the best options for those who 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.140
 they want to lower their sugar levels in 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.250
 blood 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.680
 3 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.960
 I have already dedicated an exclusive work for 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.200
 this fantastic fruit so I'm not going 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.370
 to extend more just highlight your 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.760
 hypoglycemic capacity 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.190
 4 artichokes traditionally used 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.040
 to thin the diet of the artichoke 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.280
 has success because this flower 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.760
 has a great capacity to reduce the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.020
 blood sugar 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.450
 5 virgin olive oil this type of 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.700
 oil is very rich in polyphenols the 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.080
 which will intervene in the balance 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.830
 of blood glucose 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.720
 6 the cumin another of the foods of the 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.900
 that we have already spoken this aromatic 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.180
 spice has the ability to reduce 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.430
 blood glucose levels so 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.770
 it will be a good habit to season 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.480
 our dishes with a little cumin 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.930
 at least twice a week 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.670
 and to finish the mushrooms among them 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.569
 the maita that is and is that or the king if 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.980
 these mushrooms have a good capacity 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.319
 hypoglycemic, so if you want 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.900
 lower blood sugar level 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.959
 you should take this type from time to time 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.209
 of mushrooms in addition to taking any of 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.730
 these seven foods you can reduce 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.040
 your blood sugar levels 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.319
 taking a lot of fiber as it drags 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.829
 many of the fats and lipids that 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.629
 they ended up transforming into sugars 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.510
 also a low-carbohydrate diet 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.190
 especially carbon sugars help 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.819
 to maintain a correct glucose level 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.750
 in your blood as you see are some 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.280
 affordable measures easy to follow and 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.709
 with good results 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.340
 in our next jobs more

 tips to keep our body 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.299
