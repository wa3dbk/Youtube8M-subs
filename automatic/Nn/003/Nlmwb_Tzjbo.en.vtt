because I'm going to show you where it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.749 
because I'm going to show you where it
is<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:25.020> hub<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:26.159> has<00:01:26.250> all<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
is the the hub here that has all the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.800 
is the the hub here that has all the
versions<00:01:27.710> I'm<00:01:28.710> thinking<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.579> only<00:01:29.810> download

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
versions I'm thinking that only download

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.359 
versions I'm thinking that only download
every<00:01:31.020> single<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.350> these<00:01:31.470> versions<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
every single one of these versions I

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.100 
every single one of these versions I
guess<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.450> different<00:01:33.689> versions<00:01:34.079> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
guess it's just different versions to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.840 
guess it's just different versions to
see<00:01:34.380> one<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:35.040> download<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> first<00:01:35.700> one

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
see one so just download the first one

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.490 
see one so just download the first one
I'll<00:01:35.970> bring<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> air<00:01:36.509> fly<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.229> stuff

I'll bring the air fly all that stuff

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.719 
I'll bring the air fly all that stuff
that<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.860> should<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.189> everything<00:01:38.640> in

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that this should have everything in

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.609 
that this should have everything in
there<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.090> don't<00:01:39.570> think<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.020> he<00:01:40.110> puts<00:01:40.439> some

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
there I don't think that he puts some

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.740 
there I don't think that he puts some
different<00:01:40.979> versions<00:01:41.280> each<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.689> is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
different versions each one so this is

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.800 
different versions each one so this is
the<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:42.990> we're<00:01:43.079> gonna<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.680> not<00:01:44.310> I'll<00:01:44.810> fail
