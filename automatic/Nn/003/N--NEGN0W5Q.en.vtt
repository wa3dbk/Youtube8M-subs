00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
have that on there and probably put on a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.510 
have that on there and probably put on a
pipe<00:02:02.549> with<00:02:02.790> smaller<00:02:03.090> diameter<00:02:03.799> because<00:02:04.799> this

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
pipe with smaller diameter because this

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.650 
pipe with smaller diameter because this
one<00:02:05.759> doesn't<00:02:06.060> allow<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.049> chainsaw<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.710> get<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
one doesn't allow the chainsaw to get to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.969 
one doesn't allow the chainsaw to get to
max<00:02:09.660> rpms<00:02:10.259> so

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
max rpms so

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.720 
max rpms so
yeah<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:13.440> runs<00:02:13.560> pretty<00:02:13.890> good<00:02:14.010> when<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.550> does

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
yeah it runs pretty good when it does

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.820 
yeah it runs pretty good when it does
room<00:02:16.459> for<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.550> cable<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:19.430> have<00:02:20.430> an<00:02:20.970> old<00:02:21.830> break
