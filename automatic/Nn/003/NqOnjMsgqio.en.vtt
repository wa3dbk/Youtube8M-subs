for like 10 minutes I finally found what
he<00:00:39.070> was<00:00:39.250> referring<00:00:39.700> to<00:00:39.820> now<00:00:40.360> guys<00:00:40.570> I<00:00:40.900> am<00:00:41.050> not

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.590 
he was referring to now guys I am not
sure<00:00:41.680> on<00:00:41.980> what<00:00:42.010> it<00:00:42.370> is<00:00:42.400> but<00:00:42.610> we<00:00:43.060> have<00:00:43.300> I<00:00:43.540> think

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
sure on what it is but we have I think

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.650 
sure on what it is but we have I think
three<00:00:44.230> options<00:00:45.010> first<00:00:45.670> it<00:00:46.000> looks<00:00:46.210> like<00:00:46.360> a

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
three options first it looks like a

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.200 
three options first it looks like a
zombie<00:00:47.230> or<00:00:47.380> something<00:00:47.710> and<00:00:48.310> it's<00:00:48.850> not<00:00:49.060> that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
zombie or something and it's not that

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.150 
zombie or something and it's not that
clear<00:00:49.450> I<00:00:49.510> know<00:00:49.720> so<00:00:50.170> I<00:00:50.200> can<00:00:50.530> see<00:00:50.800> what<00:00:50.950> it<00:00:51.040> is

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
clear I know so I can see what it is

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.729 
clear I know so I can see what it is
exactly<00:00:51.430> but<00:00:51.940> yeah<00:00:52.329> it<00:00:52.480> kind<00:00:52.840> of<00:00:52.989> looks<00:00:53.050> like<00:00:53.440> a

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
exactly but yeah it kind of looks like a

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.040 
exactly but yeah it kind of looks like a
zombie<00:00:54.160> and<00:00:54.520> guys<00:00:54.940> this<00:00:55.300> would<00:00:55.540> make<00:00:55.780> sense

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
zombie and guys this would make sense

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.740 
zombie and guys this would make sense
because<00:00:56.559> there<00:00:56.800> is<00:00:56.980> actually<00:00:57.790> a<00:00:57.940> zombie<00:00:58.540> in

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
because there is actually a zombie in

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.959 
because there is actually a zombie in
GTA<00:00:59.290> 5<00:00:59.590> for<00:00:59.829> those<00:01:00.070> of<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:00.430> with<00:01:00.579> in<00:01:00.700> annuities

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
GTA 5 for those of you with in annuities

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.930 
GTA 5 for those of you with in annuities
yet<00:01:01.390> he<00:01:02.230> is<00:01:02.350> in<00:01:02.530> front<00:01:02.710> of<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.100> movie<00:01:03.489> theater

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
yet he is in front of the movie theater

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.969 
yet he is in front of the movie theater
but<00:01:04.570> yeah<00:01:04.719> if<00:01:04.869> didn't<00:01:05.229> knew<00:01:05.320> this<00:01:05.469> yet<00:01:05.740> go

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
but yeah if didn't knew this yet go

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.100 
but yeah if didn't knew this yet go
search<00:01:06.219> it<00:01:06.430> up<00:01:06.520> on<00:01:06.759> YouTube<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.450> you<00:01:07.719> will<00:01:07.869> see

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
search it up on YouTube and you will see

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.309 
search it up on YouTube and you will see
so<00:01:08.439> yeah<00:01:08.829> then<00:01:09.189> it<00:01:09.460> could<00:01:09.999> also<00:01:10.240> be<00:01:10.509> one<00:01:10.990> of<00:01:11.170> the

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:11.319 
so yeah then it could also be one of the

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.889 
so yeah then it could also be one of the
aliens<00:01:11.829> and<00:01:12.100> I<00:01:12.399> think<00:01:12.819> this<00:01:13.389> is<00:01:13.539> the<00:01:13.689> most

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
aliens and I think this is the most

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.899 
aliens and I think this is the most
logical<00:01:14.170> option<00:01:14.679> I<00:01:14.979> mean<00:01:15.189> keep<00:01:15.429> it<00:01:15.549> in<00:01:15.670> mind

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
logical option I mean keep it in mind

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.599 
logical option I mean keep it in mind
and<00:01:16.119> then<00:01:16.270> take<00:01:16.509> a<00:01:16.719> close<00:01:17.109> look<00:01:17.319> at<00:01:17.649> this<00:01:17.950> image

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609 
and then take a close look at this image

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:21.719 
and then take a close look at this image
it's<00:01:18.909> a<00:01:19.119> picture<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.899> the<00:01:20.380> alien<00:01:20.889> was<00:01:21.340> frozen

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
it's a picture of the alien was frozen

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.819 
it's a picture of the alien was frozen
in<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.240> ice<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:22.749> I<00:01:22.959> think<00:01:23.259> we<00:01:23.409> all<00:01:23.560> know<00:01:23.770> this

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
in the ice and I think we all know this

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.580 
in the ice and I think we all know this
but<00:01:24.039> we<00:01:24.399> can't<00:01:24.700> find<00:01:25.060> this<00:01:25.209> alien<00:01:25.719> in<00:01:25.899> the<00:01:26.380> game

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
but we can't find this alien in the game

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.980 
but we can't find this alien in the game
in<00:01:26.829> the<00:01:27.189> first<00:01:27.490> mission<00:01:28.090> but<00:01:28.479> yeah<00:01:28.600> I'm<00:01:28.779> not

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
in the first mission but yeah I'm not

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.289 
in the first mission but yeah I'm not
saying<00:01:29.259> this<00:01:29.409> is<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.920> frozen<00:01:30.130> alien<00:01:30.670> but<00:01:31.149> at

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
saying this is the frozen alien but at

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.749 
saying this is the frozen alien but at
some<00:01:31.600> points<00:01:32.049> it<00:01:32.200> looks<00:01:32.499> the<00:01:33.009> same<00:01:33.249> and<00:01:33.549> then

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
some points it looks the same and then

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.519 
some points it looks the same and then
three<00:01:33.999> guys<00:01:34.209> it<00:01:34.509> could<00:01:34.689> also<00:01:34.840> just<00:01:34.990> be<00:01:35.259> the

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:35.529 
three guys it could also just be the

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:37.410 
three guys it could also just be the
texture<00:01:35.979> of<00:01:36.159> it<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:36.700> lamb<00:01:36.939> but<00:01:37.149> I<00:01:37.299> doubt

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
texture of it of the lamb but I doubt

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.319 
texture of it of the lamb but I doubt
that<00:01:37.990> I<00:01:38.139> can<00:01:38.349> clearly<00:01:38.679> see<00:01:39.039> something<00:01:39.700> in<00:01:39.880> it

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
that I can clearly see something in it

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:41.669 
that I can clearly see something in it
