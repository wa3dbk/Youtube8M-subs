00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.090 
my Aqua my bottle ponics
just<00:02:39.120> my<00:02:39.300> I'm<00:02:39.600> sure<00:02:39.750> you'll<00:02:39.900> figure<00:02:40.050> out<00:02:40.200> why<00:02:41.070> I

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
just my I'm sure you'll figure out why I

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.690 
just my I'm sure you'll figure out why I
would<00:02:41.520> have<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> pond<00:02:42.440> next<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.400> bottom

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
would have a pond next to the bottom

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.250 
would have a pond next to the bottom
ponics<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:47.750> hopefully<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.870> light<00:02:49.080> will

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
ponics and hopefully that light will

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.770 
ponics and hopefully that light will
give<00:02:49.440> enough<00:02:49.709> light<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.250> water<00:02:50.540> for<00:02:51.540> like

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
give enough light to the water for like

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.080

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.550

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
get more of these another plank and put

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.590 
get more of these another plank and put
it<00:03:35.700> on<00:03:35.790> top<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.239> here

top is going to be river gravel lots of

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.940 
top is going to be river gravel lots of
floating<00:03:52.490> plant<00:03:53.290> hopefully<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.500> light<00:03:54.710> will

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950

see when you stand this pallet wood how

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.440 
see when you stand this pallet wood how
interesting<00:04:15.590> it<00:04:15.950> is<00:04:16.640> it's<00:04:17.030> it's<00:04:17.269> really

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
interesting it is it's it's really

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.220 
interesting it is it's it's really
patterns<00:04:18.820> this<00:04:19.820> doesn't<00:04:20.150> fit<00:04:20.359> my<00:04:20.570> house<00:04:20.870> that

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
patterns this doesn't fit my house that

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.640 
patterns this doesn't fit my house that
well<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.820> if<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:23.660> was<00:04:23.810> using<00:04:23.900> about<00:04:24.140> fireplace

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
well and if I was using about fireplace

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.670 
well and if I was using about fireplace
then<00:04:25.100> this<00:04:25.520> would<00:04:25.730> be<00:04:25.910> a<00:04:25.940> bad<00:04:26.270> idea<00:04:26.530> but<00:04:27.530> we

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
then this would be a bad idea but we

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.110 
then this would be a bad idea but we
never<00:04:27.860> use<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.160> fireplace<00:04:28.370> because<00:04:28.850> we<00:04:28.970> don't

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
never use the fireplace because we don't

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.250 
never use the fireplace because we don't
have<00:04:29.330> like<00:04:29.540> a<00:04:29.570> few<00:04:29.810> things

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
have like a few things

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.160 
have like a few things
it<00:04:31.070> doesn't<00:04:31.460> actually<00:04:31.550> keep<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.240> house<00:04:32.420> that

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
it doesn't actually keep the house that

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.170 
it doesn't actually keep the house that
well<00:04:33.410> unless<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:34.040> power's<00:04:34.370> out<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:34.580> we're

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
well unless the power's out and we're

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.590 
well unless the power's out and we're
dying

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
dying

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.560

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
then we'll huddle in the basement and

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.660 
then we'll huddle in the basement and
light<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:38.690> fire<00:04:38.870> but<00:04:39.170> normally<00:04:39.890> we<00:04:40.070> won't<00:04:42.670> you

wall<00:04:51.710> of<00:04:51.830> it<00:04:51.919> you<00:04:52.040> can<00:04:52.160> see<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.640> use<00:04:53.240> like<00:04:53.450> quite

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
wall of it you can see I use like quite

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.260 
wall of it you can see I use like quite
a<00:04:54.020> few<00:04:54.200> different<00:04:54.590> pieces<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.760> wood<00:04:55.970> and

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
a few different pieces of wood and

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.220 
a few different pieces of wood and
they're<00:04:57.169> not<00:04:57.290> even<00:04:57.590> Lisa

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
they're not even Lisa

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.300 
they're not even Lisa
these<00:05:00.230> are<00:05:00.410> like<00:05:00.530> quarter-inch<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.160> these

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
these are like quarter-inch and these

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.790 
these are like quarter-inch and these
are<00:05:01.490> like<00:05:01.580> half-inch<00:05:02.000> so<00:05:02.510> you<00:05:03.260> can<00:05:03.440> see<00:05:03.560> from

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
are like half-inch so you can see from

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.760 
are like half-inch so you can see from
there<00:05:04.070> and<00:05:04.340> then<00:05:05.060> this<00:05:05.240> one<00:05:05.600> it's<00:05:06.410> just

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
there and then this one it's just

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.970 
there and then this one it's just
there's<00:05:07.700> a<00:05:07.790> gap<00:05:08.030> here<00:05:08.270> at<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:08.510> bottom<00:05:08.980> for

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
there's a gap here at the bottom for

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.920 
there's a gap here at the bottom for
electrical<00:05:10.610> cords<00:05:10.940> and<00:05:11.030> stuff<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:11.540> go<00:05:11.690> to

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
electrical cords and stuff to go to

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.040 
electrical cords and stuff to go to
outlet<00:05:13.000> that's<00:05:14.000> not<00:05:14.210> actually<00:05:14.419> why<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:14.780> gaps

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
outlet that's not actually why the gaps

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.790 
outlet that's not actually why the gaps
there<00:05:15.290> is<00:05:15.800> the<00:05:15.950> gap<00:05:16.130> is<00:05:16.310> here<00:05:16.580> because<00:05:17.510> I<00:05:17.800> use

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
there is the gap is here because I use

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.010 
there is the gap is here because I use
this<00:05:19.040> and<00:05:19.280> it's<00:05:19.580> not<00:05:19.790> actually<00:05:20.030> quite<00:05:20.570> as<00:05:20.750> big

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
this and it's not actually quite as big

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:28.120 
this and it's not actually quite as big
as<00:05:21.200> two<00:05:21.800> of<00:05:21.980> these<00:05:24.010> so<00:05:25.010> that<00:05:25.660> happens<00:05:26.660> so<00:05:27.350> now<00:05:27.770> I

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
as two of these so that happens so now I

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.550 
as two of these so that happens so now I
am<00:05:28.880> going<00:05:29.240> to<00:05:29.419> use<00:05:29.570> the<00:05:29.750> gap<00:05:29.930> for<00:05:30.110> electrical

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
am going to use the gap for electrical

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.720 
am going to use the gap for electrical
parts<00:05:30.860> so<00:05:31.790> that'll<00:05:32.030> be<00:05:32.150> good<00:05:34.000> I<00:05:36.400> don't<00:05:37.400> really

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
parts so that'll be good I don't really

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.420 
parts so that'll be good I don't really
know<00:05:37.940> what<00:05:38.210> else<00:05:38.360> is<00:05:38.570> up<00:05:38.600> I<00:05:39.020> guess<00:05:39.440> you<00:05:40.370> know

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
know what else is up I guess you know

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.640 
know what else is up I guess you know
the<00:05:40.700> Ravens<00:05:41.210> beat<00:05:41.360> the<00:05:41.480> Steelers<00:05:41.690> so<00:05:42.320> that's

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
the Ravens beat the Steelers so that's

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.250 
the Ravens beat the Steelers so that's
cool<00:05:43.600> if<00:05:44.600> you're<00:05:44.810> a<00:05:44.840> Ravens<00:05:45.230> fan<00:05:45.320> and<00:05:47.260> the

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
cool if you're a Ravens fan and the

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.540 
cool if you're a Ravens fan and the
goldfish<00:05:48.710> is<00:05:48.950> finally<00:05:49.520> swimming<00:05:49.880> around

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
goldfish is finally swimming around

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.070 
goldfish is finally swimming around

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
this and then I changed it to I added a

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.120 
this and then I changed it to I added a
fish<00:06:07.070> so<00:06:08.070> aquaponics<00:06:08.850> and<00:06:09.030> then<00:06:09.270> I<00:06:09.860> took<00:06:10.860> apart

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
fish so aquaponics and then I took apart

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:16.130 
fish so aquaponics and then I took apart
palate<00:06:11.610> and<00:06:12.710> made<00:06:13.710> this<00:06:14.700> pond<00:06:15.000> is<00:06:15.330> what<00:06:16.020> it's

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
palate and made this pond is what it's

palate and made this pond is what it's
going<00:06:16.290> to<00:06:16.440> be<00:06:16.550> and<00:06:17.550> I<00:06:17.610> actually<00:06:17.940> think<00:06:18.270> it

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
going to be and I actually think it

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.360 
going to be and I actually think it
looks<00:06:18.600> pretty<00:06:18.780> nice<00:06:18.930> you<00:06:19.110> know<00:06:19.250> normally<00:06:20.250> when

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
looks pretty nice you know normally when

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.490 
looks pretty nice you know normally when
I<00:06:20.430> build<00:06:20.760> something<00:06:20.940> it's<00:06:21.780> not<00:06:21.960> level<00:06:22.200> but

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500
