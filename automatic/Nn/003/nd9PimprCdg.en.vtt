00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.560
 and the squid in their ink I like them 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.359
 a lot because they are black but they are 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.490
 extraordinarily rich 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.450
 we have the ingredients that are oil 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.810
 salt a little white wine in this case 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.780
 It's chamomile serves any other wine 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.260
 garlic parsley 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.080
 the amount that a tooth is seen during 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.550
 a bay leaf and a tip of 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.100
 chilli 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.300
 of cayena but a little tip I only like 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.910
 little spicy one onion or two cut 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.030
 in julienne a glass of tomato cut into 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.800
 pictures the inks in this case are from 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.160
 the squids 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.930
 sometimes it's very empty and we're served by 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.149
 that I have here the land of a sepia 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.970
 which is a bit big and that puts a lot 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.030
 more black squids are already clean 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.059
 and inside we have put the fins and 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.670
 the legs this I have done but you will 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.159
 You can ask the fishmonger to do it in 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.560
 a low pot we will put a bottom of 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.170
 olive oil light aircraft and on that 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.130
 background we add the sliced onions 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.530
 in juliana 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.110
 while more abundant gr richer this 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.500
 red onion and gives a little bit of the best 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.200
 we also throw the one that kills the garlic and 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.579
 the parsley and raw as you can see 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.310
 we place well we add the squid 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.340
 with a padding of legs and fins 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.399
 and nothing else or salt or anything else for now 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.090
 we are going to leave them like this in their juice 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.840
 then until all the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.330
 squid juice and how it looks there already 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.610
 It's a little while until it has 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.280
 condensed also the followed and the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.750
 Squids are tender 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.729
 meanwhile we will do a 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.099
 consists of the salt that is the first 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.799
 we put it on we put little by 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:02.440
 you have to rectify the chilli and the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.650
 We crush well for it to disperse 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.440
 we add a fried garlic you want in this 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.810
 moment a slice of conflict I do not 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.250
 I've done it but I added it to the end 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.350
 a little bit of breadcrumbs is also 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.330
 another solution add it also the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.870
 inks that took away that is the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.530
 squid I am very nostalgic and I do it 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.600
 well and here we see the bread crumbs 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.120
 if it's not ready because I like to clean 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.290
 I learned both from my mother and from me 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.930
 grandmother and now that tip is the ink of 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.330
 the cuttlefish that gives a lot more tone 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.550
 dark we add the wine in the recipe 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.110
 my grandmother put cognac so who 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.129
 prefer, it puts a little bit of 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.020
 big 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:48.770
 and if we add it 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.510
 for the whole pot so that it 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.420
 Disperse well that with the breadcrumbs 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.610
 will be very good at diffusing very well 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.090
 well then once we are we are going to 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.480
 remove now and cold remove the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.850
 squid and let's beat the sauce for 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.120
 that is so that it is not against 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.319
 people so that your life stays here you 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.849
 like with trips 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.999
 in old age as it is very good 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.999
 as well 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.320
 then it is a source where we have 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.600
 put some white rice 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.510
 we have squid sauce 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.770
 we will also put it on top and 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.770
 the plate is presentable
