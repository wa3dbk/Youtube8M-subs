at the next d-ring if the wind isn't too
strong<00:01:18.080> you<00:01:19.080> could<00:01:19.350> shorten<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
strong you could shorten this up and

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.580 
strong you could shorten this up and
make<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:23.540> farthest<00:01:24.540> aft<00:01:24.810> attachment

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
the way but if you interlink them like

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.920 
the way but if you interlink them like
that<00:03:40.450> then<00:03:40.750> it's<00:03:41.470> fine<00:03:41.800> over<00:03:42.700> here<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.750> see

step so this rope here is called the
halyard<00:04:19.239> halyard<00:04:20.620> is<00:04:21.620> going<00:04:21.980> up<00:04:22.130> through<00:04:22.400> that

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
halyard halyard is going up through that

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.390 
halyard halyard is going up through that
loop<00:04:22.760> at<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.030> top<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.510> mast<00:04:23.720> I<00:04:24.110> let<00:04:25.040> go<00:04:25.250> of

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
loop at the top of the mast I let go of

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.750 
loop at the top of the mast I let go of
it<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:26.120> sail<00:04:26.360> comes<00:04:26.690> down<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:31.310> then<00:04:31.520> if<00:04:31.640> I

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
it the sail comes down and then if I

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.670 
it the sail comes down and then if I
lift<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.060> masked<00:04:32.360> up<00:04:32.600> out<00:04:33.200> of<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.470> master

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
lift it masked up out of the master

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.170 
lift it masked up out of the master
slide<00:04:34.210> it's<00:04:35.210> completely<00:04:35.840> free<00:04:36.110> from<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.500> boat

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
slide it's completely free from the boat

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.620 
slide it's completely free from the boat
so<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.390> mast<00:04:38.600> goes<00:04:38.930> through<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:39.500> mast<00:04:39.680> slide

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
so the mast goes through the mast slide

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.270 
so the mast goes through the mast slide
into<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.720> mast<00:04:41.930> step<00:04:43.600> and<00:04:44.890> then<00:04:45.890> to<00:04:46.070> raise<00:04:46.220> the
