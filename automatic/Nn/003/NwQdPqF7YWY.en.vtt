00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
channel repulsors thanks to the two

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.480 
channel repulsors thanks to the two
percent<00:00:47.970> synergies<00:00:48.630> on<00:00:48.930> these<00:00:49.260> skills<00:00:49.620> now

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
percent synergies on these skills now

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.270

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
this yourself now let's check out how
this<00:02:03.810> build<00:02:04.049> works<00:02:04.289> when<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.069> get<00:02:05.249> into<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> map

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
this build works when you get into a map

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.120 
this build works when you get into a map
put<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.539> your<00:02:06.569> energy<00:02:06.869> shield<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.920> always

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
put up your energy shield you always

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.370 
put up your energy shield you always
want<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.970> then<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.200> use

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
want to have this up then just use

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.220 
want to have this up then just use
channeled<00:02:10.950> repulsors<00:02:11.580> for<00:02:12.090> all<00:02:12.390> your<00:02:12.810> damage

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
channeled repulsors for all your damage

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.750 
channeled repulsors for all your damage
it's<00:02:13.500> multiple<00:02:14.370> targets<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.120> just

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
it's multiple targets and just

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.509 
it's multiple targets and just
melts<00:02:16.120> them<00:02:16.360> at<00:02:16.569> some<00:02:17.500> point<00:02:17.769> you're<00:02:18.189> going<00:02:18.400> to

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
melts them at some point you're going to

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.420 
melts them at some point you're going to
run<00:02:18.730> out<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.939> spirit<00:02:19.510> when<00:02:20.019> this<00:02:20.200> happens<00:02:20.739> pop

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
run out of spirit when this happens pop

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.059 
run out of spirit when this happens pop
your<00:02:21.640> shield<00:02:21.970> shut<00:02:22.299> down<00:02:22.569> get<00:02:23.379> spirit<00:02:23.860> back

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
your shield shut down get spirit back

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.309 
your shield shut down get spirit back
then<00:02:24.549> put<00:02:24.819> your<00:02:24.849> shield<00:02:25.239> back<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.659> immediately

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
and start killing enemies again that's

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.649 
and start killing enemies again that's
the<00:02:29.500> whole<00:02:29.530> build<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.730> cooldown<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.329> shutdown

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
the whole build the cooldown on shutdown

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.880 
the whole build the cooldown on shutdown
is<00:02:32.310> 15<00:02:33.310> seconds<00:02:33.909> so<00:02:34.360> at<00:02:34.510> higher<00:02:34.810> levels<00:02:35.140> you'll

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
is 15 seconds so at higher levels you'll

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.130 
is 15 seconds so at higher levels you'll
have<00:02:36.099> basically<00:02:36.610> infinite<00:02:37.360> spirit<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.959> work

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
have basically infinite spirit to work

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.180 
have basically infinite spirit to work
with<00:02:38.409> um<00:02:38.819> if<00:02:39.819> your<00:02:40.569> gear<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.140> levels<00:02:41.799> are<00:02:41.980> kind

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
with um if your gear and levels are kind

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.430 
with um if your gear and levels are kind
of<00:02:42.280> low<00:02:42.489> then<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.329> want<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.599> pop<00:02:43.810> shield<00:02:44.140> shut

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
of low then you want to pop shield shut

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.440 
of low then you want to pop shield shut
down<00:02:44.650> whenever<00:02:45.040> it's<00:02:45.459> up<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:46.030> keep<00:02:46.239> your

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
down whenever it's up to keep your

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.369 
down whenever it's up to keep your
spirit<00:02:47.170> up<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.849> can<00:02:49.000> see<00:02:49.030> average<00:02:49.720> gear<00:02:50.230> on

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
spirit up so you can see average gear on

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.490 
spirit up so you can see average gear on
this<00:02:50.650> build<00:02:50.980> works<00:02:51.670> great<00:02:52.180> but<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.140> really

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
this build works great but to really

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.339 
this build works great but to really
optimize<00:02:53.769> performance<00:02:54.540> your<00:02:55.540> gear<00:02:55.840> choices

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
optimize performance your gear choices

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.710 
optimize performance your gear choices
can<00:02:56.980> make<00:02:57.190> all<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.400> difference<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.540> let's

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
can make all the difference so let's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.440 
can make all the difference so let's
look<00:02:58.959> at<00:02:59.230> itemization<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.980> very<00:03:03.370> best<00:03:03.790> at<00:03:04.209> you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
look at itemization the very best at you

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.869 
look at itemization the very best at you
can<00:03:04.629> get<00:03:04.840> for<00:03:05.049> this<00:03:05.139> build<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.769> plus<00:03:06.280> spirit

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
can get for this build is plus spirit

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.420 
can get for this build is plus spirit
it's<00:03:07.329> very<00:03:07.720> easy<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.200> find<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.859> the<00:03:09.129> whole

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
it's very easy to find and the whole

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.879 
it's very easy to find and the whole
build<00:03:09.790> depends<00:03:10.299> on<00:03:10.510> having<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:11.019> big<00:03:11.319> spirit

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
powerful and that's something that I

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.250 
powerful and that's something that I
think<00:05:49.010> was<00:05:49.280> missing<00:05:49.790> from<00:05:49.970> the<00:05:50.150> game<00:05:50.360> before<00:05:51.020> I

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
think was missing from the game before I

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.300 
think was missing from the game before I
found<00:05:51.620> these<00:05:52.310> types<00:05:52.610> of<00:05:52.730> builds<00:05:53.830> so<00:05:54.830> that's<00:05:55.160> it

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310
