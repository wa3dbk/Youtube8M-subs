harder<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.460> live<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.840> we're<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.109> gonna

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
harder to live and so we're just gonna

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
be taking a look at these maps that I

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.520 
be taking a look at these maps that I
made<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.420> pick<00:01:00.750> your<00:01:00.960> favorite<00:01:01.170> pick

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
made and you can pick your favorite pick

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
made and you can pick your favorite pick
your<00:01:01.800> poison<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.340> will<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.660> this

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
your poison if you will and so this

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.740 
your poison if you will and so this
first<00:01:03.930> one<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.409> called<00:01:04.650> darts<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:06.450> think

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
first one is called darts and I think

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.330

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
day for all mankind and this next map is

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.039 
day for all mankind and this next map is
basically<00:01:56.640> what<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.060> envision<00:01:57.570> held<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.930> be

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
basically what I envision held to be

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.020 
basically what I envision held to be
like<00:01:58.259> you're<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.310> trapped<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.820> room

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
like you're just trapped in this room

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.700 
like you're just trapped in this room
with<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.299> one<00:02:00.479> guy<00:02:00.689> killing<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.229> over<00:02:01.560> and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
with this one guy killing you over and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.569 
with this one guy killing you over and
over<00:02:01.740> again<00:02:01.979> for<00:02:02.670> always<00:02:02.939> an<00:02:03.119> eternity

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
over again for always an eternity

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.800 
over again for always an eternity
so<00:02:05.579> yeah<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.790> map<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> little<00:02:06.450> bit<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
so yeah this map is a little bit on the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.710 
so yeah this map is a little bit on the
dark<00:02:07.049> side<00:02:07.350> if<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:08.280> doesn't<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.910> mean<00:02:09.479> if<00:02:09.599> this

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
dark side if this doesn't I mean if this

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.270 
dark side if this doesn't I mean if this
isn't<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.349> there<00:02:10.739> are<00:02:10.830> plenty<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.099> other

isn't for you there are plenty of other

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.449 
isn't for you there are plenty of other
maps<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.730> go<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.599> just<00:02:12.720> pick<00:02:12.900> from

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
maps to go and so you can just pick from

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:23.210 
maps to go and so you can just pick from
so<00:02:15.000> let's<00:02:15.180> check<00:02:15.390> out<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.629> next<00:02:15.870> three<00:02:22.220> so

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
if you will and so this next map is

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.380 
if you will and so this next map is
called<00:02:42.900> simply<00:02:43.349> dodge<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.090> if<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.239> actually

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.569 
to do is simply dodge but if you're like
everybody<00:02:49.349> else<00:02:49.530> here<00:02:49.829> that<00:02:50.099> just<00:02:50.250> wants<00:02:50.519> to

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
get the achievement all I got to do is

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.589 
get the achievement all I got to do is
just<00:02:52.470> dump<00:02:52.739> straight<00:02:53.370> up<00:02:53.579> into<00:02:53.879> the<00:02:54.150> this

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
just dump straight up into the this

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.470 
just dump straight up into the this
field<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.370> exploding<00:02:56.370> red<00:02:56.579> cubes<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.209> you'll

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
field of exploding red cubes and you'll

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.119 
field of exploding red cubes and you'll
be<00:02:57.599> that<00:02:57.750> much<00:02:57.780> closer<00:02:58.109> to<00:02:58.470> getting<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
be that much closer to getting the

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.500 
be that much closer to getting the
achievement<00:03:01.609> so<00:03:02.609> this<00:03:02.730> next<00:03:02.909> map<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.329> called

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
achievement so this next map is called

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.960 
achievement so this next map is called
just<00:03:03.930> fall<00:03:04.139> and<00:03:04.409> so<00:03:05.069> that's<00:03:05.609> all<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.790> got<00:03:05.879> to

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
just fall and so that's all you got to

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.789 
just fall and so that's all you got to
do<00:03:06.030> just<00:03:06.269> just<00:03:06.690> fall<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.170> just<00:03:07.290> walk<00:03:07.590> to

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
either the left or right and then the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.300 
either the left or right and then the
rest<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.079> map<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:10.620> gonna<00:03:10.829> do<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.129> for

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
rest of the map is just gonna do it for

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.460 
rest of the map is just gonna do it for
you<00:03:11.519> just<00:03:11.909> ride<00:03:12.299> along<00:03:12.450> this<00:03:12.750> conveyor<00:03:13.170> belt

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
you just ride along this conveyor belt

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.509 
you just ride along this conveyor belt
and<00:03:14.420> yeah<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.599> map<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:16.049> a<00:03:16.440> lot<00:03:16.980> like<00:03:17.159> one<00:03:17.400> of

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
and yeah this map is a lot like one of

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.059 
and yeah this map is a lot like one of
the<00:03:17.609> other<00:03:17.760> maps<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.359> hadn't<00:03:18.750> made<00:03:19.010> one<00:03:20.010> of

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
the other maps that I hadn't made one of

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.430 
the other maps that I hadn't made one of
the<00:03:20.129> maps<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.340> showed<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.609> earlier

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
the maps that showed you earlier

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.309 
the maps that showed you earlier
bullseye

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
bullseye

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.009 
bullseye
and<00:03:25.319> so<00:03:25.949> these<00:03:26.160> final<00:03:26.519> three<00:03:26.549> maps<00:03:26.940> I'm<00:03:27.870> gonna

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
and so these final three maps I'm gonna

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.800 
and so these final three maps I'm gonna
show<00:03:28.199> you<00:03:28.290> what<00:03:28.410> those<00:03:28.530> are<00:03:32.449> this<00:03:33.449> first<00:03:33.660> one

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
show you what those are this first one

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.479 
show you what those are this first one
is<00:03:33.870> called<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.169> little<00:03:34.470> shock<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.949> got<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.310> do<00:03:35.370> is

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
is called a little shock I got to do is

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.789 
is called a little shock I got to do is
strap<00:03:35.760> on<00:03:35.970> these<00:03:36.120> angel<00:03:36.540> wings<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.930> then<00:03:37.530> try

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
strap on these angel wings and then try

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.979 
strap on these angel wings and then try
to<00:03:37.859> fly<00:03:38.069> through<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.459> electrical<00:03:38.910> field<00:03:39.180> but

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
to fly through this electrical field but

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.210 
to fly through this electrical field but
I'm<00:03:40.079> gonna<00:03:40.199> let<00:03:40.349> you<00:03:40.440> guys<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.859> on<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.040> little

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
I'm gonna let you guys in on a little

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.670 
I'm gonna let you guys in on a little
secret

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.069 

and<00:03:43.949> so<00:03:44.609> yeah<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.849> just<00:03:45.000> keep<00:03:45.419> trying<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.959> get

and so yeah you just keep trying to get

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.240 
and so yeah you just keep trying to get
through<00:03:46.290> over<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.590> over<00:03:46.739> again<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.160> you'll

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
through over and over again and you'll

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.500 
through over and over again and you'll
be<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.579> much<00:03:47.639> closer<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.209> getting<00:03:48.480> the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
be that much closer to getting the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.710 
be that much closer to getting the
achievement<00:03:52.819> so<00:03:53.819> this<00:03:53.940> next<00:03:54.180> map<00:03:54.329> is<00:03:54.359> called

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
achievement so this next map is called

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.990 
achievement so this next map is called
good<00:03:55.199> odds<00:03:55.440> are<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.519> do<00:03:56.639> is<00:03:56.760> step<00:03:56.970> through

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
good odds are you to do is step through

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.339 
good odds are you to do is step through
this<00:03:57.180> teleporter<00:03:57.720> then<00:03:57.959> you're<00:03:58.079> gonna<00:03:58.169> be

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
this teleporter then you're gonna be

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.930 
this teleporter then you're gonna be
sent<00:03:58.590> into<00:03:58.739> this<00:03:58.919> little<00:03:59.069> randomizer<00:03:59.609> thing

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
sent into this little randomizer thing

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.699 
sent into this little randomizer thing
and<00:04:00.389> you<00:04:00.480> can<00:04:00.629> die<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.079> multitude<00:04:01.379> of<00:04:01.560> ways

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
and you can die in a multitude of ways

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.259 
and you can die in a multitude of ways
by<00:04:02.669> spikes<00:04:03.409> or<00:04:05.599> I<00:04:06.599> guess<00:04:07.379> by<00:04:07.560> spikes<00:04:07.859> again

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
by spikes or I guess by spikes again

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.839 
by spikes or I guess by spikes again
trust<00:04:09.269> me<00:04:09.389> there<00:04:09.540> are<00:04:09.569> more<00:04:09.720> than<00:04:09.870> just<00:04:09.930> spikes

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
trust me there are more than just spikes

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.349 
trust me there are more than just spikes
there<00:04:11.849> you<00:04:11.909> go

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
there you go

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.370 
there you go
pool<00:04:12.659> of<00:04:12.810> acid<00:04:13.760> that's<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.940> fun<00:04:15.120> one<00:04:15.380> fan

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
pool of acid that's a fun one fan

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.960 
pool of acid that's a fun one fan
favorite<00:04:16.909> or<00:04:17.989> electric<00:04:18.989> shock<00:04:19.639> that's<00:04:20.639> great

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
favorite or electric shock that's great

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.310 
favorite or electric shock that's great
and<00:04:21.180> so<00:04:21.329> all<00:04:21.599> you<00:04:21.659> got<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.810> do<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.049> just<00:04:22.139> keep

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
doing that over and over again and then

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.190 
doing that over and over again and then
sooner<00:04:24.479> or<00:04:24.510> later<00:04:24.630> you'll<00:04:24.870> get<00:04:25.050> the

sooner or later you'll get the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.600 
sooner or later you'll get the
achievement<00:04:25.289> that<00:04:25.830> way

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
achievement that way

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.149 
achievement that way
this<00:04:26.729> last<00:04:26.939> map<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.389> called<00:04:27.599> better<00:04:27.900> odds

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:28.159 
this last map is called better odds

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.200 
this last map is called better odds
coming<00:04:29.159> off<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.430> high<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.639> that<00:04:30.030> whole

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
coming off the high of that whole

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.850 
coming off the high of that whole
randomizer<00:04:30.719> thing<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.199> decided<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.740> make

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
randomizer thing I decided to make

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.670 
randomizer thing I decided to make
another<00:04:32.099> one<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.810> in<00:04:33.810> this<00:04:33.960> one<00:04:34.229> you've<00:04:34.650> got

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
another one and in this one you've got

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.379 
another one and in this one you've got
like<00:04:34.949> a<00:04:34.979> 1<00:04:35.310> in<00:04:35.460> 40<00:04:35.729> chance<00:04:35.969> of<00:04:36.090> actually

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
like a 1 in 40 chance of actually

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.709 
like a 1 in 40 chance of actually
beating<00:04:36.659> the<00:04:36.750> level<00:04:37.069> the<00:04:38.069> other<00:04:38.099> you<00:04:38.969> know<00:04:39.090> 39

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:39.719 
beating the level the other you know 39

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:42.830 
beating the level the other you know 39
out<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.770> 40<00:04:40.919> chances<00:04:41.669> is<00:04:41.849> to<00:04:42.120> just<00:04:42.330> get<00:04:42.539> a<00:04:42.569> face

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
out of 40 chances is to just get a face

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.679 
out of 40 chances is to just get a face
full<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:43.159> moving<00:04:44.159> saw<00:04:44.340> blades<00:04:44.669> so<00:04:45.389> that's<00:04:45.569> a

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:45.689
