features<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.480> low<00:00:24.750> height<00:00:25.050> here<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
features is you have low height here and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.800 
features is you have low height here and
the<00:00:26.130> reason<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.519> there<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.760> no<00:00:26.939> addition<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.689> an

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
the reason is there is no addition of an

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.839 
the reason is there is no addition of an
extra<00:00:28.230> engine<00:00:28.680> brake<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> top<00:00:29.400> bubble

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
extra engine brake on the top bubble

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.279 
extra engine brake on the top bubble
uses<00:00:30.090> an<00:00:30.210> exhaust<00:00:30.570> brake<00:00:30.779> which<00:00:30.990> will<00:00:31.140> show

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
uses an exhaust brake which will show

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.229 
uses an exhaust brake which will show
you<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.590> other<00:00:31.710> side<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.910> saves<00:00:33.059> you

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
you on the other side so it saves you

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.900 
you on the other side so it saves you
out<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.020> height<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.680> motor<00:00:34.910> which

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
out with the height of the motor which

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.340 
out with the height of the motor which
is<00:00:36.059> nice<00:00:36.239> because<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.690> easier<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.050> work<00:00:37.170> are

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
is nice because it's easier to work are

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.780 
is nice because it's easier to work are
you<00:00:37.380> don't<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> pull<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.920> doghouse<00:00:38.250> work

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you don't have to pull the doghouse work

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.720 
you don't have to pull the doghouse work
on<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> motor<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:40.110> well<00:00:40.469> all<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.980> power<00:00:41.280> puts

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
on the motor as well all this power puts

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.729 
on the motor as well all this power puts
both<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.180> alternator<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.559> AC

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
both the alternator and the AC

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.740 
both the alternator and the AC
compressor<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> cold<00:00:45.059> side<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> motor

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
compressor on the cold side of the motor

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.110 
compressor on the cold side of the motor
which<00:00:46.440> helps<00:00:46.710> them<00:00:46.860> out<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:47.219> longevity

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
which helps them out with longevity

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.090 
which helps them out with longevity
because<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.079> away<00:00:49.230> from<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.440> EGR<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
because it's away from that EGR and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.490 
because it's away from that EGR and
exhaust<00:00:50.489> heat<00:00:50.760> also<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.840> fill<00:00:52.110> points

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
check in if there's ever a problem you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.920 
check in if there's ever a problem you
have<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> nice<00:01:13.909> cluster<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.090> air<00:01:15.330> lines<00:01:15.630> here

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
have a nice cluster of air lines here

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.810 
have a nice cluster of air lines here
each<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.500> color-coded<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> stamped<00:01:17.729> at

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
each one is color-coded and stamped at

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.230 
each one is color-coded and stamped at
both<00:01:18.000> ends
