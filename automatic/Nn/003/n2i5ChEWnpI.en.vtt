00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520 

rebuilding<00:00:00.599> out<00:00:00.690> I<00:00:00.719> don't<00:00:01.050> know<00:00:01.170> it<00:00:01.410> looks

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
rebuilding out I don't know it looks

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.200 
rebuilding out I don't know it looks
like<00:00:01.650> he<00:00:01.740> finally<00:00:02.190> scouting<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.850> upper<00:00:03.030> left

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
like he finally scouting the upper left

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.550 
like he finally scouting the upper left
with<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.480> vulture<00:00:03.810> see<00:00:04.140> how<00:00:04.230> long<00:00:04.410> it<00:00:04.529> takes

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
with the vulture see how long it takes

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.349 
with the vulture see how long it takes
him<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.920> start<00:00:05.130> sending<00:00:05.339> things<00:00:05.609> that

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
him to start sending things that

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.430 
him to start sending things that
direction<00:00:06.660> looks<00:00:06.899> like<00:00:06.990> he's<00:00:07.109> going<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.290> keep

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
direction looks like he's going to keep

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.570 
direction looks like he's going to keep
the<00:00:07.589> tanks<00:00:07.859> make<00:00:08.010> sure<00:00:08.130> he<00:00:08.220> takes<00:00:08.250> out

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
the tanks make sure he takes out

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.250 
the tanks make sure he takes out
everything<00:00:08.970> in<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.450> bottom<00:00:09.719> left<00:00:09.870> before<00:00:10.050> he

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
everything in the bottom left before he

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.720 
everything in the bottom left before he
kind<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.469> moves<00:00:10.710> up<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.010> direction<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.460> do

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
kind of moves up that direction I do

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.400 
kind of moves up that direction I do
think<00:00:12.150> some<00:00:12.330> let's<00:00:12.630> see<00:00:12.750> if<00:00:12.809> some<00:00:13.019> observers

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
think some let's see if some observers

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.270 
think some let's see if some observers
actually<00:00:13.799> know<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:13.980> looks<00:00:14.099> like<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
actually know it looks like the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.390 
actually know it looks like the
observers<00:00:14.700> got<00:00:15.210> killed<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.660> route<00:00:15.809> as<00:00:15.990> well

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
observers got killed in route as well

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.260 
observers got killed in route as well
though<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.520> looks<00:00:17.670> like<00:00:17.760> he<00:00:17.850> does<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:18.150> one

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
though it looks like he does have one

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.120 
though it looks like he does have one
observer<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.109> we'll<00:00:19.199> be<00:00:19.289> able<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.439> work<00:00:19.619> out<00:00:19.800> no

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
observer so we'll be able to work out no

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.529 
observer so we'll be able to work out no
two<00:00:20.189> observers<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.000> will<00:00:21.119> be<00:00:21.270> able<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.449> work

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
two observers so we will be able to work

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.330 
two observers so we will be able to work
out<00:00:21.720> against<00:00:22.080> mines<00:00:22.320> fairly<00:00:23.189> well<00:00:23.310> but

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
out against mines fairly well but

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.400 
out against mines fairly well but
artosis<00:00:23.730> making<00:00:24.480> no<00:00:24.570> indication<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.080> slowing

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
artosis making no indication of slowing

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.960 
artosis making no indication of slowing
down with<00:00:25.680> his<00:00:25.800> tech<00:00:26.010> he's<00:00:26.220> not<00:00:26.369> really

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
down with his tech he's not really

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.460 
down with his tech he's not really
pushing<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.539> take<00:00:27.810> another<00:00:28.019> expansion

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
pushing out to take another expansion

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.050 
pushing out to take another expansion
he's<00:00:28.800> still<00:00:29.130> got<00:00:29.279> his<00:00:29.310> armory<00:00:29.730> up<00:00:29.849> he's<00:00:30.029> not

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
he's still got his armory up he's not

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.429 
he's still got his armory up he's not
really<00:00:30.269> transitioning<00:00:30.810> troops<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.170> his<00:00:31.260> upper

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
really transitioning troops in his upper

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.260 
really transitioning troops in his upper
left-hand<00:00:31.650> corner<00:00:31.769> either<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.790> I'm<00:00:33.030> kind<00:00:33.239> of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
left-hand corner either so I'm kind of

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.790 
left-hand corner either so I'm kind of
curious<00:00:33.480> what<00:00:33.840> he's<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.290> now<00:00:34.320> as<00:00:34.620> well

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
curious what he's up to now as well

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.799 
curious what he's up to now as well
perhaps<00:00:35.070> he<00:00:35.309> realizes<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.690> an

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
perhaps he realizes that I just have an

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.569 
perhaps he realizes that I just have an
overwhelming<00:00:37.110> true<00:00:37.559> count<00:00:37.800> louder<00:00:38.070> currently

careful<00:00:56.370> looks<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.640> he<00:00:56.730> does<00:00:56.879> manage<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120
