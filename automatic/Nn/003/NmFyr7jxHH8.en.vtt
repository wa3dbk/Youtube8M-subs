00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.530 

so<00:00:06.560> basically<00:00:07.340> this<00:00:07.490> is<00:00:07.550> what<00:00:07.670> it<00:00:07.880> does<00:00:08.059> you

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
so basically this is what it does you

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.910 
so basically this is what it does you
step<00:00:08.809> on<00:00:08.930> the<00:00:08.960> pressure<00:00:09.170> plate<00:00:09.260> in<00:00:09.559> here<00:00:09.740> and

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
step on the pressure plate in here and

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.610 
step on the pressure plate in here and
you<00:00:10.040> are<00:00:10.160> fully<00:00:10.430> enclosed<00:00:10.850> by<00:00:11.090> books<00:00:11.410> to<00:00:12.410> get

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
you are fully enclosed by books to get

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.880 
you are fully enclosed by books to get
high<00:00:12.770> enchanting<00:00:13.280> levels<00:00:14.559> I'm<00:00:15.559> going<00:00:15.680> to<00:00:15.740> walk

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
high enchanting levels I'm going to walk

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.810 
high enchanting levels I'm going to walk
you<00:00:15.920> through<00:00:16.250> each<00:00:16.279> step<00:00:16.550> of<00:00:17.060> the<00:00:17.150> wiring<00:00:17.900> and

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
you through each step of the wiring and

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.359 
you through each step of the wiring and
yes<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:20.090> only<00:00:20.510> exposed<00:00:21.380> wiring<00:00:21.739> after<00:00:22.189> you're

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
yes the only exposed wiring after you're

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.440 
yes the only exposed wiring after you're
done<00:00:22.550> will<00:00:23.509> be<00:00:23.689> if<00:00:23.869> you<00:00:23.900> if<00:00:24.410> your<00:00:24.619> wall<00:00:24.919> isn't

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
done will be if you if your wall isn't

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.290 
done will be if you if your wall isn't
right<00:00:26.450> here<00:00:26.750> you'll<00:00:26.989> have<00:00:27.079> to<00:00:27.349> have<00:00:27.529> a<00:00:28.300> little

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
right here you'll have to have a little

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.909 
right here you'll have to have a little
bit<00:00:29.509> of<00:00:29.540> exposed<00:00:29.989> wiring<00:00:30.259> but<00:00:30.560> I<00:00:30.619> think<00:00:30.860> that

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
bit of exposed wiring but I think that

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.940 
bit of exposed wiring but I think that
it<00:00:31.759> should<00:00:32.000> be<00:00:32.060> minimal<00:00:32.500> so<00:00:33.500> you're<00:00:33.860> gonna

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
it should be minimal so you're gonna

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.670 
it should be minimal so you're gonna
want<00:00:34.130> to<00:00:34.190> start<00:00:34.430> by<00:00:34.670> digging<00:00:35.510> a<00:00:35.660> hole<00:00:35.690> two<00:00:36.410> down

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
want to start by digging a hole two down

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.180 
want to start by digging a hole two down
and<00:00:36.950> it<00:00:37.430> will<00:00:37.550> be<00:00:37.700> one<00:00:38.030> two<00:00:38.690> three<00:00:39.350> four<00:00:39.710> five

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
and it will be one two three four five

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.980 
and it will be one two three four five
six<00:00:40.940> seven<00:00:41.330> eight<00:00:41.900> nine<00:00:42.320> nine<00:00:43.150> by<00:00:44.150> nine<00:00:44.930> I

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
six seven eight nine nine by nine I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.440 
six seven eight nine nine by nine I
believe<00:00:45.610> so<00:00:46.610> I'm<00:00:46.730> going<00:00:46.760> to<00:00:46.880> start<00:00:47.120> with<00:00:47.300> that

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
believe so I'm going to start with that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:01:01.500 
believe so I'm going to start with that
now<00:00:50.350> five<00:00:51.350> six<00:00:52.100> seven<00:00:52.700> eight<00:00:53.210> nine<00:00:59.560> 123456789

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
now five six seven eight nine 123456789

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.210 
now five six seven eight nine 123456789
um<00:01:02.510> I<00:01:02.570> think<00:01:03.050> one<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.380> the<00:01:03.500> cool<00:01:03.710> things<00:01:03.739> about

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
um I think one of the cool things about

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.620 
um I think one of the cool things about
this<00:01:04.369> design<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:05.089> that<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.780> doesn't<00:01:06.650> actually

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
this design is that it doesn't actually

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.090 
this design is that it doesn't actually
use<00:01:08.630> too<00:01:08.869> many<00:01:08.960> repeaters<00:01:09.469> you<00:01:09.679> don't<00:01:09.890> need

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
use too many repeaters you don't need

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.330 
use too many repeaters you don't need
repeaters<00:01:10.579> for<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.030> top<00:01:11.359> top<00:01:11.869> half<00:01:12.170> on<00:01:13.130> those

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
repeaters for the top top half on those

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.090 
repeaters for the top top half on those
sticky<00:01:13.729> pistons<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:15.229> you<00:01:15.350> should<00:01:15.710> be<00:01:15.740> aware

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
sticky pistons so you should be aware

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.639 
sticky pistons so you should be aware
though<00:01:16.159> that<00:01:16.549> on<00:01:17.090> this<00:01:17.479> does<00:01:17.719> use<00:01:17.749> sticky

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
though that on this does use sticky

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.099 
though that on this does use sticky
pistons<00:01:19.359> so<00:01:20.359> if<00:01:20.450> you<00:01:20.539> don't<00:01:20.630> have<00:01:20.780> sticky

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
pistons so if you don't have sticky

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.080 
pistons so if you don't have sticky
pistons<00:01:21.469> this<00:01:21.740> might<00:01:21.950> not<00:01:22.069> be<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.549> right

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
pistons this might not be the right

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.719 
pistons this might not be the right
thing<00:01:23.240> for<00:01:23.539> you<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.659> do<00:01:23.810> watching<00:01:24.369> but<00:01:25.369> you

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
thing for you to do watching but you

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.709 
thing for you to do watching but you
know<00:01:25.850> whatever<00:01:26.210> um<00:01:27.109> if<00:01:28.039> you<00:01:28.280> haven't<00:01:28.579> done<00:01:28.719> it

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
know whatever um if you haven't done it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.690 
know whatever um if you haven't done it
already<00:01:29.960> I'd<00:01:30.409> love<00:01:30.649> for<00:01:30.679> you<00:01:30.829> to<00:01:30.889> check<00:01:30.979> out<00:01:31.280> my

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
actually making this video I don't

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.789 
actually making this video I don't
usually<00:01:44.270> make<00:01:44.569> videos<00:01:44.929> on<00:01:45.139> things<00:01:45.499> like<00:01:45.619> this

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
usually make videos on things like this

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.429 
usually make videos on things like this
unless<00:01:45.979> they<00:01:46.249> requested<00:01:46.789> but<00:01:47.569> I<00:01:47.840> saw<00:01:48.229> this

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
unless they requested but I saw this

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.319 
unless they requested but I saw this
this<00:01:51.439> was<00:01:51.649> on<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:52.249> Minecraft<00:01:52.819> Forum<00:01:53.060> there

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
this was on the Minecraft Forum there

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.050 
this was on the Minecraft Forum there
was<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.479> post<00:01:53.749> with<00:01:53.929> this<00:01:54.109> and<00:01:54.850> there<00:01:55.850> was<00:01:56.029> a

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
was a post with this and there was a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.940 
was a post with this and there was a
bunch<00:01:56.209> of<00:01:56.389> people<00:01:56.600> asking<00:01:57.289> for<00:01:57.499> it<00:01:57.560> tutorials

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
bunch of people asking for it tutorials

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.760 
bunch of people asking for it tutorials
so<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.159> figured<00:01:58.639> on<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.749> person<00:02:00.109> that<00:02:00.139> made<00:02:00.499> its

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
so I figured on the person that made its

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.889 
so I figured on the person that made its
not<00:02:00.920> going<00:02:01.099> to<00:02:01.340> what<00:02:02.270> should<00:02:02.479> have<00:02:02.659> him<00:02:02.779> look

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
not going to what should have him look

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.080 
not going to what should have him look
like<00:02:03.049> he<00:02:03.200> had<00:02:03.229> yet

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
like he had yet

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.190 
like he had yet

assume you're using wooden planks for
this<00:02:11.180> room<00:02:11.739> because<00:02:12.739> that's<00:02:14.019> what<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.170> top<00:02:15.379> of

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
to do this would be to make a ring of

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.910 
to do this would be to make a ring of
wooden<00:03:27.950> planks<00:03:28.430> or<00:03:28.579> any<00:03:28.790> material<00:03:29.470> above<00:03:30.470> them

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
to place them on so that'll make it

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.800

oh oh my bad my bad actually no don't do
that<00:04:43.730> okay<00:04:44.150> two<00:04:44.900> down<00:04:45.140> and<00:04:45.410> then<00:04:46.250> you're<00:04:46.610> gonna

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
that okay two down and then you're gonna

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.270 
that okay two down and then you're gonna
put<00:04:46.940> your<00:04:46.970> redstone<00:04:47.420> and<00:04:47.750> then<00:04:48.680> if<00:04:48.980> you<00:04:49.070> go<00:04:49.220> to

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
put your redstone and then if you go to

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.560 
put your redstone and then if you go to
the<00:04:49.580> other<00:04:49.730> side<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.480> you<00:04:50.660> go<00:04:50.950> just<00:04:51.950> like<00:04:52.070> this

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
the other side and you go just like this

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.390 
the other side and you go just like this
you<00:04:53.570> will<00:04:53.750> see<00:04:54.020> that<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:54.710> Redstone<00:04:55.190> will

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
you will see that the Redstone will

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.550 
you will see that the Redstone will
actually<00:04:55.730> go<00:04:55.910> through<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.300> piston<00:04:56.750> this<00:04:57.410> is

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
actually go through the piston this is

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.030 
actually go through the piston this is
good<00:04:57.740> for<00:04:57.920> two<00:04:58.070> reasons<00:04:58.310> it<00:04:59.270> works<00:04:59.600> because

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
good for two reasons it works because

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.380 
good for two reasons it works because
Pistons<00:05:01.040> I<00:05:01.340> suppose<00:05:01.850> are<00:05:02.720> counted<00:05:03.320> as

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
Pistons I suppose are counted as

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.020 
Pistons I suppose are counted as
transparent<00:05:05.390> blocks<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:07.790> other<00:05:07.910> thing

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
transparent blocks and the other thing

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:15.970 
transparent blocks and the other thing
being<00:05:08.870> on<00:05:09.320> a<00:05:11.230> reason<00:05:12.610> being<00:05:13.610> that<00:05:14.740> it<00:05:15.740> will

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
being on a reason being that it will

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.690 
being on a reason being that it will
also<00:05:16.070> power<00:05:17.290> that<00:05:18.290> piston<00:05:18.680> so<00:05:18.980> you're<00:05:19.610> going

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
also power that piston so you're going

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.160 
also power that piston so you're going
to<00:05:19.760> have<00:05:20.000> these<00:05:20.570> go<00:05:22.210> yes<00:05:23.210> okay<00:05:23.870> sorry<00:05:24.140> about

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
to have these go yes okay sorry about

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.540 
to have these go yes okay sorry about
that<00:05:24.320> you<00:05:24.740> know<00:05:24.860> if<00:05:24.980> you<00:05:25.040> could<00:05:25.130> do<00:05:25.250> that<00:05:25.280> or

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
that you know if you could do that or

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.760 
that you know if you could do that or
not<00:05:25.670> but<00:05:25.850> I'm<00:05:26.150> back<00:05:26.330> okay<00:05:27.260> so<00:05:27.320> you're<00:05:27.590> going<00:05:27.680> to

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
not but I'm back okay so you're going to

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.890 
not but I'm back okay so you're going to
want<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:27.920> go<00:05:28.070> around<00:05:28.910> from<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:29.450> side<00:05:29.660> that<00:05:29.690> you

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
want to go around from the side that you

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.070 
want to go around from the side that you
have<00:05:30.080> or<00:05:30.410> going<00:05:31.100> to<00:05:31.280> have<00:05:31.490> your<00:05:32.080> pressure

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
have or going to have your pressure

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.670 
have or going to have your pressure
plate<00:05:33.410> on<00:05:33.910> you're<00:05:34.910> going<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.090> want<00:05:35.180> to<00:05:35.240> go<00:05:35.300> on

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
plate on you're going to want to go on

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.950 
plate on you're going to want to go on
around<00:05:36.680> on<00:05:37.070> one<00:05:37.250> side<00:05:37.520> just<00:05:37.820> to<00:05:37.940> the<00:05:38.150> last

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
around on one side just to the last

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.470 
around on one side just to the last
piston<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:39.620> then<00:05:39.800> on<00:05:39.920> the<00:05:40.010> other<00:05:40.040> side<00:05:40.480> just

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
piston and then on the other side just

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.530 
piston and then on the other side just
as<00:05:41.780> far<00:05:42.050> to<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.650> second-to-last<00:05:43.130> piston<00:05:43.730> so

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
as far to the second-to-last piston so

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.820 
as far to the second-to-last piston so
you're<00:05:44.810> going<00:05:44.900> to<00:05:44.960> want<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.170> put<00:05:45.350> in<00:05:45.500> a

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
you're going to want to put in a

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.310 
you're going to want to put in a
repeater<00:05:46.220> right<00:05:46.880> here<00:05:47.480> and<00:05:47.690> then<00:05:48.200> you're

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
repeater right here and then you're

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.930 
repeater right here and then you're
going<00:05:48.410> to<00:05:48.470> want<00:05:48.590> to<00:05:48.710> do<00:05:48.830> or<00:05:49.160> Peter<00:05:49.430> facing

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
going to want to do or Peter facing

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.420 
going to want to do or Peter facing
every<00:05:50.540> piston<00:05:51.020> on<00:05:51.230> the<00:05:51.320> entire<00:05:51.620> first<00:05:52.070> level

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
every piston on the entire first level

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.300 
every piston on the entire first level
so<00:05:53.270> for<00:05:53.750> this<00:05:53.930> one<00:05:54.170> it<00:05:54.380> doesn't<00:05:54.560> matter<00:05:54.830> which

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
so for this one it doesn't matter which

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.280 
so for this one it doesn't matter which
side<00:05:55.640> you<00:05:55.820> power<00:05:56.060> it<00:05:56.150> from<00:05:56.420> both<00:05:56.690> either<00:05:56.960> one

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
side you power it from both either one

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.010 
side you power it from both either one
will<00:05:57.440> work<00:05:58.150> so<00:05:59.150> you<00:05:59.240> don't<00:05:59.450> have<00:05:59.540> to<00:05:59.690> power<00:05:59.900> it

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
will work so you don't have to power it

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.510 
will work so you don't have to power it
from<00:06:00.200> both<00:06:00.380> just<00:06:00.770> getting<00:06:01.040> that<00:06:01.130> out<00:06:01.280> the<00:06:01.400> way

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
from both just getting that out the way

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.000 
from both just getting that out the way
same<00:06:01.820> thing<00:06:02.000> with<00:06:02.150> this<00:06:02.270> corner<00:06:02.720> and<00:06:02.900> all<00:06:03.860> the

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
same thing with this corner and all the

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.390 
same thing with this corner and all the
corners<00:06:04.340> go<00:06:04.490> that<00:06:04.670> way<00:06:04.820> so<00:06:06.100> so<00:06:07.100> now<00:06:07.220> that

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
corners go that way so so now that

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.800 
corners go that way so so now that
you've<00:06:07.490> got<00:06:07.670> all<00:06:07.850> your<00:06:07.880> bottom<00:06:08.360> Pistons

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
you've got all your bottom Pistons

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.130 
you've got all your bottom Pistons
powered<00:06:09.200> you<00:06:09.290> can<00:06:09.440> put<00:06:10.190> down<00:06:10.400> a<00:06:10.820> block<00:06:11.810> and

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
powered you can put down a block and

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.660 
powered you can put down a block and
your<00:06:12.290> pressure<00:06:12.500> plate<00:06:12.770> and<00:06:12.950> test<00:06:13.130> it<00:06:13.280> out<00:06:13.370> so

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
your pressure plate and test it out so

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.250 
your pressure plate and test it out so
as<00:06:13.880> you<00:06:14.030> can<00:06:14.120> see<00:06:14.300> I've<00:06:14.480> got<00:06:14.510> all<00:06:14.840> my<00:06:14.870> bottom

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
as you can see I've got all my bottom

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.510 
as you can see I've got all my bottom
Pistons<00:06:15.710> are<00:06:16.360> working<00:06:17.360> nicely<00:06:17.570> so<00:06:18.410> now<00:06:18.980> this

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
Pistons are working nicely so now this

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.650 
Pistons are working nicely so now this
is<00:06:19.910> what<00:06:20.410> depends<00:06:21.410> for<00:06:21.680> who<00:06:22.070> you<00:06:22.220> are<00:06:22.430> so<00:06:23.270> what

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
is what depends for who you are so what

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.960 
is what depends for who you are so what
I<00:06:23.870> did<00:06:23.930> was<00:06:24.170> since<00:06:25.100> the<00:06:25.310> fur<00:06:25.520> tutorial

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
I did was since the fur tutorial

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.230 
I did was since the fur tutorial
purposes<00:06:26.240> I<00:06:26.720> just<00:06:27.410> led<00:06:27.680> my<00:06:27.980> redstone<00:06:28.220> out

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.029 

and<00:06:31.630> made<00:06:32.020> a<00:06:32.229> tiny<00:06:32.560> little<00:06:32.770> staircase<00:06:33.539> but<00:06:34.539> an

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
and made a tiny little staircase but an

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.059 
and made a tiny little staircase but an
easier<00:06:36.039> way<00:06:36.250> to<00:06:36.280> do<00:06:36.610> this<00:06:36.819> if<00:06:37.720> you<00:06:38.139> have<00:06:38.560> some

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:39.069 
easier way to do this if you have some

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.580 
easier way to do this if you have some
sticks<00:06:40.030> you<00:06:40.240> can<00:06:40.389> make<00:06:40.509> redstone<00:06:40.780> torches<00:06:41.440> I

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
sticks you can make redstone torches I

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.510 
sticks you can make redstone torches I
don't<00:06:41.740> know<00:06:41.800> if<00:06:41.860> you<00:06:41.919> know<00:06:42.039> about<00:06:42.069> vertical

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
don't know if you know about vertical

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.029 
don't know if you know about vertical
redstone<00:06:43.000> but<00:06:43.810> if<00:06:43.900> you<00:06:43.960> can<00:06:44.139> find<00:06:44.680> a<00:06:44.830> way<00:06:44.979> to

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 
redstone but if you can find a way to

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:47.700 
redstone but if you can find a way to
hide<00:06:45.310> this<00:06:45.580> in<00:06:45.789> your<00:06:45.880> house<00:06:46.030> summer<00:06:46.330> it<00:06:47.110> really

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
hide this in your house summer it really

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.930
