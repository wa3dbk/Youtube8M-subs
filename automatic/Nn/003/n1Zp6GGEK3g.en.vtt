it's gonna be very shadowy it's very
dark<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.759> can't<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.090> people<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.720> corners

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
dark you can't see people in corners

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.660 
dark you can't see people in corners
probably<00:01:47.820> um<00:01:48.170> just<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.439> guess<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.009> little<00:01:50.399> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
probably um just I guess a little a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.370 
probably um just I guess a little a
little<00:01:50.970> bub<00:01:51.270> halfway<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:51.840> I'll<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.290> on

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
little bub halfway so I'll have it on

little bub halfway so I'll have it on
the<00:01:52.920> Xbox<00:01:53.130> version<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:55.320> should<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.740> able<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the Xbox version you should be able to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.179 
the Xbox version you should be able to
see<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.329> there's<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.200> little<00:01:58.409> box<00:01:58.649> here<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
see the there's like little box here you

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.469 
see the there's like little box here you
should<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.579> able<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.790> see<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.000> top<00:02:00.180> pretty

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
should be able to see the top pretty

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.469 
should be able to see the top pretty
well<00:02:01.070> which<00:02:02.070> says<00:02:02.250> not<00:02:02.490> visible<00:02:02.969> barely

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
well which says not visible barely

well which says not visible barely
visible<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.280> visible<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.700> want<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> see<00:02:06.360> not

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
visible and visible you want to see not

visible but not

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.180

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
really would be able to see it and of

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.620 
really would be able to see it and of
course<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.790> different<00:02:13.240> for<00:02:13.390> every

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
course this is different for every

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
single TV type of TV you have and

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.490 
single TV type of TV you have and
everything<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.060> maybe<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.510> little<00:02:16.750> treat<00:02:17.200> for

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
everything so maybe a little treat for

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.890 
everything so maybe a little treat for
you<00:02:17.710> then<00:02:17.920> compared<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.340> me<00:02:18.490> yes<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.720> is

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
you then compared to me yes and this is

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.440 
you then compared to me yes and this is
a<00:02:19.930> great<00:02:20.140> way<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.500> see<00:02:20.740> people<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.490> you

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
a great way just to see people and you

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.330 
a great way just to see people and you
know<00:02:22.630> people<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.440> hide<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.830> corners

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
know people that hide in the corners

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.400 
know people that hide in the corners
like<00:02:24.520> this<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:25.420> one<00:02:25.570> corner<00:02:25.870> mom<00:02:26.110> for<00:02:26.290> two

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
like this that one corner mom for two

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.600 
like this that one corner mom for two
people<00:02:26.680> would<00:02:26.770> hide<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.190> cannot<00:02:27.400> see

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
people would hide and you cannot see

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.090 
people would hide and you cannot see
them<00:02:27.790> at<00:02:27.910> all<00:02:28.210> all<00:02:29.170> right<00:02:31.560> all<00:02:32.560> right<00:02:32.620> guys<00:02:32.830> no

all about how you played the game if

all about how you played the game if

you'd like to kill people at long range
you're<00:02:40.960> going<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.470> want<00:02:41.710> a<00:02:41.980> low<00:02:42.520> low

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
you're going to want a low low

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.870 
you're going to want a low low
sensitivity<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.740> probably<00:02:45.160> went<00:02:45.340> from<00:02:45.460> one

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
sensitivity and probably went from one

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.320 
sensitivity and probably went from one
to<00:02:46.180> three<00:02:46.210> if<00:02:46.990> you<00:02:47.890> like<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.640> have<00:02:48.850> people<00:02:49.210> like

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
to three if you like to have people like

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.940 
to three if you like to have people like
right<00:02:49.840> next<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.380> if<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.620> shoot<00:02:50.860> them

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
right next to you if you shoot them

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.920 
right next to you if you shoot them
you're<00:02:51.460> probably<00:02:51.910> going<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.240> want<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.600> bit

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
you're probably going to want a bit

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.200 
you're probably going to want a bit
higher<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.470> sensitivity<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.370> probably

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
higher of a sensitivity of probably

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.900 
higher of a sensitivity of probably
about<00:02:55.390> an<00:02:55.570> 8<00:02:55.840> 9<00:02:56.140> may<00:02:56.710> probably<00:02:57.220> not<00:02:57.460> a<00:02:57.490> 10

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
about an 8 9 may probably not a 10

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.550 
about an 8 9 may probably not a 10
because<00:02:58.390> even<00:02:58.690> if<00:02:58.780> they're<00:02:58.930> too<00:02:59.110> close<00:02:59.380> you

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
because even if they're too close you

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.880 
because even if they're too close you
just<00:02:59.680> go<00:02:59.770> right<00:02:59.800> over<00:03:00.040> them<00:03:00.460> but<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.620> basically

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
just go right over them but so basically

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.130 
just go right over them but so basically
the<00:03:03.010> pens<00:03:03.220> pens<00:03:03.760> unit<00:03:04.090> like<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.390> snipe<00:03:04.630> again

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
the pens pens unit like the snipe again

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.930 
the pens pens unit like the snipe again
have<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.500> low<00:03:05.770> sensitivity<00:03:06.010> likely<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.850> be

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
have a low sensitivity likely to be

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.040 
have a low sensitivity likely to be
really<00:03:07.150> really<00:03:07.270> close<00:03:07.510> people<00:03:07.780> have<00:03:08.020> a

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
really really close people have a

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.410 
really really close people have a
highest<00:03:08.440> intuitive<00:03:08.890> some<00:03:09.390> sensitivities<00:03:10.390> you

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
highest intuitive some sensitivities you

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.390 
highest intuitive some sensitivities you
can<00:03:10.660> easily<00:03:10.930> turn<00:03:11.080> on<00:03:11.200> people<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:11.980> and

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
can easily turn on people and you and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.160 
can easily turn on people and you and
stuff<00:03:12.640> like<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.630> basically<00:03:14.080> the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
stuff like that and the basically the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.330 
stuff like that and the basically the
reason<00:03:14.440> why<00:03:14.560> is<00:03:14.620> when<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:14.950> go<00:03:15.100> over<00:03:15.250> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
reason why is when you go over the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.390 
reason why is when you go over the
crosshair<00:03:15.880> if<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:17.110> move<00:03:17.290> too<00:03:17.650> fast<00:03:17.950> at<00:03:18.340> a

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
crosshair if you move too fast at a

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.280 
crosshair if you move too fast at a
longer<00:03:18.730> distance<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.420> go<00:03:19.600> right<00:03:19.870> over<00:03:20.170> them

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
longer distance you go right over them

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.940 
longer distance you go right over them
very<00:03:20.650> very<00:03:20.890> easily<00:03:21.780> at<00:03:22.780> close<00:03:23.110> range<00:03:23.500> if<00:03:23.830> you

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
very very easily at close range if you

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.520 
very very easily at close range if you
have<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.550> fastness<00:03:25.180> Attila<00:03:25.720> T<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.110> the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
have the fastness Attila T and the

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.979 
have the fastness Attila T and the
really<00:03:26.860> close<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.280> big<00:03:27.550> or<00:03:27.700> target<00:03:28.150> compared

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
really close to big or target compared

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.680 
really close to big or target compared
to<00:03:29.110> a<00:03:29.140> smaller<00:03:29.530> one<00:03:29.860> so<00:03:30.670> it's<00:03:30.940> okay<00:03:31.270> if<00:03:31.540> the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
to a smaller one so it's okay if the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.960 
to a smaller one so it's okay if the
cross<00:03:31.930> you're<00:03:32.170> turned<00:03:32.500> we're<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.310> fast<00:03:33.580> to<00:03:33.790> kill

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
cross you're turned we're a fast to kill

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.760 
cross you're turned we're a fast to kill
them<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.080> can<00:03:35.200> turn<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.380> running<00:03:35.620> past

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
them so you can turn the running past

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.040 
them so you can turn the running past
and<00:03:36.010> get<00:03:36.130> somebody<00:03:36.550> if<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.360> had<00:03:37.540> able<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.900> even

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
and get somebody if you had able to even

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.449 
and get somebody if you had able to even
even<00:03:38.350> have<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.620> school<00:03:38.860> able<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.190> control

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
even have that school able to control

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.460 
even have that school able to control
that<00:03:39.640> sensitivity<00:03:40.060> then<00:03:40.780> you'll<00:03:41.019> be<00:03:41.110> more

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
that sensitivity then you'll be more

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.710 
that sensitivity then you'll be more
likely<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.920> do<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.070> lot<00:03:42.340> better<00:03:42.550> at<00:03:42.730> close<00:03:42.940> range

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
likely to do a lot better at close range

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.780 
likely to do a lot better at close range
the<00:03:43.930> high<00:03:44.050> sensitivity<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:45.010> see<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.519> lot<00:03:45.760> of
