yes okay so that's more or less gives
you<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> acceleration<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.790> your<00:01:06.090> race<00:01:06.299> when

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you the acceleration of your race when

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.010 
you the acceleration of your race when
you<00:01:07.200> take<00:01:07.830> off<00:01:07.979> or<00:01:08.189> landing<00:01:09.060> yeah<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.659> use<00:01:09.869> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
you take off or landing yeah you use it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.570 
you take off or landing yeah you use it
forward<00:01:11.010> hold<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:12.000> at<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.830> air<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> air

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
forward hold on at the air on the air

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.510 
forward hold on at the air on the air
you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.509> reduce<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.549> order<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.720> a

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
you can reduce it so in order to have a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.810 
you can reduce it so in order to have a
little<00:01:20.520> fuel<00:01:20.810> per<00:01:21.810> hour

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.649

warning system we put it on after

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.580 
warning system we put it on after
takeoff<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:36.430> they<00:04:36.820> warned<00:04:37.390> us<00:04:37.570> before<00:04:37.630> storm

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
pleasures all all these three this is

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:58.610 
pleasures all all these three this is
the<00:04:50.260> horsepower<00:04:50.920> from<00:04:53.100> we<00:04:54.100> choose<00:04:55.380> rpm<00:04:56.610> from

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
the horsepower from we choose rpm from

engine temperature air temperature also

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.370 
engine temperature air temperature also
and<00:05:04.750> this<00:05:05.620> is<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:05.950> panel<00:05:06.250> from<00:05:06.520> engine<00:05:07.060> start

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
and this is the panel from engine start

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.820 
and this is the panel from engine start
okay<00:05:08.820> this<00:05:09.820> is<00:05:10.060> a<00:05:10.300> red<00:05:10.510> also<00:05:10.750> because<00:05:11.350> this<00:05:11.770> is

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
okay this is a red also because this is

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.180 
okay this is a red also because this is
the<00:05:12.010> fuel<00:05:12.400> that<00:05:12.700> we<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.540> line<00:05:13.800> goes<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.830> the

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
the fuel that we the line goes to the

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.490 
the fuel that we the line goes to the
engine<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:17.430> this<00:05:18.430> is<00:05:18.940> from<00:05:19.360> only<00:05:19.870> four<00:05:20.050> from

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
engine and this is from only four from

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.490 
engine and this is from only four from
start<00:05:21.070> or<00:05:21.340> from<00:05:21.760> a<00:05:22.120> problem<00:05:22.630> on<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:22.960> air<00:05:23.080> from

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
start or from a problem on the air from

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.700 
start or from a problem on the air from
have<00:05:24.010> a<00:05:24.040> problem<00:05:24.520> we<00:05:25.650> use<00:05:26.650> this<00:05:27.040> panel<00:05:27.490> to<00:05:28.710> have

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
have a problem we use this panel to have

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.560 
have a problem we use this panel to have
a<00:05:31.380> energy<00:05:32.380> chart<00:05:32.800> on<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.220> air<00:05:33.340> if<00:05:33.580> isn't<00:05:34.420> it

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
a energy chart on the air if isn't it

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.110 
a energy chart on the air if isn't it
you<00:05:35.020> have<00:05:35.440> a<00:05:35.470> problem<00:05:38.730> so<00:05:39.730> where<00:05:39.940> do<00:05:40.030> you

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
you have a problem so where do you

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.750 
you have a problem so where do you
actually<00:05:40.270> operate<00:05:40.780> the<00:05:41.020> water<00:05:41.470> from<00:05:42.130> the

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
actually operate the water from the

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.720 
actually operate the water from the
water<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.150> diseases<00:05:43.720> businesses<00:05:44.530> if<00:05:45.160> you<00:05:45.430> put

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
water the diseases businesses if you put

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.320 
water the diseases businesses if you put
it<00:05:45.880> forward<00:05:46.540> yeah<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.770> big<00:05:48.040> doors<00:05:48.370> open<00:05:48.880> okay

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
it forward yeah the big doors open okay

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.490 
it forward yeah the big doors open okay
if<00:05:50.140> you<00:05:50.290> need<00:05:50.470> to<00:05:50.650> use<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:51.760> little<00:05:52.060> one<00:05:52.500> this

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
if you need to use the little one this

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.860 
if you need to use the little one this
is<00:05:53.680> the<00:05:53.830> line<00:05:54.040> crop<00:05:54.340> spraying<00:05:54.910> electrical

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
is the line crop spraying electrical

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.620 
is the line crop spraying electrical
engine<00:05:56.140> we<00:05:56.470> put<00:05:56.680> tunnels<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:57.520> this<00:05:57.760> is<00:05:58.050> the

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
engine we put tunnels and this is the

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.810 
engine we put tunnels and this is the
switch<00:06:01.630> that<00:06:01.930> we<00:06:02.110> put<00:06:02.500> forward<00:06:02.800> and<00:06:03.250> the

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
switch that we put forward and the

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.960 
switch that we put forward and the
little<00:06:04.240> on<00:06:04.300> open<00:06:04.600> if<00:06:04.810> you<00:06:04.930> close<00:06:05.260> it<00:06:05.470> close<00:06:06.310> and

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
little on open if you close it close and

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.720 
little on open if you close it close and
we<00:06:07.450> can<00:06:07.630> lay<00:06:07.900> if<00:06:08.230> we<00:06:08.620> put<00:06:08.920> it<00:06:09.070> forward<00:06:09.370> and<00:06:09.640> back

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
we can lay if we put it forward and back

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.620 
we can lay if we put it forward and back
you<00:06:10.150> leave<00:06:10.930> about<00:06:11.140> two<00:06:11.940> hydrant<00:06:12.940> liters<00:06:13.390> water

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
you leave about two hydrant liters water

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.470 
you leave about two hydrant liters water
about<00:06:15.390> 250<00:06:16.390> it<00:06:16.960> depends<00:06:17.380> how<00:06:17.530> rapidly<00:06:18.040> is<00:06:18.820> the

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
about 250 it depends how rapidly is the

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.390 
about 250 it depends how rapidly is the
move<00:06:19.690> so<00:06:19.930> you<00:06:19.960> doing<00:06:20.260> all<00:06:20.470> that<00:06:20.530> and<00:06:20.890> flying

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
move so you doing all that and flying

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.820 
move so you doing all that and flying
