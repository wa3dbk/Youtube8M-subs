00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.020
 and guys who spend their friend here 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.869
 channel one and as you know has 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:20.140
 a new dlc came out the beach package 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.300
 which contains three new cars a boat and 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.520
 new weapons and with it come new 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.410
 missions as you already know is totally 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.720
 free when playing people online 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.820
 he tells them that the package is free and 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.869
 they have to install it and 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.750
 well many have been asking me 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.730
 hey and how did you get the cars like 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.290
 I can get them because as I already 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.870
 they know a lot we are used to 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.140
 get the cars either stolen by 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.610
 glitch or either cloned cars and 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.440
 Well, as many do not know and they have 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.300
 been wondering just because 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.879
 they have to take out the cell phone and they go to 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.100
 the page of vehicles and transports 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.110
 they get to southern san andreas super cars 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.289
 and they will be able to find the three new 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.500
 totally free cars that would be the bf 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.780
 seen the kalahari canis and the engraving 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.420
 to see the engraving personally 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.880
 this has four different colors already 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.680
 be the surf the shark the blogger and the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.930
 doctor so in this case I bought the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.130
 shark and more soon they will see it and 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.860
 how do you know the new 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.810
 super fast boat called speeder 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.369
 which is also totally free and 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.799
 I'm going to tell you how to get it right now 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.750
 and once they were ordered, 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.549
 they will arrive at their garages verify 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.979
 that have space and buy them and 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.280
 you can use them as you see this is the ps 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:37.000
 Personally track is the second car 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.090
 favorite that I liked about this new 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.329
 dlc either because it's off-road or walking 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.799
 in sand on a hill or whatever it is not and 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.009
 Now I'm going to show you what the 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.670
 new weapons the first weapon would be the 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.250
 gun is fine that even though it is 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.170
 a small pistol is very powerful and is 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.780
 a free weapon this is worth 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.119
 buy it as you see the colors are 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.610
 totally free also accessories 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.039
 everything is free in this case I bought a 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.160
 golden color so that it looked like 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.739
 more rough and in the other weapon would be the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.860
 broken bottle right now they will see how the 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.599
 I use they do quite harm as they see with 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.810
 the bottle can stab 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.069
 people and kill in one fell swoop 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.550
 even if they are running as they see 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.850
 they 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.100
 and fell to the first one and this one is already 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.560
 came out what would be the money and then the 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.340
 gun kills perfectly in addition to that 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.620
 that kills quickly and recharges also at 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.360
 same very fast this was one of my 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.730
 favorites this already the tour using in 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.150
 several missions not and now we are going to 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.010
 move on to what would be the engraving paradise 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.480
 as you see there I bought the version of the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.760
 if you 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.099
 of the three cars I would say that this is 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.890
 the least favorite because it's a little 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.599
 difficult to control but nevertheless what 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.730
 what I liked about this were the colors 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.709
 that come with it you already know what is the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.780
 paint case the customization of 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.459
 the painting as you see I chose the one of the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.890
 shark and then it 's how I tell you 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.760
 surf blogger and good bus the 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.650
 next car would be the canis calaje and 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.010
 this personally is the best of the 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.230
 three cars because it 's too much 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.780
 too easy to drive has good 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.579
 stability and it's also the fastest 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.340
 the three is like a kind of 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:31.120
 combination between a t-shirt combi and a 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.489
 beach jeep besides having colors 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.260
 very good and apart they can modify it 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.480
 not so they can do much more 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.450
 fast now I'm going to tell you how 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.910
 get the boat or what would be the 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.950
 spider good just what they have 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.930
 what to do is to be near the beach or 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.810
 from a dock and they simply take out the 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.650
 cellular search in your contacts 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.439
 locate with pieces 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.750
 and they go them they will answer a 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:59.840
 recorder that will ask you which 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.640
 they want me to bring them only for 200 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.950
 dollars are going to bring you select 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.810
 the boat 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.459
 spider if you already ordered it and 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.030
 As you can see, this one is going to give you 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.799
 location on the map and put the gps 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.260
 they go there they look for it and there it will be 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:18.139
 once you get it and it's yours and 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.019
 they will have as if they had two 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.030
 cars on the map does not and it already sets as your 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.240
 default car 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.650
 that's a quick boat if from the boats 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.350
 what's in the game is one of the most 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.530
 fast personal is my favorite 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.780
