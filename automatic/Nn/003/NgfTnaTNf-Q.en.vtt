00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.460
 hello hunting is on the belly 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.430
 not a weapon 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.430
 good weapon no it won't be you 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.270
 about food similar in characteristics 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.820
 completely cold only we took from 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.780

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.780
 that is enough 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.320
 behind 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.800
 and the skinners are hunting 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.800
 so tall even 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.920
 often interview 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.210
 why 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.810
 1700 to 1300 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.810
 set 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.200
 only 10 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:22.140
 called 0 4 carbon and 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.140
 10 hardening openness 50 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.780
 he is this urban cool 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.790
 you are everything 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.590
 need city fix 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.550
 convenient for all these work at home I can 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.550
 maybe if the city 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.540
 Well, due to the thickness of the blade to 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.530
 that the emphasis set in my opinion and now 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.530
 cones and start but the emphasis is already more modest 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.530
 here 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.330
 he wants 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.900
 but it was almost there 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.900
 up to 4-5 meters 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.290
 for weapons they both lack them if 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.720
 you baby find less than 30 so 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.410
 new seasons what's our name 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.410
 mont blanc 2 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.620
 suit on the 12th he sat down 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.180
 light touch 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:36.980
 and that on the wedge he has this treatment 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.760
 then from the quarry the knife went first 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.189
 job cycle problem is sent and he 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.099
 very much like the image of Bulat 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:49.770
 only weak weak weak because 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:53.540
 the structure is changing the pieces it has concave 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.540
 can of all the people 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.310
 Topic cycling legs 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.380

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.380
 part go to the back of the part insert 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.020
 I . such a straight is very cool us 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.489
 you can skip two clicks 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.230
 I know how 3000 rub 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.319
 Italian 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.319

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.790
 this is what 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.130
 it's palm brass 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.460
 polished brass lacquer hike 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.470
 And from skin there are such 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.470
 no yet we need a new generation 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.760
 and 107 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.099
 95 steel is not less than carbon 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.569
 on the smaller nazi pro we too 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.489
 slightly less 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.489
 cool she valve

 collects there will be few you leave 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.970
 the part we have so is going to be taken away 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.070
 how much is 7007 expensive 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.780
 and why because eating manual assembly 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.720
 was 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.139
 she purposely goes fitting the parts themselves 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.960
 you see 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:27.100
 no, you know, don't want to let it out 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.320
 fights will reduce chic 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.249
 thank 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.610
 Western coin is not a beauty here 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:38.639

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:42.749
 american mug rent soaked 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.920

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.830
 many ti same knife and 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.560
 new 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:12.130
 for the present there is little what is called a knife 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:16.270
 Pigsy need to go to him like a horse for 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:20.940
 cycle it people can just me and but u 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.940
 but you can 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.660
 can't 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.720
 interesting but the only thing too of course 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.370
 hard to pull out 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.389
 so most childhood if you do not know here 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.150
 this competition 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.680
 s-shaped 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.960
 Now I look a lot very much 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.289
 manufacturers began to bring from the fence 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.830
 but the friendâ€™s rik level records everyone knows 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:53.160
 we have already learned the s-shaped edge like this 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:58.320
 and had to just drag the project on 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:01.080
 messaging services overnight transfer 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.950
 and it is better to use the night if 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.720
 see how to pump 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.850
 because I know people who take 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.880
 just starts from here to here 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.580
 removes and now this output just on 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.210
 straight line but 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.009
 how on an arc this collects a cut from him 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:24.349
 much better here I tried just 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.349
 compared of course more interesting
