renewable energy real and something that

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.079 
renewable energy real and something that
actually<00:00:38.600> will<00:00:39.379> be<00:00:39.470> green<00:00:39.710> and<00:00:40.040> will<00:00:40.610> work<00:00:40.850> and

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089 
actually will be green and will work and

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.420 
actually will be green and will work and
can<00:00:41.360> be<00:00:41.479> cost<00:00:41.870> effective<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:42.979> challenge

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
can be cost effective and the challenge

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.570 
can be cost effective and the challenge
we<00:00:43.580> have<00:00:43.839> is<00:00:44.839> how<00:00:45.049> to<00:00:45.110> make<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:45.470> happen<00:00:45.650> the

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
we have is how to make that happen the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.860 
we have is how to make that happen the
reason<00:00:46.699> I<00:00:46.850> know<00:00:46.909> something<00:00:47.269> about<00:00:47.360> this<00:00:47.659> as

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
reason I know something about this as

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.420 
reason I know something about this as

energy storage and batteries play a key

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.120 
energy storage and batteries play a key
role<00:01:05.299> in<00:01:05.479> that<00:01:05.659> are<00:01:06.500> something<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:06.829> really

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
role in that are something that really

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.740 
role in that are something that really
can<00:01:07.280> make<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.460> difference<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:08.390> I<00:01:08.450> should<00:01:08.630> also

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
can make a difference and I should also

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.539 
can make a difference and I should also
say<00:01:08.990> that<00:01:09.020> energy<00:01:09.859> storage<00:01:10.159> can<00:01:10.310> be<00:01:10.399> done<00:01:10.520> a

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
say that energy storage can be done a

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:11.859 
say that energy storage can be done a

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
other things that can be done but

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.219 
other things that can be done but
batteries<00:01:22.219> for<00:01:22.549> both<00:01:22.820> cars<00:01:23.149> and<00:01:23.570> for<00:01:23.750> many

batteries for both cars and for many

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.109 
batteries for both cars and for many
utility<00:01:24.710> purposes<00:01:24.890> are<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.460> best<00:01:25.670> way<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:25.880> do

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
utility purposes are the best way to do

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.020 
utility purposes are the best way to do
it<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:26.469> the<00:01:27.469> challenge<00:01:27.890> we<00:01:28.070> have<00:01:28.100> with

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
it so the challenge we have with

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.469 
it so the challenge we have with
renewable<00:01:29.479> energy<00:01:29.539> today<00:01:30.399> is<00:01:31.399> that<00:01:31.729> there<00:01:32.390> are

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
renewable energy today is that there are

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.840 
renewable energy today is that there are
a<00:01:32.509> great<00:01:32.719> opportunity<00:01:33.380> 29<00:01:34.249> states<00:01:34.429> today

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
a great opportunity 29 states today

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.179 
a great opportunity 29 states today
require<00:01:35.299> that<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:35.990> utilities<00:01:36.469> be<00:01:36.770> working

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
require that the utilities be working

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.459 
require that the utilities be working
over<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.460> next<00:01:37.490> decade<00:01:37.999> to<00:01:38.179> adding<00:01:38.479> up<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:39.079> 33%

of their power coming from renewable
energy<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:42.229> challenge<00:01:42.829> however<00:01:43.009> is<00:01:43.399> that

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
energy the challenge however is that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.849 
energy the challenge however is that
those<00:01:44.390> renewable<00:01:44.899> sources<00:01:45.200> are<00:01:45.560> in<00:01:45.710> many

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
those renewable sources are in many

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.520 
those renewable sources are in many
cases<00:01:45.950> very<00:01:46.520> unpredictable<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:47.569> can't<00:01:48.289> count

efficiency and the challenge was

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.750 
efficiency and the challenge was
literally<00:03:48.989> they<00:03:49.380> didn't<00:03:49.620> want<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.950> wind<00:03:50.160> but

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
literally they didn't want the wind but

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.550 
literally they didn't want the wind but
if<00:03:50.819> you<00:03:50.910> had<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.120> way<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.329> star<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.410> would

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
if you had a way to star it you would

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.500 
if you had a way to star it you would
then<00:03:52.709> have<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:52.980> great<00:03:53.250> opportunity<00:03:53.370> what<00:03:54.359> this

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
then have a great opportunity what this

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.229 
then have a great opportunity what this
chart<00:03:54.720> shows<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.200> here<00:03:55.829> is<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.459> if<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.819> can

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
chart shows you here is that if you can

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.289 
chart shows you here is that if you can
build<00:03:57.799> energy<00:03:58.799> storage<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.639> can<00:03:59.850> take<00:04:00.120> that

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
build energy storage you can take that

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.090 
build energy storage you can take that
off<00:04:00.540> peak<00:04:00.840> energy<00:04:01.230> which<00:04:01.440> is<00:04:01.590> being<00:04:01.799> produced

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
off peak energy which is being produced

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.550 
off peak energy which is being produced
and<00:04:02.430> use<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.359> to<00:04:03.510> fill<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:03.930> during<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.380> peak

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
and use it to fill in during the peak

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.920 
and use it to fill in during the peak
period<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.130> therefore<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.359> don't<00:04:06.480> have<00:04:06.750> to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
period and therefore you don't have to

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.930 
period and therefore you don't have to
build<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.200> extra<00:04:07.470> plants<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.130> that's<00:04:08.700> the

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
build the extra plants and that's the

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.550 
build the extra plants and that's the
opportunity<00:04:09.569> that<00:04:09.690> energy<00:04:10.019> storage<00:04:10.380> job

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
opportunity that energy storage job

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.650 
opportunity that energy storage job
offers<00:04:11.340> because<00:04:11.519> otherwise<00:04:11.940> utilities<00:04:12.480> have

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
offers because otherwise utilities have

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.090

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
to build to the peak because they can't

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.759

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
on the system and the question so if you

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.610 
on the system and the question so if you
put<00:04:39.540> those<00:04:39.690> two<00:04:39.840> things<00:04:39.870> together

put those two things together

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.830 
put those two things together
you<00:04:41.130> then<00:04:41.310> come<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.180> challenge<00:04:42.570> you<00:04:42.660> have

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
you then come to the challenge you have

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.260 
you then come to the challenge you have
and<00:04:43.050> what<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.350> real<00:04:43.560> idea<00:04:43.980> is<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.820> electric

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
and what the real idea is that electric

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.480 
and what the real idea is that electric
cars<00:04:45.390> are<00:04:45.630> only<00:04:45.780> as<00:04:46.050> good<00:04:46.230> as<00:04:46.470> what<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.280> source

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
cars are only as good as what the source

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.940 
cars are only as good as what the source
of<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.670> power<00:04:47.790> is<00:04:48.060> so<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:49.320> know<00:04:49.410> if<00:04:49.620> China

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
of the power is so you know if China

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.950 
of the power is so you know if China
went<00:04:50.190> out<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.550> today<00:04:50.790> and<00:04:51.000> added<00:04:51.360> all<00:04:51.630> these

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
went out and today and added all these

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.470 
went out and today and added all these
power<00:04:52.230> using<00:04:53.040> their<00:04:53.160> current<00:04:53.520> methods<00:04:53.880> you

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
power using their current methods you

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.700 
power using their current methods you
would<00:04:54.570> end<00:04:54.720> up<00:04:54.780> with<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.930> much<00:04:55.050> dirtier<00:04:55.410> China

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
would end up with a much dirtier China

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.290 
would end up with a much dirtier China
even<00:04:56.070> if<00:04:56.160> everybody<00:04:56.430> was<00:04:56.700> using<00:04:56.970> electric

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
even if everybody was using electric

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.510 
even if everybody was using electric
cars<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.810> we<00:04:58.290> have<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.620> same<00:04:58.830> challenge<00:04:59.130> not

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
cars and we have that same challenge not

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.790 
cars and we have that same challenge not
only<00:04:59.700> here<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.150> everywhere<00:05:00.900> else<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.350> the

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
only here and everywhere else and the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.290 
only here and everywhere else and the
way<00:05:02.220> you<00:05:02.280> can<00:05:02.730> do<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:03.120> is<00:05:03.780> by<00:05:04.520> spreading<00:05:05.520> the

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
way you can do that is by spreading the

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.270 
way you can do that is by spreading the
energy<00:05:07.170> storage<00:05:07.530> around<00:05:07.920> different
