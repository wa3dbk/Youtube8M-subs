00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.920
 well gentlemen good would like to share with 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:18.540
 you something 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:22.200
 incredible the truth is to show you this 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.050
 little buddy turned 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.520
 the test a 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.620
 almost in gentlemen and degrees 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.900
 I decided to make videos because of the special 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.840
 of the opening 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:43.329
 really incredible I have no words 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.510
 for the emotion that I felt when I turned 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.840
 I'm still really like 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.080
 traumatized 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.150
 it's amazing this is the gift that I 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.960
 sent members of the birthday party 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.310
 forum and here have it tour two gentlemen 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.160
 I did not turn it over 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.110
 the tour dito did not turn it more back 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.670
 carlos because I imagine that with so much 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.909
 bolt this is most likely to be 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.390
 dam 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.390
 that I used to open it of course 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.460
 I did a logical thinking tension in the 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.960
 cam since there is no room to work 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.910
 and how it has bolts to the left and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.000
 right at the top to 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.090
 left and right use gozo joy box 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.690
 black pin by pin and for the part 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.890
 upper raked with the pick 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:42.020
 your land then well here they have the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.400
 opening of the win of the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.690
 of the weight of each 100 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.720
 let's find the key 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.570
 to see 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.570
 in here they have the combination that as 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.700
 you will see it is not so easy you have at your point 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.360
 erratic I imagine that they chose it 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.880
 with enough bad intention those of the forum 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.780
 but here they have gentlemen rotated 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.050
 to do full video of the pique or the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.190
 I really do not promise anything 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.400
 why 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.120
 Wow 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.200
 this opening really came out 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.709
 spectacular 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.110
 so then I'll try to see if I do the 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.299
 full opening but good I do not promise 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.819
 nothing gentlemen and anyway the 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.879
 opening itself fills me with joy 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.280
 the test almost tied in that they sent me in 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.159
