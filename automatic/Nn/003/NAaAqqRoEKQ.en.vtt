geodesic<00:00:10.740> domes<00:00:11.150> really<00:00:12.150> look<00:00:12.389> complicated

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
geodesic domes really look complicated

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.890 
geodesic domes really look complicated
but<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.769> actual<00:00:14.130> fact<00:00:14.219> they're<00:00:15.000> constructed

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
but in actual fact they're constructed

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.060 
but in actual fact they're constructed
of<00:00:16.320> two<00:00:16.980> different<00:00:17.670> lengths<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.240> tubing<00:00:19.070> our

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
of two different lengths of tubing our

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.290 
of two different lengths of tubing our
one<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> be<00:00:20.850> slightly<00:00:21.119> different

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
one is going to be slightly different

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.179 
one is going to be slightly different
though<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.170> we're<00:00:22.410> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> use<00:00:22.769> three

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
though and we're going to use three

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.970 
though and we're going to use three
lengths<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.420> after<00:00:24.930> acquiring<00:00:25.320> yourself<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
lengths so after acquiring yourself a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.370 
lengths so after acquiring yourself a
fully<00:00:26.369> could<00:00:26.760> make<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> workshop<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.930> can<00:00:28.230> end

creating the contour of the dome itself
next<00:01:45.149> job<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.659> go<00:01:45.810> back<00:01:46.079> inside<00:01:46.350> again<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
next job is to go back inside again and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.300 
next job is to go back inside again and
to<00:01:47.700> use<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.420> punch<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.680> punches<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> hole

cutting through the metal and it's a

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.920 
cutting through the metal and it's a
really<00:01:52.950> dangerous<00:01:53.369> machine<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.600> better

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
really dangerous machine so you better

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.219 
really dangerous machine so you better
watch<00:01:55.229> out<00:01:55.909> by<00:01:56.909> getting<00:01:57.210> your<00:01:57.509> thumb<00:01:57.960> out<00:01:58.200> of

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
need one person to take charge this is

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.410 
need one person to take charge this is
the<00:02:22.830> person<00:02:23.370> that's<00:02:23.550> going<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.910> get<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> blame

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
the person that's going to get the blame

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.960 
the person that's going to get the blame
when<00:02:24.989> everything<00:02:25.380> falls<00:02:25.620> down<00:02:25.739> so<00:02:26.520> he<00:02:26.670> has<00:02:26.819> to

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
when everything falls down so he has to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.220 
when everything falls down so he has to
be<00:02:27.090> really<00:02:27.810> really<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.350> ball<00:02:28.910> first<00:02:29.910> job

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
be really really on the ball first job

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.470 
be really really on the ball first job
said<00:02:31.230> everything<00:02:31.590> out<00:02:31.739> in<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.980> circle<00:02:32.520> take

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
said everything out in a circle take

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.750 
said everything out in a circle take
your<00:02:33.660> second<00:02:34.080> length<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.769> create<00:02:35.160> triangles

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
your second length and create triangles

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.840 
your second length and create triangles
with<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:39.080> once<00:02:40.080> they<00:02:40.200> are<00:02:40.350> done<00:02:40.590> then<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.670> have

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
with it once they are done then you have

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.940 
with it once they are done then you have
to<00:02:42.030> use<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.360> holes<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:43.170> attach<00:02:43.470> them<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.860> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
to use the holes to attach them to the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.920 
to use the holes to attach them to the
joins<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.580> they'll<00:02:45.090> start<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.569> erase

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
joins and they'll start to erase

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.160 
joins and they'll start to erase
vertically<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:48.390> triangles<00:02:48.930> join

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
vertically like that the triangles join

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.870 
vertically like that the triangles join
each<00:02:49.350> other<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.069> once<00:02:50.280> they're<00:02:50.519> all<00:02:50.550> together

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
each other and once they're all together

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.030 
each other and once they're all together
it's<00:02:51.690> really<00:02:51.810> beautiful<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.560> looks<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:52.890> little

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
it's really beautiful it looks a little

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.570 
it's really beautiful it looks a little
bit<00:02:53.250> like<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.459> crown<00:02:54.920> ironic<00:02:55.920> though<00:02:56.130> because

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
bit like a crown ironic though because

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.820 
bit like a crown ironic though because
this<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.120> base<00:02:57.300> currents<00:02:58.260> usually<00:02:58.590> go<00:02:58.739> on

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
this is the base currents usually go on

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.590 
this is the base currents usually go on
the<00:02:58.920> top<00:03:01.610> after<00:03:02.610> that's<00:03:02.760> joined<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
the top after that's joined the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.210 
the top after that's joined the
triangles<00:03:04.170> are<00:03:04.260> joined<00:03:04.470> once<00:03:04.709> again<00:03:04.829> with<00:03:05.190> a

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
triangles are joined once again with a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.729 
triangles are joined once again with a
lateral<00:03:05.489> piece<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.269> here<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.840> have<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.079> really

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
lateral piece and here you have a really

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.400 
lateral piece and here you have a really
nice<00:03:07.920> enclosure<00:03:08.549> and<00:03:09.150> this<00:03:09.570> structure<00:03:09.900> itself

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
nice enclosure and this structure itself

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.220 
nice enclosure and this structure itself
is<00:03:10.680> extremely<00:03:11.610> strong<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.510> can<00:03:12.540> fill<00:03:13.140> it

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
is extremely strong and you can fill it

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.890 
is extremely strong and you can fill it
up<00:03:13.320> with<00:03:13.860> plastic<00:03:14.190> or<00:03:14.670> cement<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.209> create<00:03:15.540> all

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
up with plastic or cement and create all

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.020 
up with plastic or cement and create all
kinds<00:03:15.959> of<00:03:16.470> things<00:03:16.709> like<00:03:16.769> swimming<00:03:17.340> pools<00:03:17.640> or

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
kinds of things like swimming pools or

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.690 
kinds of things like swimming pools or
water<00:03:18.269> catchment<00:03:18.870> areas<00:03:19.260> we're<00:03:20.220> building<00:03:20.610> a

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
water catchment areas we're building a

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.520 
water catchment areas we're building a
dome<00:03:20.970> though<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:21.510> what<00:03:21.600> we're<00:03:21.810> going<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:21.989> do<00:03:22.170> is

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
dome though so what we're going to do is

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.050 
dome though so what we're going to do is
we're<00:03:22.769> going<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.980> start<00:03:23.280> with<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.549> next<00:03:23.850> layer

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
we're going to start with the next layer

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.900 
we're going to start with the next layer
the<00:03:24.930> next<00:03:25.260> level<00:03:25.530> goes<00:03:25.709> up<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:26.100> here<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.730> have

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
the next level goes up and here you have

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.140 
the next level goes up and here you have
that<00:03:27.060> enclosure<00:03:27.420> with<00:03:28.049> a<00:03:28.079> crown<00:03:28.500> on<00:03:28.739> top

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
that enclosure with a crown on top

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.720 
that enclosure with a crown on top
notice<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.870> slight<00:03:31.410> Bend<00:03:31.769> towards<00:03:32.609> the

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
notice is a slight Bend towards the

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.979 
notice is a slight Bend towards the
center<00:03:34.040> those<00:03:35.040> are<00:03:35.250> then<00:03:35.370> joined<00:03:35.609> up<00:03:35.989> notice

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
center those are then joined up notice

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.770 
center those are then joined up notice
that<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.829> tops<00:03:38.100> are<00:03:38.640> not<00:03:39.090> exactly<00:03:39.540> parallel

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
that the tops are not exactly parallel

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.200 
that the tops are not exactly parallel
and<00:03:40.650> that's<00:03:40.799> what<00:03:40.950> makes<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.280> interest

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.300 

the<00:03:46.210> dome<00:03:46.390> itself<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:47.230> like<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.500> combination<00:03:47.890> of

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
the dome itself is like a combination of

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.990 
the dome itself is like a combination of
hexagons<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.210> pentagons<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:51.370> once<00:03:51.610> they<00:03:51.820> go

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
hexagons and pentagons and once they go

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.450 
hexagons and pentagons and once they go
up<00:03:52.150> look<00:03:52.600> at<00:03:52.690> that<00:03:52.810> that's<00:03:53.020> 3/4<00:03:53.680> finished<00:03:54.100> and

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
up look at that that's 3/4 finished and

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.730 
up look at that that's 3/4 finished and
really<00:03:55.240> strong<00:03:55.600> supporting<00:03:56.260> everybody's

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
really strong supporting everybody's

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.710 
really strong supporting everybody's
weight<00:03:56.950> they're<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:58.210> team<00:03:58.450> works

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
weight they're the team works

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.530 
weight they're the team works
beautifully<00:03:59.290> together<00:03:59.440> and<00:04:00.120> it's<00:04:01.120> not<00:04:01.270> long

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
beautifully together and it's not long

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.200 
beautifully together and it's not long
before<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.770> final<00:04:03.160> pieces<00:04:03.520> are<00:04:03.670> ready<00:04:03.850> to<00:04:04.090> be

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
before the final pieces are ready to be

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:11.070 
before the final pieces are ready to be
put<00:04:04.420> into<00:04:04.540> place<00:04:08.790> there<00:04:09.790> we<00:04:09.940> go<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:10.960> a

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
put into place there we go and this is a

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.530 
put into place there we go and this is a
dome<00:04:11.380> that<00:04:11.590> has<00:04:11.740> a<00:04:11.770> diameter<00:04:12.130> of<00:04:12.580> around<00:04:12.970> 6

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
dome that has a diameter of around 6

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.280 
dome that has a diameter of around 6
meters<00:04:16.680> last<00:04:17.680> phase<00:04:18.160> before<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.790> end<00:04:19.290> before

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
meters last phase before the end before

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.120 
meters last phase before the end before
you<00:04:20.500> know<00:04:20.709> it<00:04:21.720> it's<00:04:22.720> complete<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.920> then

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
you know it it's complete and then

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.420 
you know it it's complete and then
there's<00:04:24.370> just<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.700> gravity<00:04:25.270> test<00:04:25.510> we<00:04:25.780> turn

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
there's just the gravity test we turn

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.190 
there's just the gravity test we turn
look<00:04:27.430> at<00:04:27.610> all<00:04:27.730> those<00:04:28.000> bodies<00:04:28.570> happily

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
look at all those bodies happily

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.960 
look at all those bodies happily
climbing<00:04:29.620> all<00:04:29.740> over<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.130> structure<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:33.430> there

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
climbing all over the structure so there

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.550 
climbing all over the structure so there
we<00:04:34.150> go<00:04:34.230> short<00:04:35.230> stages<00:04:35.560> 1<00:04:36.190> 2<00:04:36.400> 3<00:04:36.640> 4<00:04:36.970> 5<00:04:37.270> up<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:38.290> goes

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
we go short stages 1 2 3 4 5 up and goes

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.600
