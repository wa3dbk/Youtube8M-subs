00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.100
 look at the sole this beauty does not 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.600
 is it true 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.500
 familiar picture the bottom of the tough 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.509
 rubber which should be worn for a long time already 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.919
 worn out and got to the soft part to 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:26.009
 the white part is a sneaker used 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:30.070
 for two months 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:32.040
 running along the asphalt path I want 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.739
 share with you a secret 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.430
 protect against wear shoe soles in 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.650
 while running on asphalt all that for 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.590
 protection needed 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:49.110
 This flexible tape is called so you and. 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.070
 Well, sneakers for 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:57.740
 apply adhesive tape usually our two 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.140
 Three layers in place most 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.309
 susceptible of 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.399
 with this way that way 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.399
 way 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.440
 these two three layers will let you run 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.170
 all sorts of problems about ten twenty 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.000
 kilometers and it still depends on 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.189
 how thick is the molding 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 it will be the thickness of the tape will be 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.469
 if the tape is thicker then it is more accurate 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.399
 thinner than tape, respectively, less after 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:35.350
 you take the scissors here 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.350
 so that way and cut all 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.860
 all it takes 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.240
 preparation takes everything usually am 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.500
 movie 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.420
 not more than two or three minutes 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.159
 and as I said 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.880
 tape 1 2 3 layers of tape 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.929
 usually enough for 10 20 kilometers here I am 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.390
 I want to show you a sneaker which 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.079
 I already ran over 20 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.379
 kilometers 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:09.679
 It is seen that already bared sole layer but 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:12.170
 wear more sole something 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.700
 this is the moment when you can or 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.209
 apply additional layers 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.400
 or or just tearing off these my own 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.400
 other best regards
