00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:06.690
 angry you are still in Paris in the 19th arrondissement of 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.799
 paris even if it's drunk we do not see at first glance we could 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:10.610
 believe we are in 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.780
 in the countryside on this big stage little belt or are we 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.879
 now exactly 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.439
 at the entrance to the park of Buttes-Chaumont we are there we are at the entrance of the bridge 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:19.730
 and the lumberjack here 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.550
 for an individual especially for the construction of the city 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.000
 he turned from hill and there we went back to the time in the years 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.599
 from the center 100 points passing underground there are two successive kines that make 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:30.409
 mine of the om 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.899
 he denies everyone there is to run away and nostalgic me I know the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.490
 menilmontant law 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.820
 the station of maurice modern knight but amounts is where you die 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.850
 we go there after 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.300
 absolutely here it's in a straight line 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.750
 safe mutual one is in stream during the summer after his rebound he 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.470
 gives access to the staging the golden door possible them 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.940
 calls to the famed afp as it's called to the party the term hacker 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.970
 and the cost of the debt right now but that is still during this time 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.400
 the railway in these lands that voice is always in a hurry 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.610
 just the time of a night of water that is to say the French have him 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.989
 harvested 50 years walks his anger after messing up everything 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.820
 no no the green flow is estimated for the moment 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.040
 so it's still thinking about railways always 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.570
 regrets however the foot on the site of paris 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.830
 we do not have my ears at all in three versions of cpe sang not let 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.280
 sing destroy media library 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.550
 but there is still the railroad in case hello actually this 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.280
 that we have French presents a couple to 11 6% where begins the one 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.700
 great then percent 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.620
 this passage of six to five sleepers anyway 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.910
 the whole arrondissement of the 19th arrondissement for that done now 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.760
 almost a century that it does not serve much to risk these risks the guys 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.860
 it's up to him to see if he manages to recover the car had a dream 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.190
 How's it going 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.190
 among them also wanted the belt knew its success 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.510
 with many travelers the end of the 2nd century but in 1900 you must know that 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.260
 the subway appeared in paris 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.070
 and it was starting to be long 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.790
 and at the end of the service people here why because it was easier 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.090
 to go live through for example by the other than go around 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.340
 and these countries closed in 1934 essien is a young person she was replaced 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.240
 overnight because we know right now 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.150
 that is to say the buses the bus pc small belt with now the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.019
 tramway in the south of paris 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.969
 then actually there were only a few circulations afterwards been 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.640
 spoiled with one of the currency trains here until recent years the 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.119
 freight trains 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:27.719
 from one station to another even a passenger train on where we are 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.479
 and a train coming from calais but up to rome passing 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:35.639
 here mende car who came to the north station and who was taking this route 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.699
 taking care of the odd term for the contract for the street parties 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.999
 when we have the two different cases that we can not do 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:45.309
 Paris business ceded up to when that rehash company company talent there 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.749
 is about fifteen years but against him there is 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.759
 - a decade ago the mali was completely abandoned 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:55.289
 this one because there was more free trade he had only a few 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:03:00.139
 circulations I'll go a super amateur starter and hitters that allowed 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.059
 to the curists well appreciated Paris from another angle and you make yourself 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.899
 part I was told of those who read 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:09.769
 the opportunity to organize trips to the étra to Tahiti but I am present 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.379
 here of a secession of this trend the first receding 0 94% 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.639
 specificities 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.069
 every time the four great dead characters wore around the 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.279
 capital to celebrate the comment after the turn of paris passing 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:21.480
 even by transfers 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.169
 the turn the whole thing could not be 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.829
 totally complete of this mandate for maurice vincent 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.229
 by the way they only have one part to hold 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:32.039
 towards the door of auteuil the little blue belt no longer continues to 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.769
 flying 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.769
 Thursday that continue towards the deck of the daybreak 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:40.349
 not by a specific enough work this fall on two viaducts which was at 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.079
 above the boulevard and that was destroyed in the 1960s when 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.639
 even before finishing 6 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.429
 6 today ap if it belongs that are multiple then the facilities 

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:51.389
 rail 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.849
 lloris 6 been relegated to league 2 percent in september that can bring 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.019
 indeed this rail network of France who owns all 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.289
 1997 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:01.939
 the entire railway infrastructure in France is set at 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.789
 sncf or surprisingly slow it's a totally hippie 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:07.189
 in the freeville dispute of industrial public establishment and 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.819
 commercial in his hands percent of his deputies whose sequels are 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.309
 deployed in France and we the socialists we are that exploiting 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.180
 so what did you hear about projects and ideas this 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.870
 that one day we will destroy without flashing tennis what we are going 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.500
 give a hoarse voice separate we think of the conveyors then I come back 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.759
 always think that we can say a lot of projects 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.869
 commenting on the first role-playing set that can be drawn from this 

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:30.809
 episode 

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:35.099
 eurocopter of using points with the tram mans that would allow with 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.749
 a means of transport that is ecological in France communicating 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:38.870
 he is very proud 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.120
 we can, for example, serve 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.770
 but also at the level of freight with a branch outgoing his words that 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.020
 would avoid the trucks 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.740
 so from where exactly are you talking about avoiding trucks 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.090
 so the pollution 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.540
 but at the time we built this little belt the first train that 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.639
 passed it was steam trains of traffic that was not dense and 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.340
 black fumes but absolutely terrible in the city 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.810
 yes but hey we are defender began to appear in 10 127 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.530
 this first comedy yet 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.050
 it was really the first source of power that we had 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.660
 create an energy but not to mention the fear of water actually hot fire and 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.139
 blacksmiths are asking to be scared and all that century ago and who have 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.460
 until Thursday 10 of his sector taking when he eclipses 1900 between council in 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.150
 town hall also in paris i will not say here not their ipad and had already 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.150
 his contribution is still in 939 940 areas through hunger made of 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.260
 exploitation here 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.730
 perilous but it's true that steam locomotive woerth on i-tell 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.860
 but good at the time it was because they do not know where and when 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.690
 can now it's difficult because the images are close by but 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.449
 we would stop silent business 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.360
 just a little bit difficult philippe thank you very much for being with us 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.090
 but with a great program of redo just now for another 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.230
 aspect of advance
