00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello to all guys and well found a 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.879
 this new top of the week installment 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.710
 we are in the beautiful 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.540
 half of the holidays then itunes connect 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.849
 it is closed and there are no new ones 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.349
 applications however since we have arrived 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.700
 at the end of the year 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.980
 I thought of creating an episode 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.650
 special of this heading to go to 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.410
 see the best applications of 2014 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.090
 even with the help of the category made 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.800
 from apple that has collected short 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.539
 best applications released in 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.160
 this year we will also go to see the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.510
 applications that have won ours 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.759
 upstate what was held 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.759
 this summer at riccione acquafan 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.150
 let's start from a game that the 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.380
 game that won our hub of the 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.290
 2014 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.210
 a riccione and it is 2048 or 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.520
 the application the game let's say more 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.800
 this year's famous that is a game that 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.290
 focuses on the association of 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.930
 numbers we should go to move i 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.050
 numbers two and multiples of two on 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.150
 screen until you reach the box 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.040
 2048 always adding the various pieces to the 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.040
 game is very complicated however it is 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.570
 really addictive and never done 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.410
 tiring always makes us want to 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.149
 play again 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.070
 this game therefore had also won the 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.500
 our p's the year is definitely one 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.119
 of the best of this year we pass 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.910
 another application one of the best 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.460
 applications of 2014 we talk about news 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.770
 ment this application allows us to 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.009
 indicate an area to search for events 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.280
 and all the activities that can be done 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.030
 in a certain range of days it is in 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.950
 that area 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.180
 so for example we write roma e 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.490
 let's see what all the attractions are 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.340
 things you can do for example 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.200
 in a given week the next 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.350
 application is the application that has 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.660
 won our 2014 apse then ai 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.270
 student pro is an application that much 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.300
 useful for all students all 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.950
 those who are attending school 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.929
 so what does this application do 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.020
 lets first add 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.759
 easily a timetable to remind us of the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.920
 subjects that there are certain days 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.110
 still makes us create averages 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.270
 automatic just enter the votes of 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.890
 every subject makes us add gods 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.360
 short reminder for homework makes us 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.200
 best manage all aspects 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.200
 related to study planning 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.989
 and to the management of all tasks e 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.530
 then the questions 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.120
 etc 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.739
 the next application the application 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.290
 the famous treccani official 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.290
 encyclopedia bar dictionary in short a 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.180
 compendium very useful to be able to go 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.099
 right away on our device to have 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.380
 always available all 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.030
 information necessary for a search 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.470
 for example we could write a word 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.540
 and look for the definition of the 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.159
 explanations, in short, everything he can 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.090
 be useful directly inside 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.700
 application 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.950
 obviously with the quality of treccani 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.319
 so we're not going to search the web for 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.019
 first site that will happen to us but we would have 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.129
 however a certainty of quality on the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.709
 research we do 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.689
 then there is still ai for instagram aaps 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.150
 very interesting application for 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.610
 create stabilized day time laps a 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.200
 professional level is very simple 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.769
 to customize at speed level 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.049
 it is of repeating the scenes then 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.569
 much more customizable as 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.549
 interface with respect to time laps 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.900
 classic integrated in ios 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.599
 then there is the replay which is an application 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.760
 very nice video that will allow us 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.379
 to first choose and reorder 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.420
 all the contents to be included in the 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.069
 gallery then photos and videos and then of 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.980
 be able to also customize all the 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.349
 effects and types of vg presets 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.189
 etc. to create videos precisely 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.790
 very interesting even if short for 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.620
 remind us of certain occasions 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.390
 finished very useful events also in 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.579
 this holiday season to immortalize 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.890
 always remember the next one 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.420
 application is an application intended 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.680
 to design lovers and those who 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.840
 they want to try to buy 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.090
 certain things however still see 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.069
 maybe how they are in the decor of 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.719
 home this application we can go 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.999
 precisely to buy various objects 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.620
 design but also to take one 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.749
 photograph of an environment of ours 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.150
 home and try to enter that 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:15.549
 that object in the home environment for 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.160
 see how he behaves and how 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.170
 we could say stay inside the 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.300
 our training we say already composed 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.130
 well guys good or bad these were the 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.380
 best applications however it is there 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.060
 there have been so many just to see someone 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.920
 of the previous installments of top app of 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.210
 the week to see already what they were 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.190
 the best applications let's say more 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.360
 recent is however there really are 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.580
 so much we have focused 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.560
 the right attention to the most visible 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.090
 on the app store so both on those that 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.620
 chose apple on both those 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.710
 we chose the best they have 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.790
 chosen our users by voting 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.650
 of 2014 obviously on the app store for 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.000
 the moment there will be no applications 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.860
 new, however, next week 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.080
 let's return with all the applications 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.340
 however new you can go to 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.560
 look for the best apps 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.630
 category by category that came out 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.330
 so this year let's say this video 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.560
 special ends here I don't put one 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.670
 of the must-have applications that I have 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.590
 you advised though not there 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.660
 worry because I've always taken note 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.640
 of all the applications you have me 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.470
 recommended if you want you can continue 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.240
 to comment on the video advising me 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.920
 other applications to be reviewed in short 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.180
 that is the must have for those who are just 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.010
 entered the iphone world 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.750
 now with Christmas there have been 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.880
 many users who have had an iphone 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.710
 new so we will have lots of new ones 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.200
 users who want to learn how to choose 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.700
 the best applications to use 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.450
 well guys i wish you still good 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.070
