00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.589
 no matter for which 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.169
 Father Michael Ballack has his athletes 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.699
 Now I have to go over to the bar and now it's water for the colonel 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.869
 Moon Kohler pickling for her or so if she wanted the Vasterling King

 Bernschneider Kulow as only to bring us that well 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.460
 Michael Ballack also visit us in England at Chelsea 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.460
 that is something they would have liked to have done abroad 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.169
 yes place critical with security like to try around 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.260
 Enter interruption 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.290
 but nothing concrete is round and that's it 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.010
 one-sixth next to the civil lawsuits 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.110
 around at the table 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.150
 Ghanem would have changed my career in order to put her racing cars 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.300
 Priest Michael 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.170
 even at Shell she certainly has not proved that 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.070
 Fenster incorporates the mentality in the country of Daimler from the country 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.450
 contradicted and there then a purchase vote 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.730
 then to enforce in the other country 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.600
 ex-trainer Rudi Völler 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.070
 said human Eon so a football career is like in the cinema 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.620
 Hermanis in the imagination that is synonymous with all the trimmings but at some point 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.670
 SEL the show over and then the real life begins that has 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 now also a lot of nice pages, how are things going on with them? 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.010
 One with itself has announced as proper patterns that I stop 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.120
 I then withdrew for the first time 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.370
 in the times of my hometown drove to Jena for friends visited around 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.390
 The family visited then took time taken for each other 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.270
 Bonn 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.500
 Motto show by the way with the football games in Leipzig where Leverkusen 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.810
 where I also found Scheer over 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.500
 as I will certainly stay there as the game gives football heroes 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.470
 what function Danner after that Hoffmann just see 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.590
 So we say thank you again the wizard on the square Bernschneider

 Carlos Christian Alber but courage now but little applause big 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.999
 Studios and super slosh I hope we have a little something 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.639
 a bit poor 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:39.169
 but let's have the winner because they come from Lost are German 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.579

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.619
 enjoyed the World Cup is not so good mood or 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:46.569
 just not like that 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.339
 at the main thing by reporting Soester 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:50.909
 I am so happy 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.769
 Germany must have North America 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.159
 Peru is in the group at the moment so it gets a bit tight with the group 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.900
 World Cup they play in the attacking midfield at PSV Lippstadt 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.240

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.059

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.619

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.319
 Roshi with the support of the studio here on special a game for her 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.719
 Bernschneider

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.129
 of course, here on his lawn support from the studio 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.180
 The hit 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.270
 For the first time I believe in the Tauber Moers in a power question 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.099
 unequal hits 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.050
 because already slightly shortened so further support from the studio 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.050
 please Bernd Schneiders comes years 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.499
 but a hit ever and now the challenger with the sounding name 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.909
 they found him a gym 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.439
 one did not work out 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.750
 At that time Homburg crushed 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.260
 At that time it is every time the backroom birthday is exactly the same 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.550
 Michael Ballack had already indicated himself as the first challenger 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.509
 your support 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.699
 on the 12 because the woman is 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.729
 this is experience 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.259
 Bayern Munich 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.089
 maybe off 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:08.509
 your own system gradually bit 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.659
 after all, it weighs a bit like John McEnroe at the serve to Super place 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.919
 because he last so he stands parallel to demanding 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.079
 just support continues to spill over that is good so thank you from the studio 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.050
 so everything in it 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.639
 Bernschneider on top left a hit he already has 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:33.589
 because not to let up 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.740
 none of the foremen after all 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.460
 the second hit 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.539
 Anyway, Glaser always puts himself in such a position when he is not alone 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.539
 but only in the net fishes 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.210
 Friedrich's contract 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.210
 if they had come more often when she meets you the first of the six times 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.629
 three hits here Premiere 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.629
 is now supposed to be John McEnroe Ajax 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.860
 Gallois Christiane Alvarado Montmartre 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.449
 two chances also the equalizer is still turning 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:17.969
 comes a goiter 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:20.969
 he has already met so once 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.749
 Gallois 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:25.199
 concentration 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.419
 but that hits 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.339
 So who scored five goals? 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:29.759
 Great 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.939
 so now again congratulations more applause outsiders I hope so much 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:35.289
 that the applause also comes right years 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.479
 Bernschneider I think it was a nice day or so good 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.050
 they are very beautiful and rather have 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.710
 including that also pleased so if then at least 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.630
 at the end of a really great gig here with us in the gym
