00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.310 
break them up in a different little
series<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.939> kind<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.210> went<00:00:27.359> over<00:00:27.689> how<00:00:28.260> to

series so we kind of went over how to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.910 
series so we kind of went over how to
measure<00:00:29.269> draught<00:00:30.289> to<00:00:31.289> do<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.679> actual

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
measure draught to do the actual

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.709 
measure draught to do the actual
combustion<00:00:32.489> analysis<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:34.110> did<00:00:34.260> air<00:00:34.469> flow

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
combustion analysis we did air flow

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.970 
combustion analysis we did air flow
we've<00:00:36.719> met<00:00:36.899> your<00:00:37.050> temperature<00:00:37.530> difference

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
we've met your temperature difference

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.650 
we've met your temperature difference
and<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.969> said<00:00:39.059> I'm<00:00:39.180> gonna<00:00:39.360> kind<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.540> break

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
and like I said I'm gonna kind of break

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.850 
and like I said I'm gonna kind of break
it<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.290> four<00:00:40.500> or<00:00:40.559> five<00:00:40.590> different

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
it on up in four or five different

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.119 
it on up in four or five different
segments<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:42.870> watch<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.920> long

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
segments and if you one watch one long

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.190 
segments and if you one watch one long
video<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.489> think<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:44.850> 45<00:00:45.120> minutes<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.110> if

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
video I think it's like 45 minutes so if

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.020 
video I think it's like 45 minutes so if
you<00:00:46.289> want<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.530> watch<00:00:46.620> one<00:00:46.860> long<00:00:47.190> video<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.910> can

through<00:01:13.430> what<00:01:14.430> both<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> them<00:01:15.000> are<00:01:15.060> capable<00:01:15.210> of

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
through what both of them are capable of

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.859 
through what both of them are capable of
doing<00:01:15.750> kind<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.290> show<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> menus<00:01:17.869> my

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
doing kind of show you the menus my

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.240 
doing kind of show you the menus my
personal<00:01:19.290> opinion<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.710> think<00:01:19.770> they're<00:01:20.070> both

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
personal opinion I think they're both

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.810 
personal opinion I think they're both
pretty<00:01:20.670> close<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.119> being<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> same<00:01:22.640> meter<00:01:23.640> as

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
pretty close to being the same meter as

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.719 
pretty close to being the same meter as
far<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.210> taking<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> test<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.590> take<00:01:25.830> now

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
far as taking the test that we take now

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.569 
far as taking the test that we take now
the<00:01:26.820> 330<00:01:27.330> has<00:01:27.659> some<00:01:27.990> advantages<00:01:28.560> over<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.920> 320

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the 330 has some advantages over the 320

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.870 
the 330 has some advantages over the 320
but<00:01:30.540> for<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.049> average<00:01:31.170> HVAC<00:01:31.890> tectus<00:01:32.340> just

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
but for the average HVAC tectus just

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.740 
but for the average HVAC tectus just
doing<00:01:33.180> residential<00:01:34.430> HVAC<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:36.030> 320<00:01:36.689> is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
doing residential HVAC I think 320 is

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.480 
doing residential HVAC I think 320 is
going<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.200> fine<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.250> we're<00:01:38.400> gonna

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
going to be just fine so we're gonna

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.160 
going to be just fine so we're gonna
kind<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.729> go<00:01:38.850> through<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> menus<00:01:39.450> real<00:01:39.630> quick

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
kind of go through the menus real quick

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.730 
kind of go through the menus real quick
I<00:01:40.200> get<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.829> tuned<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.369> where<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:42.740> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
I get it tuned in here where we can you

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
burner control pipe test and what you

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.420 
burner control pipe test and what you
got<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.900> gas<00:02:23.800> leak<00:02:24.070> detection<00:02:26.160> then<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.280> goes<00:02:27.400> to

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
got a gas leak detection then it goes to

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.180 
got a gas leak detection then it goes to
flue<00:02:27.730> gas<00:02:27.940> analysis<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:29.320> for<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.650> most<00:02:29.830> part

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
flue gas analysis so for the most part

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.590 
flue gas analysis so for the most part
they're<00:02:30.460> all<00:02:30.490> they're<00:02:30.940> both<00:02:31.090> going<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.330> do<00:02:31.480> the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
they're all they're both going to do the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.340 
they're all they're both going to do the
same<00:02:31.780> test

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
same test

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.700 
same test
now<00:02:32.830> on<00:02:33.130> this<00:02:33.310> 320<00:02:33.940> here<00:02:34.210> I<00:02:35.140> think<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:35.620> a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
now on this 320 here I think it's a

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.580 
now on this 320 here I think it's a
fantastic<00:02:35.890> instrument<00:02:36.640> everything<00:02:37.240> but<00:02:37.590> what

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
fantastic instrument everything but what

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.710 
fantastic instrument everything but what
we<00:02:39.160> me<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:39.580> Eddie<00:02:39.790> actually<00:02:40.210> did<00:02:40.420> some

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
we me and Eddie actually did some

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.380 
we me and Eddie actually did some
testing<00:02:41.170> with<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:43.060> don't<00:02:43.210> actually

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
testing with it and we don't actually

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.920 
testing with it and we don't actually
have<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.890> differential<00:02:44.890> pressure<00:02:45.780> with<00:02:46.780> this

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
have a differential pressure with this

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.300 
have a differential pressure with this
do<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:47.230> know<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:50.230> was<00:02:50.350> an<00:02:50.470> oversight<00:02:50.770> by<00:02:51.280> a

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
do we know this it was an oversight by a

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.980 
do we know this it was an oversight by a
test<00:02:51.730> oh<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:51.940> think<00:02:52.270> we're<00:02:52.540> still<00:02:52.720> trying<00:02:52.959> to

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
test oh I think we're still trying to

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.880 
test oh I think we're still trying to
get<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.260> information<00:02:53.740> on<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.730> do

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
get the information on it to do

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.070 
get the information on it to do
differential<00:02:56.890> pressures<00:02:57.490> we<00:02:58.330> need<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.720> port

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
differential pressures we need this port

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.880 
differential pressures we need this port
here<00:03:00.720> that's<00:03:01.720> where<00:03:01.900> we<00:03:01.990> plug<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.440> one<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.740> our

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
here that's where we plug in one of our

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.360 
here that's where we plug in one of our
hoses<00:03:03.040> for<00:03:03.459> our<00:03:03.610> aesthetic<00:03:04.030> pressure<00:03:04.270> clip

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
hoses for our aesthetic pressure clip

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.500 
hoses for our aesthetic pressure clip
then<00:03:06.370> we<00:03:06.490> have<00:03:06.670> another<00:03:06.760> adapter<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.450> plugs

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
then we have another adapter that plugs

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.860 
then we have another adapter that plugs
into<00:03:07.930> here<00:03:08.400> on<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.700> 320<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:11.200> current<00:03:11.650> version

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
into here on the 320 the current version

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.600 
into here on the 320 the current version
that<00:03:13.870> little<00:03:14.110> ports<00:03:14.380> not<00:03:14.560> here<00:03:14.830> yeah<00:03:15.459> we

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
that little ports not here yeah we

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.949 
that little ports not here yeah we
thought<00:03:15.820> that<00:03:16.060> that's<00:03:16.180> what<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.600> was<00:03:16.780> an

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
thought that that's what that was an

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.750 
thought that that's what that was an
attack<00:03:17.230> right<00:03:17.680> here<00:03:17.890> it's<00:03:18.010> actually<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.400> vent

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
attack right here it's actually a vent

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.390 
attack right here it's actually a vent
yes<00:03:19.209> but<00:03:19.660> we<00:03:20.140> did<00:03:20.290> talk<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.560> test<00:03:20.920> oh<00:03:21.070> we've

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
yes but we did talk to test oh we've

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.729 
yes but we did talk to test oh we've
talked<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.700> Jim<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.420> they're<00:03:23.260> gonna<00:03:23.380> you

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
talked to Jim and and they're gonna you

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:24.840 
talked to Jim and and they're gonna you
know<00:03:23.769> it's<00:03:23.980> like<00:03:24.250> he<00:03:24.340> said<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:24.640> just<00:03:24.670> an

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
know it's like he said it's just an

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.490 
know it's like he said it's just an
oversight<00:03:25.239> but<00:03:25.450> we're<00:03:25.600> just<00:03:25.630> waiting<00:03:26.110> waiting

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
oversight but we're just waiting waiting

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.900 
oversight but we're just waiting waiting
on<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:26.950> test<00:03:27.820> over<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.090> get<00:03:28.180> back<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.510> us<00:03:28.660> so

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
on a test over to get back to us so

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.210 
on a test over to get back to us so
that's<00:03:30.910> not<00:03:31.239> enough<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.320> reason<00:03:32.350> not<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.980> go

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
that's not enough of a reason not to go

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.759 
that's not enough of a reason not to go
ahead<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.459> purchase<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.940> meter<00:03:34.650> hope<00:03:35.650> I

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
ahead and purchase the meter hope I

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.650 
ahead and purchase the meter hope I
think<00:03:35.800> they've<00:03:36.130> got<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.459> fixed<00:03:36.880> now<00:03:37.090> we<00:03:37.540> just

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
think they've got that fixed now we just

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.759 
think they've got that fixed now we just
have<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.840> see<00:03:38.019> what<00:03:38.200> they're<00:03:38.350> going<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.590> do<00:03:38.680> it

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
have to see what they're going to do it

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.610 
have to see what they're going to do it
the<00:03:38.860> current<00:03:39.130> ones<00:03:39.400> right<00:03:40.230> but<00:03:41.230> like<00:03:41.350> I<00:03:41.380> said

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
the current ones right but like I said

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.160 
the current ones right but like I said
both<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.130> meters<00:03:42.570> are<00:03:43.570> going<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.019> do

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
both of the meters are going to do

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.710 
both of the meters are going to do
basically<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.100> same<00:03:45.670> test<00:03:47.340> this<00:03:48.340> one<00:03:48.730> will

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
basically the same test this one will

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.280 
basically the same test this one will
hold<00:03:49.930> more<00:03:51.239> customers<00:03:52.239> than<00:03:52.480> this<00:03:52.720> one

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
hold more customers than this one

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.800 
hold more customers than this one
yeah<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:53.739> think<00:03:53.980> mine<00:03:54.250> holds<00:03:54.670> 500<00:03:55.330> years<00:03:55.600> also

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
yeah I think mine holds 500 years also

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.479 
yeah I think mine holds 500 years also
at<00:03:56.019> like<00:03:56.170> five<00:03:56.380> thousand<00:03:56.890> yeah<00:03:57.130> something

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
at like five thousand yeah something

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:58.970 
at like five thousand yeah something
like<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:57.850> really<00:03:58.030> don't<00:03:58.330> remember<00:03:58.630> how<00:03:58.810> many

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
so let's go ahead and go through go

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.320 
so let's go ahead and go through go
ahead<00:04:02.769> and<00:04:02.860> hit<00:04:03.010> escape<00:04:05.580> so<00:04:06.580> I'm<00:04:06.940> in<00:04:07.090> just

about everything one here's the same you
got<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.180> measurement<00:04:10.630> options<00:04:11.910> folder<00:04:12.910> some

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
got a measurement options folder some

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.060 
got a measurement options folder some
locations<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.019> actually<00:04:14.470> Eddie<00:04:14.680> actually

when I leave leave a copy with them save

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.059 
when I leave leave a copy with them save
measurements<00:04:28.259> are<00:04:28.349> actually<00:04:28.620> able<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.860> save

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
measurements are actually able to save

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.610 
measurements are actually able to save
all<00:04:29.189> your<00:04:29.370> measurements<00:04:30.319> your<00:04:31.319> device

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
all your measurements your device

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.649 
all your measurements your device
settings<00:04:31.860> that's<00:04:32.189> where<00:04:32.340> anyone<00:04:32.729> in<00:04:32.909> and<00:04:33.120> took

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
settings that's where anyone in and took

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.809 
settings that's where anyone in and took
care<00:04:33.719> of<00:04:33.900> your<00:04:34.080> thing<00:04:34.229> forming<00:04:34.819> sensor

care of your thing forming sensor

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.249 
care of your thing forming sensor
settings<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.389> guess<00:04:36.569> it<00:04:36.719> lets<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.050> know<00:04:37.080> you

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
settings I guess it lets you know you

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.629 
settings I guess it lets you know you
can<00:04:37.590> actually<00:04:37.740> get<00:04:37.979> in<00:04:38.129> there<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.340> it'll<00:04:38.460> tell

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
can actually get in there and it'll tell

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.159 
can actually get in there and it'll tell
you<00:04:38.759> whether<00:04:38.879> or<00:04:38.969> not<00:04:39.060> your<00:04:39.270> sensors<00:04:39.629> bad

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
you whether or not your sensors bad

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.050 
you whether or not your sensors bad
right<00:04:40.680> mm-hmm

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
right mm-hmm

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.059 
right mm-hmm
fuel<00:04:42.629> test<00:04:42.900> options<00:04:43.379> of<00:04:43.530> course<00:04:43.710> that's<00:04:43.919> going

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
fuel test options of course that's going

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.779 
fuel test options of course that's going
to<00:04:44.159> be<00:04:44.280> like<00:04:44.990> natural<00:04:45.990> gas<00:04:46.020> propane<00:04:46.789> butane

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
to be like natural gas propane butane

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.459 
to be like natural gas propane butane
yada<00:04:48.330> yada<00:04:48.479> yada<00:04:50.090> so<00:04:51.090> let's<00:04:51.330> see<00:04:51.509> instrument

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
yada yada yada so let's see instrument

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.399 
yada yada yada so let's see instrument
diagnosis<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:53.669> this<00:04:53.849> thing<00:04:54.300> will<00:04:54.569> actually<00:04:54.719> I

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
diagnosis so this thing will actually I

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.730 
diagnosis so this thing will actually I
reckon<00:04:56.280> it'll<00:04:56.400> it<00:04:56.699> diagnosis<00:04:57.479> itself<00:04:57.900> took

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
reckon it'll it diagnosis itself took

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.300 
reckon it'll it diagnosis itself took
the<00:04:59.099> sensors<00:04:59.580> and<00:04:59.779> but<00:05:00.779> you<00:05:00.930> have<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.310> mind

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
the sensors and but you have a mind

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.769 
the sensors and but you have a mind
you'll<00:05:02.490> strike<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:02.819> instrument<00:05:03.210> diagnosis

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:03.779 
you'll strike the instrument diagnosis

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.600 
you'll strike the instrument diagnosis
it<00:05:03.930> looks<00:05:04.110> like<00:05:04.259> the<00:05:04.379> three<00:05:04.560> are<00:05:04.710> 30<00:05:05.009> has<00:05:05.189> what

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
it looks like the three are 30 has what

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.279 
it looks like the three are 30 has what
programs<00:05:06.060> on<00:05:06.270> it<00:05:06.389> and<00:05:06.569> you<00:05:06.659> know<00:05:06.810> what<00:05:07.080> that's

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
programs on it and you know what that's

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:07.959 
programs on it and you know what that's
for

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:07.969 
for

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:12.230 
for
quick<00:05:08.969> before<00:05:09.710> all<00:05:10.710> right<00:05:10.949> so<00:05:11.219> it's<00:05:12.060> got<00:05:12.180> that

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
quick before all right so it's got that

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.730 
quick before all right so it's got that
option<00:05:12.599> I<00:05:12.960> don't<00:05:13.169> know<00:05:13.229> what<00:05:13.349> it's<00:05:13.469> for<00:05:13.590> I've

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
option I don't know what it's for I've

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.399 
option I don't know what it's for I've
never<00:05:13.919> used<00:05:14.099> it<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:14.960> all<00:05:15.960> said<00:05:16.229> we're<00:05:16.349> not

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
never used it so all said we're not

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:17.869 
never used it so all said we're not
gonna<00:05:16.680> worry<00:05:17.039> about<00:05:17.099> that<00:05:17.279> one<00:05:17.580> because<00:05:17.669> I

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
gonna worry about that one because I

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.879 
gonna worry about that one because I
haven't<00:05:18.180> used<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.509> don't<00:05:19.110> need<00:05:19.259> it<00:05:19.319> I<00:05:19.439> guess

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
haven't used it don't need it I guess

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.369 
haven't used it don't need it I guess
okay<00:05:20.759> so<00:05:20.819> we've<00:05:21.090> got<00:05:21.120> instrument<00:05:21.810> diagnosis

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
okay so we've got instrument diagnosis

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.679 
okay so we've got instrument diagnosis
though<00:05:22.770> ever<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.939> whole<00:05:24.090> screen<00:05:24.360> looks<00:05:24.539> like

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:24.689 
though ever the whole screen looks like

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:27.679 
though ever the whole screen looks like
it's<00:05:24.960> basically<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.409> same<00:05:25.560> instrument<00:05:26.689> and

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:27.689 
it's basically the same instrument and

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.469 
it's basically the same instrument and
it<00:05:27.900> takes<00:05:28.080> us<00:05:28.229> back<00:05:28.409> to<00:05:28.440> fault<00:05:29.150> there's<00:05:30.150> no

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
it takes us back to fault there's no

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:31.939 
it takes us back to fault there's no
magic<00:05:30.779> mess<00:05:30.870> okay

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949 
magic mess okay

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.659 
magic mess okay
all<00:05:32.699> right<00:05:32.940> as<00:05:33.270> far<00:05:33.479> as<00:05:33.539> the<00:05:33.839> looks<00:05:34.110> go<00:05:34.409> I<00:05:34.770> don't

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
all right as far as the looks go I don't

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.230 
all right as far as the looks go I don't
know<00:05:35.909> which<00:05:36.060> one<00:05:36.270> I<00:05:36.300> like<00:05:36.569> better<00:05:37.639> I<00:05:38.639> don't

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
know which one I like better I don't

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.050 
know which one I like better I don't
have<00:05:39.389> my<00:05:39.509> trap<00:05:39.750> off<00:05:39.930> my<00:05:40.169> tripod<00:05:40.560> at<00:05:40.710> home<00:05:40.860> but

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.779 

now<00:05:45.060> I<00:05:45.089> think<00:05:45.210> I<00:05:45.539> like<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:47.669> fuel<00:05:49.339> the<00:05:50.339> problem

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
now I think I like the fuel the problem

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.879 
now I think I like the fuel the problem

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.170 
you and get a idea of what they're
capable<00:07:59.889> of<00:08:00.189> doing<00:08:00.280> like<00:08:00.849> I<00:08:00.879> said<00:08:01.060> I<00:08:01.120> think

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.180 
capable of doing like I said I think

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.219 
capable of doing like I said I think
they're<00:08:01.449> going<00:08:01.539> to<00:08:01.599> be<00:08:01.689> pretty<00:08:01.900> close<00:08:02.050> to

00:08:02.219 --> 00:08:02.229 
they're going to be pretty close to

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:03.959 
they're going to be pretty close to
being<00:08:02.259> the<00:08:02.469> same<00:08:02.650> thing<00:08:02.680> so<00:08:03.610> let's<00:08:03.789> get

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:03.969 
being the same thing so let's get

00:08:03.969 --> 00:08:06.149 
being the same thing so let's get
everything<00:08:04.240> hooked<00:08:04.479> up<00:08:04.750> and<00:08:04.960> we'll<00:08:05.650> be<00:08:05.830> right

00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:06.159 
everything hooked up and we'll be right

00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:08.699 
everything hooked up and we'll be right
back<00:08:06.400> to<00:08:06.669> you
