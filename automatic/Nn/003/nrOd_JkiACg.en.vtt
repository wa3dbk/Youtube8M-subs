on<00:00:15.990> verizon's<00:00:16.590> lineup<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.190> let's<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:17.850> run<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
on verizon's lineup and let's just run a

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.820 
on verizon's lineup and let's just run a
couple<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.480> different<00:00:18.810> benchmark<00:00:19.320> tests<00:00:19.680> and

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
couple of different benchmark tests and

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.830 
couple of different benchmark tests and
see<00:00:20.039> how<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.279> performs<00:00:20.730> but<00:00:21.330> overall<00:00:21.600> just

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
see how it performs but overall just

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
here pretty phenomenal on top of that

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.860 
here pretty phenomenal on top of that
you<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.590> all<00:00:31.740> these<00:00:31.920> glitzy<00:00:32.489> looking<00:00:32.880> visual

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
you have all these glitzy looking visual

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.870 
you have all these glitzy looking visual
effects<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.130> very<00:00:35.370> heavy<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.730> that

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
effects to it so it's very heavy in that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.790 
effects to it so it's very heavy in that
aspect<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.690> running<00:00:36.930> fairly<00:00:37.050> smoothly<00:00:37.530> so

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
aspect and so running fairly smoothly so

aspect and so running fairly smoothly so
far<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.489> we're<00:00:38.610> pretty<00:00:38.730> content<00:00:39.180> though<00:00:39.360> with

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
far so we're pretty content though with

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.630 
far so we're pretty content though with
what<00:00:39.660> we're<00:00:39.960> seeing<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.829> let's<00:00:41.280> quickly<00:00:41.370> run

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
what we're seeing so let's quickly run

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.000 
what we're seeing so let's quickly run
the<00:00:41.790> first<00:00:42.030> test<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:42.480> let's<00:00:42.660> go<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:43.350> quadrant

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the first test here let's go do quadrant

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.940 
the first test here let's go do quadrant
of<00:00:44.070> course<00:00:44.719> ready<00:00:45.719> downloaded<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.829> we're

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
of course ready downloaded here so we're

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.369 
of course ready downloaded here so we're
going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.160> run<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.510> see<00:00:48.780> what<00:00:49.050> kind<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
going to run this and see what kind of

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.750 
going to run this and see what kind of
figures<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> put<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.730> here

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.369 

now<00:00:56.329> seeing<00:00:56.629> that<00:00:56.690> has<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:56.929> dual<00:00:57.140> core

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
now seeing that has a dual core

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.439 
now seeing that has a dual core
processor<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:58.070> should<00:00:58.280> run<00:00:58.489> this<00:00:58.640> test<00:00:59.120> pretty

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
processor it should run this test pretty

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.630 
processor it should run this test pretty
fast<00:00:59.809> compared<00:01:00.589> some<00:01:00.800> other<00:01:00.949> devices<00:01:01.339> out

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
fast compared some other devices out

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.340 
fast compared some other devices out
there<00:01:01.670> kind<00:01:02.480> of<00:01:02.570> interested<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:02.960> see<00:01:03.079> what<00:01:03.260> it

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
there kind of interested to see what it

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.039 
there kind of interested to see what it
puts<00:01:03.530> up<00:01:03.890> as<00:01:04.580> we<00:01:04.729> know<00:01:04.879> their<00:01:05.149> self<00:01:05.540> we've<00:01:05.869> been

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
puts up as we know their self we've been

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.270 
puts up as we know their self we've been
doing<00:01:06.229> this<00:01:06.290> for<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.560> while<00:01:06.619> now<00:01:06.799> with

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
doing this for a while now with

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.249 
doing this for a while now with
different<00:01:07.580> devices<00:01:07.820> most<00:01:08.630> recently<00:01:08.990> saw<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
different devices most recently saw the

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.630 
different devices most recently saw the
the<00:01:10.240> t-mobile<00:01:11.240> mytouch<00:01:11.479> 4g<00:01:12.320> slide<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:13.159> that

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
the t-mobile mytouch 4g slide and that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.460 
the t-mobile mytouch 4g slide and that
achieve<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.240> score<00:01:14.659> quadrant<00:01:15.229> score<00:01:15.409> i

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
achieve the score quadrant score i

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.649 
achieve the score quadrant score i
believe<00:01:15.799> of<00:01:15.920> 2,000<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.090> let's<00:01:17.299> see<00:01:17.420> how<00:01:17.509> this

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
believe of 2,000 so let's see how this

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.109 
believe of 2,000 so let's see how this
one<00:01:17.869> goes<00:01:18.320> right<00:01:19.220> now<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.399> graphical<00:01:19.880> test

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
one goes right now the graphical test

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.730 
one goes right now the graphical test
here<00:01:20.330> running<00:01:20.690> in<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.810> smooth<00:01:21.049> 30<00:01:21.320> frames<00:01:21.590> per

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
here running in a smooth 30 frames per

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.820 
here running in a smooth 30 frames per
second<00:01:22.369> it<00:01:22.430> looks<00:01:22.580> very<00:01:22.670> nice<00:01:23.090> indeed<00:01:23.830> it's

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
second it looks very nice indeed it's

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.710 
second it looks very nice indeed it's
going<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.130> wait<00:01:25.280> for<00:01:25.310> this<00:01:25.610> here

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 

and<00:01:31.260> so<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> other<00:01:31.620> things<00:01:31.770> noteworthy<00:01:32.400> about

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
and so the other things noteworthy about

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.610 
and so the other things noteworthy about
is<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.390> brings<00:01:33.930> twenty-seven<00:01:34.530> percent

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
is that it brings twenty-seven percent

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.860 
is that it brings twenty-seven percent
faster<00:01:35.040> multitasking<00:01:35.490> performance<00:01:36.000> over<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
faster multitasking performance over the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.440 
faster multitasking performance over the
droid<00:01:37.230> 2<00:01:37.470> global<00:01:37.730> so<00:01:38.730> that's<00:01:38.910> pretty<00:01:39.180> pretty

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
droid 2 global so that's pretty pretty

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.230 
droid 2 global so that's pretty pretty
nice<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.190> concern<00:01:41.190> that<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> droid<00:01:41.850> 2

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
nice here concern that the droid 2

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.320 
nice here concern that the droid 2
global<00:01:42.410> pack<00:01:43.410> day<00:01:43.650> 1.2<00:01:44.220> its<00:01:44.700> processor<00:01:45.300> i

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
global pack day 1.2 its processor i

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.660 
global pack day 1.2 its processor i
believe<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.440> this<00:01:46.620> puts<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> little<00:01:47.580> bit

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
believe so this puts in a little bit

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.670 
believe so this puts in a little bit
