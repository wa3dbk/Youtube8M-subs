00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.330
 to look very chic then you have to 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.710
 know what to wear what color and to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.439

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.369
 Francisco Gavin of the Bachelor of Arts 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.369
 of beauty 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.510
 but apart because you have not asked 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.070
 I always see what comes as a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.489
 Trend or fashion I always ask myself 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.350
 who decides who says because the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.020
 last season there was a lot of red or blue 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.820
 or who decides what colors will be 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.500
 for 2015 but thank you very much that's 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.449
 the main thing not the most interesting 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.860
 we have to keep in mind that that is 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.809
 an organism called pantone color 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.120
 institute that works worldwide 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.920
 the headquarters is in new york 'and there is a 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.480
 is also more they decide for us and 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.980
 for the world to the world let's say it 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.359
 so they make a proposal with 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.070
 regarding the studies of which were 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.909
 the colors that developed how 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.039
 things were 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.619
 and they make a proposal this proposal 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.509
 has 10 colors in total for women 10 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.369
 colors in total for men and it 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.469
 they divide into 5 neutrals that they can use 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.289
 2 and 5 exclusive for men and 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.810
 woman is like the movie of the devil 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.179
 Wears Prada prada you do not get bored 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.590
 they get together starts if the case is going to be the 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:30.359
 new black not that already happened if they 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.219
 what they do mainly is to do the 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.899
 proposal the designers take these 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.209
 tools through the colors that 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.310
 they will use through textures and 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:40.709
 what is the concept let's say it so 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.599
 fashion through what is going to be 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:44.789
 let's say it like this the social environment 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.500
 later you will be able to tell us from 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.739
 now what are those colors going to be 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.719
 but mainly they are 10 of women who 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:56.569
 would be for example being the most 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.569
 significant is here marín is a 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.450
 I study quite a lot last year 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.450
 the emerald color is preserved 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.289
 it's quite nice there we can see in 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.459
 the images some trends that 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:18.680
 has an inspiration of the whole wave 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:21.140
 retro with a comes much exact clear 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.900
 if using the theme of going to these stores 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.819
 buy things vintage things used then 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.590
 Continued use is not as what 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.209
 it's more of a trend really what 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.120
 you are looking for this season more than anything 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.160
 is to seek the association with respect to 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.230
 nature to the main state the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.910
 concept that he proposes in this year is 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.560
 get away from social networks a bit 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.200
 have that fear of losing something 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.400
 important life is about everything 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.440
 it works in a blink of 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.030
 facebook let's say it like that when really 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.709
 we propose to be in 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.049
 contact with nature we begin to 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.580
 appreciate this concept to green I do not feel 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.880
 the colors then are aquamarine 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.400
 say aquamarine blue is Cuba's 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.290
 foam blue color let's say what it is like 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.230
 a deep blue is considered a lot like 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.730
 The blue of the sea is a pretty color 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.710
 cool with a strong momentum 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.090
 interesting is the custard color that 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.100
 cream color a little more intense than this 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.770
 the main color that is going to be stolen 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.650
 year is the maximum color of marcela 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.230
 this is a color let's say it so lands or 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.680
 natural is a color quite similar to 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.410
 exact vanilla color the color effect 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.800
 brick is of a fruit like pomegranate a 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.800
 Red wine 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.100
 I always say that maybe it 's very 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.720
 fashionable but your skin tone is not going 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.080
 very well there is also an organization 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.760
 what is the natural scenery of the landscape 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.680
 natural we derive it in four 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.300
 groups of people and depending on the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.130
 colors that we organize 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.650
 doing a study of natural color 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.710
 of the hair of the eyes and the skin 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.880
 this throws us a group of people and 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.430
 each of these groups that 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.140
 they are usually called spring summer 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.810
 autumn winter only as colors 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.640
 classificatory mainly helps us 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.320
 to know of all these colors which 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.700
 are the ones that you have left, let's say it 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.630
 well for putting an example of all the 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.520
 reds that exist 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.959
 there is a red that is the Italian red and 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.459
 there is another red that is scarlet red 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.350
 they are different reds 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.540
 and it will not stay the same red to a 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.590
 person that is very clear a person 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.940
 that is of quite dark skin usually 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.440
 complicated but it's pretty simple 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.030
 when the tool is handled is 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.950
 quite pretty simple there in 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.870
 internet something that is going to help you with that 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.850
 It is pantone color institute offers 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.890

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.740
 can slowly make them go to a 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.170
 Fabric store and put the fabric on top 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.340
