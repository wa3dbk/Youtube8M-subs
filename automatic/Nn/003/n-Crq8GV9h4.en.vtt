for<00:00:02.129> hundreds<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:02.700> years<00:00:03.020> we've<00:00:04.020> been

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
for hundreds of years we've been

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.810 
for hundreds of years we've been
building<00:00:05.089> developing<00:00:06.200> growing<00:00:07.490> more<00:00:08.490> and

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
building developing growing more and

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.320 
building developing growing more and
more<00:00:08.910> we<00:00:09.690> grow<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.769> more<00:00:10.950> we<00:00:10.980> grow<00:00:11.330> the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
more we grow and the more we grow the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.870 
more we grow and the more we grow the
more<00:00:12.480> we<00:00:12.599> consume<00:00:13.370> striving<00:00:14.370> endlessly

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
more we consume striving endlessly

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.609 
more we consume striving endlessly
towards<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.599> better<00:00:15.780> future<00:00:16.310> but<00:00:17.310> at<00:00:17.430> what<00:00:17.640> cost

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
towards a better future but at what cost

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.019 
towards a better future but at what cost
we<00:00:20.619> become<00:00:20.949> more<00:00:21.130> conscious<00:00:21.720> more<00:00:22.720> wear<00:00:23.019> and

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
we become more conscious more wear and

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.479 
we become more conscious more wear and
eventually<00:00:25.029> we<00:00:25.060> grow<00:00:25.329> so<00:00:25.660> much<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:27.099> we<00:00:27.250> learn

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
eventually we grow so much that we learn

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.529 
eventually we grow so much that we learn
how<00:00:27.789> to<00:00:27.849> consume<00:00:28.300> less<00:00:28.359> and<00:00:28.869> that<00:00:30.390> when<00:00:31.390> we

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
how to consume less and that when we
