00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.790 

in<00:00:15.610> this<00:00:15.790> final<00:00:16.180> video<00:00:16.270> of<00:00:16.570> the<00:00:16.690> four<00:00:16.960> I'll<00:00:17.620> be

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
in this final video of the four I'll be

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.890 
in this final video of the four I'll be
looking<00:00:18.010> at<00:00:18.130> the<00:00:18.280> multiplier<00:00:18.910> rail<00:00:19.180> which<00:00:19.780> you

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
looking at the multiplier rail which you

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.600 
looking at the multiplier rail which you
can<00:00:20.020> see<00:00:20.200> in<00:00:20.320> front<00:00:20.440> of<00:00:20.620> you<00:00:20.740> looking<00:00:21.310> at<00:00:21.460> its

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
can see in front of you looking at its

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:29.310 
can see in front of you looking at its
features<00:00:22.119> and<00:00:22.390> how<00:00:23.050> to<00:00:23.080> have<00:00:23.980> you<00:00:24.130> use<00:00:24.310> it<00:00:28.320> its

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
features and how to have you use it its

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.640 
features and how to have you use it its
final<00:00:29.500> rail<00:00:29.830> is<00:00:30.010> a<00:00:30.300> multiplier<00:00:31.650> it's

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
final rail is a multiplier it's

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.040 
final rail is a multiplier it's
essentially<00:00:33.100> used<00:00:33.370> for<00:00:33.730> sea<00:00:34.450> fishing<00:00:34.870> off

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
essentially used for sea fishing off

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.090 
essentially used for sea fishing off
slightly<00:00:35.650> fishing<00:00:36.070> for<00:00:36.250> very<00:00:36.430> very<00:00:36.490> big<00:00:36.850> fish

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
slightly fishing for very very big fish

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.680 
slightly fishing for very very big fish
unlike<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.310> other<00:00:39.970> reels<00:00:40.360> which<00:00:40.510> we've

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
unlike the other reels which we've

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.620 
unlike the other reels which we've
looked<00:00:40.900> at<00:00:41.079> this<00:00:41.470> fits<00:00:41.739> on<00:00:41.920> top<00:00:42.100> of<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.310> rod

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
looked at this fits on top of the rod

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.970 
looked at this fits on top of the rod
and<00:00:43.630> so<00:00:43.840> you<00:00:43.989> either<00:00:44.110> have<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.350> hold<00:00:44.649> the<00:00:44.800> rod

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
and so you either have to hold the rod

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.640 
and so you either have to hold the rod
whilst<00:00:45.760> you're<00:00:45.970> fishing<00:00:46.329> or<00:00:47.290> you<00:00:47.410> have<00:00:47.530> to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
whilst you're fishing or you have to

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.820 
whilst you're fishing or you have to
having<00:00:47.890> some<00:00:48.160> kind<00:00:48.400> of<00:00:48.490> clump<00:00:49.500> he<00:00:50.500> says<00:00:50.680> the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
having some kind of clump he says the

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.360 
having some kind of clump he says the
same<00:00:51.010> features<00:00:51.490> as<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:52.060> fixed<00:00:52.750> bull<00:00:53.020> reel

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
same features as the fixed bull reel

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.730 
same features as the fixed bull reel
with<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.400> bait<00:00:54.640> runner<00:00:55.290> which<00:00:56.290> we<00:00:56.410> talked<00:00:56.650> about

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
with a bait runner which we talked about

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.860 
with a bait runner which we talked about
a<00:00:57.100> moment<00:00:57.340> ago<00:00:59.400> this<00:01:00.400> is<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.850> clients<00:01:01.420> brother

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
a moment ago this is the clients brother

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.200 
a moment ago this is the clients brother
when<00:01:02.050> you<00:01:02.140> wind<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.470> handle<00:01:02.800> round<00:01:02.950> this<00:01:03.940> goes

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
when you wind the handle round this goes

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.060 
when you wind the handle round this goes
backwards<00:01:04.689> and<00:01:04.750> forwards<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:05.560> you<00:01:05.650> get<00:01:05.799> a<00:01:05.830> nice

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
backwards and forwards so you get a nice

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
backwards and forwards so you get a nice
even<00:01:06.340> distribution<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:07.270> line<00:01:07.540> on<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.110> spool

this<00:01:11.740> little<00:01:12.100> knob<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:14.490> bait<00:01:15.490> runner

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
this little knob is the bait runner

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.219 
this little knob is the bait runner

this one but very very expensive reels

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.620 
this one but very very expensive reels
of<00:01:23.050> course<00:01:23.320> have<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:24.120> system<00:01:25.120> of<00:01:25.240> magnets

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
of course have the system of magnets

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.130 
of course have the system of magnets
inside<00:01:26.020> here<00:01:26.790> which<00:01:27.790> makes<00:01:28.030> them<00:01:28.240> very<00:01:28.930> very

very very explosive indeed open 2,000
pounds<00:01:32.409> in<00:01:32.560> some<00:01:32.740> cases<00:01:36.330> on<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.420> other<00:01:37.540> side

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.250 

is<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.860> main<00:01:42.370> clutch<00:01:42.810> adjustment<00:01:43.810> since

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
is the main clutch adjustment since

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.850 
is the main clutch adjustment since
whilst<00:01:44.650> are<00:01:44.830> think<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:46.090> can<00:01:46.240> see<00:01:46.510> here<00:01:46.900> so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
whilst are think you can see here so

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.399 
whilst are think you can see here so
that<00:01:48.010> when<00:01:48.070> you're<00:01:48.250> playing<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.670> fish<00:01:49.260> you<00:01:50.260> can

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
that when you're playing a fish you can

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.110 
that when you're playing a fish you can
adjust<00:01:50.740> this<00:01:51.330> with<00:01:52.330> your<00:01:52.510> thumb<00:01:53.400> so<00:01:54.400> increase

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
adjust this with your thumb so increase

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:03.670 
adjust this with your thumb so increase
the<00:01:55.150> drug

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.950 

so<00:02:04.680> before<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.070> cast<00:02:05.340> out<00:02:05.550> with<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:06.530> you

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
so before you cast out with this you

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.680 
so before you cast out with this you
slacking<00:02:09.960> off<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.350> bake<00:02:10.830> run<00:02:11.070> a<00:02:11.100> clutch<00:02:11.690> so

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
slacking off the bake run a clutch so

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.780 
slacking off the bake run a clutch so
the<00:02:12.900> spool<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.560> very<00:02:13.950> free<00:02:14.520> running<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:20.670> would

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the spool is very free running you would

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
the spool is very free running you would
think<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:22.340> with<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.370> huge<00:02:24.090> sea<00:02:24.420> fishing

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
think that with a huge sea fishing

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.350 
think that with a huge sea fishing
weight<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.950> great<00:02:26.160> lump<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.490> bait<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.270> a

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
weight and a great lump of bait on and a

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.860 
weight and a great lump of bait on and a
stiff<00:02:27.950> shot<00:02:28.950> rod<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.640> could<00:02:29.790> fling<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.240> bait

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
stiff shot rod you could fling the bait

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.470 
stiff shot rod you could fling the bait
a<00:02:31.380> hundred<00:02:32.190> yards<00:02:32.490> or<00:02:32.580> more<00:02:32.880> which<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.450> course

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
a hundred yards or more which of course

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.320 
a hundred yards or more which of course
is<00:02:33.780> perfectly<00:02:34.200> true<00:02:34.550> but<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.640> big<00:02:35.790> problem<00:02:36.000> is

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
is perfectly true but the big problem is

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.750 
is perfectly true but the big problem is
as<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.959> bait<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.980> weight<00:02:38.990> slow<00:02:39.990> down

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
as the bait and the weight slow down

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.310 
as the bait and the weight slow down
towards<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.850> end<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.209> cast<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.750> almost

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
towards the end of the cast and almost

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.690 
towards the end of the cast and almost
come<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.650> stop<00:02:43.860> because<00:02:43.980> when<00:02:44.340> they<00:02:44.430> hit<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
come to a stop because when they hit the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.310 
come to a stop because when they hit the
water

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
water

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:53.300 
water
the<00:02:46.320> real<00:02:46.530> continues<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.760> run<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:53.010> get<00:02:53.160> an

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
the real continues to run and you get an

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.830 
the real continues to run and you get an
overrun<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.480> huge<00:02:54.840> bird's<00:02:55.320> nest<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:55.830> here

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
overrun and the huge bird's nest on here

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.660 
overrun and the huge bird's nest on here
so<00:02:57.980> as<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.250> bait<00:03:00.180> approaches<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.930> water<00:03:01.670> you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
so as the bait approaches the water you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.030 
so as the bait approaches the water you
have<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.970> slow<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.480> down<00:03:03.540> by<00:03:04.350> feathering<00:03:04.770> it

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
have to slow this down by feathering it

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.250 
have to slow this down by feathering it
with<00:03:05.160> your<00:03:05.310> thumb<00:03:08.330> as<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.780> whirring

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
around at the fair or lick then if you

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.979

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
get a friction burn on the end some

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.720 
get a friction burn on the end some
people<00:03:18.420> use<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:21.709> sort<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.739> rubber<00:03:22.980> finger<00:03:23.340> which

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
people use a sort of rubber finger which

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.910 
people use a sort of rubber finger which
they've<00:03:23.940> cut<00:03:24.150> off<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.330> pair<00:03:25.049> of<00:03:25.080> kitchen<00:03:25.680> gloves

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
and they put it on their thumb to

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.320 
and they put it on their thumb to
prevent<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.500> from<00:03:28.560> happening<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.280> when<00:03:30.239> you

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.590 
prevent that from happening so when you
finish<00:03:30.540> casting<00:03:31.820> you're<00:03:32.820> pushing<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.330> little
