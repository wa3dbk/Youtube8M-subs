the<00:00:05.310> screws<00:00:05.730> they<00:00:06.629> fall<00:00:06.899> into<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.379> holes<00:00:07.620> and

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
the screws they fall into the holes and

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.589 
the screws they fall into the holes and
pretty<00:00:08.340> much<00:00:08.370> align<00:00:08.790> themselves<00:00:08.970> so<00:00:09.330> that's<00:00:09.510> a

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
pretty much align themselves so that's a

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.620 
pretty much align themselves so that's a
very<00:00:09.630> easy<00:00:09.990> part<00:00:10.969> now<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.059> thing<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.570> you

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
very easy part now the thing that you

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.169 
very easy part now the thing that you
want<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.840> do<00:00:12.990> with<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.380> rig<00:00:13.620> scalped<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.309> if<00:00:15.030> it

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
want to do with the rig scalped is if it

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.760 
want to do with the rig scalped is if it
doesn't<00:00:15.420> stay<00:00:15.599> on<00:00:15.630> by<00:00:15.870> itself<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.470> most<00:00:16.619> of

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
doesn't stay on by itself and most of

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.500 
doesn't stay on by itself and most of
them<00:00:16.920> don't<00:00:17.340> stand<00:00:17.670> by<00:00:17.880> themselves<00:00:18.060> once

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
them don't stand by themselves once

them don't stand by themselves once
you've<00:00:18.630> taken<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.960> mouth<00:00:19.109> they'll<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:19.890> as

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
you've taken the mouth they'll just as

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.029 
you've taken the mouth they'll just as

likely to fall off is anything else i
use<00:00:23.039> Elmer's<00:00:23.340> glue-all<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.180> water<00:00:24.390> based

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
use Elmer's glue-all it's a water based

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.230 
use Elmer's glue-all it's a water based
glue<00:00:25.019> basically<00:00:25.740> scruple<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.910> United

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
glue basically scruple in the United

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.839 
glue basically scruple in the United
States<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.859> I'd<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.920> little<00:00:29.429> bit<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.640> glue

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
States and I'd a little bit of glue

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.709 
States and I'd a little bit of glue
around<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.420> flange<00:00:30.720> right<00:00:30.990> here<00:00:35.270> then<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.450> put

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
around the flange right here then I put

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.020 
around the flange right here then I put
it<00:00:36.809> back<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> head<00:00:37.550> let's<00:00:38.550> sit<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> head

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
it back on the head let's sit the head

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.000 
it back on the head let's sit the head
under<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> light<00:00:39.690> not<00:00:40.140> too<00:00:40.290> close<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.860> don't

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
under a light not too close you don't

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.530 
under a light not too close you don't
need<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.700> be<00:00:41.790> heating<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.239> head<00:00:42.450> or

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
need to be heating up the head or

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.630 
need to be heating up the head or
anything<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:43.559> enough<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.070> gently<00:00:44.309> warm

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
anything but just enough to gently warm

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.279 
anything but just enough to gently warm
it<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.910> makes<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> glue<00:00:45.360> dry<00:00:45.570> little<00:00:45.809> faster

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
it it makes the glue dry little faster

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.479 
it it makes the glue dry little faster
and<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.530> think<00:00:46.710> maybe<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.160> little<00:00:47.280> bit

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
and I think maybe it a little bit

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.260 
and I think maybe it a little bit
stronger<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:50.010> after<00:00:50.550> that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
stronger and then what you do after that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.000 
stronger and then what you do after that
part<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.690> done<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:54.559> take<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.770> bit<00:00:55.949> of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
part is done is take a little bit of

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.260 
part is done is take a little bit of
glue<00:00:56.280> and<00:01:00.829> very<00:01:01.829> carefully<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.910> eat

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
glue and very carefully I like to eat

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.859 
glue and very carefully I like to eat
glue<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> scalp<00:01:05.090> that<00:01:06.090> way<00:01:06.360> no

glue just on the scalp that way no
matter<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.229> kind<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.530> glue<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.830> use<00:01:08.330> can

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
matter what kind of glue you use can

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.480 
matter what kind of glue you use can
make<00:01:09.479> sure<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.990> don't<00:01:10.170> mess<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.979> get

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
make sure that you don't mess up and get

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.100 
make sure that you don't mess up and get
it<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> face<00:01:12.060> plate<00:01:12.330> or<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.600> back<00:01:12.810> plate
