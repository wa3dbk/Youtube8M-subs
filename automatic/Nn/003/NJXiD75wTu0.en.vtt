00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
a number of things that we did and we

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.480 
a number of things that we did and we
had<00:04:43.970> a<00:04:44.000> basic<00:04:44.419> format<00:04:44.870> we<00:04:44.990> ran<00:04:45.229> out<00:04:45.440> of<00:04:45.490> which

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
had a basic format we ran out of which

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.300 
had a basic format we ran out of which
is<00:04:46.699> why<00:04:46.910> I<00:04:46.940> really<00:04:47.360> felt<00:04:47.810> very<00:04:48.349> comfortable<00:04:49.220> in

is why I really felt very comfortable in
the<00:04:49.430> triangle<00:04:49.849> structure<00:04:50.150> because<00:04:50.570> it's<00:04:50.750> very

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
the triangle structure because it's very

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.680 
the triangle structure because it's very
similar<00:04:51.380> to<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:52.610> triangle<00:04:53.090> structure<00:04:53.419> that

similar to the triangle structure that
we<00:04:53.840> had<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:56.080> we<00:04:57.080> had<00:04:57.110> really<00:04:57.650> a<00:04:58.210> understanding

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
we had and we had really a understanding

we had and we had really a understanding
of<00:04:59.330> how<00:04:59.479> to<00:04:59.539> play<00:04:59.870> together<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.560> he<00:05:00.889> created

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580
