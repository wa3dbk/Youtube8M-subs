phones<00:00:02.990> here<00:00:03.990> that's<00:00:04.200> pretty<00:00:04.680> much<00:00:05.400> up<00:00:05.759> and

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
phones here that's pretty much up and

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.150 
phones here that's pretty much up and
I'm<00:00:06.930> actually<00:00:07.140> going<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.529> do<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> test<00:00:07.740> flight

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
I'm actually going to do a test flight

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.850 
I'm actually going to do a test flight
so<00:00:08.780> here<00:00:09.780> now<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:09.990> wind<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.349> really<00:00:10.530> calm

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
so here now the wind is really calm

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.390 
so here now the wind is really calm
let's<00:00:11.219> see<00:00:11.370> how<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.490> happens<00:00:14.839> yeah<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.400> not

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
let's see how it happens yeah it's not

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.740 
let's see how it happens yeah it's not
bad<00:00:17.869> we'll<00:00:18.869> give<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.020> another<00:00:19.140> test<00:00:19.590> flight

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
bad we'll give it another test flight

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.509 
bad we'll give it another test flight
just<00:00:21.750> flight<00:00:22.020> without<00:00:22.170> any<00:00:22.560> battery<00:00:23.189> okay

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
just flight without any battery okay

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.410 
just flight without any battery okay
yeah<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:27.029> fly<00:00:28.130> flights<00:00:29.130> pretty<00:00:29.490> well<00:00:29.730> now

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
yeah you can fly flights pretty well now

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.420 
yeah you can fly flights pretty well now
I'm<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.779> give<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.019> nice<00:00:31.219> charge<00:00:34.430> okay

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
I'm going to give it a nice charge okay

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.819 
I'm going to give it a nice charge okay
here<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.760> goes<00:00:35.790> let's<00:00:36.180> hope<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.510> doesn't<00:00:36.829> hang

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
here it goes let's hope it doesn't hang

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.549 
here it goes let's hope it doesn't hang
on<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> any<00:00:38.219> tree<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.550> now<00:00:38.700> there<00:00:38.940> really<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
on to any tree so now there really is

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.830 
on to any tree so now there really is
zero<00:00:40.559> wind<00:00:41.450> let's<00:00:42.450> charge<00:00:43.140> until<00:00:44.329> like<00:00:45.329> 15

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
zero wind let's charge until like 15

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.910 
zero wind let's charge until like 15

that<00:00:50.160> way<00:00:50.940> you'll<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.149> how<00:00:51.449> how<00:00:51.809> much<00:00:51.960> you're

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
that way you'll know how how much you're

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.080 
that way you'll know how how much you're
charging<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.920> listen<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> pitch<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
charging and listen to the pitch of the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.930 
charging and listen to the pitch of the
sound

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
sound

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.450 
sound
of<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:56.780> motor<00:00:56.989> okay<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:57.829> think<00:00:58.070> it's<00:00:58.219> okay

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
of the motor okay I think it's okay

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.670 
of the motor okay I think it's okay
let's<00:00:59.149> watch<00:00:59.449> this<00:01:00.910> see<00:01:01.910> it<00:01:02.120> stalls<00:01:02.899> goes<00:01:03.410> up

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
let's watch this see it stalls goes up

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.999 
let's watch this see it stalls goes up
and<00:01:03.920> down<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:05.170> it's<00:01:06.170> nice<00:01:06.350> it's<00:01:06.710> actually

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
and down and it's nice it's actually

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.160 
and down and it's nice it's actually
pretty<00:01:07.159> cool<00:01:07.430> just<00:01:07.790> goes<00:01:08.479> ups<00:01:08.690> and<00:01:08.869> down<00:01:08.990> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
pretty cool just goes ups and down the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.830 
pretty cool just goes ups and down the
problem<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.650> that<00:01:09.860> it<00:01:10.070> could<00:01:10.220> actually<00:01:10.840> crash

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
problem is that it could actually crash

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.060 
problem is that it could actually crash
and<00:01:12.229> we<00:01:13.220> want<00:01:13.399> to<00:01:13.490> avoid<00:01:13.729> those<00:01:14.030> crashes<00:01:15.070> since

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
and we want to avoid those crashes since

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.880 
and we want to avoid those crashes since
the<00:01:16.340> nose<00:01:16.549> although<00:01:17.180> them<00:01:17.830> material<00:01:18.830> is

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
the nose although them material is

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.270 
the nose although them material is
really<00:01:19.130> strong<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:19.640> plastic<00:01:20.180> is<00:01:21.280> glass

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
really strong the plastic is glass

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.080 
really strong the plastic is glass
filled<00:01:25.149> polyamide<00:01:26.409> at<00:01:27.409> PA<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.070> also<00:01:28.610> you<00:01:28.850> have

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
filled polyamide at PA and also you have

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.260 
filled polyamide at PA and also you have
a<00:01:29.119> fiber<00:01:29.929> carbon<00:01:30.429> so<00:01:31.429> this<00:01:31.550> is<00:01:31.670> really<00:01:31.820> very

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
a fiber carbon so this is really very

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.320 
a fiber carbon so this is really very
robust<00:01:32.720> but<00:01:33.110> still<00:01:33.470> if<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:34.610> fly<00:01:34.819> this<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:35.210> an

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
robust but still if you fly this on an

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.580 
robust but still if you fly this on an
asphalt<00:01:36.280> will<00:01:37.280> not<00:01:37.460> be<00:01:37.610> good<00:01:37.899> so<00:01:38.899> now<00:01:39.140> let's

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
asphalt will not be good so now let's

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.149 
asphalt will not be good so now let's
leave<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:40.009> elephant's<00:01:41.229> let's<00:01:42.229> excuse<00:01:42.830> me<00:01:42.979> now

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
leave the elephant's let's excuse me now

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.649 
leave the elephant's let's excuse me now
let's<00:01:43.429> correct<00:01:43.789> the<00:01:43.909> other<00:01:44.090> ones<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:44.539> see

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
let's correct the other ones and see

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.050 
let's correct the other ones and see
what<00:01:44.810> happens<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:46.100> we<00:01:46.190> just<00:01:46.340> had<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.550> stalling

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
what happens so we just had a stalling

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.540 
what happens so we just had a stalling
effect<00:01:47.539> I'm<00:01:47.690> going<00:01:47.899> back<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:49.130> center<00:01:49.520> of

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
effect I'm going back to the center of

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.730 
effect I'm going back to the center of
the<00:01:49.729> field<00:01:49.909> because<00:01:50.330> it's<00:01:51.200> difficult<00:01:51.590> to

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
the field because it's difficult to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.680 
the field because it's difficult to
anticipate<00:01:51.979> where<00:01:52.550> it's<00:01:52.700> going<00:01:52.819> to<00:01:52.880> fly<00:01:54.190> and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
anticipate where it's going to fly and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.660 
anticipate where it's going to fly and
I'm<00:01:56.690> going<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:56.929> lower<00:01:58.060> lower<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.330> elephant's

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
I'm going to lower lower the elephant's

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.449 
I'm going to lower lower the elephant's
I'll<00:02:01.670> give<00:02:01.849> it<00:02:01.879> a<00:02:02.030> little<00:02:02.330> test<00:02:02.720> flight<00:02:03.459> see

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
I'll give it a little test flight see

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.100 
I'll give it a little test flight see
that<00:02:04.580> applies<00:02:04.940> okay

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.250 

yeah<00:02:08.770> that's<00:02:09.100> pretty<00:02:09.340> nice<00:02:09.960> you<00:02:10.960> can<00:02:11.110> see<00:02:11.230> a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
yeah that's pretty nice you can see a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.740 
yeah that's pretty nice you can see a
bit<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.740> left<00:02:12.210> but<00:02:13.210> that<00:02:13.390> would<00:02:13.690> be

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
bit to the left but that would be

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.930 
bit to the left but that would be
interesting<00:02:14.140> let's<00:02:14.320> see<00:02:14.410> what<00:02:14.530> happens<00:02:14.980> and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
interesting let's see what happens and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.980 
interesting let's see what happens and
let's<00:02:16.900> give<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.260> charge<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.710> about<00:02:18.540> 10<00:02:19.540> 10

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
let's give it a charge of about 10 10

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.600 
let's give it a charge of about 10 10
seconds<00:02:20.470> okay<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.940> here<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.180> goes<00:02:22.800> one<00:02:23.800> two

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
seconds okay so here it goes one two

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.470 
seconds okay so here it goes one two
three<00:02:25.600> four<00:02:26.530> five<00:02:27.430> six<00:02:28.390> seven<00:02:29.380> eight<00:02:29.770> nine<00:02:30.550> ten

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
three four five six seven eight nine ten

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.430 
three four five six seven eight nine ten
into<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.140> wind<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.440> nice<00:02:32.620> smooth<00:02:33.070> throw<00:02:33.430> up

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
into the wind a nice smooth throw up

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.340 
into the wind a nice smooth throw up
black<00:02:35.440> really<00:02:36.010> bad<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.750> until<00:02:37.750> another<00:02:38.020> trial

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350
