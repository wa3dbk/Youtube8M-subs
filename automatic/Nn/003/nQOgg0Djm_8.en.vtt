film<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.569> the<00:01:43.380> minute<00:01:43.709> you<00:01:43.829> give<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> figure<00:01:44.279> to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
film and the minute you give a figure to

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.789 
film and the minute you give a figure to
it<00:01:44.609> you<00:01:45.569> know<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.139> many<00:01:46.380> people<00:01:46.709> have

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
it you know that that many people have

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.010 
it you know that that many people have
gone<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.189> view<00:01:47.490> your<00:01:47.700> film<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.599> obviously<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
gone to view your film so obviously the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.899 
gone to view your film so obviously the
figures<00:01:49.349> come<00:01:49.560> into<00:01:50.069> consideration<00:01:50.639> at<00:01:50.759> that

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
figures come into consideration at that

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.839 
figures come into consideration at that
time<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.359> think<00:01:51.899> whether<00:01:52.340> whenever<00:01:53.340> an<00:01:53.490> actor

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:53.849 
time I think whether whenever an actor

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:56.209 
time I think whether whenever an actor
sets<00:01:54.090> out<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.299> make<00:01:54.539> a<00:01:54.569> film<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:55.079> all<00:01:55.200> want<00:01:55.560> many

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
sets out to make a film we all want many

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.800 
sets out to make a film we all want many
people<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.609> and<00:01:56.819> watch<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.329> more<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
people to and watch it like more the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.760 
people to and watch it like more the
