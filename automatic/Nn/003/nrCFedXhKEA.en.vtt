00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.320

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.210 

so<00:00:33.330> you<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.480> see<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.810> screen<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.740> in<00:00:34.920> great

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
so you can see the screen is in great

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.810 
so you can see the screen is in great
condition

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.660 

all<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.660> down<00:00:39.900> got<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.860> glass<00:00:41.190> or<00:00:41.430> plastic

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
all the way down got a glass or plastic

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.970 
all the way down got a glass or plastic
base<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:43.280> it<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.489> attached<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.210> pedestal

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
base and it is attached to this pedestal

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.380 
base and it is attached to this pedestal

sunlight<00:02:28.250> coming<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:28.849> room<00:02:29.629> no<00:02:29.870> shades

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
sunlight coming in this room no shades

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.670 
sunlight coming in this room no shades
to<00:02:31.190> windows<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.849> door<00:02:32.060> right<00:02:32.269> here<00:02:32.510> but<00:02:33.500> as

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
to windows in the door right here but as

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.360 
to windows in the door right here but as
you<00:02:33.830> can<00:02:33.950> see<00:02:35.410> no<00:02:36.410> imperfections<00:02:37.129> in<00:02:37.280> the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
you can see no imperfections in the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:46.330 
you can see no imperfections in the
screen<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:42.940> it's<00:02:43.940> not<00:02:44.180> LCD<00:02:44.870> or<00:02:45.140> Plasma<00:02:45.590> so

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
screen and it's not LCD or Plasma so

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.520 
screen and it's not LCD or Plasma so
there<00:02:46.940> will<00:02:47.090> be<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.239> point<00:02:47.599> where<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.319> get<00:02:48.470> to

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
there will be a point where you get to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.080 
there will be a point where you get to
that<00:02:48.739> your<00:02:48.890> screen<00:02:49.130> can't<00:02:49.430> see<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.670> lot<00:02:49.880> but<00:02:50.060> I

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
that your screen can't see a lot but I

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.460 
that your screen can't see a lot but I
mean<00:02:50.239> it<00:02:50.329> takes<00:02:50.480> all<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.930> way<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.410> edge

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
mean it takes all the way to the edge

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.110 
mean it takes all the way to the edge
it's<00:02:51.950> better<00:02:52.220> than<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.549> old<00:02:52.579> rear<00:02:52.940> projection

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
it's better than the old rear projection

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.240 
it's better than the old rear projection
so<00:02:53.569> you<00:02:53.630> can<00:02:53.780> see<00:02:54.019> it<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.680> know<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:54.799> could<00:02:55.040> set

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
so you can see it you know you could set

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.770 
so you can see it you know you could set
this<00:02:55.400> for<00:02:55.610> all<00:02:55.670> an<00:02:55.760> edge<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.120> still<00:02:56.329> watch<00:02:56.510> it

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
this for all an edge and still watch it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.620

which is really an advancement in the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.380
