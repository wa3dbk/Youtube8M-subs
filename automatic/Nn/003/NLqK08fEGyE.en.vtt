00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 It goes to Sweden what awaits us 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.390
 Of course, there then drive to 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.220
 win 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.050
 For that we train for the whole week 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.550
 want to achieve a good result there 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.210
 and I hope everything goes the way we do 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.210
 imagine that 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.580
 He already had a video session over 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.490
 helsingborg what an enemy is coming up 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.380
 we have not much to us before 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.539
 that's why we have known about the team 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.279
 she analyzed via video we have to go there 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.890
 just go there and our football 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.510
 That 's the only way to play that 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.280
 to win the game we have to focus 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.100
 put on us and to one hundred percent 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.539
 concentrated his coach of 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 Helsingborg is a former 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.890
 national coach of moa has expired only 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.000
 something about him tells how he teams up 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.000
 adjusts and trains 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.559
 unfortunately I do not know that but as me 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.520
 have played in norway I have them 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.379
 also met 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:12.119
 but I do not know so much about it 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:13.680
 us what do you know then about him he has in 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.229
 same city where I played 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.270
 so in molde he was always 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.770
 because if my team has played it 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.830
 will definitely make fun of him again 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.830
 see 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.770
 Last question how do you feel you were 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.140
 hurt long did it last a couple 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.250
 short runs how is your stand enough 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.110
 maybe even for the start eleven 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.110
 games and how exactly 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.720
 we'll see I'm not the one 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.430
 that decides i have to go all the time 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.360
 give the best and at my fitness 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.610
 work 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.140
 whether I play or not 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.850
 the coach alone I just do it 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.420
 my job and see what's next 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.420
 coming
