eight but obviously there's goals inside
those<00:01:15.410> goals<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:15.950> I<00:01:16.160> suppose<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.000> first

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
those goals and I suppose the first

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.550 
those goals and I suppose the first
thing<00:01:17.450> for<00:01:17.630> us<00:01:17.750> is<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:17.960> get<00:01:18.260> off<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.500> good

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
we do them together this here is a big

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.440 
we do them together this here is a big
year<00:02:06.800> for<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.070> sport<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.580> I<00:02:07.970> think<00:02:08.179> we<00:02:08.300> as<00:02:08.420> a

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
year for the sport and I think we as a

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.880 
year for the sport and I think we as a
game<00:02:08.720> in<00:02:08.899> particular<00:02:09.050> in<00:02:09.500> London<00:02:09.739> go<00:02:09.860> to

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
game in particular in London go to

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.010 
game in particular in London go to
capitalize<00:02:10.310> on<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.520> I<00:02:10.850> think<00:02:11.690> we<00:02:11.810> mustn't

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
capitalize on that I think we mustn't

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.180 
capitalize on that I think we mustn't
underestimate<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:12.709> there's<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.890> huge

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
underestimate but there's a huge

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.860 
underestimate but there's a huge
opportunity<00:02:13.340> here<00:02:13.970> in<00:02:14.060> London<00:02:14.360> we<00:02:14.480> probably

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
opportunity here in London we probably

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.090 
opportunity here in London we probably
haven't<00:02:15.110> tapped<00:02:15.320> into<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.680> as<00:02:15.770> much<00:02:15.950> as<00:02:15.980> we

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
haven't tapped into it as much as we

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.890 
haven't tapped into it as much as we
should<00:02:16.220> have<00:02:16.370> been<00:02:16.610> hopefully<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.450> world<00:02:17.660> cup

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
should have been hopefully the world cup

should have been hopefully the world cup
will<00:02:18.560> spur<00:02:18.860> us<00:02:19.010> on<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.370> be<00:02:19.489> able<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.090> some

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
will spur us on to be able to and some

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.699 
will spur us on to be able to and some
success<00:02:20.600> for<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.810> Broncos<00:02:21.140> will<00:02:21.320> spur<00:02:21.500> us<00:02:21.650> on
