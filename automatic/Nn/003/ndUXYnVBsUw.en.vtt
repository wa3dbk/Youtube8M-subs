one<00:01:20.580> thing<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.880> was<00:01:21.000> thinking<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.720> pink<00:01:22.170> slip

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
one thing I was thinking of is pink slip

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.230 
one thing I was thinking of is pink slip
races<00:01:22.830> now<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.340> being<00:01:23.520> confirmed<00:01:23.939> or

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
races now it's not being confirmed or

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.960 
races now it's not being confirmed or
denied<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.110> neatly<00:01:25.409> 2015<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.820> was

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
denied to be neatly 2015 but I was

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.149 
denied to be neatly 2015 but I was
thinking<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.229> where<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:28.770> should

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
thinking of a way in where they should

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.219 
thinking of a way in where they should
implement<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.750> thinking<00:01:30.990> instead<00:01:31.110> of

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
implement this I was thinking instead of

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.350 
implement this I was thinking instead of
actually<00:01:31.650> having<00:01:31.860> pink<00:01:32.280> slip<00:01:32.460> races<00:01:32.880> maybe

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
actually having pink slip races maybe

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.749 
actually having pink slip races maybe
give<00:01:33.570> us<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> ability<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.290> send<00:01:34.979> or<00:01:35.189> trade

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
give us the ability to send or trade

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.690 
give us the ability to send or trade
cars<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.229> way<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.130> obviously<00:01:38.369> give

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
cars and that way we can obviously give

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.060 
cars and that way we can obviously give
players<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.329> cars<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:40.020> agree<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.409> come

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
players the cars if we agree to come

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.649 
players the cars if we agree to come
over<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> cars<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.939> race<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.390> sort<00:01:42.630> of

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
over the cars in the race that sort of

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.270 
over the cars in the race that sort of
thing<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.380> that's<00:01:43.530> really<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> best<00:01:44.040> way

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
thing I think that's really the best way

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.310 
thing I think that's really the best way
to<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.840> my<00:01:45.990> personal

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
to do it but that's just my personal

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.510 
to do it but that's just my personal
preference<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:46.860> not<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.340> game

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
preference and that's not in the game

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.190 
preference and that's not in the game
but<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.360> would<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.570> pretty<00:01:48.720> cool<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.170> did

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
but it would be pretty cool if they did

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.960 
but it would be pretty cool if they did
that<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.829> those<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.159> don't<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:50.490> during

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that so for those that don't know during

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.170 
that so for those that don't know during
e3<00:01:51.329> people<00:01:52.320> were<00:01:52.409> able<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.770> play<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.430> demo<00:01:53.729> build

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
e3 people were able to play a demo build

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.780 
e3 people were able to play a demo build

a<00:02:10.590> lot<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:10.979> information<00:02:11.250> came<00:02:11.730> up<00:02:11.910> from<00:02:12.120> just

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
a lot of information came up from just

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.520 
a lot of information came up from just
those<00:02:12.660> things

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
those things

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.690 
those things
something<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.069> thought<00:02:14.340> was<00:02:14.490> absolutely

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
something that I thought was absolutely

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.420 
something that I thought was absolutely
awesome<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.870> you're<00:02:16.319> actually<00:02:16.500> able<00:02:17.069> to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
awesome is you're actually able to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.510 
awesome is you're actually able to
change<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.420> sound<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.990> your<00:02:19.140> car<00:02:19.520> using

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
change the sound of your car using

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.910 
change the sound of your car using
exhausts<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.630> Nick's<00:02:21.810> meters<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.319> only

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
exhausts so Nick's meters in the only

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.830 
exhausts so Nick's meters in the only
game<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.400> actually<00:02:23.790> ever<00:02:24.000> do<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.600> whole

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
game to actually ever do this whole

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.900 
game to actually ever do this whole
exhaust<00:02:25.319> changing<00:02:25.920> sin<00:02:26.130> changes<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.670> sound

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
exhaust changing sin changes the sound

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.300 
exhaust changing sin changes the sound
thing<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.780> mean<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.200> lot<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.470> games<00:02:28.740> have<00:02:29.100> it

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
thing I mean a lot of games have it

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.370 
thing I mean a lot of games have it
mostly<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.239> older<00:02:30.270> Need<00:02:30.720> for<00:02:30.750> Speed<00:02:30.900> games

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
mostly the older Need for Speed games

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.500 
mostly the older Need for Speed games
and<00:02:31.680> more<00:02:32.220> recently<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.790> odium<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.209> can<00:02:33.360> think

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
and more recently the odium I can think

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.110 
and more recently the odium I can think
of<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.080> new<00:02:34.230> Forza<00:02:34.739> horizon<00:02:34.890> 2<00:02:35.400> I'm

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
of is the new Forza horizon 2 I'm

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.180 
of is the new Forza horizon 2 I'm
assuming<00:02:36.510> Forza<00:02:36.870> 5<00:02:37.080> did<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.709> some<00:02:37.980> way<00:02:38.130> but

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
assuming Forza 5 did it in some way but

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.940 
assuming Forza 5 did it in some way but
honestly<00:02:38.790> those<00:02:39.360> games<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:40.080> me<00:02:40.319> they<00:02:40.770> don't

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
honestly those games to me they don't

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.680 
honestly those games to me they don't
really<00:02:41.220> change<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.880> as<00:02:42.000> well<00:02:42.239> as<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.390> Need<00:02:42.660> for

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
really change it as well as a Need for

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.390 
really change it as well as a Need for
Speed<00:02:42.930> would<00:02:43.470> that's<00:02:43.770> one<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.160> many

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
Speed would that's one of the many

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.160 
Speed would that's one of the many
things<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.850> love<00:02:44.880> about<00:02:45.060> Neve<00:02:45.360> speeds<00:02:45.660> this

got<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.220> bmw<00:03:05.819> m3<00:03:06.000> in<00:03:06.780> there<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.200> can

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
got the bmw m3 in there that I can

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.740 
got the bmw m3 in there that I can
convert<00:03:07.769> into<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.069> GTR<00:03:08.700> with<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.180> body<00:03:09.390> kit<00:03:09.660> or

convert into a GTR with the body kit or

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.449 
convert into a GTR with the body kit or
something<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.380> then<00:03:10.739> for<00:03:10.860> me<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.040> change<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
something and then for me to change the

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.740 
something and then for me to change the
exhaust<00:03:11.760> sound<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.180> sound<00:03:12.300> pretty<00:03:12.540> narrow

there's a highway and to get onto the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.670 
there's a highway and to get onto the
highway<00:04:11.549> there's<00:04:12.269> some<00:04:12.420> kind<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.870> curved<00:04:13.260> road

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680

where<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.480> Mustang<00:04:15.810> out<00:04:15.930> see<00:04:16.140> how<00:04:16.229> is<00:04:16.410> sliding
