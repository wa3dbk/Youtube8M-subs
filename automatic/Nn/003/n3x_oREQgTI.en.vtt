00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.900
 minute arrive at dollar costs sitting 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.180
 same as the first post in the second flex 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.250
 time and we start with one 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:18.079
 the more difficult and what do I say 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.730
 now time for you must here may say 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.039
 Let's take note of important skills 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.130
 There are two groups required 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.229
 a group which made the door and 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.509
 a group which is practical and the 

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:33.860
 whole export and needed for the things 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:37.670
 Just give a tank a heel 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.890
 and dvds so that you practically the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.650
 can do the tower and must on 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.970
 wait a bit for the first time 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.190
 after a while how does it look like 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.290
 the middle of the screen so in the 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.020
 middle of the interface first on 100 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.450
 percent have as yours npcs 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.000
 managed to blow the gate of doing 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.680
 then you have to run dani nordrhein 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.920
 run up and the commander 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.399
 which is positioned around practically 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.399
 kill 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.429
 Of course that's why it's the one 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.249
 men have killed the commander and 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:17.659
 you have cleaned the platform 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:20.659
 use the cannon and with this 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.119
 Cannon from Caracas shoot the big one 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.999
 red dragon of course up around 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.829
 is that why you have to do it 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:29.420
 gives two towers a left right 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.020
 So a north and a south clock with 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.609
 first the south tower opens 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.289
 do you a done that before him 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.999
 described and then the 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.209
 North bypass would have opened between 

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:43.340
 wait a while and of course you can 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:47.329
 go on the net and after her 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.770
 who then south tower also clarified the 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.539
 as well as the place you have to do the two 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.189
 occupy cannons so there would have to each 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.490
 send a player in and with it 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.409
 He then shoots galas and forces him 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.249
 to land and then the second begins 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.249
 phase of the fight 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.880
 Of course, the second tour did that 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.009
 same 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.379
 that just explained the tours shoot 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.000
 then as described the communes and 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.519
 then switch directly to the second 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.680
 phase where we then against ballack itself 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.720
 fight and here would have to be a very 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.060
 important activities 88 this fireball 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.769
 who could see now and so will this 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.510
 fireball on a random player 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.900
 and this player then has one 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.370
 some time to position yourself 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.819
 or to run away completely 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.799
 important that the ball one or more 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.750
 other players will hit it 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.360
 flies through before she sights her 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.430
 there you can not do that 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.290
 happens then comes a very high eye 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.970
 look that is that is on 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.709
 Best in a group and easy 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.860
 who gets the ball does a few 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.910
 steps backwards and that's it 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.910
 problem done
