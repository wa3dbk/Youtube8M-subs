00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
the young people love it and we like to

the young people love it and we like to
show<00:00:36.559> you<00:00:36.649> different<00:00:36.950> ways<00:00:36.980> you<00:00:37.250> can<00:00:37.370> use<00:00:37.520> it

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
show you different ways you can use it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.479 
show you different ways you can use it
so<00:00:37.940> here<00:00:38.239> is<00:00:38.480> an<00:00:38.870> example<00:00:39.289> that<00:00:39.500> we<00:00:39.710> use<00:00:40.250> not

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
so here is an example that we use not

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.580 
so here is an example that we use not
once<00:00:40.789> but<00:00:41.000> twice<00:00:41.360> in<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:42.050> December<00:00:42.440> issue

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
once but twice in the December issue

that focuses on Valentine's Day and it's

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.619 
that focuses on Valentine's Day and it's
with<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:45.440> new<00:00:45.649> wire<00:00:45.890> from<00:00:46.280> Oasis<00:00:46.879> it's<00:00:47.239> flat

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
with the new wire from Oasis it's flat

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.959 
with the new wire from Oasis it's flat
wire<00:00:47.899> we've<00:00:48.230> worked<00:00:48.469> a<00:00:48.710> lot<00:00:49.129> with<00:00:49.190> wire<00:00:49.640> that's

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
wire we've worked a lot with wire that's

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.420 
wire we've worked a lot with wire that's
just<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:50.870> know<00:00:50.899> a<00:00:51.020> regular<00:00:51.649> gauge<00:00:51.920> but<00:00:52.250> this

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
just you know a regular gauge but this

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.049 
just you know a regular gauge but this
this<00:00:52.930> opens<00:00:53.930> up<00:00:54.079> all<00:00:54.350> new<00:00:55.010> possibilities<00:00:55.850> of

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
this opens up all new possibilities of

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.779 
this opens up all new possibilities of
design<00:00:56.690> here's<00:00:57.320> what<00:00:57.559> we<00:00:57.680> did<00:00:57.920> both<00:00:58.250> Keith

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
design here's what we did both Keith

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.910 
design here's what we did both Keith
white<00:00:59.059> who<00:00:59.359> was<00:00:59.480> our<00:00:59.629> guest<00:00:59.780> designer<00:01:00.199> and<00:01:00.500> the

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
white who was our guest designer and the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.369 
white who was our guest designer and the
issue<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:01.519> in<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.510> department<00:01:03.019> that<00:01:03.050> I<00:01:03.140> made

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
issue and in a department that I made

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.510 
issue and in a department that I made
myself<00:01:03.559> we<00:01:04.489> created<00:01:05.420> roses<00:01:06.110> or<00:01:06.320> flowers<00:01:06.520> out

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
myself we created roses or flowers out

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.780 
myself we created roses or flowers out
of<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.910> flat<00:01:08.840> wire<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.470> it's<00:01:09.950> very<00:01:10.250> simple<00:01:10.670> to

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
of the flat wire and it's very simple to

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.429 
of the flat wire and it's very simple to
do<00:01:10.939> to<00:01:11.240> create<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.600> flower<00:01:11.810> part<00:01:12.110> of<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.290> wire

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
do to create the flower part of the wire

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.550 
do to create the flower part of the wire
I<00:01:12.650> just<00:01:12.860> take<00:01:13.180> needle<00:01:14.180> nose<00:01:14.330> pliers<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.409> I

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
I just take needle nose pliers and I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.460 
I just take needle nose pliers and I
clamp<00:01:15.890> down<00:01:16.100> on<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.310> very<00:01:16.520> end<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.900> curl<00:01:18.320> it

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
clamp down on the very end and I curl it

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.090 
clamp down on the very end and I curl it
inside<00:01:19.130> itself<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:22.270> start<00:01:23.710> getting<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.829> bit<00:01:25.070> of

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
inside itself and start getting a bit of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.240 
inside itself and start getting a bit of
a<00:01:25.280> swirl<00:01:26.110> getting<00:01:27.110> it<00:01:27.229> kind<00:01:27.500> of<00:01:27.619> tight<00:01:27.890> in<00:01:27.920> the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
a swirl getting it kind of tight in the

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.920 
a swirl getting it kind of tight in the
middle<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:34.280> once<00:01:34.670> I<00:01:34.759> get<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:35.030> started<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.600> can

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
middle and once I get it started I can

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.060 
middle and once I get it started I can
just<00:01:37.390> curl<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.509> by<00:01:38.689> hand<00:01:39.020> just<00:01:39.290> keep<00:01:39.590> curling

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
just curl it by hand just keep curling

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:51.740 
just curl it by hand just keep curling
it<00:01:40.159> in<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:41.110> this<00:01:42.110> creates<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.890> flower

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.790 

now<00:01:52.750> as<00:01:52.840> you're<00:01:52.960> curling<00:01:53.260> it<00:01:53.409> you'll<00:01:53.560> notice

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
now as you're curling it you'll notice

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.700 
now as you're curling it you'll notice
it<00:01:54.100> gets<00:01:54.280> it's<00:01:54.640> probably<00:01:55.330> too<00:01:55.540> tight<00:01:55.900> so<00:01:56.229> what

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
it gets it's probably too tight so what

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.260 
it gets it's probably too tight so what
you<00:01:56.800> want<00:01:56.979> to<00:01:57.070> do<00:01:57.190> is<00:01:57.369> go<00:01:57.550> back<00:01:57.580> in<00:01:57.970> with<00:01:58.090> your

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
you want to do is go back in with your

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.840 
you want to do is go back in with your
pliers<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.770> go<00:02:00.040> against<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.710> curl<00:02:03.040> holding

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
pliers and go against the curl holding

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.370 
pliers and go against the curl holding
it<00:02:03.970> on<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.150> end<00:02:04.300> I<00:02:04.360> don't<00:02:04.420> clamp<00:02:04.840> down<00:02:05.050> too

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
it on the end I don't clamp down too

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.590 
it on the end I don't clamp down too
tight<00:02:05.650> on<00:02:05.680> this<00:02:05.950> because<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:06.490> can<00:02:06.759> make

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
tight on this because you can make

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.560 
tight on this because you can make
little<00:02:07.960> silver<00:02:08.560> spots<00:02:09.190> or<00:02:09.580> take<00:02:10.119> some<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.450> the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
little silver spots or take some of the

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.990 
little silver spots or take some of the
color<00:02:11.080> off<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.590> wire<00:02:11.800> so<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.459> just<00:02:12.610> go<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:12.970> a

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
color off the wire so you just go in a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.680 
color off the wire so you just go in a
reverse<00:02:13.390> motion<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:15.390> opens<00:02:16.390> up<00:02:16.510> the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
reverse motion and that opens up the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:26.060 
reverse motion and that opens up the
flower<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.580> get<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.850> desired<00:02:21.970> look

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.490 

okay<00:02:27.070> now<00:02:27.730> I'm<00:02:27.940> going<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.150> continue<00:02:28.540> on<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:29.320> add

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
okay now I'm going to continue on to add

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.860 
okay now I'm going to continue on to add
a<00:02:29.530> couple<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:30.010> leaves<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.519> this<00:02:30.760> flower<00:02:31.030> first

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
a couple of leaves to this flower first

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.479 
a couple of leaves to this flower first
thing<00:02:32.050> I<00:02:32.140> want<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.380> do<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.800> decide<00:02:33.190> where<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
thing I want to do is decide where the

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.570 
thing I want to do is decide where the
flower<00:02:33.670> ends<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.890> then<00:02:35.890> I'm<00:02:35.980> gonna<00:02:36.190> pinch

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
flower ends and then I'm gonna pinch

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.370 
flower ends and then I'm gonna pinch
that<00:02:36.820> tightly<00:02:37.590> with<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.620> needlenose<00:02:39.010> plier

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
that tightly with the needlenose plier

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.580 
that tightly with the needlenose plier
then<00:02:41.380> I'm<00:02:41.470> gonna<00:02:41.590> make<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:41.830> loop<00:02:43.320> that's<00:02:44.320> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
then I'm gonna make a loop that's the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.090 
then I'm gonna make a loop that's the
size<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.190> leaf<00:02:45.459> that<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.730> want<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:47.100> then

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
size of the leaf that I want and then

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.020 
size of the leaf that I want and then
I'm<00:02:48.220> going<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.750> pinch<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:50.019> again<00:02:50.519> all<00:02:51.519> the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
I'm going to pinch that again all the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.479 
I'm going to pinch that again all the
way<00:02:52.180> together<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:53.700> then<00:02:54.700> smooth<00:02:55.209> out<00:02:56.489> this

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
way together and then smooth out this

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.340 
way together and then smooth out this
leaf<00:02:57.820> shape

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.340 

I'm<00:03:01.980> gonna<00:03:02.190> pinch<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.490> again<00:03:05.960> make<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:06.990> loop

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
I'm gonna pinch it again make a loop

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.680 
I'm gonna pinch it again make a loop
it's<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.830> size<00:03:08.100> of<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.370> leaf<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.820> want<00:03:11.690> tighten

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
it's the size of the leaf I want tighten

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:23.290 
it's the size of the leaf I want tighten
that<00:03:12.810> back<00:03:13.050> in<00:03:17.900> smooth<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.110> leaf<00:03:19.380> back<00:03:19.680> out

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:36.860 

and<00:03:24.300> finish<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.840> off<00:03:24.960> at<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.290> end<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:36.600> now<00:03:36.750> I've

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
and finish it off at the end so now I've

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:46.790 
and finish it off at the end so now I've
created<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:37.440> rose<00:03:41.600> with<00:03:42.600> two<00:03:42.870> rose<00:03:43.110> leaves<00:03:45.800> we

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
created a rose with two rose leaves we

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.380 
created a rose with two rose leaves we
like<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.100> technique<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.670> much<00:03:47.880> we<00:03:48.090> use<00:03:48.240> it

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
like this technique so much we use it

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.300 
like this technique so much we use it
twice<00:03:48.600> in<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.870> magazine<00:03:49.320> once<00:03:49.890> in<00:03:50.190> the
