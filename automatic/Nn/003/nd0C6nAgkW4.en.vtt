00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.550
 lion ' 1414 and today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.260
 of how to review the resource requirements 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.540
 or requirements according to how they want 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.989
 call him on his pc in a windows xp and 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.480
 windows 7 this is useful to check if 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:26.810
 grab a game your pc or even systems 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.410
 operative good i will do it in xp but 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.079
 I will tell you how it is in windows 7 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.989
 we started let's start with the disk 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.650
 hard the hard drive is the ability to 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.540
 store all the files on your pc 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.610
 first we will review how much capacity and 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.700
 how much space does the hard drive have or 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.730
 how many hard drives do you have to review 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.890
 the hard drive we go to my pc and the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.800
 hard drives 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.600
 I have two good discs we are going to give 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.570
 Right click on a hard drive and now 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.900
 properties what blue is what you wear 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.600
 used from your pc and the pink is what 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.700
 you still have to fill out but if you fill it 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.289
 too much is going to get between your pc 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.310
 and it is possible that you mark some 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.619
 mistakes 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.329
 good to check the video card 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.560
 ram etcetera let's address run 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:22.479
 in windows 7 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.479
 these two keys at the same time 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.850
 and they give him to accept if they did not understand 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.970
 I'll leave these letters in the 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.399
 video description we hope a bit 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:49.789
 to open the box 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:51.310
 We wait 10 seconds 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.610
 and 10 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.399
 If a box appears, we say yes 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.520
 and it will come out good first we see that 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.490
 The current date and time appear 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.500
 the name of the team after the system 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.340
 operative they have installed I have 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.489
 the xp sp3 fork that language until its 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.030
 operating system then follow manufacturer 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.000
 of the team 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.000
 we see that I started in this sea ​​canet and 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.920
 then follow the system model this 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.130
 It can be very useful to download the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.290
 types of drivers that your pc uses in 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.630
 another tutorial say that they are the drivers 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.540
 how many drivers are they for? 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.769
 where the good advice going back to 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.319
 theme then follow the lip version 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.330
 then the processor comes 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.420
 can run several executions in the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.420
 same pc at the same time eye a 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.430
 processor has its brand and capacity the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.560
 brand is important because the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.700
 The company that made it is going to give you the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.980
 power my brand is 20 on 21 4 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.050
 but the capacity is important because 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.330
 helps you process several files to the 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:07.030
 once mine has 2.47 the processor is 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.970
 a resource for running games later 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.030
 comes the ram the ram card is the 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.090
 speed of the pc in games too 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.750
 is the speed that will also run in a 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.350
 game happens the same 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.090
 the ran is a resource for running games 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.260
 then follow the paging files 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.260
 that's not important 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.440
 is another resource to extend games and 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.200
 to check the video card we 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.500
 we go to screen and total memory 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.380
 approximate we see that I have 96 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.350
 megabytes well that's all about this 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.510
 tutorial the next tutorial I'll do it 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.770
 how to download games programs and 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.190
 utilities please subscribe to the
