 recipes but there is also a great 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.900
 variety of products to perform each 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.480
 one of them is for frying pans 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.490
 furnace refrigerators have already removed the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.100
 where to serve them but they know that I 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.440
 love that soriana and you will see as well as I 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.379
 think about the environment and support me 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.879
 every time I carry my ecological bags 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.129
 besides taking care of the future of my children 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.679
 and the welfare of the planet but I'm with 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.339
 points on my soriana card 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:50.739
 they fit everything and you can buy it in the 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.269
 store and thus contribute to the welfare 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.210
 of our environment 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.179
 They are also very soriana and see if 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.180
 in hedge and for that reason soriana hÃ­pers is the 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:04.420
 super for shopping 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.030
 So you already know where to go, because I 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.930
 I want to do with you my first 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:16.080
 smodis recipe let's do this is 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.080
 mute and we 're going to see the ingredients 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.000
 for this recipe we are going to need a 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.020
 ripe banana half a cup of juice 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.390
 granada half a cup of frozen blackberries 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.620
 a spoonful of honey and one 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.060
 cup of natural yogurt 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.810
 rafa in fat 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.189
 and I think that smoothies are very 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.899
 nutritious 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.759
 especially for when people who live 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.200
 in the rush and running around 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.579
 parties and that is going to meet with the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.409
 city traffic and exiting 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.479
 running that children that school 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.659
 that the change to the channel then with that 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.890
 we can assure ourselves of being well 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.380
 nourished especially in our children 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.149
 then suddenly, now that 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.340
 The time goes by 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.350
 sleep or go to school and we 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.950
 we want to make sure they eat well and 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.049
 have a full smoothie breakfast is the 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.360
 solution also for us a 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.459
 smoothie can give us a lot of energy and 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.530
 revitalize throughout the day and that 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.080
 it is well complemented you can leave them 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.590
 satisfied for at least the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.390
 4 hours then it is important to have a 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.210
 that another needs the mobile in our 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.120
 recipe book 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.310
 I love it because it has many 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.270
 beta-carotene and beta-carotene are 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.270
 what are xavi 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.470
 Well, you learned the fungus and not 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.710
 I'm very good because I'm going to remove the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.220
 toxins do not eliminate free radicals 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.650
 they help us and now it delays the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.140
 aging both physically and at a level 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.420
 cellular also remove the possibilities 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.400
 of having cancer or suffering from any 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.440
 chronic illness as is the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.120
 diabetes the cholesterol and you already know all 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.490
 the diseases that have bombarded us 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.260
 it is possible all of us have the 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.690
 opportunity to change our state 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.180
 nutritional in our state of health to 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.600
 through foods that really come 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.780
 to help us maintain a life a life 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.600
 they are at a spiritual physical equilibrium 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.120
 and all good then here I have my 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.100
 blueberries that are frozen 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.000
 then it is no longer a matter of 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.370
 thaw those that now 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.070
 if they want their is very cold do not choose them 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.070
 use it as vis club 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.780
 they are and they put them in the blender and this 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.570
 You can also give him a little 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.030
 freshness is to die and make it colder 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.280
 and if they were already frozen and if they want 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.680
 it is cold and ice and potential 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.870
 we 're going to add a little bit of 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.550
 pomegranate juice than the red pomegranate 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.190
 good leaves a lot for your property 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.420
 It is a fruit that became very famous in 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.420
 China 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.599
 and that blessed goodbye we have here in 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.330
 mexico and this fruit has the quality of 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:02.090
 purify the liver and liver do not sing 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.430
 normally if we are a diet for 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.110
 detoxify the liver in how long 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.640
 we would take in the desert 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.010
 explain it 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:15.400
 throw it all on how long 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.440
 one week two weeks a month 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.660
 ok to be impressed and leave in 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.610
 the eight years 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.590
 so it is very important to be 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.300
 taking care to not fill 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.080
 toxins because then detoxify what 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.009
 a little more 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.289
 18 I visited the 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.910
 the truck we will also incorporate the 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.920
 honey 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.990
 that this is natural honey but 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.350
 You can also find honey 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.770
 aromatic to me I love fascinates me the 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.040
 lavender honey and it's a honey that 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.530
 comes from the lavender flower and 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.650
 then the bees go and only 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.690
 they suck the nectar of lavender and it's 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.960
 delicious to be there and I can 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.940
 find is pretty easy to find 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.890
 and if it's organic honey better because 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.170
 then they are sure that it is about 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.600
 that have more freedom and chacala the 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.390
 process of how they get honey and how 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.820
 respect the channels always look for the 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.410
 organic when we can let's add 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.570
 also the banana because to me the 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.490
 banana makes me a very 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.729
 interesting because in addition to potassium 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.680
 It has many proteins 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.020
 the protein what potassium is good 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.409
 help help that I put to remove us read the 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.580
 the cramps not those we do not have 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.589
 these cramps and these pains 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.449
 joint and remove the uric acid 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:36.490
 after a day of exercise like this 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.960
 it also helps a lot but apart from 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.969
 protein then a food that when 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.199
 consume help also regenerate all 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.319
 the tissues of the body from those of 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.569
 out to those who are already in 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:49.240
 our inside our organs and everything 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.710
 and finally we are going to incorporate a bit 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.210
 of yogurt that in this case I 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.720
 I recommend it to be a low yogurt in 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.009
 grease 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.639
 to avoid some saturated fat 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:04.990
 and if they can do it in boxes with 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:07.199
 Bulgarians, better not, and this is what we're going to 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.199
 Mix 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.020
 this that come out those flasks 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.150
 it was never the umpteenth sport 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.250
 shell always going to provide 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.080
 a lot of fiber and that's what we want 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.270
 have fiber in our body 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.620
 fiber to take out what we're not going to 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.570
 can digest 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.390
 and then our digestion always 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.940
 create the best 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:48.070
 wow 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:52.260
 a delicious is mobile let's go to a cut 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.260
 do not take off, we go back with him
