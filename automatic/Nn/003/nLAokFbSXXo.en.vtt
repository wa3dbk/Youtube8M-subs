00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.640
let's be realistic

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.080
remember what I did to Abdullah Othman?

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.420
in the break

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.020
reality is different

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.580
you remember

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.320
you did nothing, idiot

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.860
you know nothing with that big nose of yours

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.740
just because I'm short?

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.720
shut up

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.520
guys

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.460
just now, I have finished inventing a silicone chip

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.140
it's 500 times effeicient than the standard ones

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600
the worker wants his money

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.440
keeps on calling

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.620
this time you get the grocery, we need water

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.480
call the company to get us some

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.720
a bunch of losers, I swear

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.620
commission for taking care of inventors

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.400
these computers are hards

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.740
it was working before

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.360
just press enter

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.320
thank you, it took me 3 days

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.120
who are you? what do you want?

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.120
I have an invention I want to showcase

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.200
hello

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.060
yes

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.400
it transfers solar energy to...

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.340
take madam from school then go

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.800
it's basically a silicone chip that transfers solar energy to electrical

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.040
the chip I invented...

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.720
yes, to the kid's school

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.700
yes, my kid

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.980
the advantage is...

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.880
I filled the car tank yesterday, are you stupid?

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.440
don't waste gas

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.320
the cost process should be an easy one

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.300
yes, fill it with 95

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.020
you were saying?

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.960
inventor, huh?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.740
this is an idea

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.920
steam pot with three rows

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.680
3 types of rice

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.660
just a press of a button

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.980
and dinner is ready

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.700
just press a button.. that doesn't interest me

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.180
don't worry, you well be

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.520
take this one

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.840
let me explain more

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.300
shut up, enough

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.640
I will send you to the manager

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.780
you're not the manager??

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.340
we are both the invention department managers

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.180
the transformation of solar energy to multiple energies

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.640
wow, I'm proud of you

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.740
this is great, I'm impressed

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.640
I didn't know you were interested in those things before

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.820
thank you

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.720
I was surprised when they mentioned you work here

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.840
good to see you

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.300
to summarize, I need your support

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.320
support? no worries

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.100
this is our duty

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.140
if we direct it to the sun, as you see

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.320
it's highly efficient, although it's small

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.440
no, what did you do

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.260
what are you doing?

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.140
more?

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.300
you misunderstood me

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.360
don't joke about this

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.900
stop!

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.440
thanks everyone

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.100
I'd like to thank you for being here

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.760
and a thank you to those who have supported me

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.260
it's my pleasure to be your biggest supporter

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.260
you're our youth

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.800
I love support
