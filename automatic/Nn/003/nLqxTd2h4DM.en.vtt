game a lot and the moving system in this

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.870 
game a lot and the moving system in this
game<00:01:13.990> is<00:01:14.110> actually<00:01:14.590> really<00:01:14.800> good<00:01:15.100> but<00:01:15.729> you

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
game is actually really good but you

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.090 
game is actually really good but you
need<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.240> master<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.840> it's<00:01:16.960> not<00:01:17.200> as<00:01:17.410> complex<00:01:17.890> as

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
need to master it it's not as complex as

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.529 
need to master it it's not as complex as
advanced<00:01:18.399> warfare<00:01:18.910> but<00:01:19.000> at<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.179> same<00:01:19.330> time

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
advanced warfare but at the same time

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.109 
advanced warfare but at the same time
people<00:01:20.110> still<00:01:20.560> do<00:01:20.830> double<00:01:21.280> jump<00:01:21.550> like<00:01:21.759> it<00:01:21.940> the

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
people still do double jump like it the

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.060 
people still do double jump like it the
way<00:01:22.420> people<00:01:22.450> double<00:01:23.110> jump<00:01:23.290> though<00:01:23.439> is<00:01:23.590> the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
way people double jump though is the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.890 
way people double jump though is the
wall<00:01:24.430> run<00:01:24.729> and<00:01:24.970> then<00:01:25.119> they'll<00:01:25.270> double<00:01:25.509> jump

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
wall run and then they'll double jump

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.749 
wall run and then they'll double jump
over<00:01:26.290> something<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.890> that's<00:01:27.130> when<00:01:27.430> I<00:01:27.460> usually

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
over something and that's when I usually

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.880 
over something and that's when I usually
in<00:01:28.090> cutoff<00:01:28.299> guard<00:01:28.659> is<00:01:28.810> like<00:01:28.840> that<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:29.380> if<00:01:29.680> you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
in cutoff guard is like that so if you

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.710 
in cutoff guard is like that so if you
can<00:01:30.040> use<00:01:30.400> you're<00:01:30.610> moving<00:01:30.909> right<00:01:31.060> on<00:01:31.240> certain

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
can use you're moving right on certain

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.530 
can use you're moving right on certain
walls<00:01:31.900> um<00:01:32.259> you<00:01:33.130> guys<00:01:33.220> may<00:01:33.400> think<00:01:33.430> oh<00:01:33.820> crap<00:01:34.210> wall

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
walls um you guys may think oh crap wall

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.630 
walls um you guys may think oh crap wall
running<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:34.960> know<00:01:35.049> exosuits<00:01:35.710> a<00:01:35.829> lot<00:01:36.159> there's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
running you know exosuits a lot there's

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.249 
running you know exosuits a lot there's
only<00:01:36.790> a<00:01:36.909> couple<00:01:36.939> walls<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.600> people<00:01:37.899> really

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
only a couple walls that people really

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.230 
only a couple walls that people really
do<00:01:38.409> like<00:01:38.619> to<00:01:38.770> wall<00:01:38.950> run<00:01:39.189> and<00:01:39.399> that's<00:01:39.939> where<00:01:40.119> yet

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
do like to wall run and that's where yet

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.880 
do like to wall run and that's where yet
they<00:01:40.390> expect<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:40.960> so<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.229> have<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.350> pre<00:01:41.619> the

they expect it so you have to pre the
walls<00:01:42.220> when<00:01:42.430> they're<00:01:42.549> jumping<00:01:42.850> off<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.270> and

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
walls when they're jumping off of it and

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.569 
walls when they're jumping off of it and
that's<00:01:44.020> how<00:01:44.259> you<00:01:44.439> can<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:44.890> know<00:01:45.040> really<00:01:45.280> catch

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
that's how you can you know really catch

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:46.200 
that's how you can you know really catch
them<00:01:45.729> off-guard

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
them off-guard

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.819 
them off-guard
honestly<00:01:46.450> double<00:01:47.049> jumping<00:01:47.290> is<00:01:47.409> cool<00:01:47.619> and<00:01:47.740> all

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
that stuff but it's really slow so it's

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.389 
that stuff but it's really slow so it's
not<00:01:49.570> as<00:01:49.750> effective<00:01:50.079> but<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.890> can't<00:01:51.159> catch
