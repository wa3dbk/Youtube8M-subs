00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.220

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.220
 the big mistakes in makeup 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.199
 as are many design eyebrows 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.030
 faces of my social networks or my mail 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.220
 you have made me small consultations 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.620
 about your eyebrows as it can be 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.050
 that you do not have a well-defined eyebrow 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.400
 a good eyebrow design you have some 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.530
 capita that you want to cover and you do not know 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.120
 How do you need to know what products 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.620
 you have to use in the video from there 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.449
 let's try to solve all those 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.220
 doubts and then sudden steps and with a 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.280
 only product that you have is there will be 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.420
 know what it is about that galicia 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.860
 like fashion sometimes in the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.929
 trends you have realized that both 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.820
 on the catwalk as in the advertising campaign 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:16.610
 what is worn is a marked eyebrow 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.619
 dense populated super well defined to the 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.630
 leader I'm going to locality of new permit 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.550
 of levels is called bravos to be dyed 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.740
 This designer eyebrows here is an 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.929
 designer of expenses in one because these 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.479
 in one on the one hand they met with the 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.700
 retractable pencil that will help us 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.510
 design the hairs and draw our 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.780
 vega 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.100
 and on the other end we are 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.100
 with a sponge 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.400
 a foam pad is the winter 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.690
 Shade powder product that is 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:54.600
 find where we will get is 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.600
 seal and fix the design 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.330
 and on this day he leaves me to the natural 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.539
 and we started teaching the dangers 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:14.040
 little by little forms of mind 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.040
 up to the eyebrow 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.989
 we will insist quite the way this 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.290
 from here that would be the base area of 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.299
 Eyebrows 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.299
 because it is what defines fame 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.170
 have to go soon after more 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.170
 that this base until you get to the band 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.350
 yes if you want it will help to ventilate more the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.470
 scars that fill an illuminator or 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.180
 a concealer and draw the outline of the 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.180
 eyebrow to live them both 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.909
 here we have already taught and left in 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.450
 descending form from the top from the 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:07.930
 eyebrow arch down 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.930
 all right 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.080
 and that's how you would have treated 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.890
 very much the difference in a simple 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.160
 step with another eyebrow 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.570
 yes 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.570
 we go for the second step 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.800
 the sponge and we won 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.280
 let's apply 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.520
 no no 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.969
 as you can see and touch eyebrows very 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.739
 dark is very dense however you need 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.900
 an eyebrow design needs to be 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.640
 profiled because after applying 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.010
 both the makeup base and the 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.889
 powder looks like the eyebrow where it is 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.380
 washed as dirty and not indefinite 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.329
 I do not notice the look however 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.100
 let me just design it in the 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.990
 mouse to you is defined in a 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.389
 very laminar 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.060
 let's make a second eyebrow with the 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.690
 satin brau satin as always the 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.200
 first step draw the eyebrow and the 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:41.470
 Second seal it with dust 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.470
 to practice 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.750
 anyway and gradually looking at each other 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.330
 to the mirror that was suffering 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.979
 and what 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.539
 it is possible that we are excited jce and 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:03.889
 we want to leave many videos in a way 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:06.600
 natural is a little bit to the robot we go through and 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:10.700
 sometimes questioned makes traces 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.700
 and the design would be 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.030
 all right 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.030
 let's seal the most the old compost 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:40.000
 that would be the shadow dominates a 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.910
 difference from lidia I have to truth 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.970
 used for you to know is the dark 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.220
 brown that environment for brunettes there are two 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.900
 tones plus tone for blondes and the whole 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.210
 for chestnuts two modes the best is 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.550
 much more information in the post of 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.120
