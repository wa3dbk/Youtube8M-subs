00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.970 
not exact yet so a couple of more steps
and<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:30.680> will<00:02:30.860> be<00:02:30.980> dead<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.430> where<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:31.910> need<00:02:32.240> to<00:02:32.390> be

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.430 

that<00:02:36.980> looks<00:02:37.220> pretty<00:02:37.400> good<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.810> now<00:02:38.990> I<00:02:39.140> want<00:02:39.380> to

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
that looks pretty good so now I want to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.110 
that looks pretty good so now I want to
check<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.770> other<00:02:39.860> corners<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.490> I<00:02:40.610> am<00:02:40.760> going<00:02:41.000> to

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
check the other corners so I am going to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.200 
check the other corners so I am going to
go<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.330> step<00:02:41.810> two<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.710> I'm<00:02:43.460> going<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.820> zoom

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
go to step two and I'm going to zoom

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.960 
go to step two and I'm going to zoom
into<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.930> design<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.620> touch<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.880> other

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
into the design and touch the other

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.260 
into the design and touch the other
corner<00:02:47.480> I'll<00:02:48.100> zoom<00:02:49.100> into<00:02:49.340> its<00:02:49.550> icons<00:02:49.940> make

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
corner I'll zoom into its icons make

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.250

sure<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.810> am<00:02:50.960> right<00:02:51.170> on<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.470> corner<00:02:51.740> and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
sure that I am right on the corner and

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.320 
sure that I am right on the corner and
again<00:02:54.370> fine-tune<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:56.660> its<00:02:56.870> position<00:02:57.380> and

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
again fine-tune it to its position and

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.790 
again fine-tune it to its position and
oh<00:02:59.650> dear

can<00:03:03.950> lock<00:03:04.520> that<00:03:04.850> next<00:03:05.180> position<00:03:05.480> which<00:03:05.720> turns

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
can lock that next position which turns

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.860 
can lock that next position which turns
it<00:03:06.290> into<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.530> rotation<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.460> it<00:03:08.360> is<00:03:08.480> going<00:03:08.690> to

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
pivot and I am just going to rotate it

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.640 
pivot and I am just going to rotate it
up<00:03:11.090> slightly<00:03:11.710> until<00:03:12.710> it<00:03:12.980> lines<00:03:13.370> up<00:03:13.640> perfectly
