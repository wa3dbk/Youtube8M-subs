00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.840
 I'm going to start by telling you something very obvious 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.570
 we all had we will get idols 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.340
 but that also implies your idols 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.780
 they also have idols 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.980
 chan chan chan chan chan 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.460

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.860

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.700
 no fictional characters having idols is 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.920
 very exciting fun and the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.510
 frustrating but we all have the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.239
 idol that we have in major or minor 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.239

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.470

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.130
 kilos that squashes shot the Russians 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.229
 we can not stop looking at their 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.090
 photographs or videos that I have all in 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.090
 my room in postulate with points of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.789
 mike the south 2 wow 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:33.060
 liter of air and we investigate all about 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:36.240

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.789
 right table incised is not man 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.469
 I really defend it to layer 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:45.830
 brought to all the words what is 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.230
 your problem 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.660
 we make plans to know them and in 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.060
 Juanita the plan is the following the blond 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.590

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.190
 costumes to make us go through the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.190
 cleaning people 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.720
 everything so retro today we daydream 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.180
 with them we are sure that never 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.910
 you met maradona 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.410

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.800

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:23.330
 number 700 we compete to see what is 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:26.660
 happening and about work and my marianas 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.610
 look there would be a strawberry the signs are 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.980
 referents with which we identify 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.870
 I already know why we want to own some of 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.130
 your qualities or because we already know them 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.320
 and they reflect us 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.280
 in any case they help us to form 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.280
 our personality 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:58.200
 and strawberry 1 doctor strawberry 9.684 or yes 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.720
 they have or had idols the likes 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.060
 video and comment on what your idols are 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.950
 Now I do not have an idol, but I have 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.620
 people that I admire and that inspire me 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.510
 but when a girl loves value and the one that 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.549
 I liked most was this 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.250
 Now I do not understand why after me 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.560
 started to like 20 spies is not no 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.480
 It's sad and I liked it because I was 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.189
