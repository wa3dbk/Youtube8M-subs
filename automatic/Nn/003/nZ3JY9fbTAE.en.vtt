triangle I've also seen them where it's

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.639 
triangle I've also seen them where it's
about<00:02:05.310> right<00:02:05.579> here<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.360> other<00:02:07.020> bikes<00:02:07.320> so

about right here on other bikes so
depending<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> year<00:02:08.580> you're<00:02:08.970> gonna<00:02:09.060> have

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
depending on the year you're gonna have

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.370 
depending on the year you're gonna have
to<00:02:09.330> watch<00:02:09.509> for<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:10.430> so<00:02:11.510> what<00:02:12.510> you'll<00:02:12.720> do<00:02:12.870> is

to watch for that so what you'll do is

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.910 
to watch for that so what you'll do is
you'll<00:02:14.220> rotate<00:02:15.080> your<00:02:16.080> flywheel<00:02:16.410> here<00:02:17.840> until

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
you'll rotate your flywheel here until

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.270 
you'll rotate your flywheel here until
you<00:02:19.920> get<00:02:20.100> see<00:02:20.400> I've<00:02:20.520> rotated<00:02:20.880> 180<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.280> it's

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
you get see I've rotated 180 and it's

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.010 
you get see I've rotated 180 and it's
lined<00:02:23.580> up<00:02:23.850> right<00:02:24.090> there<00:02:26.600> but<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.720> can<00:02:27.840> see

here the circles not lined up and my cam

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.500 
here the circles not lined up and my cam
lobes<00:02:32.750> or<00:02:33.750> both<00:02:34.050> pointed<00:02:34.530> up<00:02:35.060> that's<00:02:36.060> not<00:02:36.270> what

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
lobes or both pointed up that's not what

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.420 
lobes or both pointed up that's not what
you<00:02:36.660> want<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.080> want<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.320> make<00:02:37.440> sure<00:02:37.470> them<00:02:37.890> cam

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
you want you want to make sure them cam

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.850 
you want you want to make sure them cam
lobes<00:02:38.760> are<00:02:38.970> down<00:02:39.210> see<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.320> still<00:02:40.530> moving

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
lobes are down see it's still moving

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.860 
lobes are down see it's still moving
right<00:02:40.980> there<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.850> see<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.120> cam<00:02:42.360> moving<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
right there you see the cam moving the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.530 
right there you see the cam moving the
rocker<00:02:43.080> arm<00:02:43.880> rotating<00:02:44.880> so<00:02:44.970> that's<00:02:45.120> still<00:02:45.420> on

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
rocker arm rotating so that's still on

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.530 
rocker arm rotating so that's still on
the<00:02:45.720> exhaust<00:02:46.050> stroke<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:50.390> when<00:02:51.390> you're

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
the exhaust stroke so when you're

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.280 
the exhaust stroke so when you're
setting<00:02:51.870> your<00:02:51.900> chain<00:02:53.360> look<00:02:54.360> at<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.690> little

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
setting your chain look at this little

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.450 
setting your chain look at this little
circle<00:02:55.800> mark<00:02:55.980> right<00:02:56.250> there<00:02:56.960> and<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.740> T<00:02:58.980> here

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
circle mark right there and the T here

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.310 
circle mark right there and the T here
and<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.850> pull<00:03:00.090> my<00:03:00.240> spark<00:03:00.600> plug<00:03:00.810> out<00:03:00.960> so<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.260> a

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
and I pull my spark plug out so it's a

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.410 
and I pull my spark plug out so it's a
lot<00:03:01.470> easier<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.920> rotate<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:03.270> crank<00:03:03.690> over<00:03:05.420> so

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
lot easier to rotate the crank over so

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.580 
lot easier to rotate the crank over so
the<00:03:06.540> t's<00:03:06.780> lined<00:03:07.170> up<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:09.660> circles<00:03:10.140> lined<00:03:10.350> up

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
the t's lined up the circles lined up

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.970 
the t's lined up the circles lined up
you<00:03:10.710> can<00:03:10.770> tell<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.130> not<00:03:11.250> completely<00:03:12.120> even

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
you can tell it's not completely even

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.690 
you can tell it's not completely even
looking<00:03:13.980> like<00:03:15.380> this<00:03:16.380> engine<00:03:17.160> may<00:03:17.340> need<00:03:17.550> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
looking like this engine may need the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.880 
looking like this engine may need the
timing<00:03:18.240> chain<00:03:18.380> adjusted<00:03:19.380> there<00:03:19.560> might<00:03:19.740> be<00:03:19.770> a

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
timing chain adjusted there might be a

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.700 
timing chain adjusted there might be a
lot<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.160> slack<00:03:20.460> in<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.780> if<00:03:22.170> you're<00:03:22.350> having<00:03:22.590> a

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
lot of slack in it so if you're having a

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.290 
lot of slack in it so if you're having a
lot<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:22.980> trouble<00:03:23.310> trying<00:03:23.490> to<00:03:23.580> get<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:24.030> perfect

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
lot of trouble trying to get it perfect

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.320 
lot of trouble trying to get it perfect
on<00:03:24.690> there<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:26.310> might<00:03:26.490> be<00:03:26.670> about<00:03:26.850> time<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.240> get

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
on there it might be about time to get

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.970 
on there it might be about time to get
that<00:03:27.510> timing<00:03:27.990> chain<00:03:28.260> replaced<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:30.800> I've<00:03:31.800> also

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
that timing chain replaced so I've also

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.480 
that timing chain replaced so I've also
heard<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.340> trick<00:03:32.610> if<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.390> pull<00:03:33.690> your<00:03:34.490> spark

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
heard a trick if you pull your spark

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.110 
heard a trick if you pull your spark
plug<00:03:35.790> out<00:03:36.260> get<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.440> light<00:03:37.740> and<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.790> income

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
plug out get you a light and a income

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.530 
plug out get you a light and a income
will<00:03:39.330> see<00:03:39.570> this<00:03:39.750> but<00:03:41.000> look<00:03:42.000> in<00:03:42.150> there<00:03:42.330> at<00:03:42.450> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
will see this but look in there at the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.790 
will see this but look in there at the
piston<00:03:43.020> and<00:03:43.190> also<00:03:44.190> verify<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:44.850> it's<00:03:45.030> up<00:03:45.330> and

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
piston and also verify that it's up and

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.590 
piston and also verify that it's up and
when<00:03:46.800> you're<00:03:46.950> are<00:03:47.100> at<00:03:47.250> top<00:03:47.460> dead<00:03:47.700> center<00:03:48.090> you

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
when you're are at top dead center you

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.510 
when you're are at top dead center you
should<00:03:48.810> be<00:03:48.930> able<00:03:49.020> to<00:03:49.140> wiggle<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:49.890> crank<00:03:50.250> just

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
should be able to wiggle the crank just

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.450 
should be able to wiggle the crank just
a<00:03:50.670> little<00:03:51.030> bit<00:03:51.180> like<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:53.130> see<00:03:53.340> that

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
a little bit like this and you see that

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.370 
a little bit like this and you see that
piston<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.060> won't<00:03:54.240> move<00:03:54.450> at<00:03:54.660> all<00:03:54.780> that's

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
piston and it won't move at all that's

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.330 
piston and it won't move at all that's
also<00:03:55.830> good<00:03:56.100> indication<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.860> there's<00:03:59.070> a<00:03:59.130> little

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
also good indication so there's a little

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.830 
also good indication so there's a little
quick<00:03:59.580> basic<00:03:59.880> on<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.680> setting<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.740> timing<00:04:02.840> and

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
quick basic on a setting the timing and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.150 
quick basic on a setting the timing and
while<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.050> got<00:04:04.290> this<00:04:04.470> all<00:04:04.650> out<00:04:04.860> I'll<00:04:05.040> go<00:04:05.100> ahead

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
while I got this all out I'll go ahead

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.590 
while I got this all out I'll go ahead
and<00:04:05.400> show<00:04:05.580> you<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:06.000> little<00:04:06.240> bit<00:04:06.330> about

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
and show you a little bit about

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.320 
and show you a little bit about
adjusting<00:04:07.140> your<00:04:07.320> timing<00:04:07.710> chain<00:04:08.270> now<00:04:09.270> to

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
adjusting your timing chain now to

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.590 
adjusting your timing chain now to
adjust<00:04:09.600> your<00:04:09.990> timing<00:04:10.380> chain<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:11.730> have<00:04:11.910> an

adjust your timing chain you have an

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.530 
adjust your timing chain you have an
adjuster<00:04:13.140> right<00:04:13.350> here<00:04:13.740> for<00:04:14.250> more<00:04:14.940> of<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.180> fine

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
adjuster right here for more of the fine

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.880 
adjuster right here for more of the fine
tuning<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:17.010> have<00:04:17.160> an<00:04:17.250> adjuster<00:04:17.760> right<00:04:18.420> here

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
tuning you have an adjuster right here

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.400 
tuning you have an adjuster right here
which<00:04:19.890> you'll<00:04:20.250> start<00:04:20.609> with<00:04:20.820> if<00:04:21.150> it's<00:04:22.049> pretty

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
which you'll start with if it's pretty

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.070 
which you'll start with if it's pretty
bad<00:04:22.850> now

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
bad now

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.900 
bad now
can't<00:04:25.590> really<00:04:25.740> see<00:04:26.039> in<00:04:26.220> there<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:26.789> I've

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
can't really see in there so I've

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.120 
can't really see in there so I've
actually<00:04:27.060> got<00:04:27.300> some<00:04:27.720> of<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.470> chain<00:04:28.800> guides

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
actually got some of the chain guides

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.540 
actually got some of the chain guides
and<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.880> adjuster<00:04:30.449> right<00:04:30.690> here<00:04:31.400> now<00:04:32.400> this

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
and the adjuster right here now this

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.129 
and the adjuster right here now this
little<00:04:32.819> flat<00:04:33.060> one<00:04:33.650> it'll<00:04:34.650> be<00:04:34.680> in<00:04:34.949> here<00:04:35.330> on<00:04:36.330> this

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
little flat one it'll be in here on this

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.159 
little flat one it'll be in here on this
side<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.919> ride<00:04:38.069> that<00:04:38.250> side<00:04:38.580> of<00:04:38.699> the<00:04:38.789> chain<00:04:39.169> and

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
side to ride that side of the chain and

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:47.809 
side to ride that side of the chain and
this<00:04:40.410> one<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:42.150> little<00:04:42.449> screw<00:04:42.810> here<00:04:46.550> is<00:04:47.550> what

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
this one this little screw here is what

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.450 
this one this little screw here is what
you<00:04:47.910> have<00:04:48.120> right<00:04:48.720> here<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.319> this<00:04:50.009> works<00:04:50.250> as<00:04:50.430> a

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
you have right here and this works as a

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.020 
you have right here and this works as a
little<00:04:50.699> locking<00:04:51.120> mechanism<00:04:51.690> for<00:04:51.930> it<00:04:52.639> and<00:04:53.639> you

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
little locking mechanism for it and you

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.430 
little locking mechanism for it and you
see<00:04:54.270> this<00:04:54.419> rod<00:04:54.780> here<00:04:55.520> spring-loaded<00:04:57.020> so<00:04:58.020> if

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
see this rod here spring-loaded so if

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.040 
see this rod here spring-loaded so if
you're<00:04:58.710> if<00:04:59.280> you<00:04:59.479> loosen<00:05:00.479> up<00:05:00.599> this<00:05:00.750> 10

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
you're if you loosen up this 10

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.640 
you're if you loosen up this 10
millimeter<00:05:01.530> here<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.970> can<00:05:03.150> rotate<00:05:03.389> this<00:05:04.169> and

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
millimeter here you can rotate this and

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.100 
millimeter here you can rotate this and
what<00:05:05.130> this<00:05:05.310> will<00:05:05.490> do<00:05:05.639> it<00:05:05.789> will<00:05:05.900> push<00:05:06.900> your

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
what this will do it will push your

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.140 
what this will do it will push your
chain<00:05:07.409> or<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.830> tensioner<00:05:08.400> closer<00:05:08.819> to<00:05:09.060> the

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
chain or the tensioner closer to the

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.330 
chain or the tensioner closer to the
chain<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:10.259> reduce<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.889> chatter<00:05:11.159> and

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
chain to reduce the chatter and

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.010 
chain to reduce the chatter and
everything<00:05:11.990> so<00:05:13.370> if<00:05:14.370> you<00:05:14.580> rotate<00:05:15.030> this<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.630> you

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
everything so if you rotate this and you

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.050 
everything so if you rotate this and you
aren't<00:05:16.259> getting<00:05:16.380> anything<00:05:16.759> go<00:05:17.759> ahead<00:05:17.940> and

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
aren't getting anything go ahead and

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.149 
aren't getting anything go ahead and
tighten<00:05:18.449> it<00:05:18.569> up<00:05:20.180> go<00:05:21.180> ahead<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:21.830> loosen<00:05:22.830> up

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
tighten it up go ahead and loosen up

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:27.140 
tighten it up go ahead and loosen up
this<00:05:23.370> 12<00:05:24.180> right<00:05:24.509> here<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:25.340> you'll<00:05:26.340> back<00:05:26.880> out

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
this 12 right here and you'll back out

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.749 
this 12 right here and you'll back out
this<00:05:27.360> flathead<00:05:27.990> what<00:05:28.979> that<00:05:29.159> does<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.610> has<00:05:29.729> a

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759
