00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:03.750
 Dr 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.750
 earlier 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:11.329
 well 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.009
 So we're going to take German history live to next year 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.900
 Experience that you arrive at their big Trabbi meeting 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.390
 The Travis have come here to Hagen am Teutoburger Wald 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.490
 because we are celebrating an anniversary this year, which is exactly the same 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.820
 he did not know exactly 20 years ago has been the end of production of the day 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.069
 there are today great models arrived here 

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:46.100
 a working one 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.639
 Percent the police drove them back then 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:51.800
 the Trabi in that for executions they gave back then 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.239
 So pretending from the body are bandage as a sedan 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.890
 and as a combination there was for the army and for the police there was still the 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.240
 Version is a demonstration car 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.240
 which was later also offered as jam 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.899
 but unfortunately no 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.120
 just for export so thought 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.720
 domestic use of the GDR, this vehicle was not to get one 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.510
 "He's got Super Trabelsi top in here, we want to get out of here 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.610
 look at the closest proximity 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.060
 now we enjoy the interior of Trabi Walter more 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.700
 Legroom as I thought 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.960
 and critical attitude 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.820
 There were any special extras you could order at 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.329
 There were extras years ago 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.930
 But there are also different equipment variants of 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 a normal sex and a standard 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.100
 These are buzz used by sex hotlines 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.740
 the deal is that was the so to speak 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.179
 a special or the dome equipment 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.700
 the contents over a heated rear window 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.700
 what Grumbach just about drum board from the back 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.500
 over fog lights 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.340
 to write posts because 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.080
 especially extreme also for the heating 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.909
 percent 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.140
 the users should show 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.560
 Turn up the heater Speed ​​Guild Deiss very simple set up 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.610
 you only have three 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.220
 those you can imagine as you can on the one hand the cold air 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.229
 Fresh air intake rules 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.739
 Here is regulated whether the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.529
 Air should be directed upwards or downwards 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.220
 and here once the heating is switched on 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.909
 switched off again 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.659
 You can see them here once again the fuel cock 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.609
 opened normally with two positions 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.609
 and once fuel for the candidate thanks 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.679
 Well live processor install in a car because it is so easy 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.069
 that is what fascinates many of us 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.429
 This is one of the simplest vehicles you can handle 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.549
 little background knowledge itself the more expensive storyline respectively 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:42.889
 can repair 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.249
 if you have to work there and have a bit of a car 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.169
 employed 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.609
 that explains itself a lot by itself as I said a very simple technique 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.269
 for everyone to understand 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.010
 at least as unmistakable as the mantra feels the ISV agree 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.609
 I'm sure that you're a Ronny to each other 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:01.210
 recognize 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.580
 but very understandable Trawick long that is unique that there is no such 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.370
 second time 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.999
 yes we want Andy Murray 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.999
 Peter Züll for us now his Trabi 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.499
 The big crawl was Horse's are never going to have to target this 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.499
 they look more beautiful than the police allowed 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.790
 therefore near Hasbergen 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:49.719
 Hanover 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.719
 H 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.129
 Hanover
