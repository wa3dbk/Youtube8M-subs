extremely surprised that thief is on the
list<00:03:44.370> here<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.850> guess<00:03:45.180> because<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.570> ps3<00:03:45.959> is

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
list here I guess because the ps3 is

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.660 
list here I guess because the ps3 is
kind<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.260> phasing<00:03:46.620> out<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.190> ps4<00:03:47.430> is

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
kind of phasing out and the ps4 is

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.220 
kind of phasing out and the ps4 is
taking<00:03:47.910> over<00:03:48.000> they<00:03:48.180> can<00:03:48.300> release<00:03:48.540> manure<00:03:48.930> and

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
taking over they can release manure and

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.020 
taking over they can release manure and
higher<00:03:49.470> profile<00:03:49.830> titles<00:03:50.250> without<00:03:50.370> taking<00:03:50.910> too

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
higher profile titles without taking too

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.180 
higher profile titles without taking too
much<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.330> hit<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:52.170> know<00:03:52.260> game<00:03:52.590> sales<00:03:52.860> so
