 today it fell pedagogue são paulo and it is for 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.029
 thing I thought was that it's the 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.880
 time began that I found 45 pm 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:26.109
 because the time of the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:34.540
 datena datena has pact with são pedro 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:35.800

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.350
 reach the winners 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.060
 Then I thought I'd start with the joke I 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.400
 I already have a guarantee for exchange that I speak 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.390
 If you always left today started at 4 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.730
 afternoon hours 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.590
 because worse than the datena program 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.600
 land tried to overcome the franchise arrives 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.030
 I live there but you have to take 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.230
 Be careful because where are you going to make a joke? 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.820
 now it 's the same 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.910
 he says that the datena goes after 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.940
 tragedy then she speaks risk match to 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.560
 Ithaca was for novel I've been that 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.230
 second one is a bad one, the first one 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.820
 The second protein defect by rainfall is 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.050
 that history similar to that pee 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.000
 He thought of that, right? 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.650
 I was thinking how much rain it is. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.280
 hail 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:20.370
 Is this when you're taking him? 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.370
 Nope, I had gonorrhea, right? 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.009
 raises taking and tacuru is another thing 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.899
 also it rained away and the right port 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.060
 I want to see in the car tv koubek cup 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.979
 poisonous talk now doing in 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.200
 portugal now makes the idea is for this 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:43.939
 that was all covered lane has problem 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:49.429
 I'm still gal, it's better to talk one 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:51.049
 piauí in portugal is portuguese and donkeys 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.909
 hey there the cat and I have to have 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.159
 established before someone is stupid, right? 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:01.340
 at the time of goodbye to the dispute at the time of 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.470
 to research the actual origin of rain rain 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.500
 precipitation that is due to the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.989
 condensation is from the water being gaseous 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.769
 in the clouds will start from public spending 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.500
 huh 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.630
 I was left wondering if condensation is 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.810
 gaseous state for the liquid then milk 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.690
 condensed comes from the pedro da vaca ne 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.090
 the gas that the traffic lights are paulo 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.299
 sloshing wet or spoils it right 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.480
 the rain impacts if you take all 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.780
 the natural disasters that exist 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.600
 extinct more light to think flood 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.400
 temporal cyclone hurricane that name 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.140
 earthquake there is more light flood 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.670
 do you agree that God sends the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.769
 earthquake in japan because they know 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.230
 caring understood if sending it here was 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.079
 My father has no side, I find a guy. 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.660
 came the rain it seemed rainy face it came 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.180
 The rain that fell on the third one I wanted 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.130
 turn joke on as they arise the 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.840
 umbrella he has an error of 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.470
 rain umbrella design 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.900
 because you only see the umbrella handle 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.569
 it occupies the best umbrella area 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.340
 which is the medium 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:11.569
 the umbrella handle went through the tip 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.730
 for us to stay in the middle after the car 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:18.049
 stay there I'm fucking your soft hair does not 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.730
 is switched on to design 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.100
 radio benefited by rain 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.079
 while a rain largest transit 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.540
 what was the name of the 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.639
 radio 6 o'clock because it's time for the elo tent 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.769
 It will rain, it will get transit attended. 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.199
 everything connected to these other person stop 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.549
 who likes to rain the drunk driver is 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.620
 Good because it 's the shower because when 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.950
 Rain does not have blitz. 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:44.750
 That's why it's called dry law and it's not 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:48.049
 Culture right culture 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.640
 rain in the capital also I think it has 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.290
 that develops when the rain is 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.010
 that I speak earlier in the world can 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.870
 get there 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.260
 a theory of today none of the guards 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.420
 rain anywhere on the canopy all 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.370
 what was well celebrates the variation is 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.470
 accompanied by other just protect 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.900
 My jokes like this case of the penalty that 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.379
 they will only be worth the law even knew it was 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.160
 good 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:13.250
 the hail rain struck now she goes 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.709
 providing that journey works as 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.690
 apifarma not the fact is that it combines the 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.690
 condensate and tail condensation 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:25.419
 Cow airport runway covered 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.419
 surprised place otto upgrade 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.740
 This is where I do the most beautiful is the 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.750
 mental map so I decide at home 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.690
 I already wanted to use it because the rain is the block 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.990
 rain here and I'm actually doing it 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.780
 I hope to be made paper is that paper is the 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.580
 brain it uses a way of thinking 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.920
 that it is not linear 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.200
 the brain thinks it south all sides 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.260
 on paper you tend to get much better 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.390
 to write down from the bastille is very 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.030
 There you are this cool way because you 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.750
 exploring ideas for all 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.750
 sides understood
