00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.310
 hello everybody it's ibis cooked 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.130
 welcome everyone on our new 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.329
 chain game lull welcome welcome 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.280
 so for my first solo video I 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.100
 will you do a little by little 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.920
 xbox gameplay on 60 of a game that 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.860
 I love I think a lot of people 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.410
 loved this little game it's rayman the 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:52.090
 young on xbox or 60 by the way that is 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.690
 the second of the name because the first one had 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:00.960
 very well marketed and this one is out 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:05.019
 August 29, a game from ubisoft 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.470
 as we can like many people the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:12.189
 know 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.960
 and for me it's the game for me one of 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.850
 best platform games of this 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.700
 year 2013 whether to choose a single 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.240
 for me will hold because there is 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.759
 such diversity in the gameplay by 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.409
 example to judge you a solo part and 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.609
 all at the Iron Age will we go to see him 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.929
 I played a game with a person 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:33.280
 with a second player and you go 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.729
 see the difference in gameplay is enough 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.380
 quite bluffing in the party the party 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.770
 those as you see it's a world 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.770
 rained 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.479
 of this breakfast lunch by 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.539
 example with sausage apples 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.090
 some noise fish bones 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.380
 borderline imports the door nawak its 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.530
 ranks what represents the world the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.020
 worlds of 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.840
 rayman on one side we can have a 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.140
 world with with works of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.049
 knights on one side the grace of 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.850
 cakes there really is a difference of 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.560
 world of variations in the mountains when 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.420
 that every time we start 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.790
 level we do not even know we do not know 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.640
 everything that will happen 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.530
 so that's really what I really 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.630
 loved 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.900
 so here we will do we are in the small 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.270
 world of lunches 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.950
 I like it is that if we have a little 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.350
 complicated by the way in general the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.410
 talk well and one of them yesterday that 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.790
 climbs crescendo and we feel sometimes 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.110
 is obliged to start over a certain 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.550
 number several times and despite that 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.500
 it's a game that I would advise 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:52.470
 small stinks and it bit and it'll love 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.310
 it's going to make vegetables love hours a 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:00.060
 more experienced 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:04.400
 so there we go no more donna in the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:09.299
 miser to also he was judged rama hand 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.890
 attention here is the late at sion where 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.549
 he will fall he will fall and fall 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.510
 he see there he will fall and the cod 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.200
 true I'm losing a little bit I'm a little 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.410
 whatever 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.390
 I had a perfect run on this course 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.230
 and just when jean just video 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.269
 it was completely I missed 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.870
 a few times so I apologize for advanced 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.390
 so you'll see after I think that 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.480
 just after that one I'll do a 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:42.140
 video to 2 in a world a little weird 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.250
 cube shaped like that and I had 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.720
 it made me think of some people 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.220
 movies like horror movies by 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.590
 example I pass if you do 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.739
 remember the Cuban film can we are and 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.930
 we people got stuck in the year 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.209
 it's in a geometrical shape a little 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.730
 a little with traps and knew it 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.599
 alas I think I have the impression that the 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.269
 guys from ubisoft 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.930
 they were inspired by this film 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:09.110
 so when I told you we're already going 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:13.190
 already die here are the people place I 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.569
 am two with a friend of mine whose 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.389
 world and for me 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.370
 to two we could all alone 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.859
 that we can do 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.870
 first shot but must know that they have 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.440
 played we play we play the first clean 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.600
 franson and it asked quite a lot 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.120
 of 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.920
 a little moment of adaptation because 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.690
 it was as you see it was very 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.530
 complicated you have to go up 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.270
 go down there are traps everywhere 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.610
 it was really very difficult to 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.810
 manage 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:53.470
 you see there is a person who does not 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:55.030
 does nothing they plane is really 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.160
 well it's really very complicated when 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:03.310
 you really have to have some 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:08.860
 dexterity in the sense of placement enough 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:11.820
 extraordinary then there you see there d 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.390
 a person who would control man 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:19.700
 and art game and if the second the second 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:25.760
 character is touched we start over again 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:28.770
 the part and we have to type 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.720
 here I have deliberated the little beasts and 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:35.220
 you have to tap your team mate 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.590
 pau who come back into play and you 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.540
 can do the level like that between 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:46.710
 a vincent not helping your friend 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:48.720
 but hey that's not very good so 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.190
 here was there was a lot a lot 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.690
 many times with tables 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.370
 almost in every level more or 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.670
 least there are races chases with 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.260
 flames of dragons to everyone 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.170
 which you pursue you pursue 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.760
 always almost always 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.170
 thing 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.190
 speed trials like that 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:17.610
 we will get caught 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:21.150
 so start to like them our 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.540
 colleagues he left is that he has 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.100
 lost 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:27.360
 attention it's really complicated it's 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.250
 when you see that really requires 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.450
 some time of adaptation 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.180
 the first levels as I said 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.620
 just now are rather simple after 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:42.000
 his request 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:44.190
 really really discussed the world the 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.710
 Belgian is over it was complicated 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:50.820
 did not do it the first time I play there 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.590
 you are is to get to it I apologize 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.500
 did not make the high score big enough 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.639
 naughty that's pitiful 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:00.270
 but it was not really showing you 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:02.760
 there the dike has cited levels and even 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.220
 but I did not show everything because at 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.249
 really quite a lot of things to 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.709
 valence rayman will make others 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:13.500
 fresh other videos to show you 

00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:16.380
 the world and 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:20.130
 of this beautiful of this beautiful game made in France 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:22.530
 frankly hobby hat except for this 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:25.530
 little gem that will do a lot 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.060
 happy in this end period 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.060
 of year to a purchased game 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.280
 I will give it months to me I am 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.990
 not attested professional mayor if he 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.810
 had to give a note to this game I him 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:40.290
 would give to the east 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.740
 18 out of 20 so here is the video going to get 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.360
 finish
