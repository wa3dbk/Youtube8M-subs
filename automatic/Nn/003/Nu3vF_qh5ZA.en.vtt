00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.940

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.240
 images 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.209
 the desired module for the sound project in the 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.770
 your thumbnail 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:22.470
 after being lowered 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:27.700
 open it and select the print option 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:32.770
 then you will select the sheet option 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:35.410
 of contacts time ready 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.010
 why there is this option that will 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.519
 do better or what will be going out with 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.579
 size closest to me going out there and 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.410
 when printing use to say sheet 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.839
 I will not end 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.539
 you will not need to use glue 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:01:04.120
 paste the way there you just be here already 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:01:08.520
 the adhesive is then usually takes the 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.520
 scissor and record that the module 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.900
 now take a notebook cover 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.400
 put a way up there you will use 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.870
 a pen to scratch around the module 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.230
 After we're done, everything's over. 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.530
 there you will remember the part scratched with 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:46.590
 the pen cut the part you risk on 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:51.990
 around the module with the pen now. 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.800
 Use the pilot pen to paint the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.410
 module 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.369
 then you will use the pilot pen to 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.810
 paint around the module from black to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:09.600
 getting a more detailed business understood 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:14.130
 detail is important you will get a 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:17.490
 mobile we'll highlight him there after that 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.320
 pick it up on the notebook cover you already 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.320
 cut is ready 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.660
