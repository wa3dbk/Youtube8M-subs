this<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.199> just<00:00:01.350> going<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.589> be<00:00:01.709> a<00:00:01.740> quick<00:00:01.979> review

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
this is just going to be a quick review

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.849 
this is just going to be a quick review
Casio<00:00:03.000> Pathfinder<00:00:03.810> PW<00:00:04.770> 1500<00:00:05.700> T<00:00:05.879> -<00:00:06.210> 7<00:00:06.600> V<00:00:06.859> it's

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
Casio Pathfinder PW 1500 T - 7 V it's

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.060 
Casio Pathfinder PW 1500 T - 7 V it's
the<00:00:08.189> titanium<00:00:08.940> version<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.420> 1500<00:00:12.230> and<00:00:13.230> yes

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
the titanium version of the 1500 and yes

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.090 
the titanium version of the 1500 and yes
I'll<00:00:14.340> just<00:00:14.490> do<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.639> quick<00:00:14.820> little<00:00:16.100> walk-around

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
I'll just do a quick little walk-around

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.730 
I'll just do a quick little walk-around
of<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> watch<00:00:17.930> so<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.109> front<00:00:19.320> you'll<00:00:19.590> have

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
of the watch so on the front you'll have

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.839 
of the watch so on the front you'll have
the<00:00:19.980> obviously<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.850> time<00:00:22.039> rotating<00:00:23.039> bezel

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
the obviously the time rotating bezel

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.670 
the obviously the time rotating bezel
this<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.269> cursory<00:00:28.019> calls<00:00:28.199> their<00:00:28.410> triple

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
this is the cursory calls their triple

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.460 
this is the cursory calls their triple
sensor<00:00:29.010> or<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.789> ABC<00:00:30.390> function<00:00:31.019> which<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
sensor or the ABC function which is the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.060 
sensor or the ABC function which is the
altimeter<00:00:32.279> barometer<00:00:33.020> compass<00:00:34.880> as<00:00:35.880> atomic

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
altimeter barometer compass as atomic

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.240 
altimeter barometer compass as atomic
timekeeping<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:40.250> atomic

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
timekeeping so this is the atomic

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.400 
timekeeping so this is the atomic
timekeeping<00:00:41.969> sensor<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.840> receives<00:00:43.200> radio

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
timekeeping sensor it receives radio

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.910 
timekeeping sensor it receives radio
signals<00:00:44.040> from<00:00:46.160> various<00:00:48.289> atomic<00:00:49.289> clocks<00:00:49.710> and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
signals from various atomic clocks and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.639 
signals from various atomic clocks and
one<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> US<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> couple<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.840> Europe<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.410> one

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
one in the US a couple in Europe and one

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.990 
one in the US a couple in Europe and one
in<00:00:52.739> Japan<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> believe<00:00:54.860> this<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.579> adjust

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
in Japan I believe this is the adjust

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.189 
in Japan I believe this is the adjust
button<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.719> light<00:00:57.930> button<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.649> mode<00:01:00.199> will

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
button the light button and mode will

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.599 
button the light button and mode will
just<00:01:01.559> joke<00:01:01.770> through<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> different<00:01:02.489> modes

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
just joke through the different modes

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.630 
just joke through the different modes
with<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> tight<00:01:03.510> graph<00:01:04.760> timer<00:01:06.320> stopwatch<00:01:07.640> world

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
with a tight graph timer stopwatch world

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.310 
with a tight graph timer stopwatch world
time<00:01:09.170> alarms<00:01:10.580> recorded<00:01:13.250> information<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
time alarms recorded information and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.080 
time alarms recorded information and
this<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> receive<00:01:16.950> function<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
this is the receive function of the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.740 
this is the receive function of the
atomic<00:01:18.420> clock<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.820> titanium<00:01:21.180> handles

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
atomic clock this is a titanium handles

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.570 
atomic clock this is a titanium handles
that<00:01:22.380> sorry<00:01:22.740> titanium<00:01:23.189> band<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:26.490> this

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
that sorry titanium band and then this

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.260 
that sorry titanium band and then this
is<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:27.060> pretty<00:01:27.150> cool<00:01:27.860> latch<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.670> most

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
is it's pretty cool latch so most

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
is it's pretty cool latch so most
watches<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.439> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
watches if you do that you know that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
watches if you do that you know that
opens<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> watch<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.420> made

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
opens the watch but because this is made

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200 
opens the watch but because this is made
for<00:01:33.920> sort<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.009> outdoors<00:01:35.490> an<00:01:35.729> adventurer

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
for sort of the outdoors an adventurer

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.819 
for sort of the outdoors an adventurer
they<00:01:36.630> decided<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.320> secondary<00:01:38.159> class<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:40.770> you

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
they decided a secondary class so you

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.910 
they decided a secondary class so you
don't<00:01:41.070> open<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.630> drop<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> watch<00:01:43.649> down

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
don't open it up and drop the watch down

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.950 
don't open it up and drop the watch down
its<00:01:44.280> waterfall<00:01:45.180> or<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.659> mountain<00:01:46.560> order<00:01:47.960> so

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
its waterfall or a mountain order so

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.359 
its waterfall or a mountain order so
yeah<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:51.000> inside<00:01:51.930> logo<00:01:52.649> it'll<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.250> say

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
yeah the inside logo it'll just say

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.469 
yeah the inside logo it'll just say
Pathfinder<00:01:54.119> 1,500<00:01:55.969> 200<00:01:56.969> meter<00:01:57.149> water

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
Pathfinder 1,500 200 meter water

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.889 
Pathfinder 1,500 200 meter water
resistance<00:01:58.079> which<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.469> good<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.430> diving<00:01:59.899> but

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
resistance which is good for diving but

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.319 
resistance which is good for diving but
if<00:02:01.799> you're<00:02:01.950> gonna<00:02:02.040> be<00:02:02.130> taking<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.939> know<00:02:03.000> salt

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
if you're gonna be taking you know salt

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.910 
if you're gonna be taking you know salt
water<00:02:03.540> diving<00:02:03.780> make<00:02:04.049> sure<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.409> do<00:02:04.530> rinse<00:02:04.770> it

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
water diving make sure you do rinse it

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.889 
water diving make sure you do rinse it
out<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.280> fresh<00:02:05.700> water<00:02:05.909> afterwards<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.750> let

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
out with fresh water afterwards and let

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.830 
out with fresh water afterwards and let
it<00:02:07.049> dry<00:02:07.259> properly<00:02:07.829> otherwise<00:02:08.660> even<00:02:09.660> though<00:02:09.750> it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
it dry properly otherwise even though it

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.820 
it dry properly otherwise even though it
is<00:02:09.899> titanium<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.520 

so<00:02:13.830> yeah<00:02:14.130> that's<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.550> that's<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:16.230> overall

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
so yeah that's just that's the overall

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.680 
so yeah that's just that's the overall
functions<00:02:17.930> it's<00:02:18.930> also<00:02:19.550> solar-powered<00:02:20.690> which

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
functions it's also solar-powered which

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.199 
functions it's also solar-powered which
on<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> single<00:02:22.440> full<00:02:23.220> charge<00:02:23.550> will<00:02:23.790> last<00:02:23.819> about

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
on a single full charge will last about

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.990 
on a single full charge will last about
five<00:02:24.569> months<00:02:25.430> with<00:02:26.430> basic<00:02:27.150> use<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.790> yeah<00:02:29.880> let

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
five months with basic use so yeah let

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.350 
five months with basic use so yeah let
me<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.120> go<00:02:30.330> through<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.690> triple<00:02:31.020> sensors<00:02:31.410> so

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
me just go through the triple sensors so

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.760 
me just go through the triple sensors so
this<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.600> old<00:02:33.750> timid<00:02:34.440> edge<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.709> just

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
this is the old timid edge you just

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.110 
this is the old timid edge you just
press<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.610> big<00:02:35.760> button

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
press the big button

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.140 
press the big button
this<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.260> altimeter<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.160> tells<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.520> you

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
this is altimeter and it tells you you

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.990 
this is altimeter and it tells you you
know<00:02:39.239> where<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.600> are<00:02:40.700> your<00:02:41.700> altitude

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
know where you are your altitude

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.610 
know where you are your altitude
relative<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.600> sea<00:02:42.750> level<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.110> right<00:02:43.350> now<00:02:43.470> we're

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
relative to sea level so right now we're

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.050 
relative to sea level so right now we're
five<00:02:43.860> meters<00:02:44.250> above<00:02:44.430> sea<00:02:44.489> level<00:02:44.720> which<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.870> a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
five meters above sea level which is a

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.940 
five meters above sea level which is a
fairly<00:02:48.060> accurate<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.780> all<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.709> way<00:02:49.769> on<00:02:49.920> a

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
fairly accurate and all the way on a

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.580 
fairly accurate and all the way on a
side<00:02:50.220> note<00:02:50.420> Casio<00:02:51.420> does<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.930> know<00:02:52.019> say<00:02:52.290> that

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
side note Casio does you know say that

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.979 
side note Casio does you know say that
this<00:02:53.400> isn't<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.760> precision<00:02:54.209> instrument<00:02:54.450> so

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
this isn't a precision instrument so

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.500 
this isn't a precision instrument so
whatever<00:02:56.090> measurements<00:02:57.090> are<00:02:57.180> going<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.420> be

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
whatever measurements are going to be

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.620 
whatever measurements are going to be
calculating<00:02:58.470> or<00:02:58.590> very<00:02:59.160> finding<00:02:59.519> out<00:02:59.640> do<00:03:00.480> not

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
calculating or very finding out do not

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.210 
calculating or very finding out do not
think<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.200> as<00:03:02.090> an<00:03:03.290> accurate<00:03:04.290> measure<00:03:04.680> it's

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
think of it as an accurate measure it's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.030 
think of it as an accurate measure it's
just<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.519> rough<00:03:05.760> estimate<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:07.170> shouldn't<00:03:07.980> be

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
just a rough estimate and shouldn't be

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.800 
just a rough estimate and shouldn't be
used<00:03:08.280> or<00:03:08.610> considered<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.330> precision

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
used or considered a precision

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.100 
used or considered a precision
instrument<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:12.239> go<00:03:12.360> back<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.780> main<00:03:12.930> menu

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
instrument to go back to the main menu

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.250 
instrument to go back to the main menu
press<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.530> mode<00:03:13.769> button<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.870> second

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
press the mode button the second

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.340 
press the mode button the second
function<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.549> barometer<00:03:21.320> displays<00:03:22.320> a

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
function is the barometer displays a

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.550 
function is the barometer displays a
graph<00:03:22.829> on<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.160> top<00:03:23.400> here<00:03:24.110> barometric<00:03:25.110> graph

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
graph on the top here barometric graph

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.590 
graph on the top here barometric graph
and<00:03:25.829> then<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.549> reads<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.970> out<00:03:27.090> at<00:03:27.239> hectopascal

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
and then it reads it out at hectopascal

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.759 
and then it reads it out at hectopascal
so<00:03:28.290> right<00:03:28.470> now<00:03:28.590> it's<00:03:29.269> 1013<00:03:30.269> hecto<00:03:30.600> Pascal's<00:03:30.989> at

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
so right now it's 1013 hecto Pascal's at

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.080 
so right now it's 1013 hecto Pascal's at
about<00:03:32.010> twenty<00:03:32.280> eight<00:03:32.310> point<00:03:32.519> nine<00:03:32.640> degrees

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
about twenty eight point nine degrees

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.660 
about twenty eight point nine degrees
which<00:03:33.360> is<00:03:33.390> fairly<00:03:34.019> accurate<00:03:34.230> my<00:03:35.070> B<00:03:35.220> will<00:03:35.430> warn

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
which is fairly accurate my B will warn

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.280 
which is fairly accurate my B will warn
because<00:03:35.970> I'm<00:03:36.150> I've<00:03:36.510> been<00:03:36.690> holding<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.110> watch

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290

screen<00:03:40.739> press<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.370> mode<00:03:41.670> button<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:43.280> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
screen press the mode button and the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.440 
screen press the mode button and the
last<00:03:44.519> function<00:03:44.790> up<00:03:45.150> here<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.720> compass

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
last function up here is the compass

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.850 
last function up here is the compass
just<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.630> regular<00:03:48.989> compass<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.500> again<00:03:49.709> it's

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
just a regular compass and again it's

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.069 
just a regular compass and again it's
not<00:03:50.070> on<00:03:50.370> percent<00:03:50.760> accurate<00:03:51.090> but<00:03:51.329> it<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.049> a

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
not on percent accurate but it is a

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.380 
not on percent accurate but it is a
rough<00:03:52.350> estimate<00:03:52.470> if<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.760> know<00:03:53.850> where<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.360> are

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
rough estimate if you know where you are

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.190 
rough estimate if you know where you are
and<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.440> just<00:03:55.560> shows<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:55.980> degrees<00:03:56.340> and

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
and it just shows you the degrees and

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.850 
and it just shows you the degrees and
yeah<00:03:58.220> so<00:03:59.220> back<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.700> mode<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.620> what<00:04:01.620> you'll<00:04:01.769> see

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
yeah so back to mode and what you'll see

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.580 
yeah so back to mode and what you'll see
on<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.220> bottom<00:04:02.400> here<00:04:02.579> that's<00:04:02.910> just<00:04:03.209> sort<00:04:03.510> of

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
on the bottom here that's just sort of

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.250 
on the bottom here that's just sort of
jogging<00:04:04.590> around<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:07.350> tight<00:04:07.950> graph<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:09.260> it

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
jogging around is the tight graph so it

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.140 
jogging around is the tight graph so it
just<00:04:10.560> takes<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.250> while<00:04:11.400> for<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.760> set<00:04:11.970> so

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
just takes a while for it to set so

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.300 
just takes a while for it to set so
right<00:04:12.299> now<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.510> see<00:04:12.630> to<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.079> low<00:04:13.260> tide<00:04:13.530> the

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
right now you see to the low tide the

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.759 
right now you see to the low tide the
approaching<00:04:14.760> high<00:04:15.829> is<00:04:17.780> basically<00:04:18.780> fuel<00:04:19.500> more

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
approaching high is basically fuel more

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.590 
approaching high is basically fuel more
information<00:04:20.190> obviously<00:04:20.580> read<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.880> manual

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600
