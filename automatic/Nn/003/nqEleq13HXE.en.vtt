-<00:00:27.120> on<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.360> backside<00:00:27.810> as<00:00:27.960> well<00:00:28.700> push<00:00:29.700> that<00:00:29.910> clip

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
- on the backside as well push that clip

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.240 
- on the backside as well push that clip
in<00:00:30.360> there<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.780> that<00:00:30.870> red<00:00:31.050> piece<00:00:31.230> pull<00:00:32.100> this

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
in there and that red piece pull this

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.150 
in there and that red piece pull this
off<00:00:33.200> without<00:00:34.200> cover<00:00:34.650> then<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:34.890> got<00:00:34.980> eight

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
off without cover then we got eight

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.650 
off without cover then we got eight
millimeter<00:00:35.580> bolts<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.320> goes<00:00:37.320> off<00:00:38.600> maybe<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
millimeter bolts here goes off maybe a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.360 
millimeter bolts here goes off maybe a
10<00:00:39.870> millimeter<00:00:40.110> bolt<00:00:40.500> actually<00:00:40.710> back<00:00:41.070> there

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
10 millimeter bolt actually back there

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:52.209 
10 millimeter bolt actually back there
for<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.700> ground<00:00:42.000> wire

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:14.920 

Korver<00:00:52.910> interaction<00:00:53.480> at<00:00:53.629> 10<00:00:53.809> millimeter

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.810 

you<00:01:15.930> take<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.289> coil<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.579> there's<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
you take the coil off because there's a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.380 
you take the coil off because there's a
millimeter<00:01:18.509> bolt<00:01:18.750> back<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.390> there's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
millimeter bolt back there so there's

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.109 
millimeter bolt back there so there's
our<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> round<00:01:23.429> wire<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:23.909> ten

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
our like a round wire there ten

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.510 
our like a round wire there ten
millimeter<00:01:25.039> so<00:01:26.039> I'll<00:01:26.100> take<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> 10

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
millimeter so I'll take the 10

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.249 
millimeter so I'll take the 10
millimeter<00:01:26.850> bolt<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.689> then<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> eight

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
millimeter bolt out and then the eight

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.240 
millimeter bolt out and then the eight
millimeters<00:01:29.960> in<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:30.990> back<00:01:31.319> I'm<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:31.950> see

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
millimeters in the back I'm gonna see

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.740 
millimeters in the back I'm gonna see
where<00:01:32.369> these<00:01:32.490> notches<00:01:33.149> are<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.299> those<00:01:36.450> out

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
where these notches are so get those out

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
where these notches are so get those out
and<00:01:37.049> we'll<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.649> booking<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.039> valve<00:01:38.250> cover

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
and we'll see booking the valve cover

00:01:38.520 --> 00:03:04.610 
and we'll see booking the valve cover
out

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.650 

we<00:03:04.800> got<00:03:04.950> three<00:03:05.640> volts<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.090> bolts<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.569> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
we got three volts and bolts in the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:37.270 
we got three volts and bolts in the
valley<00:03:06.870> to

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:50.020 

their<00:03:38.030> screwdriver<00:03:38.480> pry<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.810> up<00:03:48.940> she'll<00:03:49.940> be

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
their screwdriver pry it up she'll be

00:03:50.030 --> 00:04:10.339 
their screwdriver pry it up she'll be
able<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.180> wheel<00:03:50.360> it<00:03:50.540> out<00:03:50.570> of<00:03:50.810> here

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.380 

so<00:04:11.349> there<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.590> go<00:04:11.739> were<00:04:11.980> removed<00:04:12.879> by<00:04:13.060> valve

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
so there you go were removed by valve

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.819 
so there you go were removed by valve
