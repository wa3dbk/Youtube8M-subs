staging<00:02:42.470> yard<00:02:44.170> excuse<00:02:45.170> me<00:02:46.480> okay<00:02:47.480> this<00:02:47.750> one<00:02:47.930> is

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
staging yard excuse me okay this one is

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.770 
staging yard excuse me okay this one is
more<00:02:48.319> or<00:02:48.410> less<00:02:48.590> just<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:49.239> hold<00:02:50.239> some<00:02:50.510> extra

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
more or less just to hold some extra

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.100 
more or less just to hold some extra
trains<00:02:52.060> get<00:02:53.060> them<00:02:53.180> off<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.420> layout<00:02:53.690> actually

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
trains get them off the layout actually

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.080 
trains get them off the layout actually
so<00:02:54.349> I<00:02:54.620> can<00:02:54.860> actually<00:02:55.010> have<00:02:55.220> ten<00:02:55.459> trains<00:02:55.760> on<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
so I can actually have ten trains on the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.110 
so I can actually have ten trains on the
way<00:02:56.239> out<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.920> be<00:02:58.310> able<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.579> park<00:02:58.849> them<00:02:59.000> all

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
way out and be able to park them all

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.920 
way out and be able to park them all
operate<00:03:00.049> them<00:03:00.170> all<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:02.150> those<00:03:02.269> way<00:03:02.540> down<00:03:02.840> in

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
operate them all so those way down in

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.750 
operate them all so those way down in
the<00:03:03.019> corner<00:03:03.049> there<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:07.010> back<00:03:07.400> up<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.700> here<00:03:08.299> so

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
the corner there and back up to here so

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.330 
the corner there and back up to here so
these<00:03:10.760> will<00:03:10.910> be<00:03:10.940> like<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.389> arrival<00:03:12.019> tracks

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
these will be like the arrival tracks

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.680 
these will be like the arrival tracks
receiving<00:03:13.340> yard<00:03:13.549> and<00:03:13.850> then<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.480> will

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
receiving yard and then this will

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.199 
receiving yard and then this will
actually<00:03:14.989> be<00:03:15.109> the<00:03:15.139> departure<00:03:15.709> yard<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:17.030> these

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
actually be the departure yard so these

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.360 
actually be the departure yard so these
ones<00:03:17.389> will<00:03:17.480> be<00:03:17.510> ready<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.930> go<00:03:18.049> back<00:03:18.290> out<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.829> the
