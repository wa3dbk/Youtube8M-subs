at night during dinner our balloon broke

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.710 
at night during dinner our balloon broke
in<00:01:55.830> half<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.429> refrigerator<00:01:56.970> stopped<00:01:57.270> working

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
in half the refrigerator stopped working

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.320 
in half the refrigerator stopped working
and<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.770> was<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.069> night<00:01:59.310> two<00:01:59.880> o'clock<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.179> the

and it was that night two o'clock in the

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.179 
and it was that night two o'clock in the
morning<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:00.869> came<00:02:01.259> up<00:02:01.440> with<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.619> goofy<00:02:01.890> bottle

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
morning I came up with the goofy bottle

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.770 
morning I came up with the goofy bottle
I<00:02:02.280> was<00:02:02.430> noticing<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.939> every<00:02:03.180> bottle<00:02:03.509> is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
I was noticing that every bottle is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.289 
I was noticing that every bottle is
concave<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.619> when<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.549> try<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.790> squeeze<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
concave and when you try to squeeze it

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.350 
concave and when you try to squeeze it
flat<00:02:06.619> in<00:02:07.619> order<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.979> make<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.250> fit<00:02:08.549> into<00:02:09.060> any

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
flat in order to make it fit into any

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.449 
flat in order to make it fit into any
kind<00:02:09.630> of<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.989> know<00:02:10.079> closed<00:02:10.410> spaces<00:02:10.709> it's

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
kind of you know closed spaces it's

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.640 
kind of you know closed spaces it's
impossible<00:02:12.209> that's<00:02:13.019> when<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> came<00:02:13.290> up<00:02:13.470> with

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
impossible that's when I came up with

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.850 
impossible that's when I came up with
the<00:02:14.430> concept<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.269> rounded<00:02:15.630> bottom<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.530> I

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
the concept of the rounded bottom that I

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.360 
the concept of the rounded bottom that I
came<00:02:17.070> home<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:18.180> got<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> pad<00:02:18.840> dry<00:02:19.079> and<00:02:19.739> put<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
came home and got a pad dry and put the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.670 
came home and got a pad dry and put the
whole<00:02:20.519> thing<00:02:20.549> together<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.360> got<00:02:22.260> my<00:02:22.410> first

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
whole thing together and got my first

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.150 
whole thing together and got my first
prototype<00:02:22.980> made<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.650> that's<00:02:25.650> when<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.890> came<00:02:25.980> up

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
prototype made so that's when I came up

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.949 
prototype made so that's when I came up
with<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.519> inner<00:02:26.670> peace

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
with the inner peace

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.500 
with the inner peace
which<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.500> also<00:02:28.680> used<00:02:29.040> as<00:02:29.219> a<00:02:29.250> city<00:02:29.609> area<00:02:29.909> so<00:02:30.420> you

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
which is also used as a city area so you

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.550 
which is also used as a city area so you
can<00:02:30.629> actually<00:02:30.780> drink<00:02:31.140> out<00:02:31.349> of<00:02:31.379> the<00:02:31.530> bottle

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
can actually drink out of the bottle

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.719 
can actually drink out of the bottle
without<00:02:32.310> having<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.819> spill<00:02:33.090> over<00:02:33.390> your<00:02:33.540> face
