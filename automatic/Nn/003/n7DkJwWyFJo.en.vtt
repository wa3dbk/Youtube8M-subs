00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.830
 well this is the interior of the new fiat 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:11.850
 1 2015 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.010
 in the 1 way version the most expensive and most 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.610
 equipped but really the difference 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.040
 in relation to the basic is not very big 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.720
 I like the car many aspects 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.060
 example the finished ones seem to me 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.210
 pretty good the category of 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.100
 vehicle are rigid plastics but and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.810
 they are a little bit brighter than 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.660
 we would like but with the angle of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.610
 Windshields even handle in the sun not 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.280
 I have felt it very much with many reflections 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.280
 here we have another texture textures 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.830
 different and I do not think it looks 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.710
 wrong that part aesthetically I do not like 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.210
 a lot but it's functional is not the black 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.210
 piano that I think 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.770
 a little bit beyond what you should 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.100
 be a very good touch screen 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.990
 size the steering wheel has functions has 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.320
 adjustment of 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.600
 of height not no depth and that 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.090
 it takes for you to find a good 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.820
 driving position me for example if 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.570
 I put 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.670
 if I would have to be living here a 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.890
 knee practically hitting between those 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.930
 two places to have a good 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.420
 distance or have the distance 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.310
 correct to do flyer that is with the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.510
 back with the back attached to the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.119
 back and the dolls up with the 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.330
 arms arms slightly bent 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.000
 but since it is uncomfortable for the knee 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.250
 I have put a couple of points back and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.509
 it was further from the steering wheel what 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.509
 it should be for that you need 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.280
 the steering wheel telescope that in this car 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.740
 I repeat, you do not have any air 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.030
 conditioning a gearbox of 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.940
 5 changes some inaccuracies here a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.750
 auxiliary input another usb a socket 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.330
 current there is a rests arms what 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.330
 It is very good for long trips 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
 unfortunately 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.920
 here it is done 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.090
 this is to improve the tree 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.430
 back 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.580
 this for me I would like it to be a 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.370
 little armrest I like this 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.530
 way I lower it lower so it interferes me 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.080
 to use the speeds I prefer 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.810
 remove them you prefer to remove it because no 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.850
 have a case so that you have a 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.460
 rest arms and you can not use it to 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.220
 unless you put it on the back in 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:47.110
 a too vertical position works 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.560
 and it works well there the scheme says 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.650
 what makes volkswagen seems to me better 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.770
 the doors and so on has good space 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.700
 back not back there is very little space if 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.650
 you are totally back and here 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.780
 you can see there that space is very 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.520
 reduced you have to put that more for 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.890
 ahead but still if you're a little 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.400
 higher I for example I have to put 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.530
 is another problem generated by no 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.750
 steering wheel with telescopic adjustment have not 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.630
 I have to put my seat further back 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.880
 of what it should and that produces less 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.700
 rear space in what should the 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.620
 three subsequent headers very well 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.049
 designed in the form of you sit 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.900
 feels uncomfortable then you lift her up 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.269
 forces so that they notice how and with that 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.040
 you put it in the ideal position the box the 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.739
 They are relatively good in size 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.620
 for the segment the engine is 1.4 liters 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.040
 with 85 horses is a much more car 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.860
 urban that something else not here I'm 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.780
 turning on the functions here forward 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.180
 from me I have a travel computer what 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.400
 I can adjust with this button in the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.440
 board we have there the hours of 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.750
 engine operation temperature 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.300
 Exterior 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:04.500
 an econometer here and 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.709
 tachometer on the left speedometer 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.370
 around every gas tank in the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.680
 right side on the screen is not touch 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.959
 I do not think I did not remember discreetly but 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.620
 it's not tactile you have to use it with 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.620
 This is 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.900
 with these 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.110
 functions that are memories with a 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.050
 cell phone you have to put the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.850
 sine of a button as such are sensitive 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.740
 to the touch but it is not a button as such 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.750
 before you have to press is a little bit 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.449
 here the memories and so on the quality of 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.560
 sound is quite reasonable I think 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:44.930
 well has abs brakes and double bag 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.210
 air without frontal daily bags and that 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.090
 from the basic version this makes 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.280
 this car is the economic car in my 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.090
 most recommended opinion of the market 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.810
 because it's the car with abs brakes bags 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.690
 of air more cheaper 160 thousand pesos 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.990
 this version is worth 170 really not me 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.610
 I agree what is this 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.639
 compared to the one that costs 10 thousand pesos 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.550
 less should be details type this 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.100
 console or something like that I do not know if the screen 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.789
 different from the third case is for the 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.250
 style 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.680
 good the car is soft suspension 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.500
 as almost everything 7 obviously does not accelerate 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.539
 A lot is not fast, it's not made for 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.950
 but that is a car that moves with 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:32.420
 a lot of ease 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.560
 in him in the city where he is 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.230
 designed 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:41.540
 here we have this mirror in the style of 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:43.490
 the minivan is and here we have a portal 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.100
 head lens holder that fits lens a 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.500
 little bit bigger is that most 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:52.910
 those who are in the market 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.700
 efe is a good cart or at a point that 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.460
 I think it should improve, you have to 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.790
 lock and unlock that 9 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:05.030
 remote control that sounds like a thing to me 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.390
 last century but otherwise very good 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.390
 trolley
