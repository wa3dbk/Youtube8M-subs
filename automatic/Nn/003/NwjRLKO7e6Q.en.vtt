it's no coincidence that both of these

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.329 
it's no coincidence that both of these
guys<00:00:36.129> are<00:00:37.170> elite<00:00:38.170> scores<00:00:38.589> because<00:00:39.039> they<00:00:39.190> can

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:45.270 
talk about the pull-up jumper and why
you<00:00:43.899> should<00:00:44.230> learn<00:00:44.440> it<00:00:44.649> why<00:00:44.890> you<00:00:44.920> should

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
you should learn it why you should

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.970 
you should learn it why you should
incorporate<00:00:46.120> it<00:00:46.510> in<00:00:46.600> your<00:00:46.629> game<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.499> why<00:00:47.800> you

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
incorporate it in your game and why you

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.040 
incorporate it in your game and why you
should<00:00:48.159> practice<00:00:48.579> shooting<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.659> pull-ups

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
should practice shooting the pull-ups

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.739 
should practice shooting the pull-ups
just<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.069> be<00:00:51.159> real<00:00:51.370> quick<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:51.729> pull<00:00:52.300> up<00:00:52.479> is<00:00:52.629> the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
just to be real quick to pull up is the

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.290 
just to be real quick to pull up is the
hardest<00:00:54.390> move<00:00:55.589> to<00:00:56.589> guard<00:00:56.890> in<00:00:57.039> basketball

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
hardest move to guard in basketball

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.399 
hardest move to guard in basketball
reason<00:00:58.300> because<00:00:58.600> they<00:00:58.839> don't<00:00:59.050> know<00:00:59.199> when

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
reason because they don't know when

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.950 
reason because they don't know when
you're<00:00:59.530> going<00:00:59.649> to<00:00:59.739> stop<00:00:59.979> and<00:01:00.249> shoot<00:01:00.960> you're

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
you're going to stop and shoot you're

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.930 
you're going to stop and shoot you're
going<00:01:02.109> to<00:01:02.170> run<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.409> clip<00:01:02.649> and<00:01:03.429> I'm<00:01:03.639> going

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
going to run the clip and I'm going

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.910 
going to run the clip and I'm going
further<00:01:04.210> detailing<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.780> little<00:01:05.019> bit<00:01:05.199> but<00:01:05.770> it's

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
further detailing a little bit but it's

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.850 
further detailing a little bit but it's
a<00:01:05.950> lot<00:01:06.100> watch<00:01:06.340> Kobe<00:01:06.640> as<00:01:06.909> he<00:01:07.439> basically<00:01:08.439> just

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
a lot watch Kobe as he basically just

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.770 
a lot watch Kobe as he basically just
sweeps<00:01:09.130> through<00:01:09.369> and<00:01:09.670> goes<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.299> spot<00:01:10.630> and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
sweeps through and goes to a spot and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.209 
sweeps through and goes to a spot and
pulls<00:01:11.049> up<00:01:15.780> nothing<00:01:16.780> fancy<00:01:17.020> man<00:01:17.439> he<00:01:17.649> just<00:01:17.920> knows

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
pulls up nothing fancy man he just knows

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.490 
pulls up nothing fancy man he just knows
he<00:01:18.939> can<00:01:19.090> get<00:01:19.210> his<00:01:19.360> shot<00:01:19.630> he<00:01:19.960> can<00:01:20.049> go<00:01:20.229> to<00:01:20.289> the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
he can get his shot he can go to the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.359 
he can get his shot he can go to the
spot<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:20.770> pull<00:01:21.100> up<00:01:22.590> now<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.649> reason<00:01:24.039> why<00:01:24.159> it's

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
spot and pull up now the reason why it's

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.850 
spot and pull up now the reason why it's
so<00:01:24.549> effective<00:01:24.670> because<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:26.259> defender<00:01:26.710> does

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
so effective because the defender does

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.469 
so effective because the defender does
not<00:01:27.130> know<00:01:27.460> when<00:01:27.700> you're<00:01:27.820> going<00:01:27.939> to<00:01:28.030> stop<00:01:28.270> and

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.779 
layup
that's<00:04:46.080> what<00:04:46.289> Colton<00:04:46.470> does<00:04:46.800> he's<00:04:47.610> such<00:04:47.759> a

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
that's what Colton does he's such a

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.310 
that's what Colton does he's such a
smart<00:04:48.000> player<00:04:48.419> that's<00:04:48.630> what<00:04:48.750> separates<00:04:49.139> code

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
smart player that's what separates code

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.140 
smart player that's what separates code
because<00:04:49.560> he's<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:49.710> thinking<00:04:50.159> player<00:04:50.400> it's<00:04:51.030> like

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
because he's a thinking player it's like

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.820 
because he's a thinking player it's like
a<00:04:51.180> chess<00:04:51.479> match<00:04:51.720> when<00:04:52.110> Colton<00:04:52.320> plays<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.590> game

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
a chess match when Colton plays a game

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.170 
a chess match when Colton plays a game
that's<00:04:52.979> why<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:53.099> like<00:04:53.280> watching<00:04:53.639> him<00:04:53.669> play<00:04:53.909> and

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
that's why I like watching him play and

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.930 
that's why I like watching him play and
he<00:04:54.659> just<00:04:54.870> he's<00:04:55.080> just<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:56.099> defender<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:56.789> knows

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
he just he's just the defender you knows

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.110 
he just he's just the defender you knows
basically<00:04:57.240> as<00:04:57.570> will<00:04:58.340> so<00:04:59.340> that<00:04:59.610> that's<00:04:59.970> what

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
basically as will so that that's what

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.249 
basically as will so that that's what
makes<00:05:00.300> you<00:05:00.449> a<00:05:00.479> good<00:05:00.720> when<00:05:00.930> you<00:05:00.990> can<00:05:01.110> add

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
makes you a good when you can add

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.839 
makes you a good when you can add
counters<00:05:01.919> to<00:05:02.220> your<00:05:02.400> moves

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
counters to your moves

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.180 
counters to your moves
and<00:05:03.110> that's<00:05:04.110> why<00:05:04.259> Kobe<00:05:04.590> is<00:05:04.650> one<00:05:04.800> of<00:05:04.919> the<00:05:05.009> best

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
and that's why Kobe is one of the best

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.640 
and that's why Kobe is one of the best
players<00:05:05.430> because<00:05:05.909> you<00:05:06.810> know<00:05:06.900> offensively<00:05:07.440> he

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
players because you know offensively he

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.219 
players because you know offensively he
just<00:05:07.919> is<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.490> mastermind<00:05:09.210> with<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.750> ball<00:05:09.960> so
