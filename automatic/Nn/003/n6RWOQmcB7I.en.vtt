00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
don't know if you heard magma kind of

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.689 
don't know if you heard magma kind of
keyboards<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:55.460> this<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:57.980> is<00:00:58.980> definitely<00:00:59.280> not

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
keyboards but this one is definitely not

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.889 
keyboards but this one is definitely not
as<00:00:59.940> loud<00:01:00.149> actually<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.140> my<00:01:01.170> brother<00:01:01.590> has<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
as loud actually what my brother has the

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.160 
as loud actually what my brother has the
he<00:01:03.899> has<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:05.519> loud<00:01:05.880> mechanical<00:01:06.360> mechanical

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
he has the loud mechanical mechanical

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.719 
he has the loud mechanical mechanical
razer<00:01:07.740> keyboard<00:01:07.950> i<00:01:08.189> think<00:01:08.369> he<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.580> has<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
razer keyboard i think he just has the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.929 
razer keyboard i think he just has the
black<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.900> black<00:01:10.110> widow<00:01:10.380> ultimate<00:01:10.790> not<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
black the black widow ultimate not the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.140 
black the black widow ultimate not the
stealth<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.549> actually<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.880> part<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.060> this

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
stealth so actually for part of this

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.570 
stealth so actually for part of this
video<00:01:15.450> although<00:01:15.720> we'll<00:01:16.409> go<00:01:16.530> put<00:01:16.740> my<00:01:17.130> keyboard

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
video although we'll go put my keyboard

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.950 
video although we'll go put my keyboard
next<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> his<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.530> compare<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.740> noise<00:01:20.340> levels

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
next to his and compare the noise levels

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.960 
next to his and compare the noise levels
but<00:01:22.130> if<00:01:23.130> you're<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.340> familiar<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
but if you're not familiar with the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.280 
but if you're not familiar with the
mechanical<00:01:24.659> keyboards<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> idea<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.950> that

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
mechanical keyboards the idea is that

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.090 
mechanical keyboards the idea is that
maybe<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.590> keys<00:01:29.310> being<00:01:29.610> mechanical

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
maybe the keys being mechanical

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.890 
maybe the keys being mechanical
underneath<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.880> supposed<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.360> more

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
underneath that's supposed to be more

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.800 
underneath that's supposed to be more
responsible<00:01:34.250> for<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.640> gaming<00:01:36.000> specifically

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
responsible for for gaming specifically

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.749 
responsible for for gaming specifically
so<00:01:37.670> i<00:01:38.869> mean<00:01:39.869> anything<00:01:40.290> anything<00:01:41.280> anywhere<00:01:41.670> you

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
so i mean anything anything anywhere you

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.030 
so i mean anything anything anywhere you
can<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:41.939> an<00:01:42.030> edge<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.479> know<00:01:42.680> with<00:01:43.680> gaming

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
can get an edge you know with gaming

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.630 
can get an edge you know with gaming
that's<00:01:44.189> kind<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.790> my<00:01:44.939> thing<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.329> i<00:01:46.579> don't<00:01:47.579> know

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that's kind of my thing and i don't know

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.710 
that's kind of my thing and i don't know
how<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> get<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.149> thing<00:01:48.210> apart<00:01:48.450> without

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
how to get this thing apart without

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.980 
how to get this thing apart without
really<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.439> tearing<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.770> shreds<00:01:50.899> it's<00:01:51.899> like

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
really just tearing to shreds it's like

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.149 
really just tearing to shreds it's like
a<00:01:52.079> maze

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.340
