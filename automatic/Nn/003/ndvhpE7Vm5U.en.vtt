one

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
one

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.910 
one
whatever<00:02:13.250> size<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.909> choose<00:02:14.349> you<00:02:15.349> can<00:02:15.530> go<00:02:15.680> with

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
whatever size you choose you can go with

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.670 
whatever size you choose you can go with
you<00:02:16.069> all<00:02:16.400> three<00:02:16.819> inside<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:17.870> mean<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.349> you

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
you all three inside I mean that you

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.170 
you all three inside I mean that you
kind<00:02:18.860> of<00:02:18.920> get<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.129> concept<00:02:19.610> but<00:02:19.790> it's<00:02:20.030> pretty

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
kind of get the concept but it's pretty

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.350 
kind of get the concept but it's pretty
cool<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.840> what<00:02:21.319> I<00:02:21.349> like<00:02:21.560> about<00:02:21.769> it<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:23.239> know

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
cool and what I like about it you know

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.729 
cool and what I like about it you know
just<00:02:23.390> as<00:02:23.780> an<00:02:23.930> example<00:02:24.230> if<00:02:24.470> I'm<00:02:24.530> going<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.709> use

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
just as an example if I'm going to use

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.890 
just as an example if I'm going to use
this<00:02:25.159> size<00:02:25.610> pot<00:02:25.849> which<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.209> cup<00:02:26.689> and<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.870> half

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
this size pot which is a cup and a half

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.380 
this size pot which is a cup and a half
I'm<00:02:27.290> pretty<00:02:27.530> much<00:02:27.849> it's<00:02:28.849> going<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.030> be<00:02:29.150> for

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
I'm pretty much it's going to be for

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.649 
I'm pretty much it's going to be for
specific<00:02:30.170> trips<00:02:31.040> specific<00:02:31.819> circumstances

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
specific trips specific circumstances

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.210 
specific trips specific circumstances
and<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.110> this<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.379> pretty<00:02:33.620> much<00:02:33.769> what<00:02:34.099> I'm

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
and so this is pretty much what I'm

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.930 
and so this is pretty much what I'm
going<00:02:34.489> to<00:02:34.519> need<00:02:34.760> now<00:02:36.220> if<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.370> want<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.579> you<00:02:37.849> know
