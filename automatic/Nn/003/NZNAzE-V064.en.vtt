00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.690 
consultant didn't tell me to I've seen
people<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.930> basically<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:08.400> took

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
people do it but basically I just took

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.609 
people do it but basically I just took
it<00:01:09.590> take<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> little<00:01:10.770> section<00:01:11.479> twisted<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.659> put

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
it take a little section twisted it put

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.210 
it take a little section twisted it put
a<00:01:13.650> rubber<00:01:13.860> band<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.670> then<00:01:14.900> bandage<00:01:15.900> it

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
a rubber band on it and then bandage it

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.630 
a rubber band on it and then bandage it
so<00:01:18.590> that's<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.770> did<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> way<00:01:20.369> around

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
so that's what I did all the way around

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.039 
so that's what I did all the way around
and<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:20.970> kind<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.270> hard<00:01:23.720> to<00:01:24.720> get<00:01:24.840> there

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
and it was kind of hard to get there

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.810 
and it was kind of hard to get there
short<00:01:25.350> ones<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:25.830> minor<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.280> not<00:01:26.310> exactly

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
short ones because minor is not exactly

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.240 
short ones because minor is not exactly
even<00:01:27.030> or<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> ones<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> outside<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> had

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
even or the ones on the outside so I had

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.760 
even or the ones on the outside so I had
put<00:01:29.549> some<00:01:29.759> pins<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.930> kind<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.170> hold<00:01:31.320> them<00:01:31.500> down

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
put some pins to kind of hold them down

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.899 
put some pins to kind of hold them down
to<00:01:31.979> make<00:01:32.130> sure<00:01:32.250> they<00:01:32.369> weren't<00:01:32.520> gonna<00:01:32.640> get

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
to make sure they weren't gonna get

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.330 
to make sure they weren't gonna get
washed<00:01:33.299> away<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.500> found<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.950> did<00:01:35.189> not

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
washed away but I found that I did not

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.670 
washed away but I found that I did not
need<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> took<00:01:36.780> them<00:01:37.079> out<00:01:37.200> as<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.560> was

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
need them so I took them out as I was

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.069 
need them so I took them out as I was
shampooing<00:01:38.130> because

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
shampooing because

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.029 
shampooing because
they<00:01:41.079> weren't<00:01:41.350> they<00:01:41.439> just<00:01:41.500> weren't<00:01:41.740> coming

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
they weren't they just weren't coming

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.679 
they weren't they just weren't coming
out<00:01:42.219> because<00:01:42.579> I<00:01:42.700> was<00:01:42.850> shampoo<00:01:43.149> and<00:01:43.360> cut<00:01:43.479> like

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
out because I was shampoo and cut like

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.649 
out because I was shampoo and cut like
this<00:01:43.899> which<00:01:44.409> was<00:01:44.649> more<00:01:44.799> like<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> hard<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:46.360> rub

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
this which was more like a hard like rub

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.690 
this which was more like a hard like rub
and<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:47.020> was<00:01:47.259> scratching<00:01:47.710> so<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.159> really<00:01:48.520> wasn't

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
and I was scratching so I really wasn't

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.870 
and I was scratching so I really wasn't
bothering<00:01:49.149> them<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.179> basically<00:01:52.420> did

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
bothering them and I basically did

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.100 
bothering them and I basically did
enough<00:01:54.880> shampoo<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.420> where<00:01:55.539> I<00:01:55.600> got<00:01:55.780> my<00:01:55.960> head

kind<00:04:08.060> of<00:04:08.180> are<00:04:08.420> like<00:04:09.020> these<00:04:09.290> then<00:04:10.220> I<00:04:10.250> have<00:04:10.430> other

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
kind of are like these then I have other

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.990 
kind of are like these then I have other
ones<00:04:11.080> like<00:04:12.080> this<00:04:12.380> one<00:04:12.710> where<00:04:13.460> you<00:04:13.550> could<00:04:13.730> see

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
ones like this one where you could see

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.699 
ones like this one where you could see
like<00:04:14.420> it's<00:04:15.519> super<00:04:16.519> coil<00:04:16.880> II<00:04:17.150> at<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.420> end<00:04:17.709> so

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
like it's super coil II at the end so

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.130 
like it's super coil II at the end so
don't<00:04:19.430> know<00:04:19.670> why<00:04:19.820> some<00:04:20.180> are<00:04:20.209> poofy<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:20.959> white

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
don't know why some are poofy and white

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.490 
don't know why some are poofy and white
so<00:04:21.350> marker<00:04:21.769> oily<00:04:22.750> but<00:04:23.750> it's<00:04:23.900> definitely<00:04:24.320> like
