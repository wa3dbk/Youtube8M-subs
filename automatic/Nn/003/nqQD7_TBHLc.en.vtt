00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.060
 Hello everyone 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.440
 what we see today the application of a double frame no image 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:13.519
 is the bottom position 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.409
 of a signature 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.409
 first of all let's open our image on photoshop 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.569
 then we go on image size 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:24.380
 painting 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.140
 hey in the window that opens 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.029
 we choose the width and height of our first frame 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.129
 in this case we choose a width of one millimeter 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.230
 and a height 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.219
 even if god a millimeter 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.190
 so we're going to create a thin strip 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.750
 lan we run in the four sides we choose the color 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.260
 as color we can choose a foreground color with base color background 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.530
 set 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.410
 white and black and gray already preset by photoshop 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.210
 or by clicking on other we can go to open our palette of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.490
 colors that choose the color we prefer 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.960
 in this case we choose the white color 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.170
 click on ok 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.760
 and here around our image and a very thin one is created 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.540
 strip away 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.340
 now let's get back to king 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.000
 framework size 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.260
 to create the second frame we give a width of 6 millimeters 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.870
 height 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.110
 drawings of meters 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.550
 also in this case we anchor to the four sides of the image and we give in 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.520
 like color black 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.420
 click on ok 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.060
 and here it is created around our very thin white line 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.150
 a frame 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.500
 now he loves me to create in the space below 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.300
 another black strip to sign our name 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.790
 always from image square dimension 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.790
 let's choose a height this time and say 2 centimeters 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.289
 that I still love you at the bottom in the picture 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.279
 we choose as color 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.679
 and black 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.769
 and click on ok 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.159
 we see in fact that in the lower part of the photo a further has been created 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.909
 black stripe 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:30.389
 where we are going to position our signature first of all we create ourselves 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.519
 wedge level 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.239
 for the text part 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.560
 we move to the left hey we click on the platti 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:42.119
 to be able to access 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.599
 when entering text 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.519
 position the cursor where 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.739
 we decide to insert our writing 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.349

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.169

 or what pleases us the most 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.489
 in this case we visit nikon digitalfoto 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:08.579
 after which we highlight it in order to make a change to the character of 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.049
 size than anything else 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.459
 we choose a character of 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.659
 monotype test verissimo 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.039

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:23.479
 perfect 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.849
 and now as an effect we choose 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.659
 the tall rotunda 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.309

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:38.769

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.749
 now we can move it 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:43.549
 where it suits us most 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.239
