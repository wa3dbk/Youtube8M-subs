 I will tell you how to usually instruct the gamepad 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.019
 and not a xbox 360 gamepad cheap 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.780
 budget option through a special 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:18.180
 xbox 360 gamepad emulator program so 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.240
 In short, download the emulator itself; the link will be 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:27.109
 in the description and be sure to download 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.109

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.810
 drag and drop our file here and run 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.320
 this 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.460
 we are asked what can we create here 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.489
 document and want him we agree here 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.000
 peak well, like saw our gamepad haunting 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.160
 green is now the game Plato and 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.860
 plug in and see burn 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.079
 green heat buttons it means type 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:02.559
 does not plow 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:04.439
 enter the key twist the wheel the fungus it does not 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.470
 who study only left-right and 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.490

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.610
 button 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.140
 the other one works very well 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.950
 these buttons here we have the choice you can 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.950
 download this one 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.130

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.440
 does not flow does not see home 2 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.960
 This is noticed shorter try 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.150
 so here the buttons are torn off are confused 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.970
 here 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.850

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.880
 we are wrong here then these 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.510
 buttons 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.160
 here 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:04.870
 here they are on the right so reflected are shown 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.630

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.240

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:17.010
 the correct location is obtained 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.010
 here we have button1 here we have bud 4 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.430

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.740
 such a garbage 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.160
 and save 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.160
 as 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:52.060
 In the game, it works like this: 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:56.500
 resident evil revelations and downloaded 2 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:00.760
 we have come out so long ago that these files are shorter 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:05.790
 take copy already with customized 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.780
 gamepad file location and paste 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:13.480
