00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.100 
the nutribullet from magic bullet we
compared<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.090> in<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.330> other<00:01:13.450> video<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.080> a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
compared it in the other video to a

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.469 
compared it in the other video to a
competitor<00:01:14.680> as<00:01:14.860> well<00:01:15.250> as<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:16.000> original<00:01:16.150> magic

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
competitor as well as the original magic

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.480 
competitor as well as the original magic
bowl<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:16.960> see<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.260> difference<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:18.010> to<00:01:18.280> see<00:01:18.430> if

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
bowl to see the difference and to see if

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.680 
bowl to see the difference and to see if
there<00:01:18.640> was<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:18.850> difference<00:01:19.270> when<00:01:19.450> we<00:01:19.570> were

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
there was a difference when we were

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.560 
there was a difference when we were
actually<00:01:20.500> extracting<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:21.490> making<00:01:22.120> drinks

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
actually extracting and making drinks

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.719 
actually extracting and making drinks
I<00:01:22.720> thought<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.440> drinks<00:01:23.680> came<00:01:23.830> out<00:01:23.950> well<00:01:24.430> and

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
I thought the drinks came out well and

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.149 
I thought the drinks came out well and
obviously<00:01:25.210> in<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:26.290> macro<00:01:26.710> they<00:01:26.830> make<00:01:26.979> it<00:01:27.130> very

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
obviously in the macro they make it very

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.039 
obviously in the macro they make it very
straightforward<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.180> easy<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.600> understand

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
straightforward and easy to understand

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.609 
straightforward and easy to understand
how<00:01:29.650> much<00:01:29.830> of<00:01:29.860> each<00:01:30.640> item<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.330> needed<00:01:31.780> they

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
how much of each item is needed they

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.410 
how much of each item is needed they

line in here what you can fill it to but

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.750

want it's going to be how high you fill
it<00:02:27.260> now<00:02:27.920> using<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.670> items<00:02:29.000> like<00:02:29.180> kale<00:02:29.450> I

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
it now using the items like kale I

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.930 
it now using the items like kale I
thought<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.170> was<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> little<00:02:30.440> bit<00:02:30.620> too<00:02:31.610> thick

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
thought that was a little bit too thick

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.680 
thought that was a little bit too thick
and<00:02:32.150> even<00:02:33.040> grinding<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.160> down<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.760> extracting

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
and even grinding it down and extracting

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.870 
and even grinding it down and extracting
a<00:02:35.900> lot<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.410> still<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:37.310> know<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.459> can<00:02:37.640> still

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
a lot I still you know you can still

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.180 
a lot I still you know you can still
taste<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.390> consistency<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:39.410> you<00:02:39.800> might<00:02:39.980> want

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
taste that consistency so you might want

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.560 
taste that consistency so you might want
to<00:02:40.250> do<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.430> little<00:02:40.520> bit<00:02:40.670> longer<00:02:40.850> or<00:02:41.209> might

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
to do it a little bit longer or might

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.510 
to do it a little bit longer or might
want<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.930> try<00:02:42.080> different<00:02:42.410> greens<00:02:42.620> but<00:02:43.280> just

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
want to try different greens but just

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.070 
want to try different greens but just
keep<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.760> in<00:02:43.820> mind<00:02:43.910> it's<00:02:44.300> not<00:02:44.360> silky<00:02:45.170> smooth

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
keep that in mind it's not silky smooth

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.030 
keep that in mind it's not silky smooth
but<00:02:48.080> I<00:02:48.110> don't<00:02:48.410> think<00:02:48.470> that's<00:02:48.650> really<00:02:48.890> gonna

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
but I don't think that's really gonna

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.229 
but I don't think that's really gonna
happen<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.459> you're<00:02:49.700> gonna<00:02:49.850> get<00:02:50.030> something

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
happen that you're gonna get something

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.270 
happen that you're gonna get something
that's<00:02:50.480> extremely<00:02:50.989> silky<00:02:51.620> silky<00:02:52.010> smooth

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
that's extremely silky silky smooth

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.690 
that's extremely silky silky smooth

having<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.310> next<00:03:49.640> to<00:03:49.730> my<00:03:49.850> original<00:03:50.030> magic

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
having this next to my original magic

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.000 
having this next to my original magic
bullet<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:50.930> it's<00:03:51.380> still<00:03:51.590> it's<00:03:51.739> something

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
bullet and it's still it's something

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.410 
bullet and it's still it's something
that<00:03:52.130> works<00:03:52.340> differently<00:03:52.760> than<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:52.970> blender<00:03:53.390> so

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
that works differently than a blender so

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.740 
that works differently than a blender so
it's<00:03:54.200> not<00:03:54.410> huge<00:03:54.739> not<00:03:55.340> cumbersome<00:03:55.910> so<00:03:56.209> it's<00:03:56.510> not

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
it's not huge not cumbersome so it's not

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.870 
it's not huge not cumbersome so it's not
something<00:03:57.140> that<00:03:57.320> will<00:03:57.680> overpower<00:03:58.190> even<00:03:58.790> a

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
something that will overpower even a

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.220 
something that will overpower even a
small<00:03:59.120> kitchen<00:03:59.450> you<00:03:59.600> probably<00:03:59.900> put<00:04:00.049> it<00:04:00.140> away

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
small kitchen you probably put it away

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.979 
small kitchen you probably put it away
and<00:04:00.590> use<00:04:00.769> it<00:04:00.920> when<00:04:01.070> needed<00:04:01.100> oh<00:04:01.810> we're<00:04:02.810> all<00:04:02.870> I'm

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
and use it when needed oh we're all I'm

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.600 
and use it when needed oh we're all I'm
going<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.170> give<00:04:03.290> them<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.920> nutribullet<00:04:04.220> from

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
going to give them the nutribullet from

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.880 
going to give them the nutribullet from
Magic<00:04:04.970> Bullet<00:04:05.090> four<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.019> a<00:04:06.049> half<00:04:06.079> stars<00:04:06.500> and

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
you know that's really just because of

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.800 
you know that's really just because of
the<00:04:10.070> overalls<00:04:10.489> we'd<00:04:10.820> like<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.030> see<00:04:11.209> a<00:04:11.239> low<00:04:11.510> I
