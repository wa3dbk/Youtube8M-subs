I'm gonna go straight into it uh the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.429 
I'm gonna go straight into it uh the
origin<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:26.189> before<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> Marvel<00:01:26.939> multiverse

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
origin now before the Marvel multiverse

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.929 
origin now before the Marvel multiverse
there<00:01:28.439> were<00:01:28.950> three<00:01:30.259> beings<00:01:31.259> essentially<00:01:31.979> in

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
there were three beings essentially in

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.550 
there were three beings essentially in
this<00:01:33.210> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.450> void<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.810> nothingness<00:01:33.840> there

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
this kind of void of nothingness there

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.289 
this kind of void of nothingness there
is<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:34.920> above<00:01:35.100> all<00:01:35.310> at<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.240> very

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
is the one above all at the very very

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.569 
is the one above all at the very very
top<00:01:36.659> which<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:36.930> pretty<00:01:37.140> much<00:01:37.259> God<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:38.340> there

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
top which is pretty much God then there

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.640 
top which is pretty much God then there
is<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> living<00:01:39.000> tribunal<00:01:39.180> which<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.350> got

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
is a living tribunal which I got

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.370 
is a living tribunal which I got
essentially<00:01:41.280> judges<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.210> keeps<00:01:42.930> balance

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
essentially judges and keeps balance

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.920 
essentially judges and keeps balance
overall<00:01:43.920> all<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.430> multiverse<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.090> then

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
overall all the multiverse and then

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840 
overall all the multiverse and then
there's<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.649> third<00:01:46.890> being<00:01:47.159> which<00:01:47.640> was

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
there's the third being which was

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.420 
there's the third being which was
something<00:01:48.240> called<00:01:48.390> nemesis<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.189> nemesis<00:01:50.189> was

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
something called nemesis a nemesis was

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.240 
something called nemesis a nemesis was
made<00:01:50.880> by<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:52.049> above<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.439> with<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
made by the one above all with the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.319 
made by the one above all with the
intention<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.210> creation<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.219> being<00:01:56.520> it's

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
intention of creation so this being it's

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.080 
intention of creation so this being it's
a<00:01:57.420> she<00:01:57.659> she<00:01:58.409> was<00:01:58.619> essentially<00:01:59.250> supposed<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.880> do

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
a she she was essentially supposed to do

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.480
