00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.410
 it was a good night 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.620
 RenÃ© of the boasts 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.009
 aquarium caron 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.009
 this hemicycle 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 in short in a few words to be able to say what 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:20.839
 it is a minister who has contrasts 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.960
 On the one hand we have 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.650
 from the waist up 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.310
 complies with quality standards 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.310
 of modern media 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.810
 while the waist down 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.140
 design 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.750
 of the pieces 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.470
 It is quite poor and let you want 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.530
 especially society 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.600
 too long 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.880
 very big cerredo 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.820
 the pieces of 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.820
 legs are also 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.970
 it's hard to be able 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.960
 weapons a good version scholarships unbalance omitted 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.640
 because not only do you need 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.950
 purchase of the pm 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.280
 but at the same time that min deficit is to buy 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.350
 a piece is of the consensus camus keys to be able to mount 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.170
 the face with correct expression 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.900
 then it is difficult but above all it is expensive 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.430
 culmination 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.660
 acceptable medium 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.000
 because not even these two purchases 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 they finish 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.960
 fix the design 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 of this figure 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.129
 in my case I have not only put on the child's face 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.939
 His plans 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.179
 we dedicate to the country 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.519
 but he fears I put the appendix 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.839
 pieces like the arms 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:27.199
 the fists 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:29.139
 The hair 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.259
 the mask 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:33.729
 especially the shadow 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.219
 shoulder pads 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.669
 afp decreasing 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:43.859
 that although they do not come with the right mechanism to be mounted on the armor 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.689
 only real a few small cuts 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.189
 in this area 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:54.889
 that could 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.519
 in monagas 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.519
 acceptably 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.939
 in general terms 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.829
 already with all these arrangements 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.129
 cb acceptably well 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.399
 but as I said 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.399
 the legs are the ones that end after subtracting points 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.529
 house cements 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:31.459
 ii do not keep the correct symmetry that should be saved in relation to 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.459
 the other pieces of the armed ones the mature age 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.119
 maybe one of the biggest flaws 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.219
 I do not know if the rock 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.219
 which has not included enough parts to 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.099
 this micro will end 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.789
 as it should 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:02.789
 after a hand that I have entered 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.449
 we will continue in a second
