matrix<00:01:16.749> now<00:01:17.749> you've<00:01:17.899> got<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.170> digital<00:01:18.740> clock

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
matrix now you've got the digital clock

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.550 
matrix now you've got the digital clock
in<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.159> bottom<00:01:19.549> on<00:01:19.909> this<00:01:20.149> is<00:01:20.299> more

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
in the bottom on this is more

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.139 
in the bottom on this is more

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
intuitional like it makes a little more

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.300 
intuitional like it makes a little more
sense<00:01:23.420> because<00:01:23.630> we're<00:01:23.749> used<00:01:23.929> to<00:01:24.020> using<00:01:24.310> just

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
sense because we're used to using just

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.359 
sense because we're used to using just
hitting<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.549> different<00:01:25.850> icons<00:01:26.179> a<00:01:27.249> little<00:01:28.249> bit
