00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.369 
apply the flanger so I'm having this
conversation<00:04:05.640> with<00:04:06.000> Nicks<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.450> don't<00:04:06.629> I<00:04:07.230> think

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.300 
cool so it's one and we're gonna do a
machine<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.139> come<00:04:19.320> ahead<00:04:19.470> baseline<00:04:20.100> if<00:04:20.220> you

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
machine the come ahead baseline if you

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.069 
machine the come ahead baseline if you
can<00:04:20.459> believe<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:20.729> with<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.840> base<00:04:22.049> that

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
can believe it with the base that

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.350 
can believe it with the base that
actually<00:04:22.620> used<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.160> record<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.699> with<00:04:23.729> this<00:04:24.060> was

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
actually used to record it with this was

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.900 
actually used to record it with this was
this<00:04:24.539> base<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:25.199> it<00:04:25.590> was<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:25.860> flanger<00:04:26.430> and

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
this base and it was that flanger and

00:04:26.910 --> 00:06:08.770 
this base and it was that flanger and
this<00:04:27.150> was

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.590 

eighty-eight<00:06:09.780> flanger<00:06:10.230> it's<00:06:10.380> cool
