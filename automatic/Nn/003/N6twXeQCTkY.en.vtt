 sending to the old movie is also quite 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.860
 easy to operate thanks to a 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.299
 free application called such an arrow to 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.100
 you can screen sick for this 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.549
 services if they use or tunein 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.290
 radio 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.780
 but even the music strip service 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.360
 from sony itself music unlimited 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.230
 and also you can use this application 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.239
 cue we go 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.530
 easy set up, then be over 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.989
 sound quality has two small ones 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.640
 speakers that both have power 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.709
 have 16 wat of each other 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.299
 And he also has a subwoofer that one 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.569
 capability of 16 watts so on 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.670
 so each other has a 32 watt capacity 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.910
 And yes the sound quality just stays 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.620
 very good thanks to its aptx and codec 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.750
 that means that the sound of 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.430
 CD quality remains 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.620
 for example, I will now switch on 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.470
 i have one connected via the bluetooth i 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.470
 press play and I turn it up a bit 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.900
 no so hear that he is not going to 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.540
 distort 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.859
 even if you put it so that is harder 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.109
 just ideal for example if you 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.790
 also put it in your garden because then 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.190
 you just a little further in your garden 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.440
 still great the music william by the way 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.239
 take it to the beach or to it 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.560
 pool will handle it with care 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.200
 because he is not 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.090
 splash-proof but you are actually yes 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.160
 oh look at its size and it too 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.260
 that you can connect to it so yeah 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.660
 on your home network 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.340
 it is really more of an audio reader 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.819
 intended to use it for example 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.799
 in your garden or at home on your cupboard
