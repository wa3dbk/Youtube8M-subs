00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello I'm lulas handmade and have 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.389
 Today is a last minute Valentine's Day 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.519
 Idea for you and that are small 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.929
 dear case of those most like 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.830
 can give with a small 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.030
 message to it 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.830
 Now I'll show you some 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 materials that the eu needs 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.600
 normal shashlik skewer then 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.850
 you need something firmer bastl felt 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.550
 a bit of cardboard in front of a message 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.230
 then you definitely need 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.550
 Needles if you want a stand 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.750
 Although to punch out the message 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.700
 but he could also quite 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.620
 then cut normally by hand 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.809
 you need a hot glue gun or 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.079
 very strong as gluing then needs 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.550
 her a little laugh pretty pretty 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.690
 mÃ©gane and matching colors and one 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.550
 scissors to cut out 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.230
 First, cut out the pieces of rock 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.360
 that front pressure part out so they 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.890
 glue it on this wooden stick afterwards 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.300
 can sew that on it and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.719
 Just cut the same size again 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.719
 time out 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.660
 but as you see here in the cowardly 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.740
 are still so little notches in the back 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.740
 I ask here now even a 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.230
 next, you're gonna cut that 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.790
 spit for the desired length 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.650
 because we ourselves are a bit too long 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.010
 so recently it simply a 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.780
 then we need a bit next 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.370
 the hot glue with it for the two 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.240
 end of the bar between the 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.240
 can stick to layers 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.930
 after we have glued the bar 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.000
 Now we are still needle and thread and 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.940
 do not take these parts firmly from above 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.740
 by then again from below always with 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.490
 The distance that that a nice distance 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.490
 stuck 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.530
 front once sewn dream almost here 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.030
 So it's nice to do it now 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.680
 a knot and then I do exactly 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.250
 the same on the back side of 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.170
 arrow 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.150
 if you want you can order now 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.310
 your arrow a bit federal 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.210
 masking tape will find it one more 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.250
 bit confused and then hit you 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.740
 on your stand was a piece of paper or 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.910
 cardboard or just cut it by hand 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.330
 out and no longer mine 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.330
 little laugh 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.480
 now take a pen and 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.459
 a message writes the card 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.110
 Next, take alarm with it 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.110
 to tie the card to the case 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.250
 are you ready and can the case 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.939
 use for someone to valentines 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.500
 to surprise 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.569
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.189
 imitate and if your suggestions for 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.140
 even more ideas are needed for the 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:48.700
