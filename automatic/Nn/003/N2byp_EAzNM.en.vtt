 today we are going to prepare carrot cake 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.780
 a delicious and nutritious fast dessert 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.570
 we started washing and removing the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.390
 peels of two large carrots 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:28.450
 then we scratched and reserved them 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.750
 in a vessel we place an egg 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.440
 we beat it with the help of a balloon 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.440
 metal 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.140
 we add a pinch of salt 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.520
 a quarter of a small milk well 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.300
 skim 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.030
 we mix 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.180
 add a teaspoon of essence 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.150

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.910
 tablespoons of condensed milk we mix 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.430
 again vigorously so that it 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.610
 integrate all the ingredients 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.670
 we add a teaspoon of powder to 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:28.260
 bake and we keep beating 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.160
 add all the grated carrot 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.460
 We change utensil to mix that 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.820
 We are mixing with a flat spoon 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.520
 mix with any type of spoon 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.040
 mix well the carrot that is 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.520
 impregnated with all the ingredients 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.500
 that we have in the vessel we make the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.860
 carrot aside and in the part 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.030
 liquid we are going to add 3 tablespoons 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.260
 full 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.260
 of wheat flour 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.659
 we mix starting in the liquid part 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.099
 and little by little we are integrating the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.500
 carrot with wheat flour and the 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.180
 liquid 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.920
 we have everything very well mixed 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:22.390
 and then we add 4 tablespoons of flour 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:26.380
 of well-filled wheat 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.260
 and we mix again we mix very 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.540
 good for about two minutes until 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.020
 we are completely integrated 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.530
 ingredients the wheat flour does not have 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.590
 lumps or be separated from the rest of 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.410
 mix 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.540
 when we have obtained this texture 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.290
 creamy 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.960
 we put a pan to the fire pardon a 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.750
 Teflon pot to heat to heat 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.080
 and we add all the mixture inside the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.080
 cooking pot 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.170
 we try 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.450
 and place the medium-low heat 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.150
 we cook for half an hour last is 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.819
 half an hour we uncover we review with a 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.980
 knife that comes out clean 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.950
 if so 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.430
 we turn it over carefully to the 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.430
 cake 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.980
 and we put it on the opposite side 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:34.700
 we cover the fire to the minimum and 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.860
 we let cook for 15 or 20 minutes 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.310
 until it is golden when this happens 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.060
 time we take out the cake and place it 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.060
 on a plate 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.150
 and our cake is ready, notice that 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.610
 It does not grow much but it is very rich 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.090
 it is golden brown on both sides 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.340
 like a crispy layer but inside 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.810
 It has a different texture 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.810
 we can cut it once 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.000
 without letting it cool 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.860
 and so we can eat it that way it's delicious 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.950
 or if you prefer to let it cool but 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.060
 it is very rich look at the texture that it has 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.350
 the cake 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.350
 what fluffy 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:29.319
 remains with the edges 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:29.319
 Crispy but in the center it is creamy 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:36.960
 I invite you to taste this delicious 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.960
 cake
