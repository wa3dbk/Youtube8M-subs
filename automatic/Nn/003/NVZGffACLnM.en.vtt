when<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.080> finally<00:02:45.590> does<00:02:45.770> display<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:47.170> think

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
when it finally does display it I think

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.560 
when it finally does display it I think
this<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:48.410> just<00:02:48.680> my<00:02:49.010> tablet<00:02:49.550> that's<00:02:49.730> going<00:02:50.240> slow

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
this is just my tablet that's going slow

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.420 
this is just my tablet that's going slow
the<00:02:50.720> moment<00:02:50.990> there<00:02:51.320> we<00:02:51.440> are<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.160> now<00:02:52.310> it

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
the moment there we are so now it

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.310 
the moment there we are so now it
displays<00:02:52.730> any<00:02:52.940> story<00:02:53.240> absolutely<00:02:54.080> unreadable

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
displays any story absolutely unreadable

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.410 
displays any story absolutely unreadable
because<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.950> lines<00:02:55.160> are<00:02:55.310> very<00:02:55.370> long<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.850> I'm

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
because the lines are very long and I'm

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.410 
because the lines are very long and I'm
not<00:02:56.540> going<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.840> have<00:02:56.990> any<00:02:57.320> fun<00:02:57.680> reading<00:02:58.130> this

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
not going to have any fun reading this

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.620 
not going to have any fun reading this
so<00:02:59.420> it's<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.980> pretty<00:03:00.980> useless<00:03:01.610> application<00:03:02.480> for

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
so it's a pretty useless application for

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.270 
so it's a pretty useless application for
the<00:03:02.690> tablet<00:03:03.110> at<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.260> moment<00:03:03.620> i'll<00:03:03.980> just<00:03:04.190> show

all<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:17.480> can<00:03:17.720> then<00:03:18.080> also<00:03:18.380> maybe<00:03:18.980> open<00:03:19.370> up<00:03:19.430> a

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
all you can then also maybe open up a

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.640 
all you can then also maybe open up a
website<00:03:19.730> if<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.120> wanted<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.630> from<00:03:21.260> where<00:03:21.560> the

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
website if you wanted to from where the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.000 
website if you wanted to from where the
original<00:03:22.040> source<00:03:22.280> comes<00:03:22.640> from<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:24.200> then<00:03:24.680> if<00:03:24.890> I

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
original source comes from and then if I

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.900 
original source comes from and then if I
just<00:03:25.190> go<00:03:25.340> back<00:03:25.610> into<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:26.120> story<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:28.459> again<00:03:28.760> it's

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
just go back into a story and again it's

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.400 
just go back into a story and again it's
made<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.180> text<00:03:29.540> small<00:03:29.840> again<00:03:30.080> for<00:03:30.260> some

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
made the text small again for some

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.199 
made the text small again for some
reason<00:03:30.739> so<00:03:30.920> it's<00:03:31.100> not<00:03:31.280> keeping<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.760> text

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
reason so it's not keeping the text

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.479 
reason so it's not keeping the text
remember<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:33.140> you<00:03:33.260> could<00:03:33.410> then<00:03:33.620> share<00:03:33.860> the

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
remember it you could then share the

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.760 
remember it you could then share the
information<00:03:34.730> if<00:03:35.270> you<00:03:35.420> wanted<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.989> revert<00:03:36.739> a

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
information if you wanted to revert a

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.500 
information if you wanted to revert a
variety<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.250> options<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.910> here's<00:03:38.300> the<00:03:38.420> other

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
variety of options and here's the other

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.940 
variety of options and here's the other
thing<00:03:38.570> you<00:03:38.750> can<00:03:38.900> do<00:03:39.020> you<00:03:39.230> can<00:03:39.380> say<00:03:39.560> whether<00:03:39.770> you

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
thing you can do you can say whether you

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.160 
thing you can do you can say whether you
like<00:03:40.190> it<00:03:40.220> or<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.580> don't<00:03:40.610> like<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.300> and<00:03:41.510> then

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
like it or you don't like it and then

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.690 
like it or you don't like it and then
obviously<00:03:42.500> it<00:03:42.920> should<00:03:43.100> take<00:03:43.310> up<00:03:43.520> more

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
obviously it should take up more

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.440 
obviously it should take up more
articles<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.390> do<00:03:44.750> with<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.140> guess<00:03:45.470> Tim<00:03:45.860> elbow

is<00:04:44.990> very<00:04:45.139> similar<00:04:45.620> because<00:04:45.889> it<00:04:46.129> since<00:04:46.310> I

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
is very similar because it since I

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.339 
is very similar because it since I
essentially<00:04:46.909> exactly<00:04:47.539> the<00:04:47.629> same<00:04:47.810> application

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
essentially exactly the same application

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.140 
essentially exactly the same application
it's<00:04:48.469> no<00:04:48.620> different<00:04:48.889> on<00:04:49.099> the<00:04:49.159> tablet<00:04:49.580> which<00:04:50.029> is

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
it's no different on the tablet which is

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.580 
it's no different on the tablet which is
why<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.330> doesn't<00:04:50.659> work<00:04:50.689> on<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:50.960> tablet<00:04:51.349> but<00:04:51.439> on<00:04:51.499> a

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
why it doesn't work on a tablet but on a

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.129 
why it doesn't work on a tablet but on a
mobile<00:04:51.830> phone<00:04:51.979> it<00:04:52.370> works<00:04:52.580> excellently<00:04:53.479> as<00:04:53.900> you

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139

this is what I expect zeit to be like on

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.029 
this is what I expect zeit to be like on
an<00:06:27.469> android<00:06:27.889> and<00:06:28.310> it<00:06:28.639> just<00:06:28.819> isn't<00:06:29.089> a<00:06:29.180> demand<00:06:29.479> so

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
an android and it just isn't a demand so

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:36.939 
an android and it just isn't a demand so
what<00:06:31.039> we<00:06:31.189> need<00:06:31.460> is<00:06:33.189> site<00:06:34.189> on<00:06:34.520> the<00:06:35.089> android<00:06:35.569> in<00:06:36.080> a

what we need is site on the android in a
HD<00:06:37.550> format<00:06:37.939> so<00:06:38.149> presumably<00:06:38.539> site<00:06:39.409> HD<00:06:40.069> that's

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310
