little bid for a slab I could page

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.660 
little bid for a slab I could page
through<00:00:20.500> the<00:00:20.590> whole<00:00:20.740> book<00:00:21.040> to<00:00:21.279> find<00:00:21.460> what

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
through the whole book to find what

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.429 
through the whole book to find what
we're<00:00:21.790> looking<00:00:21.820> for<00:00:22.150> but<00:00:22.689> there's<00:00:23.140> a<00:00:23.200> better

way

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.790 
way
I'll<00:00:25.310> use<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:25.880> index<00:00:26.420> to<00:00:26.750> find<00:00:26.780> costs<00:00:27.560> force

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
I'll use the index to find costs force

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.510 
I'll use the index to find costs force
and<00:00:28.070> fill<00:00:28.370> under<00:00:28.850> a<00:00:28.880> slab<00:00:29.270> base<00:00:29.630> I'm<00:00:30.520> searching

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
and fill under a slab base I'm searching

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.060 
and fill under a slab base I'm searching
for<00:00:31.550> sand<00:00:31.940> fill<00:00:32.470> there<00:00:33.470> are<00:00:33.590> three<00:00:33.800> ways<00:00:34.040> to

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
for sand fill there are three ways to

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.690 
for sand fill there are three ways to
find<00:00:34.340> what<00:00:34.820> we<00:00:34.970> need<00:00:35.710> this<00:00:36.710> tab<00:00:37.010> works<00:00:37.310> like<00:00:37.670> a

find what we need this tab works like a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.620 
find what we need this tab works like a
book<00:00:38.030> index<00:00:39.070> use<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.340> search<00:00:40.640> tab<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:41.270> drill

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
book index use the search tab to drill

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.470 
book index use the search tab to drill
down<00:00:41.900> to<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.200> category<00:00:42.830> you<00:00:43.010> need
