75 gallon tank is awesome it's the same
length<00:01:09.170> as<00:01:09.410> my<00:01:09.620> 55<00:01:10.250> but<00:01:11.210> it's<00:01:11.360> wider<00:01:12.460> so<00:01:13.460> you

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
length as my 55 but it's wider so you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:22.300 
length as my 55 but it's wider so you
have<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:14.500> lot<00:01:15.500> more<00:01:16.540> options<00:01:20.979> this<00:01:21.979> is<00:01:22.130> what<00:01:22.280> I

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
to do on my 55 it would be a similar

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.680 
to do on my 55 it would be a similar
idea<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:33.080> seven<00:01:33.470> gallon<00:01:33.860> that<00:01:34.040> I<00:01:34.070> have

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
idea to the seven gallon that I have

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.300 
idea to the seven gallon that I have
we're<00:01:35.690> right<00:01:36.229> in<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.500> middle<00:01:36.619> is<00:01:37.130> your

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
we're right in the middle is your

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.410 
we're right in the middle is your
centerpiece<00:01:38.050> okay<00:01:39.550> for<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.670> substrate<00:01:41.240> I

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
centerpiece okay for the substrate I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.340 
centerpiece okay for the substrate I
would<00:01:41.660> go<00:01:41.840> with<00:01:41.869> sand<00:01:45.399> your<00:01:46.399> centerpiece

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
would go with sand your centerpiece

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.430 
would go with sand your centerpiece
would<00:01:48.350> be<00:01:48.560> basically<00:01:49.990> driftwood<00:01:50.990> like<00:01:51.229> these

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
would be basically driftwood like these

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.530 
would be basically driftwood like these
months<00:01:54.440> to<00:01:54.530> need<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:54.710> driftwood<00:01:55.160> where<00:01:55.640> they

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
months to need a driftwood where they

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.450 
months to need a driftwood where they
would<00:01:56.780> stick<00:01:57.110> out<00:01:58.300> you<00:01:59.300> would<00:01:59.450> have<00:01:59.600> rocks<00:02:00.460> all

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
would stick out you would have rocks all

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.389 
would stick out you would have rocks all
over<00:02:01.520> here<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:03.680> know<00:02:03.800> you<00:02:03.860> can<00:02:04.070> also<00:02:04.190> have

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
over here you know you can also have

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.480 
over here you know you can also have
some<00:02:04.640> driftwood<00:02:05.060> get<00:02:05.630> drift<00:02:05.960> with<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.490> it

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
some driftwood get drift with that it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.090 
some driftwood get drift with that it
comes<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:07.940> point<00:02:08.000> like<00:02:08.600> that<00:02:08.739> you<00:02:09.739> can<00:02:09.920> put

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
comes to a point like that you can put

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.259 
comes to a point like that you can put
it<00:02:10.190> on<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.429> ends<00:02:11.769> but<00:02:12.769> mainly<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:14.030> want<00:02:14.180> to

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
it on the ends but mainly you want to

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.289 
it on the ends but mainly you want to
get<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.510> month<00:02:14.720> near<00:02:14.989> driftwood<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:16.299> extend

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
get the month near driftwood that extend

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.300 
get the month near driftwood that extend
to<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.260> far<00:02:18.560> far<00:02:19.430> ends<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.910> tank<00:02:21.310> going

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
to the far far ends of the tank going

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.220 
to the far far ends of the tank going
this<00:02:22.549> way<00:02:22.820> some<00:02:23.720> going<00:02:24.049> up<00:02:24.310> open<00:02:25.310> tank<00:02:26.230> even

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
this way some going up open tank even

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.960 
this way some going up open tank even
coming<00:02:28.160> out<00:02:28.310> would<00:02:28.549> look<00:02:28.760> good<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.269> my<00:02:30.140> opinion

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
coming out would look good in my opinion

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.530 
coming out would look good in my opinion
and<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.570> course<00:02:31.600> inside<00:02:32.470> all<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.550> what<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.180> have

and of course inside all the what I have
in<00:02:34.990> most<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.530> my<00:02:35.590> tanks<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.310> look<00:02:36.550> where

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
in most of my tanks is that look where

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.870 
in most of my tanks is that look where
you<00:02:37.180> have<00:02:37.360> all<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:37.750> java<00:02:38.080> fern<00:02:38.580> place<00:02:39.580> right

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
you have all this java fern place right

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.090 
you have all this java fern place right
inside<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.590> with<00:02:42.010> java<00:02:42.700> fern<00:02:43.030> or<00:02:43.270> an<00:02:43.480> anubius

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
inside so with java fern or an anubius

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.920 
inside so with java fern or an anubius
you<00:02:45.100> don't<00:02:45.250> have<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.550> really<00:02:45.790> worry<00:02:45.880> about<00:02:46.240> you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
you don't have to really worry about you

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.610 
you don't have to really worry about you
know<00:02:48.450> your<00:02:49.450> substrate<00:02:49.960> or<00:02:50.050> anything<00:02:50.590> like

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
know your substrate or anything like

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.830 
know your substrate or anything like
that<00:02:50.770> you<00:02:51.760> just<00:02:51.790> stick<00:02:52.240> them<00:02:52.390> right<00:02:52.450> inside

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
that you just stick them right inside

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.310 
that you just stick them right inside
and<00:02:53.410> have<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.770> look<00:02:54.070> right<00:02:54.490> in<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.880> middle

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
and have that look right in the middle

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.010 
and have that look right in the middle
since<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.500> already<00:02:56.680> have<00:02:57.010> angelfish<00:02:58.020> you

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
since you already have angelfish you

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.740 
since you already have angelfish you
know<00:02:59.170> maybe<00:02:59.560> step<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:00.280> up<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.580> notch<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.690> go

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
know maybe step it up a notch and go

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.830 
know maybe step it up a notch and go

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
but if it was up to me I would stick

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.870

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
with just one tetra and that be the

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.920 
with just one tetra and that be the
Roman<00:04:19.209> nose<00:04:20.579> disqus<00:04:21.579> you<00:04:21.850> can<00:04:22.060> get<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:22.780> know
