transponder and this picks up the
transponder<00:01:56.630> signal<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:57.500> we<00:01:57.530> know<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.920> name

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
transponder signal so we know the name

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.550 
transponder signal so we know the name

of the ship and how far away it is and
we<00:02:00.710> carry<00:02:00.980> these<00:02:01.190> half<00:02:01.400> tops<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:01.880> board<00:02:02.180> the
