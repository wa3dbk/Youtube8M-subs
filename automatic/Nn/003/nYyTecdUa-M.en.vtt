 hello how about friends that tutorials 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.010
 friends rum and 830 this time I'm going 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.160
 to teach as 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.440
 create a new you talk from which 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.529
 can they be able to install their system 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.270
 operative at the time of formatting if 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:24.390
 well let's go to what the tutorial is already 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.960
 I have told you previously a one 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.660
 today's tutorial on ultraiso 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.470
 and simply load it or when it's already 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.690
 I have it 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.640
 they entangle right foot 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.460
 run as administrator this is fine 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.320
 important gentlemen because if they are going to 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.320
 double click will not be able to 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.080
 I can do the operation that we are going to 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.480
 do normal 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.320
 then let's go right click 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.320
 as our bar 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:01.560
 once open let's open files 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.300
 and we look for the operating system that in 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.600
 my case is this one 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.270
 let's open it 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.850
 and it's going to leave you all this once 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.820
 have all this here simply give 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.820
 another run that burn disk image 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.649
 here they give 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.340
 on the usb by the way I was 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:33.039
 forgetting 20 black a blank usb 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.430
 yes please have to do here to 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:41.140
 to have it like that is just to format 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.600
 they will be defaults 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.280
 and in that year 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.430
 well I do not do it because I already have it 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.430
 do not 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.909
 here when he also takes out the first milestone 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.300
 is to take the first one so please do not 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.680
 according to the third the first one we go and in 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.200
 record notice all unit data 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.580
 such will be lost are you sure that 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.580
 they really count like this 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.870
 and as it says the street is already recording 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.349
 how can you see what you are doing 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.700
 it takes to pause the video until 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.700
 finish loading 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.490
 bencomo 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.490
 how can you see it and it's about to end 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.560
 it has taken me around more or less than 8 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.560
 minutes as ncaa says elapsed 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.540
 I'm finishing it as you can 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:45.170
 see here says finished recording 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.560
 correctly so now we close it well 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.560
 this 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.660
 we are going to see if this really 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.880
 Has failed 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.730
 and here we are 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.810
 what this decided original diet is what 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.720
 external in ours that you see then 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.540
 we can open it did not and says it 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.140
 we can execute 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.459
 now 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.410
 how would all this be was another tutorial 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.750
 from your friend rum and 830 where I have them 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:26.020
 taught how to really 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.530
 create a portable usb memory where 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.770
 we can flip and install the system 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.770
 operative 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.990
 in another author I'm going to show you how 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.920
 install the designed operating system 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.120
 from an usb but for now this is 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.100
 all 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.100
 comment subscribe and until next time
