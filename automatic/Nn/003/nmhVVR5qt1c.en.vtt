00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.049
 welcome to this new installment of 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:17.120
 hate mania the rubric can't do it with 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:17.120
 giacomo cipro audio hands this Monday 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.520
 I was running now because I had gods 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.520
 problems 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.439
 theme song 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.910
 today I'll show you how to make it 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.040
 this phone call effect can be 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.890
 useful both for your video productions 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.050
 both for your musical productions 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.120
 here we are in the adobe interface 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.510
 audition the only tool we will go to 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.370
 use to achieve this effect 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.270
 phone that actually is a lot 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.930
 simple will be the equalizer to do 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.509
 this select the part of yours 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.840
 of ibra audio that you have to filter too 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:18.450
 based precisely on the shots and one 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:24.540
 once selected we go on perfect 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.540
 filter and q fft filter 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.160
 this is the curve I designed 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.800
 to get this phone effect 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:37.300
 so I went to remove all the 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.590
 low frequencies up to 90 100 hearts e 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.670
 I created a curve with a slight curve 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:49.899
 up to 3,000 hearts with 3000 hearts 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.479
 let's say forward then more or less between 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.869
 the 3,000 and 4,000 I created this peak 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.119
 then removed all the frequencies had 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.170
 over 4,000 hearts we are going to listen 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:05.830
 the difference between the normal item then 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.780
 without the applied equalization look 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.569
 they were actually running it now 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.579
 because I had problems 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:24.900
 format the computer and now with 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:26.639
 equalization activated another thing 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.400
 what you can do to make more 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.969
 realistic the sound of the phone call e 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.590
 to make the sound from stereo to 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:37.709
 monophonic another thing you can do 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.079
 it's adding a little background buzz 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.930
 there are various types of noises and they are 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.969
 cataloged with colors actually exists 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.150
 white noise the pink noise the 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:51.269
 brown noise I will leave you in description 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.159
 a link where you can read but 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.219
 especially listening to the various types of 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.709
 noises and I advise you to be careful 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:00.239
 when even when you talk on the phone 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.000
 when you lift your handset 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.879
 phone trying to figure out what the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.349
 noise that looks more like that 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.689
 of the phone call 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.879
