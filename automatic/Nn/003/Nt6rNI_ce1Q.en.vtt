all it is is the bail bender and you
take<00:01:32.510> a<00:01:32.540> blank<00:01:32.840> bail<00:01:33.080> stick<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.620> in<00:01:33.710> there<00:01:34.690> runs

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
take a blank bail stick it in there runs

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.300 
take a blank bail stick it in there runs
a<00:01:35.780> little<00:01:35.840> program<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.680> out<00:01:36.740> comes<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.130> bent

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
a little program and out comes a bent

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.400 
a little program and out comes a bent
fail<00:01:37.520> this<00:01:38.360> is<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.600> press<00:01:38.900> that<00:01:38.930> makes<00:01:39.590> those

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
fail this is the press that makes those

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.260 
fail this is the press that makes those
those<00:01:42.410> plates<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:42.950> saw<00:01:43.160> this<00:01:43.910> one<00:01:44.119> over

those plates that you saw this one over

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.820 
those plates that you saw this one over
here<00:01:44.300> is<00:01:44.570> actually<00:01:44.750> set<00:01:45.110> up<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.470> cut<00:01:45.650> out<00:01:45.800> the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
here is actually set up to cut out the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.890 
here is actually set up to cut out the
plate<00:01:46.190> what<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:46.550> do<00:01:46.640> is<00:01:47.000> I<00:01:47.119> have<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:47.510> fixture

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
plate what I do is I have this fixture

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.540 
plate what I do is I have this fixture
you<00:01:48.290> see<00:01:48.500> right<00:01:48.680> there<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.070> I<00:01:49.130> mount<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:49.460> up

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
you see right there and I mount it up

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.460 
you see right there and I mount it up
and<00:01:49.880> then<00:01:50.210> we<00:01:50.330> run<00:01:50.479> a<00:01:50.540> program<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.140> that's<00:01:51.260> me

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
and then we run a program and that's me

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.150 
and then we run a program and that's me
cut<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:51.710> out<00:01:51.920> that's<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.520> shape<00:01:52.729> of<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.940> plate

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
cut it out that's the shape of the plate

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.400 
cut it out that's the shape of the plate
hopefully<00:01:55.160> comes<00:01:55.430> off<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:56.660> feel<00:01:56.990> like<00:01:57.020> that

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
hopefully comes off and feel like that

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.670 
hopefully comes off and feel like that
is<00:01:58.150> it's<00:01:59.150> pretty<00:01:59.360> light<00:01:59.600> I'm<00:02:00.080> pretty<00:02:00.380> strong

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680
