hi<00:00:01.380> guys<00:00:01.589> so<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:02.419> few<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.449> you<00:00:03.629> have<00:00:03.720> emailed<00:00:04.080> me

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
hi guys so a few of you have emailed me

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.249 
hi guys so a few of you have emailed me
asking<00:00:04.410> me<00:00:04.740> four<00:00:04.980> types<00:00:05.970> for<00:00:06.450> my<00:00:06.870> version<00:00:07.080> of

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
asking me four types for my version of

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.070 
asking me four types for my version of
canon<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:07.770> d<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.719> unfortunately<00:00:09.719> i<00:00:09.750> can't

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
canon in d and unfortunately i can't

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.620 
canon in d and unfortunately i can't
read<00:00:10.440> or<00:00:10.590> write<00:00:10.620> tablature<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.820> i<00:00:11.849> decided<00:00:12.480> i'd

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
read or write tablature so i decided i'd

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.539 
read or write tablature so i decided i'd
uploaded<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> tutorial<00:00:13.320> video<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.280> i<00:00:14.400> hope

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
uploaded a tutorial video and i hope

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.090 
uploaded a tutorial video and i hope
that's<00:00:14.730> okay

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
that's okay

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.290 
that's okay
basically<00:00:17.100> everything<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.550> do<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.850> based<00:00:18.029> on

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
basically everything I do is based on

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.530 
basically everything I do is based on
this<00:00:18.449> chord<00:00:18.779> progression<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.529> d<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:23.090> B<00:00:24.090> minor

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
this chord progression it's d a B minor

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:35.250 
this chord progression it's d a B minor
f<00:00:26.230> sharp<00:00:26.290> minor<00:00:27.630> G<00:00:29.640> D<00:00:31.470> G<00:00:32.470> and<00:00:33.010> then<00:00:33.730> again<00:00:34.360> so<00:00:35.230> I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
f sharp minor G D G and then again so I

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.080 
f sharp minor G D G and then again so I
started<00:00:35.680> doing<00:00:35.890> harmonics<00:00:36.550> that's<00:00:36.940> the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
started doing harmonics that's the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.260 
started doing harmonics that's the
introduction<00:00:38.400> essentially<00:00:39.400> on<00:00:39.520> harmonic<00:00:40.090> is

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
introduction essentially on harmonic is

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.240 
introduction essentially on harmonic is
is<00:00:40.480> if<00:00:40.630> you<00:00:40.750> have<00:00:40.900> an<00:00:41.020> open<00:00:41.320> note<00:00:41.470> say<00:00:42.010> for

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
is if you have an open note say for

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.939 
is if you have an open note say for
instance<00:00:42.370> an<00:00:42.670> e<00:00:42.879> then<00:00:43.780> you<00:00:43.900> count<00:00:44.140> 12<00:00:44.680> frets

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
instance an e then you count 12 frets

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.070 
instance an e then you count 12 frets
above<00:00:45.190> that<00:00:45.400> note<00:00:45.640> so<00:00:45.879> 1<00:00:46.690> 2<00:00:47.050> 3<00:00:47.379> 4<00:00:47.860> 5<00:00:48.160> 6<00:00:48.520> 7<00:00:48.850> 8<00:00:49.239> 9<00:00:49.660> 10

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
above that note so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.750 
above that note so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11<00:00:50.379> 12<00:00:50.770> and<00:00:51.220> then<00:00:52.059> if<00:00:52.210> I<00:00:52.330> play<00:00:52.570> if<00:00:52.840> i<00:00:53.460> damp<00:00:54.460> the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
11 12 and then if I play if i damp the

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.330 
11 12 and then if I play if i damp the
string<00:00:55.030> lightly<00:00:55.540> on<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:55.989> twelfth<00:00:56.320> fret<00:00:56.470> and<00:00:56.739> i

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
string lightly on the twelfth fret and i

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.200 
string lightly on the twelfth fret and i
pluck<00:00:57.610> I<00:00:58.320> get<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.350> harmonic<00:00:59.830> and<00:01:00.010> that's<00:01:00.699> that's

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
pluck I get a harmonic and that's that's

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.000 
pluck I get a harmonic and that's that's
the<00:01:01.330> principle<00:01:01.780> pen<00:01:01.930> when<00:01:02.170> people<00:01:02.530> do<00:01:02.710> stuff

like<00:01:03.129> this<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:05.190> doesn't<00:01:06.190> have<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.340> be<00:01:06.520> the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
like this this doesn't have to be the

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.340 
like this this doesn't have to be the
truth<00:01:06.820> can<00:01:07.180> be<00:01:07.210> five<00:01:07.479> frets<00:01:07.720> above<00:01:07.990> as<00:01:08.170> well

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
truth can be five frets above as well

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.080 
truth can be five frets above as well
but<00:01:09.310> I<00:01:09.820> use<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.540> 12<00:01:10.780> also<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.580> if<00:01:12.729> you<00:01:12.850> playing

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
but I use the 12 also so if you playing

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.469 
but I use the 12 also so if you playing
basically<00:01:14.080> it's<00:01:14.260> an<00:01:14.380> insane<00:01:14.680> progression<00:01:15.310> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
basically it's an insane progression and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.250 
basically it's an insane progression and
as<00:01:16.479> opposed<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.500> playing

I'm playing the same notes but in
harmonic<00:01:41.600> form<00:01:41.870> so<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.580> mute<00:01:43.580> with<00:01:43.850> my<00:01:44.000> index

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270
