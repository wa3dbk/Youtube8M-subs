 against jamaica medicare and medicaid 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.980
 they are left with the best 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.980
 the complaint 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.150
 she is unique and Rodriguez the best 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.730
 400- meter Mexican runner with 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.160
 fences who really is the queen of 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.410
 the obstacles for both his life and 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.320
 his sports career are marked by 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.239
 adversity as a juvenile competing 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.460
 National Cleaner found out he was 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.530
 pregnant and left athletics for the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.110
 arrival of hita we come to think that 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.360
 that not that I am that I had already 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.180
 stayed there because I was already a mother 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.610
 then I already had a responsibility 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.850
 that my son did not study had to 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.469
 see by then I was very 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.750
 sad because I will not be able to 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.910
 I will not be able to study anymore 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.800
 time later the coach cosme 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.680
 Rodríguez invites her to return to 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.680
 tracks 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.630
 but 2009 marks his life was 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.110
 triumphing in an Olympics without 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.570
 But a few days later this one 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.130
 learned of the tragic news that my 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.740
 son loses his life in an accident and 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.060
 it was a very hard year very difficult what 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.070
 What else I would like in this world is 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:33.050
 have it back good but I 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.810
 I know that will never be able to be 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.090
 Y 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.549
 despite the pain its dam and it results and in 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.740
 the Central American Games of 2010 wins 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.450
 medals but they are removed and the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.450
 Suspend for a double tax 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.820
 my team 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.600
 he fulfills the punishment and after years of 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.750
 effort in 2014 breaks the record 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.120
 Mexican 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.100
 from there I said I'll never go back to 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.930
 distrust what I can make a 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.970
 new obstacle presents itself during its 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.970
 preparation for veracruz 2014 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.480
 It was a fall that left me with a lot 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.110
 fear because nothing else were scratches 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.569
 it was a loss of consciousness in the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.940
 hit that I hit in the head despite the 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.890
 cervical sprain your dike and earn gold and 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.099
 raise your hand to heaven to provide the 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.150
 triumph to his son I always dedicated him to 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.489
 his memory every event I can 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.370
 do it and I do it really with many 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.290
 you win because I do not want I do not want 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.610
 dedicate a career that is not worth the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.180
 and the only thing that could have happened to me 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.130
 sunk was the death of my son 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.569
 and that I did not have it close but that 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.209
 there was going to be another bigger pain for 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.090
 me then whenever something happens to me 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.480
 I remember that this is not anything anymore 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.540
 I'm not strong, I'm living it and 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.610
 I'm learning to live with it 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.610
