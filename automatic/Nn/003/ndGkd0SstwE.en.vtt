00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.550
 hello everybody with you rekent and today I 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:13.610
 I will show you how to configure the x2 emulator pc 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.770
 build 5450 version 100 last 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.260
 looked all sorts of 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.689
 videos on youtube and on the internet in 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.699
 google and yandex setting honestly 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.869
 say intelligent don't say anything 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.730
 I offer you my version of customization 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.910
 turn on and then I'll show you right away 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.480
 This is an example of all the settings go 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.610
 emulation settings let's start with 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.059
 building and and ah pi 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.190
 so you should be standing like this 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.950
 meanings and that bold average chop font 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.699
 zero 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.160
 rivers player rekam 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:01.800
 you can't touch anything here 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:04.010
 setting in the mind is all sorts of sounds too 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.270
 we leave even the premises 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.340
 most games work with standard 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.650
 settings 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.100
 further frame limit off limit 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.200
 frames do not need here just 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.780
 set the base value to 100 percent 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.290
 deceleration factor 50 and ratio 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.390
 acceleration 200 pairs opus frame off 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.270
 use their chronization enable 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.020
 the output from the data is not necessary here 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.890
 remember 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:37.049
 g with a window this is a window in which you have 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.049
 will serve not recorded window sizes 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.990
 shorter aspect ratio 4 by 300 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.640
 an increase of 100 percent hide the window in 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.079
 double click pause mode 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.590
 go to full screen 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.280
 the mode needs nothing more 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:57.990
 sleeping hacks what kind of garbage speed up the work 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.759
 emulator and some i love you 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.149
 I advise you to turn off sleeping hacks 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.210
 Yes, because it is an account or a computer 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.850
 send you either all the rest 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.390
 Greig has also unfolding here khaki 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.300
 such 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.380
 for some games, too, if you 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.050
 games not included 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.530
 You have no such games 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.430
 which are specified do not need to include here 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.360
 me off 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:33.190
 so here you set up the bios setting 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:39.709
 bios and offer here a little list 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:44.720
 bios and here i am looking at the versions here 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:47.810
 version 2 and 2 2006 newest i 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.640
 leave plugins plugins customize 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.280
 look like 2g with the first for the weak 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.340
 computers in old old then goes 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:04.720
 but there are two such mediocre ones 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:07.940
 powerful so here i put duck normal 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.310
 will bring to further all leave 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.959
 base value first or whatever 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:19.130
 you have nothing here anymore 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.530
 Next is the video settings customization 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.760
 plug 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.230
 opens a window like this if you 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.420
 windows 7 or vista 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:35.470
 you had better install x3 d11 or 10 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:41.180
 hardwar this is the best option 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:43.910
 on it you will shake shorter screen 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.950
 on f5 pro and knife and honestly say 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.769
 I did not notice any difference when I 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.230
 Get out and put who is next Original 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:56.450
 ps resolution is this setting 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.019
 original ps is better to put nativ on 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.200
 tilde 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.450
 or you yourself will come to specify the size 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.000
 further not to touch anything here 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.420
 put olga texture about filters and all 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.329
 here we go to the sound setting 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.769
 sound plug 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.440
 module here voly do not touch anything 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.200
 On the side, open 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.410
 even writes 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.470
 I recommend on the slide put nys here 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.720
 adjust the volume 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.919
 put the recommended parameters here 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.060
 put the most optimal stereo 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.000
 so we go further settings 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.750
 I see a lot of joysticks 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.010
 devices a few few devices 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.130
 translate first I have configured 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.960
 joystick 2 beads and keyboard will be with 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.230
 brother played 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.780
 set it up just like that further with us 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.840
 go here these don't touch everything here anymore 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.200
 do not need anything so the console can not 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.830
 display choices sit go and all that 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:11.560

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:15.139
 run now i'll show you work 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:18.680
 Of course you need to understand that this is an emulator 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:22.540
 playstation what games like she herself 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:25.760

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:32.300

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:11.949
