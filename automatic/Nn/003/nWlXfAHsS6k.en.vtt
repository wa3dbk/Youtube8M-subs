00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.090 
let's do that with the three wound
strings<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:18.990> other<00:01:19.170> words<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> E<00:01:19.560> string

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
strings so in other words the E string

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.060 
strings so in other words the E string
the<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> string<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> D<00:01:21.360> string<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.229> don't

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the a string and the D string I don't

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.560

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.450 
like doing this too hard on the three
smaller<00:01:25.439> strings<00:01:25.799> because<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.430> might

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
smaller strings because then you might

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.520 
smaller strings because then you might
get<00:01:26.729> some<00:01:27.000> snapping<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.990> could<00:01:28.140> kink<00:01:28.380> them

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530

those<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:47.159> now<00:01:47.310> after<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.450> once

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
those up so now after you do that once

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.819 
those up so now after you do that once
what<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.210> go<00:01:51.600> through<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.960> tune<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.680> up

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
what we do is go through and tune it up

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.630 
what we do is go through and tune it up
again<00:01:54.290> usually<00:01:55.290> they'll<00:01:55.680> drop<00:01:55.950> about<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.310> half

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
again usually they'll drop about a half

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.080 
again usually they'll drop about a half
step<00:01:57.770> alright<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.670> check<00:01:59.880> each

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
step alright so I want to check each

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.560 
step alright so I want to check each
string<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.340> bring<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.460> back<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.240> their

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
string and bring it back up to their

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.740 
string and bring it back up to their
normal<00:02:03.810> pitches<00:02:04.409> now<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.520> notice<00:02:05.909> one

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
normal pitches now if you notice one

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.940 
normal pitches now if you notice one
thing<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:06.990> happens<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> Floyd<00:02:07.890> Rose

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
thing that happens with a Floyd Rose

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.390 
thing that happens with a Floyd Rose
system<00:02:08.670> or<00:02:09.179> any<00:02:09.330> floating<00:02:09.750> bridge<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.410> can

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
system or any floating bridge as I can

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.880 
system or any floating bridge as I can
run<00:02:11.670> up<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.360> others<00:02:12.690> will<00:02:12.959> adjust

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
run up the others will adjust

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.320 
run up the others will adjust
so<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.160> kind<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.400> got<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.640> go<00:02:14.730> through<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> few

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
so you kind of got to go through a few

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.760 
so you kind of got to go through a few
times<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.980> make<00:02:17.160> sure<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.400> they<00:02:17.520> all<00:02:17.700> sit

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
times to make sure that they all sit

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.370 
times to make sure that they all sit
right<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:20.010> tune<00:02:20.690> because<00:02:21.690> this<00:02:21.930> will<00:02:22.080> be<00:02:22.170> lower

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
right in tune because this will be lower

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.910 
right in tune because this will be lower
again<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:22.830> I'll<00:02:22.920> bring<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.220> up<00:02:24.650> what<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.680> like

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
again so I'll bring this up what I like

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.040 
again so I'll bring this up what I like
to<00:02:26.070> do<00:02:26.250> when<00:02:26.490> they<00:02:26.580> get<00:02:26.730> close<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.720> being<00:02:27.930> in

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
to do when they get close to being in

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.770 
to do when they get close to being in
pitch<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:28.620> I'll<00:02:29.010> tune<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> e<00:02:29.760> string<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.540> then

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
pitch is I'll tune the e string and then

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.960 
pitch is I'll tune the e string and then
the<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.900> string<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.590> then<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.160> do<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.490> E<00:02:32.520> string

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
the a string and then I do the E string

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.970 
the a string and then I do the E string
again<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> string<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.200> then<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.380> D<00:02:34.650> string

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
again the a string and then the D string

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.330 
again the a string and then the D string
and<00:02:35.100> then<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.850> e<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:36.300> D<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:36.870> G<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:38.070> way<00:02:38.280> you

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
and then the e a D and G that way you

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.220 
and then the e a D and G that way you
keep<00:02:38.640> checking<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.210> bigger<00:02:39.420> strings<00:02:39.840> as<00:02:40.080> you

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
keep checking the bigger strings as you

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.630 
keep checking the bigger strings as you
tune<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:41.070> usually<00:02:41.459> helps<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:43.340> get<00:02:44.340> them<00:02:44.520> in

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
tune and it usually helps to get them in

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:56.180 
tune and it usually helps to get them in
tune<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.090> sit<00:02:45.330> well<00:02:54.709> okay<00:02:55.709> we<00:02:55.890> don't<00:02:56.040> have<00:02:56.130> to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
tune and sit well okay we don't have to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.440 
tune and sit well okay we don't have to
be<00:02:56.310> exact<00:02:56.930> just<00:02:57.930> get<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.170> close<00:02:59.180> because<00:03:00.180> what

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
be exact just get it close because what

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.780 
be exact just get it close because what
I<00:03:00.480> like<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.810> do<00:03:01.020> is<00:03:01.200> do<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.220> stretching

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
I like to do is do this stretching

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.870 
I like to do is do this stretching
exercise<00:03:03.239> usually<00:03:03.780> about<00:03:03.930> three<00:03:04.320> times

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
exercise usually about three times

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.340 
exercise usually about three times
usually<00:03:05.880> after<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.300> third<00:03:06.690> time<00:03:06.720> or<00:03:07.170> by<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
usually after the third time or by the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.949 
usually after the third time or by the
third<00:03:07.709> time<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.760> don't<00:03:08.880> see<00:03:09.209> them<00:03:09.390> slip<00:03:09.750> too

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
third time you don't see them slip too

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:17.170 
third time you don't see them slip too
much<00:03:10.140> okay<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:14.900> see<00:03:15.900> how<00:03:16.050> I'm<00:03:16.140> doing<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.530> here

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
much okay so see how I'm doing this here

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.850 
much okay so see how I'm doing this here
work<00:03:18.180> your<00:03:18.209> way<00:03:18.420> all<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.630> way<00:03:18.750> down<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.680> the

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
work your way all the way down to the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.890 
work your way all the way down to the
lower<00:03:20.070> frets<00:03:20.640> there<00:03:20.970> with<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.480> higher<00:03:21.630> frets

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
lower frets there with the higher frets

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:30.100 
lower frets there with the higher frets
rather<00:03:25.519> all<00:03:26.519> right<00:03:27.650> give<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.680> little<00:03:28.830> tug<00:03:29.190> and

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
rather all right give a little tug and

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.270 
rather all right give a little tug and
retune<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.260> once<00:03:31.620> again

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.830 

so<00:03:39.280> again<00:03:39.490> we're<00:03:39.670> making<00:03:39.700> major<00:03:40.150> adjustments

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
so again we're making major adjustments

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.870 
so again we're making major adjustments
in<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.020> tuning<00:03:41.380> now<00:03:41.560> while<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.370> strings<00:03:42.730> are

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
in the tuning now while the strings are

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.870 
in the tuning now while the strings are
not<00:03:43.060> locked<00:03:43.390> down<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:45.040> once<00:03:45.430> we<00:03:45.580> get<00:03:45.700> this

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
not locked down and once we get this

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.580 
not locked down and once we get this
right<00:03:46.270> on<00:03:47.040> lock<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:48.220> down<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:49.410> then<00:03:50.410> we

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
right on lock it down and then we

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.650 
right on lock it down and then we
fine-tune<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.460> with<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.700> fine<00:03:51.940> tuning<00:03:52.390> pegs

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
fine-tune it with the fine tuning pegs

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.020 
fine-tune it with the fine tuning pegs
at<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:52.990> back<00:03:53.200> of<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.440> guitar

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
at the back of the guitar

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:08.220 
at the back of the guitar
[Music]

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.920 

[Music]

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.800 

now<00:04:12.739> you'll<00:04:12.980> notice<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.640> after<00:04:13.879> you<00:04:14.540> lock

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
now you'll notice that after you lock

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.280 
now you'll notice that after you lock
the<00:04:15.379> strings<00:04:15.739> down<00:04:16.570> they<00:04:17.570> might<00:04:17.780> adjust<00:04:18.169> a

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
the strings down they might adjust a

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.539 
the strings down they might adjust a
little<00:04:18.470> bit<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:18.919> that's<00:04:19.040> again<00:04:19.310> what<00:04:19.459> the

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
little bit and that's again what the

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.759 
little bit and that's again what the
fine<00:04:19.790> tuners<00:04:20.180> are<00:04:20.299> for<00:04:20.539> so<00:04:21.199> now<00:04:21.380> I<00:04:21.410> got<00:04:21.650> the

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
fine tuners are for so now I got the

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.150 
fine tuners are for so now I got the
string<00:04:22.039> so<00:04:22.220> that<00:04:22.250> they're<00:04:22.520> all<00:04:23.919> tuned<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.070> way

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
string so that they're all tuned the way

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.040 
string so that they're all tuned the way
they<00:04:25.310> should<00:04:25.370> be<00:04:25.580> so<00:04:26.300> now<00:04:26.570> I'm<00:04:26.660> gonna<00:04:26.750> take<00:04:26.990> my

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
they should be so now I'm gonna take my

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.680 
they should be so now I'm gonna take my
wrench<00:04:27.500> here<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.009> lock<00:04:28.759> these<00:04:29.030> back<00:04:29.389> down

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
wrench here and lock these back down

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.140 
wrench here and lock these back down
just<00:04:29.990> like<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.889> back<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.430> guitar<00:04:31.580> you

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
just like the back of the guitar you

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.850 
just like the back of the guitar you
wanted<00:04:32.449> it<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:32.600> know<00:04:32.840> lock<00:04:33.080> down<00:04:33.320> so<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:33.560> feel

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
wanted it you know lock down so you feel

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.920 
wanted it you know lock down so you feel
a<00:04:34.220> good<00:04:34.699> amount<00:04:35.090> of<00:04:35.150> pressure<00:04:35.330> but<00:04:35.660> don't<00:04:35.840> go

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
a good amount of pressure but don't go

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.710 
a good amount of pressure but don't go
too<00:04:35.990> crazy<00:04:37.060> because<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.270> doesn't<00:04:38.509> need<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.690> be

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
too crazy because it doesn't need to be

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.409 
too crazy because it doesn't need to be
that<00:04:38.810> tense<00:04:39.460> but<00:04:40.460> just<00:04:40.669> make<00:04:40.789> sure<00:04:40.910> you<00:04:41.030> get

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
that tense but just make sure you get

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.749 
that tense but just make sure you get
some<00:04:41.600> good<00:04:41.780> tension<00:04:42.590> there<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:42.919> they<00:04:43.520> should

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
some good tension there and they should

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.939 
some good tension there and they should
hold<00:04:43.880> just<00:04:44.120> fine<00:04:44.419> so<00:04:45.410> we're<00:04:45.560> going<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.740> tighten

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
hold just fine so we're going to tighten

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.629 
hold just fine so we're going to tighten
down<00:04:46.039> all<00:04:46.160> three<00:04:47.199> all<00:04:48.199> right<00:04:48.310> now<00:04:49.310> we're<00:04:49.550> going

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
down all three all right now we're going

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.290 
down all three all right now we're going
to<00:04:49.729> check<00:04:49.970> this<00:04:50.090> again<00:04:50.449> and<00:04:51.850> if<00:04:52.850> you<00:04:52.940> look<00:04:53.150> at

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
to check this again and if you look at

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.060 
to check this again and if you look at
you<00:04:53.479> know<00:04:53.510> my<00:04:53.750> e<00:04:53.780> right<00:04:54.289> here<00:04:54.530> slipped<00:04:54.979> a

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
you know my e right here slipped a

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.640 
you know my e right here slipped a
little<00:04:55.449> same<00:04:56.449> with<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.720> a<00:04:56.750> but<00:04:57.139> it<00:04:57.260> shouldn't

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
little same with the a but it shouldn't

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.029 
little same with the a but it shouldn't
go<00:04:57.800> too<00:04:57.860> much<00:04:58.330> so<00:04:59.330> now<00:04:59.510> what<00:04:59.750> we<00:04:59.870> do<00:05:00.080> is<00:05:00.350> move<00:05:00.710> to

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
go too much so now what we do is move to

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.129 
go too much so now what we do is move to
the<00:05:01.160> back<00:05:01.550> of<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:01.820> guitar<00:05:04.599> where<00:05:05.599> we<00:05:05.750> adjust

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
the back of the guitar where we adjust

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:15.189 
the back of the guitar where we adjust
our<00:05:06.260> fine<00:05:06.620> tuners<00:05:11.590> good<00:05:13.180> ok<00:05:14.180> so<00:05:14.780> now<00:05:14.960> this<00:05:15.139> is

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
our fine tuners good ok so now this is

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.640 
our fine tuners good ok so now this is
where<00:05:15.410> you<00:05:15.470> want<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.710> try<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:15.949> get<00:05:16.039> it<00:05:16.160> exact

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
where you want to try and get it exact

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.600 
where you want to try and get it exact
so<00:05:20.020> you<00:05:21.020> go<00:05:21.169> usually<00:05:21.410> you<00:05:21.680> go<00:05:21.800> clockwise<00:05:22.099> to

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
so you go usually you go clockwise to

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.469 
so you go usually you go clockwise to
tighten<00:05:22.849> it<00:05:23.150> and<00:05:23.270> get<00:05:23.419> it<00:05:23.539> higher<00:05:25.389> should<00:05:26.389> get

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
tighten it and get it higher should get

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.839 
tighten it and get it higher should get
that<00:05:26.630> right<00:05:26.840> on<00:05:26.870> okay<00:05:27.320> cool<00:05:27.710> and<00:05:27.919> then<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:28.520> a

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.909 

now<00:05:31.849> these<00:05:32.120> don't<00:05:32.539> really<00:05:32.840> adjust<00:05:33.470> you<00:05:33.800> know

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
now these don't really adjust you know

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.399 
now these don't really adjust you know
if<00:05:34.010> I<00:05:34.099> tighten<00:05:34.430> one<00:05:34.760> string<00:05:35.120> the<00:05:35.750> other<00:05:35.780> string

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
if I tighten one string the other string

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:37.990 
if I tighten one string the other string
usually<00:05:36.770> doesn't<00:05:36.949> adjust<00:05:37.340> much<00:05:37.639> which<00:05:37.880> is

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
usually doesn't adjust much which is

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.760 
usually doesn't adjust much which is
what<00:05:38.120> you<00:05:38.240> want<00:05:38.510> because<00:05:38.780> this<00:05:39.530> is<00:05:39.680> the

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
what you want because this is the

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:47.189 
what you want because this is the
fine-tuning<00:05:40.070> phase<00:05:44.110> so<00:05:45.110> go<00:05:45.229> through<00:05:45.440> each<00:05:45.560> one

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
fine-tuning phase so go through each one

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.290 
fine-tuning phase so go through each one
making<00:05:48.199> sure<00:05:48.229> they're<00:05:48.650> right<00:05:48.830> on

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
making sure they're right on

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.959 
making sure they're right on

okay<00:06:08.729> again<00:06:09.729> this<00:06:09.879> is<00:06:10.029> kind<00:06:10.149> of<00:06:10.269> your<00:06:10.360> final

okay again this is kind of your final

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:12.389 
okay again this is kind of your final
test<00:06:10.959> if<00:06:11.259> you<00:06:11.319> stay<00:06:11.559> in<00:06:11.619> tune<00:06:11.919> after<00:06:12.129> you<00:06:12.279> do

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:12.399 
test if you stay in tune after you do

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:15.299 
test if you stay in tune after you do
this<00:06:12.549> stuff<00:06:12.909> you<00:06:13.749> know<00:06:13.779> you<00:06:13.959> got<00:06:14.309> everything

00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:15.309 
this stuff you know you got everything

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:19.379 
this stuff you know you got everything
set<00:06:15.549> up<00:06:15.579> right<00:06:17.339> all<00:06:18.339> right<00:06:18.489> no<00:06:18.759> just<00:06:19.119> a<00:06:19.239> little

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
set up right all right no just a little

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:20.909 
set up right all right no just a little
bit<00:06:19.569> so<00:06:20.049> again<00:06:20.259> this<00:06:20.379> is<00:06:20.499> where<00:06:20.589> you<00:06:20.709> kind<00:06:20.799> of

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
bit so again this is where you kind of

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:24.449 
bit so again this is where you kind of
want<00:06:20.979> to<00:06:21.099> go<00:06:21.249> through<00:06:21.639> and<00:06:23.219> fine-tune<00:06:24.219> it<00:06:24.339> one

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:24.459 
want to go through and fine-tune it one

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:30.359 
want to go through and fine-tune it one
more<00:06:24.639> time<00:06:28.439> because<00:06:29.439> again<00:06:29.799> they'll<00:06:30.009> stretch

00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:30.369 
more time because again they'll stretch

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:31.889 
more time because again they'll stretch
a<00:06:30.399> little<00:06:30.639> bit<00:06:30.879> so<00:06:31.029> you<00:06:31.149> got<00:06:31.269> to<00:06:31.360> double-check

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:31.899 
a little bit so you got to double-check

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:38.009 
a little bit so you got to double-check
it<00:06:32.229> and<00:06:32.379> sometimes<00:06:33.599> if<00:06:34.799> you<00:06:36.749> need<00:06:37.749> to<00:06:37.839> keep

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:38.019 
it and sometimes if you need to keep

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:40.199 
it and sometimes if you need to keep
loosing<00:06:38.469> it<00:06:38.679> up<00:06:38.799> and<00:06:39.069> you<00:06:39.129> run<00:06:39.309> out<00:06:39.369> of<00:06:39.489> room<00:06:39.639> to

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:40.209 
loosing it up and you run out of room to

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:43.079 
loosing it up and you run out of room to
to<00:06:40.899> keep<00:06:41.079> fine-tuning<00:06:41.379> it<00:06:41.860> open<00:06:42.759> the<00:06:42.849> locks

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:43.089 
to keep fine-tuning it open the locks

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:45.719 
to keep fine-tuning it open the locks
back<00:06:43.360> up<00:06:43.569> on<00:06:43.719> the<00:06:43.839> on<00:06:44.079> the<00:06:44.289> on<00:06:45.069> the<00:06:45.279> nut<00:06:45.489> and

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729 
back up on the on the on the nut and
