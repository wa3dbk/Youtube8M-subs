glue<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.060> scissors<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.840> that's<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.580> we<00:00:20.580> began

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
glue and scissors and that's it we began

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.779 
glue and scissors and that's it we began
by<00:00:21.150> drawing<00:00:21.210> our<00:00:21.810> hands<00:00:22.289> by<00:00:23.160> tracing<00:00:23.490> our

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
by drawing our hands by tracing our

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.390 
by drawing our hands by tracing our
hands<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.539> our<00:00:24.840> arm<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:27.260> on<00:00:28.260> an<00:00:28.890> orange<00:00:29.130> paper

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
hands and our arm and on an orange paper

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.179 
hands and our arm and on an orange paper
then<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.119> cut<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.449> out

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
then we cut it out

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.130 
then we cut it out
that's<00:00:32.189> funny<00:00:32.460> again<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.570> bigger<00:00:33.870> as

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
that's funny again this one is bigger as

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.299 
that's funny again this one is bigger as
you<00:00:34.170> can<00:00:34.469> see<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.149> then<00:00:36.829> we<00:00:37.829> cut<00:00:38.010> up<00:00:38.040> some

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
you can see and then we cut up some

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.180 
you can see and then we cut up some
different<00:00:38.760> color<00:00:38.940> circles<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.829> two<00:00:40.950> kids

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190

cut<00:00:41.489> out<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.820> petals<00:00:42.420> which<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.350> just

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
cut out little petals which they just

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.760 
cut out little petals which they just
dip<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.940> circle<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.750> they<00:00:45.899> cut<00:00:46.170> little<00:00:46.350> slits

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
dip the circle and they cut little slits

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130 
dip the circle and they cut little slits
around<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:48.030> told<00:00:48.539> them<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.719> make<00:00:48.989> sure

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
around it just told them to make sure

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.779 
around it just told them to make sure
not<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.500> cut<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.860> way<00:00:50.010> into<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> middle

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
not to cut all the way into the middle

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.350 
not to cut all the way into the middle
so<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:51.840> did<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:54.980> then<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.520> our<00:00:56.550> styrofoam

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
so they did that then with our styrofoam

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.510 
so they did that then with our styrofoam
balls<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.899> cut<00:00:58.140> them<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.410> half<00:00:58.620> with<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> knife

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
balls I cut them in half with a knife

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.529 
balls I cut them in half with a knife
and<00:01:00.390> then<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.109> painted<00:01:01.530> them<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:03.239> they<00:01:03.359> may

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
and then they painted them so they may

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.730 
and then they painted them so they may
look<00:01:03.660> nice<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.140> shiny<00:01:05.090> as<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.740> and
