00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
the next like that and you're going to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.250 
the next like that and you're going to
work<00:03:12.860> this<00:03:13.130> pattern<00:03:13.550> all<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.820> way<00:03:14.000> around<00:03:14.260> the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
work this pattern all the way around the

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.520 
work this pattern all the way around the
bottom<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:16.670> front<00:03:17.000> around<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.990> neck<00:03:18.170> down

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.820 
bottom the front around the neck down
the<00:03:18.680> other<00:03:18.800> side<00:03:19.480> okay<00:03:20.480> I've<00:03:20.720> made<00:03:20.780> my<00:03:21.440> loops

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
the other side okay I've made my loops

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.020 
the other side okay I've made my loops
all<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.310> way<00:03:22.430> around

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
all the way around

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.910 
all the way around
and<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.540> make<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.840> last<00:03:24.050> loop<00:03:24.380> I'm<00:03:24.590> going<00:03:24.800> to

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
and to make the last loop I'm going to

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.880 
and to make the last loop I'm going to
chain<00:03:25.220> two<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:27.320> I'm<00:03:27.440> going<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.680> double

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
chain two and I'm going to double

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.350 
chain two and I'm going to double
crochet<00:03:28.130> in<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.790> base<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.239> that<00:03:29.540> first<00:03:31.989> loop

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
crochet in the base of that first loop

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.780 
crochet in the base of that first loop
like<00:03:35.360> that<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:35.930> that<00:03:36.380> is<00:03:36.650> simply<00:03:37.010> so<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.580> I

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
like that and that is simply so that I

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.330 
like that and that is simply so that I
wind<00:03:38.060> up<00:03:38.239> in<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.780> center<00:03:39.170> of<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.350> loop<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.280> to

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
wind up in the center of a loop so to

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.340 
wind up in the center of a loop so to
make<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.700> next<00:03:40.910> row<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.239> loops<00:03:41.540> I'm<00:03:41.870> going<00:03:42.170> to

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
make the next row of loops I'm going to

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.250 
make the next row of loops I'm going to
single<00:03:43.220> crochet<00:03:43.340> in<00:03:43.700> that<00:03:44.269> same<00:03:44.750> loop<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.200> I

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
single crochet in that same loop that I

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.620 
single crochet in that same loop that I
just<00:03:45.530> formed<00:03:45.980> going<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:46.970> chain<00:03:47.300> three<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:49.630> I'm

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
just formed going to chain three and I'm

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.509 
just formed going to chain three and I'm
going<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:50.930> single<00:03:51.200> crochet<00:03:51.440> in<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:52.190> next<00:03:52.220> loop

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
going to single crochet in the next loop

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.890 
going to single crochet in the next loop
chain<00:03:55.519> 3<00:03:57.519> single<00:03:58.519> crochet<00:03:59.150> in<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.780> next<00:03:59.810> loop

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
chain 3 single crochet in the next loop

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.630 
chain 3 single crochet in the next loop
like<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:03.170> and<00:04:03.470> that's<00:04:03.680> making<00:04:03.950> my<00:04:04.220> second

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
like that and that's making my second

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.610 
like that and that's making my second
row<00:04:04.790> of<00:04:04.850> loops<00:04:05.090> there's<00:04:05.540> my<00:04:05.750> first<00:04:06.049> row<00:04:06.350> and

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
row of loops there's my first row and

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.960 
row of loops there's my first row and
here's<00:04:06.950> my<00:04:07.160> second<00:04:07.610> row

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.690 

okay<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.180> have<00:04:12.510> done<00:04:12.750> three<00:04:13.409> rows<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:14.040> loops<00:04:14.400> all

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
okay I have done three rows of loops all

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.939 
okay I have done three rows of loops all
around<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.720> can<00:04:15.930> make<00:04:16.049> as<00:04:16.199> many<00:04:16.380> rows<00:04:16.709> as<00:04:16.919> you

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
around you can make as many rows as you

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.860 
around you can make as many rows as you
like<00:04:17.280> now<00:04:17.790> I'm<00:04:17.880> going<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.209> proceed<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.630> the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
like now I'm going to proceed to the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:27.379 
like now I'm going to proceed to the
last<00:04:18.989> step

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.020 

last<00:04:27.629> row<00:04:28.020> you're<00:04:28.740> going<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:29.219> in<00:04:29.430> each<00:04:29.699> loop

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
last row you're going to in each loop

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.689 
last row you're going to in each loop
you're<00:04:30.330> going<00:04:30.539> to<00:04:30.659> do<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:31.020> shell<00:04:31.499> so<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.460> shell

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
you're going to do a shell so the shell

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.640 
you're going to do a shell so the shell
is<00:04:32.849> going<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.240> consist<00:04:33.689> of<00:04:33.930> one<00:04:34.319> single

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
is going to consist of one single

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:46.309 
is going to consist of one single
crochet

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.730

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
crochet like that in every loop all the

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.719 
crochet like that in every loop all the
way<00:04:55.360> around<00:04:55.840> you're<00:04:56.650> going<00:04:56.889> to<00:04:57.039> do<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.370> same

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
way around you're going to do the same

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:04.230 
way around you're going to do the same
show<00:04:59.250> so<00:05:00.250> single<00:05:00.970> crochet<00:05:02.490> three<00:05:03.490> double

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
show so single crochet three double

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:12.020 
show so single crochet three double
crochets

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.270 

single<00:05:12.900> crochet

worked the row of shelf stitches all the

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.860 
worked the row of shelf stitches all the
way<00:05:26.480> around<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:27.740> as<00:05:27.860> you<00:05:28.010> can<00:05:28.160> see<00:05:28.430> this<00:05:29.090> loopy

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870

would like of double crochets and then

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.390 
would like of double crochets and then
again<00:06:03.120> at<00:06:03.360> the<00:06:04.020> end<00:06:04.199> of<00:06:04.409> the<00:06:04.530> sleeve<00:06:04.800> add<00:06:05.069> the
