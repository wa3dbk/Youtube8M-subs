main<00:00:21.480> bore<00:00:21.750> because<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.410> was<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.160> cheapest

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
main bore because it was the cheapest

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.630 
main bore because it was the cheapest
mainboard<00:00:24.240> which<00:00:24.449> had<00:00:25.130> four<00:00:26.130> SATA<00:00:26.550> ports<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
mainboard which had four SATA ports and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.389 
mainboard which had four SATA ports and
it<00:00:29.640> has<00:00:29.820> everything<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.480> need

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
it has everything I need

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:48.709 
it has everything I need
so<00:00:33.559> let's<00:00:34.559> look<00:00:34.829> what's<00:00:35.399> inside<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:47.719> they

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
so let's look what's inside and they

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.020 
so let's look what's inside and they
give<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.140> also<00:00:49.430> one<00:00:50.430> SATA<00:00:51.180> cable<00:00:52.430> one<00:00:53.430> IDE

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
give you also one SATA cable one IDE

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.779 
give you also one SATA cable one IDE
