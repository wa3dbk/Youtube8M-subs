a look here at orange we look at the

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.130 
a look here at orange we look at the
types<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.119> technology<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.960> could

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
types of technology that we could

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.839 
types of technology that we could
potentially<00:00:25.710> use<00:00:25.829> in<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.039> future<00:00:26.249> to<00:00:26.609> power<00:00:26.820> a

last<00:00:29.279> year<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.789> developed<00:00:30.239> the<00:00:30.419> power<00:00:30.689> wellies

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
last year we developed the power wellies

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.569 
last year we developed the power wellies
which<00:00:31.499> we<00:00:31.649> tested<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.130> Glastonbury

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
which we tested at the Glastonbury

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.700 
which we tested at the Glastonbury
Festival<00:00:32.690> they<00:00:33.690> charged<00:00:34.079> your<00:00:34.230> mobile<00:00:34.500> phone

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
Festival they charged your mobile phone

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.650 
Festival they charged your mobile phone
while<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.070> walked<00:00:35.280> around<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.730> site<00:00:35.970> this

while you walked around the site this

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.420 
while you walked around the site this
year<00:00:36.720> we've<00:00:37.200> decided<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.710> look<00:00:37.830> at<00:00:38.010> how<00:00:38.160> design

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
year we've decided to look at how design

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.610 
year we've decided to look at how design
can<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.730> used<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:39.210> charging<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.080> technology

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

called
piezoelectric<00:00:43.500> film<00:00:44.010> which<00:00:44.220> is<00:00:44.430> very

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
piezoelectric film which is very

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.570 
piezoelectric film which is very
commonly<00:00:45.150> found<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.720> home<00:00:46.440> -<00:00:46.620> speakers<00:00:47.190> modern

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
commonly found in home - speakers modern

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.600 
commonly found in home - speakers modern
-<00:00:47.790> speakers<00:00:48.270> basically<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.260> takes<00:00:49.950> sound

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
- speakers basically it takes sound

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490 
- speakers basically it takes sound
pressure<00:00:50.880> waves<00:00:51.150> and<00:00:51.450> turns<00:00:52.290> it<00:00:52.440> into

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
pressure waves and turns it into

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.380 
pressure waves and turns it into
electrical<00:00:53.220> charge<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.790> electric<00:00:54.150> charge

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
electrical charge that electric charge

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.660 
electrical charge that electric charge
is<00:00:54.570> then<00:00:54.720> stored<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.890> reservoir<00:00:56.190> battery

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
is then stored in a reservoir battery

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.340 
is then stored in a reservoir battery
and<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.150> reservoir<00:00:57.480> battery<00:00:57.840> then<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.140> turn

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and the reservoir battery then in turn

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.350 
and the reservoir battery then in turn
charges<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.860> mobile<00:00:59.130> device<00:00:59.370> we<00:01:00.120> chose<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
charges the mobile device we chose a

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.660 
charges the mobile device we chose a
t-shirt<00:01:00.750> because<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.920> everyday<00:01:02.340> item

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
t-shirt because it's a everyday item

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.039 
t-shirt because it's a everyday item
that<00:01:02.850> everyone<00:01:03.150> will<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.690> Buster

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
that everyone will have that Buster

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.870 
that everyone will have that Buster
Murray<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.619> also<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.519> has<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.670> large

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
Murray and also because it has a large

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.730 
Murray and also because it has a large
surface<00:01:06.150> area<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.810> we'll<00:01:06.960> get<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> lot<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.500> sound

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
surface area so we'll get a lot of sound

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.590 
surface area so we'll get a lot of sound
waves<00:01:08.010> received<00:01:08.520> by<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.760> piezoelectric<00:01:09.090> film

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
waves received by the piezoelectric film

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.780 
waves received by the piezoelectric film
and<00:01:09.810> therefore<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.440> lot<00:01:10.620> charge<00:01:10.890> created<00:01:11.340> we've

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and therefore a lot charge created we've

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.399 
and therefore a lot charge created we've
designed<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.300> sound<00:01:12.570> charge<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> be<00:01:13.110> able<00:01:13.230> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
designed the sound charge to be able to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.380 
designed the sound charge to be able to
recharge<00:01:13.980> as<00:01:14.190> many<00:01:14.400> different<00:01:15.090> makes<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
recharge as many different makes and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480 
recharge as many different makes and
models<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.750> phones<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.409> possible<00:01:16.860> simply<00:01:17.370> by

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
models of phones as possible simply by

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.490 
models of phones as possible simply by
using<00:01:17.550> interchangeable<00:01:18.270> means<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:19.080> estimated

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
using interchangeable means we estimated

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.580 
using interchangeable means we estimated
that<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.310> sound<00:01:20.550> charge<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.000> glastonbury

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
that the sound charge of glastonbury

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.380 
that the sound charge of glastonbury
being<00:01:22.590> exposed<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.220> about<00:01:23.340> 80<00:01:23.550> DB<00:01:23.940> of<00:01:24.120> sound

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
being exposed to about 80 DB of sound

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.090 
being exposed to about 80 DB of sound
which<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.750> about<00:01:24.990> what<00:01:25.650> you'd<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.070> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
which is about what you'd get on a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.230 
which is about what you'd get on a
normal<00:01:26.280> physics<00:01:26.640> -

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
normal physics -

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760 
normal physics -
will<00:01:27.570> give<00:01:27.690> us<00:01:27.780> enough<00:01:28.020> charge<00:01:28.320> probably

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
will give us enough charge probably

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.350 
will give us enough charge probably
about<00:01:28.860> six<00:01:29.190> months<00:01:29.430> hours<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.850> enough<00:01:30.090> charge

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
about six months hours so enough charge

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.539 
about six months hours so enough charge
to<00:01:30.479> charge<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:31.380> standard<00:01:31.650> mobile<00:01:31.770> phones<00:01:32.130> or

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
to charge to standard mobile phones or

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.420 
to charge to standard mobile phones or
one<00:01:32.760> smartphone<00:01:33.590> obviously<00:01:34.590> we're<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
one smartphone obviously we're here in a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.430 
one smartphone obviously we're here in a
lab<00:01:35.640> now<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.240> don't<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.870> live<00:01:37.080> band

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
lab now so we don't have a live band

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.780 
lab now so we don't have a live band
playing<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.010> same<00:01:38.159> way<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.310> would<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.760> a

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
playing the same way you would have at a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.640 
playing the same way you would have at a
festival<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.270> Glastonbury<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.350> we've<00:01:40.500> done

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
festival like Glastonbury but we've done

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.469
