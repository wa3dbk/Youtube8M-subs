00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.620
 hello welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.900
 crafts for all today we are going to 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.900
 make a decorative mobile 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.690
 materials that we are going to need 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.880
 colored cards of 15 x 20 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.779
 centimeters pencil 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.779
 scissors 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.570
 glue stick 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.430
 a trinket 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.850
 and I 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.080
 and the bowl that they can get it in 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.080
 the link that is in the description 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.830
 crafts for all let's start 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.250
 we folded one of the cards by the 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:00.170
 half this way 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.890
 let's take the mold and we 're going to 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.580
 mark by matching the part 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.590
 bent with the right part of the mold 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:15.010
 we mark the central circle which is a 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.010
 half circle and the outline of the droplet 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.400
 we're going to have to do the same with the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.400
 rest of the cards one by one 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.260
 once this is done we will move on to 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.040
 cut out cut by the edges or by 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.610
 the outline and we will also save the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.550
 center and the contour we do the same 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.729
 with the rest of the cards now 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.180
 we begin to paste we are going to paste half 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.640
 drop of a color let's say half cardboard 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.170
 one color with half the other 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.750
 cardboard of another color 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.090
 in this case blue and yellow 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.900
 we will do it well we say it well that 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.900
 be well even 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.369
 and we happened to paste the following 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.670
 We will do this process with 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.210
 all half drops 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.120
 until the second to last 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.880
 let's keep closing it the finish 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.300
 the drop for the end is going to be seeing 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.300
 A) Yes 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.120
 one more 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.480
 at this time what should 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.970
 just stick the green with the 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.540
 yellow and close but what are we going to 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.370
 do is wait to finish the center 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.340
 and 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.140
 so it would look like we're going to do what 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.140
 same with the circles of the center 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.990
 the circle that we are going to take the center 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.360
 we are going to cut it so that there is a 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.390
 little bit more in this case I chose three 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.820
 colors of the six that I had and I'm going to 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.240
 adhere in the same way half with 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.240
 medium 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.980
 one more 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.980
 and we adhere 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.099
 now we are left with the other circles other 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.700
 three circles that we are also going to 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:24.520
 adhere in this case without cutting 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.520
 let's move on to place 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.240
 and the first thing we put a trinket to 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.240
 stop mode 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.299
 we tie it to the end of the thread 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.310
 we will locate the thread in the center and 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.120
 about it we are going to also paste the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.530
 smaller circles 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.530
 we put glue 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.150
 we also focus a bit on the book to 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.409
 that is well well centered we place 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.989
 glue in the drop and we're going to close it 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.790
 while the glue has not dried 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.680
 we can go centering as it is 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.359
 necessary the circle in the middle 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.690
 so we stretch the thread a bit and 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.880
 we center the circle 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.890
 now as an ornament we are going to place the 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:26.530
 larger circles about it a 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:28.900
 I little higher once become one 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.880
 we can do a couple more for if we can 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.060
 form our mobile 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.000
 now we take a stick we put a 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.130
 little bit of glue and we're going to screw 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.610
 on him the thread in this way what 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.610
 we can decorate 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.740
 no no 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.380
 but we search 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.820
 and reaching the end 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.820
 we make a nudite 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.529
 to seal the knot it can be placed 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:10.639
 also a little bit of glue 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:14.259
 on the opposite side of the stick we are going to tie 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.259
 the opposite end of the thread 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:22.460
 we are not good we cut the remains and of 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.140
 here is going to hang our mobile we are going to 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.330
 try that one is a little bit more 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.139
 above that other giving thus a little 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.180
 movement 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.229
 and we try to balance it so that the 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.229
 stick that of the right 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.940
 and so it would be finished 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.250
 if you liked it, do not forget to leave your like 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.120
 comment and subscribe we see in the 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.120
 next craft
