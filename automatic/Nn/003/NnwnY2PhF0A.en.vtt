00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
the flipside of that review there should

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.840 
the flipside of that review there should
always<00:00:16.379> be<00:00:16.500> two<00:00:16.770> sides<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> story<00:00:17.340> just

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
always be two sides to a story just

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.570 
always be two sides to a story just
remember<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.869> these<00:00:19.050> are<00:00:19.320> very<00:00:19.770> minor<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.490> do

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
remember that these are very minor I do

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.609 
remember that these are very minor I do
think<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.359> Galaxy<00:00:21.779> Note<00:00:21.900> 5<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.439> an

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
think that the Galaxy Note 5 is an

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.710 
think that the Galaxy Note 5 is an
awesome<00:00:23.039> device<00:00:23.189> but<00:00:23.910> there<00:00:24.090> are<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> few

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
awesome device but there are a few

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.060 
awesome device but there are a few
things<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.320> should<00:00:25.350> be<00:00:25.619> aware<00:00:25.740> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
things that you should be aware of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.179 
things that you should be aware of
before<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.609> drop<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.660> significant<00:00:28.650> amount<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
before you drop a significant amount of

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.429 
before you drop a significant amount of
money<00:00:29.490> I'll<00:00:30.060> kick<00:00:30.330> things<00:00:30.449> off<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.929> number

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
money I'll kick things off with number

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.560 
money I'll kick things off with number
one<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.340> year<00:00:32.610> around<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.329> very

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
one this year around it is very

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.389 
one this year around it is very
surprising<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.680> S<00:00:34.800> Pen

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
surprising is the S Pen

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.119 
surprising is the S Pen
so<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> S<00:00:36.390> Pen<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:37.020> gives<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.530> Galaxy

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
so the S Pen is what gives the Galaxy

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.250 
so the S Pen is what gives the Galaxy
Note<00:00:38.309> series<00:00:38.370> its<00:00:39.000> name<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.600> S<00:00:39.750> Pen<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.110> been

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
Note series its name the S Pen is been

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.440 
Note series its name the S Pen is been
around<00:00:40.379> since<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.980> first<00:00:41.190> iteration<00:00:41.790> Galaxy

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
around since the first iteration Galaxy

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.330 
around since the first iteration Galaxy
Note<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.170> undergone<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.710> few<00:00:44.070> minor

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
Note and it's undergone a few minor

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.729 
Note and it's undergone a few minor
changes<00:00:44.879> every<00:00:45.270> year<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> first

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
changes every year but this is the first

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.520 
changes every year but this is the first
time<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.370> requires<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.239> click<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:49.050> unlock

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
time that it requires a click to unlock

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.830 
time that it requires a click to unlock
or<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.100> release<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.579> S<00:00:50.700> Pen<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.690> is

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
or to release the S Pen and this is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.720 
or to release the S Pen and this is
something<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:52.800> I'm<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.460> used

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
something that I think I'm just not used

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.410 
something that I think I'm just not used
to<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.600> I'm<00:00:54.899> definitely<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.100> fan<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.460> don't

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
to but I'm definitely not a fan of don't

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.360 
to but I'm definitely not a fan of don't
get<00:00:57.539> me<00:00:57.660> wrong<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.289> S<00:00:58.440> Pen<00:00:58.710> still<00:00:59.010> has<00:00:59.190> great

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
get me wrong the S Pen still has great

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.180 
get me wrong the S Pen still has great
features<00:00:59.910> you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.300> record<00:01:00.690> notes<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.710> it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
features you can record notes but it

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.820 
features you can record notes but it
just<00:01:02.489> makes<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.090> tiny<00:01:03.480> bit<00:01:03.719> less<00:01:04.290> accessible

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
just makes it a tiny bit less accessible

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.340 
just makes it a tiny bit less accessible
and<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.119> small<00:01:06.570> little<00:01:06.930> factor

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
and I think that small little factor

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.140 
and I think that small little factor
that<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> actually<00:01:08.010> click<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.640> might

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
that you have to actually click it might

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.480 
that you have to actually click it might
deter<00:01:09.510> some<00:01:09.840> people<00:01:10.229> from<00:01:10.380> using<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.890> maybe

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
deter some people from using it maybe

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.510 
deter some people from using it maybe
that's<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.150> personal<00:01:12.570> opinion<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.990> course

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
that's just personal opinion of course

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
that's just personal opinion of course
so<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:14.700> I've<00:01:14.850> said<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.270> S<00:01:15.390> Pen<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.689> undergone

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
so as I've said the S Pen is undergone

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.920 
so as I've said the S Pen is undergone
changes<00:01:16.560> every<00:01:17.400> single<00:01:17.759> year<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.570> year

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
changes every single year and this year

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.960 
changes every single year and this year
it<00:01:19.140> does<00:01:19.380> feel<00:01:19.650> pretty<00:01:19.680> solid<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.520> got<00:01:20.729> some

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
it does feel pretty solid it's got some

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.120 
it does feel pretty solid it's got some
nice<00:01:21.090> weight<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.530> has<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
nice weight to it and it now has that
