00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.580

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.420
 so he has several peculiarities 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.170
 several features very 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.599
 interesting 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.449
 so we actually have a very big base 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.289
 of dictionaries in very 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.270
 many languages 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.670
 as you see so there is really 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.780
 All the possibilities 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.399
 so know that you can ask 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.680
 developers to add a 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.930
 precise dictionary he will do it with 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.539

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.899
 so with a list in each of 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.270
 languages 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.890
 so you have lists of synonyms 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.110
 of an act of a gram of word list 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.550
 list of known words for example 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.469
 like this you have different 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.480
 formations as you see on 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.559
 each of these dictionaries you have 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.120
 also all the dictionaries 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.799
 of translation as you see it 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.600
 so note down by the users and you 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.189
 do you have that for all languages ​​in 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.510
 French in this case I installed 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.790
 only two dictionaries simply 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.460
 to give you a little example you 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.470
 so here is the list of x dictionary 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.939
 that you have installed and here you 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.479
 so can just type a 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.460
 research 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.640
 so be aware that when you type a 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.439
 search and well simply the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.020
 words will appear as you see it 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.640
 here and if the dictionary does not contain 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.380
 not the word you are looking for there 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.780
 will have no indication here so that serves 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.070
 for nothing to continue the search you 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.680
 click like these here and there you fall 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.009
 so on the definition of the word with 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.990
 expressions the definition etc 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.570
 so you can also zoom in on the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.909
 text or diminish it so 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.950

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.200
