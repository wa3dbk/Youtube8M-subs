fruit<00:00:21.970> I<00:00:22.090> can<00:00:22.240> see<00:00:22.360> here<00:00:22.570> this<00:00:22.720> looks<00:00:22.960> like<00:00:23.200> it

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
fruit I can see here this looks like it

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.779 
fruit I can see here this looks like it
may<00:00:23.560> have<00:00:23.590> been<00:00:23.860> a<00:00:24.100> fruit<00:00:24.730> damaged<00:00:25.180> by<00:00:25.600> hill

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
may have been a fruit damaged by hill

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.880 
may have been a fruit damaged by hill
and<00:00:27.789> you<00:00:28.180> remove<00:00:28.480> all<00:00:28.720> that<00:00:28.990> fruit<00:00:29.260> but<00:00:29.500> beyond

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
and you remove all that fruit but beyond

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.850 
and you remove all that fruit but beyond
that<00:00:30.930> you<00:00:31.930> remove<00:00:32.200> a<00:00:32.320> lot<00:00:32.469> of<00:00:32.590> fear<00:00:32.710> there's

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
that you remove a lot of fear there's

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.400 
that you remove a lot of fear there's
probably<00:00:33.370> at<00:00:33.789> least<00:00:33.899> 10,000<00:00:34.899> nectarines<00:00:35.289> on

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
probably at least 10,000 nectarines on

to basically rip them off and leave a
gap<00:00:45.430> of<00:00:45.670> about<00:00:46.570> ten<00:00:47.140> inches<00:00:47.520> between

and it almost sounds sort of crazy but

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.239 
and it almost sounds sort of crazy but
think<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.509> your<00:01:25.990> root<00:01:26.289> system<00:01:26.709> as<00:01:26.889> your

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
obviously as your root system and end up

comes up route to your fruit and you

consider is the season that your fruit

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.510 
consider is the season that your fruit
ripens<00:01:54.450> some<00:01:55.450> apricots<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.349> nectarines<00:01:57.249> come

some<00:01:58.899> peaches<00:01:59.169> and<00:01:59.529> nectarines<00:01:59.560> that<00:02:00.099> come

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:00.279 
some peaches and nectarines that come

some peaches and nectarines that come
later<00:02:00.549> in<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.789> season<00:02:00.969> they're<00:02:01.630> going<00:02:01.779> to<00:02:01.869> be

absorbing that nutrients longer which

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.019 
absorbing that nutrients longer which
means<00:02:05.739> there's<00:02:05.950> going<00:02:06.069> to<00:02:06.130> be<00:02:06.159> more<00:02:06.549> money<00:02:06.819> if

attention to is we also if you saw a

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.710 
attention to is we also if you saw a
newsletter<00:03:08.859> earlier<00:03:09.310> about<00:03:09.970> trimming<00:03:10.480> the

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
newsletter earlier about trimming the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.539 
newsletter earlier about trimming the
trees<00:03:10.959> we<00:03:11.139> trimmed<00:03:11.829> out<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.010> thinner<00:03:12.370> of<00:03:12.489> the

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.039 
trees we trimmed out the thinner of the
tree<00:03:12.730> right<00:03:13.150> in<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.359> middle<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.659> this<00:03:13.810> here

tree right in the middle of this here

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.080 
tree right in the middle of this here
nectarine<00:03:14.530> tree<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.489> reason<00:03:15.760> we<00:03:15.879> do<00:03:16.060> that

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
nectarine tree and the reason we do that

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.009 
nectarine tree and the reason we do that
is<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:17.379> sunlight<00:03:18.159> can<00:03:18.489> shine<00:03:18.790> right<00:03:19.450> into<00:03:19.810> this

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
is so sunlight can shine right into this

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.589 
is so sunlight can shine right into this
tree<00:03:21.010> we're<00:03:21.310> getting<00:03:21.639> as<00:03:21.790> much<00:03:21.970> surface<00:03:22.269> area

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.020 
tree we're getting as much surface area
with<00:03:22.870> sunlight<00:03:23.079> as<00:03:23.319> possible<00:03:23.949> which<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:24.910> going

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
with sunlight as possible which is going

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.119 
with sunlight as possible which is going
to<00:03:25.090> help<00:03:25.359> this<00:03:25.540> fruit<00:03:25.780> sweeten<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.440> the
