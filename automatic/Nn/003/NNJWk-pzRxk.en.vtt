00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.849
 correctly is never dependent on 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.159
 restaurant milk nothing then we already

 classic bodybuilding that prioritizes 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.500
 height and muscle maturity

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.329
 also in bodybuilding 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.609
 the physical education student says that 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.379
 it takes a lot of persistence to 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.510
 continue in this sport 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.870
 if we are going to put no account of the act 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.879
 people or an intense athlete because people 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.199
 has cost we have social life has 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.359
 family has everything we have to 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.459
 devote much time that sometimes what 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.900
 we do not give half of what we 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.010
 we need to get on top 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.199
 condition understood 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.720
 nowadays, what is lacking most is the 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:06.510
 private companies and even support 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.000
 federal government the government of the spirit 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.729
 holy that unfortunately is to have good 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.799
 athletes this year and did not have a body 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:15.959
 builders had the bag athlete understands 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.780
 so we need some 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.970
 more not of respect but they compensate 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.669
 because the results are coming in that 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.090
 before the competition the diet is 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.430
 more regaled but then the championships 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.610
 will healed bodies gain 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.400
 rest at least on food is a 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.160
 myth too big to think that we do not 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.380
 eat nothing this is lie understood the 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.840
 last two months really restricts 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.790
 far below in caloi management for 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.950
 to achieve the best percentage of fat 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.900
 and a definition in the bodies 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.150
 but after the championship will be more than 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.040
 How natural did you see how eating athlete

 women actually broke this 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.810
 itabuna that they can not work with 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.720
 weights because they do not get too strong 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.420

 then in bodybuilding that in fact the 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.400
 body worship does not mean that they 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.110
 should be extremely muscular to 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.289
 that there are categories 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.449

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.649
 the characteristics of each woman in the 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:40.569

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:59.050
 at least 40 athletes 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:00.999

 training and diet dedication throughout 

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:07.210
 based mainly on trust 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:09.369
 between parents hoping to bring in medals 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.990

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.639
 So we have to make an effort. 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:18.969
 Even to get what we want is 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:21.009
 very confident even with not working 

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:22.360
 is neither the result nor the best condition 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:25.330
 I'm sure I'll go up because 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.919
 I trust a lot in the coach and understood 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.339
 a lot of people believe in me and my 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:33.990
 victory is not the gain a title like that is 

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:33.990
