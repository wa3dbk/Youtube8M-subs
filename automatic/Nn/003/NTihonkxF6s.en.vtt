I'm about to be three years natural in
April<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.219> much<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.490> show<00:01:59.640> for

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
April and I don't have much to show for

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.700 
April and I don't have much to show for
it<00:01:59.969> because<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.079> protective<00:02:01.409> styles<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
it because one I do protective styles a

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.889 
it because one I do protective styles a
lot<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.040> don't<00:02:02.310> keep<00:02:02.490> them<00:02:02.670> long<00:02:02.850> enough<00:02:03.000> so

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
lot I don't keep them long enough so

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.240 
lot I don't keep them long enough so
that<00:02:03.930> they<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:04.290> make<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> difference<00:02:04.710> I

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
that they actually make a difference I

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.679 
that they actually make a difference I
just<00:02:05.520> give<00:02:05.640> my<00:02:05.759> hair<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.149> maybe<00:02:06.390> three<00:02:06.659> weeks

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
just give my hair like maybe three weeks

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.150 
just give my hair like maybe three weeks
to<00:02:06.990> break<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.350> I'm<00:02:07.409> going<00:02:07.649> back<00:02:07.770> into<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
to break and I'm going back into it

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.219 
to break and I'm going back into it
again<00:02:08.220> which<00:02:08.759> makes<00:02:09.030> no<00:02:09.090> sense<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.899> I'm<00:02:09.959> trying

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
again which makes no sense so I'm trying

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.410 
again which makes no sense so I'm trying
to<00:02:10.289> keep<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> styling<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:10.979> six<00:02:11.370> weeks<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.940> be
