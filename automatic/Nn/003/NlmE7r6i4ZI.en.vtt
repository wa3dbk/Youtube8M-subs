 valentina ponomareva did you know that 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.750
 curious facts about snow 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.720
 I really like looking at the snowflakes 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.310
 so beautiful they are admired 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.330
 may therefore collect information on 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.240
 snow theme 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.460
 and metric data most often have 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.089
 snow stars an diameter of about 5 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.859
 millimeters 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.400
 officially registered 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.750
 record holder had a 12 centimeter 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.600
 snowflakes usually weigh about one 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.250
 milligram they are 95 percent composed 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.129
 from the air therefore has a low 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.890
 density and low fall rate 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.109
 average 9 10 kilometers an hour 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.230
 colors who will argue with the fact that the snow 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.300
 white of course white usually but in 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.430
 arctic and mountain regions him 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.379
 happens to be pink or even red 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.809
 due to tinting by living organisms 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.789
 between algae crystals for example 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.760
 repeatedly happened falling out 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.120
 colored snow blue green gray 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.580
 about voices when falling input snowflake 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.070
 sings that is creates a very high sound 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.110
 elusive human ear but by 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.900
 approval by experts unpleasant for 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.180
 fish population of reservoirs but under their feet 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.280
 sometimes snow creaks and only 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.340
 frost and the stronger it is the higher 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.070
 distinguishable sound it breaks ice 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.870
 needles and population numbers and 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.060
 involvement in the life of the planet 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.890
 German meteorologists were able to calculate 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.290
 that every year in Germany falls 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.990
 several septillion number with twenty 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.330
 four zeros of snowflakes of which not 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.280
 find two identical and their total 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.890
 strength can affect speed 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.810
 rotation of the earth besides taking possession 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.820
 expanse of land snow folk 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.360
 strongly reflects the energy of solar 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.480
 rays 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.520
 they are visibility and modesty more 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.290
 half the world's population never 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.810
 I have not seen real snow 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.360
 this is a fairly well-known fact remaining 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.160
 nonetheless curious for a long time 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.540
 it was difficult for scientists to photograph 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.530
 snowflake under the microscope 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.920
 first successful attempt took place in 1885 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.140
 year and finally heard that the Sami 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.940
 to determine the quality of snow in all 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.280
 its types are used 40 one word 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.530
 and in this is seen the importance of this 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.960
 surprising phenomenon in the life of the people and 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.590
 how do you feel about snow 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.520
 valentina ponomareva did you know that 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.520
