00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
development diary for this new map which

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.340 
development diary for this new map which
I'm<00:00:16.440> currently<00:00:16.500> making<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:18.199> having<00:00:19.199> thought

I'm currently making and having thought

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.290 
I'm currently making and having thought
of<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> name<00:00:19.619> yet<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.970> going<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.150> be<00:00:21.210> new

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
of a name yet but it's going to be new

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.750 
of a name yet but it's going to be new
zombie<00:00:21.539> map<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.100> if<00:00:23.100> you're<00:00:23.250> wondering<00:00:23.279> about

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
zombie map and if you're wondering about

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.429 
zombie map and if you're wondering about
the<00:00:24.210> old<00:00:24.660> zombie<00:00:24.990> map<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.320> advance<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.099> fend

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
the old zombie map the advance and fend

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.990 
the old zombie map the advance and fend
unfortunately<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.710> weld<00:00:29.160> cycle<00:00:29.340> corrupted

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
unfortunately the weld cycle corrupted

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.319 
unfortunately the weld cycle corrupted
because<00:00:31.160> somehow<00:00:32.160> when<00:00:32.669> your<00:00:32.820> experiment

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
because somehow when your experiment

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.440 
because somehow when your experiment
experimenting<00:00:33.989> with<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.910> zombie<00:00:35.910> health<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
experimenting with a zombie health and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.459 
experimenting with a zombie health and
you<00:00:37.170> change<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> data<00:00:38.520> tags<00:00:38.820> or<00:00:39.469> MBT

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
you change one of the data tags or MBT

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.340 
you change one of the data tags or MBT
tags<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.480> crushes<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.719> world<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
tags it just crushes the world and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.340 
tags it just crushes the world and
eventually<00:00:44.480> had<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> spawner<00:00:45.840> which<00:00:46.050> kept

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
eventually had a spawner which kept

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.630 
eventually had a spawner which kept
spawning<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:46.829> zombies<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.460> just

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
spawning these zombies and it just

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.490 
spawning these zombies and it just
eventually<00:00:47.789> corrupted<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> world<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.260> do<00:00:49.350> have

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
eventually corrupted the world I do have

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.330 
eventually corrupted the world I do have
a<00:00:49.559> backup<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.670> very<00:00:51.289> while<00:00:52.289> back<00:00:52.559> so

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
a backup but it's a very while back so

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.369 
a backup but it's a very while back so
not<00:00:53.699> much<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.059> saved<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:54.960> leave<00:00:55.140> pretty

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
not much is saved and they leave pretty

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.709 
not much is saved and they leave pretty
pointless<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:56.190> try<00:00:56.219> again<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.390> I've<00:00:57.449> got<00:00:57.600> this

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
pointless to try again so I've got this

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.979 
pointless to try again so I've got this
world<00:00:58.050> which<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.039> started<00:00:59.550> today<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.690> is

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
world which I started today and this is

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.189 
world which I started today and this is
a<00:01:01.020> new<00:01:01.379> map<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.699> there's<00:01:03.059> some

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
a new map as you can see there's some

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.299 
a new map as you can see there's some
strange<00:01:04.199> things<00:01:04.290> happening<00:01:04.769> which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
strange things happening which is the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.630 
strange things happening which is the
coal<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.820> iron<00:01:07.159> travelling<00:01:08.159> along<00:01:08.280> some<00:01:08.460> mine

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
coal and iron travelling along some mine

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.660 
coal and iron travelling along some mine
cart<00:01:08.909> tracks<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.290> I'll<00:01:11.159> talk<00:01:11.280> about<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.549> in

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
cart tracks and I'll talk about that in

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.609 
cart tracks and I'll talk about that in
a<00:01:12.240> minute<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:14.030> use<00:01:15.030> MCEdit<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.170> kind

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
a minute so I use MCEdit to do this kind

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.109 
a minute so I use MCEdit to do this kind
of<00:01:16.650> cave<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.460> like<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> mine<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:20.119> I've

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
of cave on it to be like a mine and I've

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.260 
of cave on it to be like a mine and I've
made<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.479> far<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.740> iron<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.430> coal<00:01:23.909> coming

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
made so far is the iron and coal coming

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.980 
made so far is the iron and coal coming
into<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.750> furnace<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.700> then<00:01:26.780> some<00:01:27.780> I'm

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
into this furnace and then some I'm

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.179 
into this furnace and then some I'm
blocks<00:01:28.290> coming<00:01:28.650> out<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:30.200> i'll<00:01:31.200> probably<00:01:31.950> have

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
blocks coming out so i'll probably have

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.770 
blocks coming out so i'll probably have
the<00:01:32.490> players<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> zombie<00:01:33.390> map<00:01:33.540> walk

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the players in the zombie map walk

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.690 
the players in the zombie map walk
around<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.140> bottom<00:01:34.470> section<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.430> few

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
around this bottom section and a few

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.590 
around this bottom section and a few
areas<00:01:36.380> up<00:01:37.380> top<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.180> but<00:01:39.180> basically<00:01:39.450> this

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
areas up top and but basically this

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.950 
areas up top and but basically this
pitches<00:01:39.900> four<00:01:39.930> director<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.040> shin<00:01:41.450> but<00:01:42.450> i'll

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
pitches four director a shin but i'll

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.749 
pitches four director a shin but i'll
explain<00:01:43.259> how<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.530> works<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.579> there's<00:01:44.729> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
explain how this works so there's a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.480 
explain how this works so there's a
little<00:01:44.820> timer<00:01:45.119> here<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> hopper<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:47.159> it

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
little timer here with a hopper and it

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.420 
little timer here with a hopper and it
goes<00:01:47.579> into<00:01:47.700> cut<00:01:47.909> into<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> comparator<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
goes into cut into a comparator and

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
goes into cut into a comparator and
these<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.820> activates<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.540> command<00:01:52.500> blocks

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
these this activates to command blocks

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.120 
these this activates to command blocks
and<00:01:53.060> these<00:01:54.060> come<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.329> blocks<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:55.009> using<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and these come on blocks is using the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.100 
and these come on blocks is using the
new<00:01:56.250> saman<00:01:56.579> command<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.479> new<00:01:57.840> snapshot

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
new saman command in the new snapshot

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.420 
new saman command in the new snapshot
which<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> 13<00:01:59.310> w<00:01:59.810> 36<00:02:00.810> b<00:02:01.200> i<00:02:01.229> believe<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.369> it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
which is a 13 w 36 b i believe so it

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.230 
which is a 13 w 36 b i believe so it
spawns<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.790> ride<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.390> car<00:02:03.950> which<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.240> minus

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
spawns a ride on one car which is minus

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.969 
spawns a ride on one car which is minus

the cordon from the command block it's a

Z<00:02:17.620> coordinate<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.819> also<00:02:19.299> has<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:20.709> custom

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
Z coordinate so it also has a custom

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.550 
Z coordinate so it also has a custom
display<00:02:21.519> title<00:02:21.970> 16<00:02:22.330> which<00:02:22.480> means<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.840> displays

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
display title 16 which means it displays

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.940 
display title 16 which means it displays
the<00:02:23.890> block<00:02:24.640> which<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.180> ID<00:02:25.540> 16<00:02:26.110> which<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.500> I

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
the block which is ID 16 which is I

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.039 
the block which is ID 16 which is I
believe<00:02:26.980> ainol<00:02:27.670> or<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.390> coal<00:02:28.569> or<00:02:28.750> not<00:02:28.959> sure

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
believe ainol or the coal or not sure

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.990 
believe ainol or the coal or not sure
which<00:02:29.200> ones<00:02:29.349> which<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.830> then<00:02:30.370> display<00:02:30.730> tiles

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
which ones which and then display tiles

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.360 
which ones which and then display tiles
16<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.930> if<00:02:32.049> I<00:02:32.170> make<00:02:32.319> this<00:02:32.410> yourself<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:33.190> want

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
16 so if I make this yourself you want

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.339 
16 so if I make this yourself you want
someone<00:02:33.810> minecart<00:02:34.810> rideable<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:36.040> want<00:02:36.190> this

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
someone minecart rideable you want this

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.640 
someone minecart rideable you want this
strange<00:02:38.349> symbol<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:40.510> can<00:02:40.629> put<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
strange symbol and you can put the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.920 
strange symbol and you can put the
change<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.040> coordinates<00:02:42.510> relative<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.540> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
change the coordinates relative to the

change the coordinates relative to the
command<00:02:44.200> block<00:02:44.370> then<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.459> have<00:02:45.579> custom

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
command block then you have custom

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.240 
command block then you have custom

display tile the ideal one displayed
tiled<00:02:48.459> ID<00:02:48.700> want<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.180> then<00:02:49.299> display<00:02:49.599> offset

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
tiled ID want and then display offset

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.170 
tiled ID want and then display offset
which<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.099> distance<00:02:51.340> between<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.790> cart

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
which is the distance between the cart

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.400 
which is the distance between the cart
and<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:53.530> block<00:02:54.780> 6170<00:02:55.780> means<00:02:56.379> that<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:57.040> block

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
and the block 6170 means that the block

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.509 
and the block 6170 means that the block
here<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.590> quite<00:02:59.829> far<00:03:00.040> away<00:03:00.129> from<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.400> mine

cottages<00:03:00.849> under<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.120> ground<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.739> few<00:03:02.739> problems

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
cottages under the ground a few problems

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.770 
cottages under the ground a few problems
with<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.519> or<00:03:03.910> one<00:03:04.060> problem<00:03:04.239> is<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:04.660> if<00:03:04.720> you

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
with this or one problem is so if you

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.599 
with this or one problem is so if you
get<00:03:04.870> too<00:03:05.019> close<00:03:05.049> to<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.440> coal<00:03:05.709> or<00:03:06.010> any<00:03:06.310> block

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
get too close to the coal or any block

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.910 
get too close to the coal or any block
that's<00:03:06.730> moving<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.239> disappears<00:03:07.769> not<00:03:08.769> sure<00:03:08.859> if

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
that's moving it disappears not sure if

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.440 
that's moving it disappears not sure if
this<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.069> a<00:03:09.160> bug<00:03:09.310> but<00:03:09.579> it<00:03:09.819> happens<00:03:10.090> but

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
this is a bug but it happens but

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.599 
this is a bug but it happens but
obviously<00:03:11.079> as<00:03:11.410> decoration<00:03:12.010> part<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:12.459> no

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
obviously as decoration part so no

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.699 
obviously as decoration part so no
players<00:03:12.879> will<00:03:13.000> get<00:03:13.120> near<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:14.530> it's<00:03:14.650> all

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
players will get near that so it's all

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.039 
players will get near that so it's all
fine<00:03:15.299> so<00:03:16.299> I'll<00:03:16.389> just<00:03:16.450> going<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.720> show<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:16.930> the

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
fine so I'll just going to show you the

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.000 
fine so I'll just going to show you the
inside<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:17.980> these<00:03:18.549> two<00:03:18.880> clocks<00:03:19.889> spawn<00:03:20.889> the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
inside so these two clocks spawn the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.039 
inside so these two clocks spawn the
minecarts<00:03:21.519> right<00:03:22.239> there<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.739> they<00:03:23.739> basically

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
minecarts right there and they basically

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.750 
minecarts right there and they basically
have<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.730> coal<00:03:27.730> or<00:03:27.910> iron<00:03:27.940> above<00:03:28.450> them<00:03:28.630> and

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
have the coal or iron above them and

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.240 
have the coal or iron above them and
they<00:03:30.760> just<00:03:30.940> transport<00:03:31.480> them<00:03:32.250> underground

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
they just transport them underground

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.129 
they just transport them underground
through<00:03:34.090> here<00:03:35.310> until<00:03:36.310> they<00:03:37.299> get<00:03:37.599> so<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> hole

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
through here until they get so a hole

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.330 
through here until they get so a hole
which<00:03:38.319> just<00:03:38.500> goes<00:03:38.620> into<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.919> void<00:03:39.010> and

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
which just goes into the void and

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.909 
which just goes into the void and
destroyed<00:03:39.609> them<00:03:39.760> both<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.500> made<00:03:41.769> a<00:03:41.799> little

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
destroyed them both so I made a little

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.449 
destroyed them both so I made a little
furnace<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:43.120> simulate<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:44.049> they're<00:03:44.560> going

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
furnace to simulate that they're going

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.199 
furnace to simulate that they're going
into<00:03:45.579> a<00:03:46.680> furnace<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:48.549> then<00:03:48.849> I've<00:03:48.970> got<00:03:49.090> another

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
into a furnace and then I've got another

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.970 
into a furnace and then I've got another
kind<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.810> same<00:03:49.959> thing<00:03:50.139> here<00:03:50.380> which<00:03:50.590> is<00:03:50.829> with

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
kind of same thing here which is with

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.250 
kind of same thing here which is with
iron<00:03:51.190> blocks<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.790> this<00:03:52.750> usually<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.109> same

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
iron blocks and this usually the same

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.099 
iron blocks and this usually the same
user<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.769> pit<00:03:53.919> same<00:03:54.099> coin<00:03:54.340> mechanism<00:03:55.180> so

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
user the pit same coin mechanism so

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.539 
user the pit same coin mechanism so
another<00:03:56.260> clock<00:03:56.500> here<00:03:56.849> going<00:03:57.849> up<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.329> a<00:03:59.549> spot

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
another clock here going up to a spot

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.129 
another clock here going up to a spot
summon<00:04:00.910> command<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:01.569> it<00:04:01.959> spawns<00:04:02.230> in<00:04:03.060> 222<00:04:04.139> in

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
summon command and it spawns in 222 in

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.110 
summon command and it spawns in 222 in
the<00:04:05.470> x-coordinate<00:04:06.040> 3<00:04:06.370> in<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.519> y<00:04:06.669> coordinate

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
the x-coordinate 3 in the y coordinate

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.449 
the x-coordinate 3 in the y coordinate
and<00:04:07.269> turns<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.690> coordinate<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.459> despite

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
piles 42 which is the iron block and

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.670 
piles 42 which is the iron block and
spray<00:04:12.129> offset<00:04:12.400> of<00:04:12.489> 64<00:04:12.940> which<00:04:13.870> means<00:04:14.139> the<00:04:14.500> gap

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
spray offset of 64 which means the gap

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.750 
spray offset of 64 which means the gap

you'll<00:04:23.990> see<00:04:24.170> notice<00:04:24.440> at<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.590> block<00:04:24.860> that<00:04:27.280> so

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
you'll see notice at the block that so

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.250 
you'll see notice at the block that so
this<00:04:28.430> block<00:04:28.670> will<00:04:29.000> be<00:04:29.360> dark<00:04:29.690> if<00:04:29.960> there's<00:04:30.140> no

this block will be dark if there's no

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
light source next to the mine cart so

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.710 
light source next to the mine cart so
for<00:04:33.740> example<00:04:33.770> if<00:04:34.190> I<00:04:34.900> just<00:04:35.900> got<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.050> work<00:04:37.150> or<00:04:38.150> do

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.640 

try<00:04:41.720> to<00:04:41.780> show<00:04:42.170> you<00:04:42.260> how<00:04:42.410> this<00:04:42.590> works<00:04:44.590> so<00:04:45.590> you

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
try to show you how this works so you

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.870 
try to show you how this works so you
can<00:04:45.740> see<00:04:45.800> this<00:04:45.890> is<00:04:46.070> a<00:04:46.100> bit<00:04:46.250> darker<00:04:46.700> than<00:04:46.790> the

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
can see this is a bit darker than the

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.750 
can see this is a bit darker than the
other<00:04:46.940> blocks<00:04:48.010> that's<00:04:49.010> because<00:04:49.310> needing

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
other blocks that's because needing

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.870 
other blocks that's because needing
light<00:04:49.910> source<00:04:50.240> is<00:04:51.100> you<00:04:52.100> like<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.490> light

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
light source is you like the light

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.580 
light source is you like the light
source<00:04:53.150> next<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.900> minecart<00:04:54.260> not<00:04:54.470> the

note<00:04:57.530> is<00:04:57.680> that<00:04:57.920> these<00:04:58.370> blocks<00:04:58.820> cannot<00:04:59.630> be

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
note is that these blocks cannot be

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.620 
note is that these blocks cannot be
moved<00:05:00.320> because<00:05:01.130> they're<00:05:01.640> linked<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.450> mine

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
moved because they're linked to the mine

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.510 
moved because they're linked to the mine
cart<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:02.990> if<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:03.710> stand<00:05:03.980> near<00:05:04.130> them<00:05:04.280> what<00:05:04.400> any

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
mob Stanley them it's not affected so

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.450 
mob Stanley them it's not affected so
that's<00:05:06.680> really<00:05:06.830> good<00:05:07.070> and<00:05:07.370> my<00:05:08.240> music<00:05:08.630> is
