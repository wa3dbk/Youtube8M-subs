my team is obviously out of touch but
I'm<00:02:30.700> going<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:30.910> get<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.060> new<00:02:31.299> board<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.840> director

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.970 

the<00:02:38.109> point<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.560> we<00:02:39.010> want<00:02:39.250> more<00:02:39.579> rng<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:41.470> well

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
the point is we want more rng so well

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.770 
the point is we want more rng so well
you<00:02:42.370> know<00:02:42.489> when<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.760> this<00:02:43.209> is<00:02:43.359> this<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:43.660> like

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
you know when you this is this is like

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.720 
you know when you this is this is like
the<00:02:43.870> conservation<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.680> energy<00:02:44.799> it's<00:02:45.220> Newton's

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
the conservation of energy it's Newton's

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.920 
the conservation of energy it's Newton's
third<00:02:45.940> law<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.450> motion<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.920> gotta<00:02:48.100> uh<00:02:48.930> when

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
third law of motion you gotta uh when

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.330 
third law of motion you gotta uh when
you<00:02:49.959> take<00:02:50.200> away<00:02:50.230> from<00:02:50.560> something<00:02:50.799> you<00:02:51.190> got<00:02:51.310> to

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
you take away from something you got to

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.349 
you take away from something you got to
add<00:02:51.549> it<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.850> another<00:02:51.970> thing<00:02:52.299> so<00:02:52.569> look<00:02:53.410> look<00:02:53.590> out

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
add it to another thing so look look out

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.330 
add it to another thing so look look out
because<00:02:55.359> once<00:02:55.840> we<00:02:55.959> take<00:02:56.200> away<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.620> rng<00:02:57.100> from

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
because once we take away the rng from

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.470 
because once we take away the rng from
gearing<00:02:57.700> we're<00:02:57.819> going<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.000> add<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.359> to

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
gearing we're going to add it to

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.259 
gearing we're going to add it to
something<00:02:58.690> else<00:02:58.870> you're<00:02:59.139> gonna<00:02:59.260> have<00:02:59.470> our<00:02:59.709> ng

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
of ideas on stupid bee gees I mean we

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.870 
of ideas on stupid bee gees I mean we
already<00:04:20.930> got<00:04:21.169> strand<00:04:22.039> the<00:04:22.190> ancients<00:04:22.580> which<00:04:22.729> is
