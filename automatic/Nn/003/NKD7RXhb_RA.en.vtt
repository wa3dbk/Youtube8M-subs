but<00:05:21.919> i<00:05:21.950> think<00:05:22.460> i've<00:05:22.610> tried<00:05:22.910> every<00:05:23.720> single<00:05:24.050> spin

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
but i think i've tried every single spin

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.070 
but i think i've tried every single spin
out<00:05:24.530> there<00:05:25.330> so<00:05:26.330> this<00:05:26.630> was<00:05:27.440> 399<00:05:28.100> each<00:05:28.810> so<00:05:29.810> right

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
out there so this was 399 each so right

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.280 
out there so this was 399 each so right
around<00:05:30.729> eight<00:05:31.729> dollars<00:05:32.330> and<00:05:32.750> some<00:05:32.960> change

around eight dollars and some change

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.520 
around eight dollars and some change
which<00:05:34.070> is<00:05:34.250> expensive<00:05:34.669> but<00:05:35.270> it's<00:05:36.260> well<00:05:36.500> worth

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530
