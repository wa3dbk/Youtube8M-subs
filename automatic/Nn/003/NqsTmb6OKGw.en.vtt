little higher it looks like your foot
position<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.250> good<00:00:47.489> starting<00:00:47.969> off<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.530> it

position is good starting off and it

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.010 
position is good starting off and it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
slow-mo cool so let's check this out see

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
slow-mo cool so let's check this out see
if<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.600> break<00:01:00.840> down<00:01:00.899> what's<00:01:01.350> happening

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
if we can break down what's happening

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.640 
if we can break down what's happening
here<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.699> your<00:01:02.910> foot<00:01:03.120> begins<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.840> drag<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:04.530> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
here so your foot begins to drag then it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.260 
here so your foot begins to drag then it
kind<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.949> leaves<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.430> board<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.000> then<00:01:06.150> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
kind of leaves the board and then you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.480 
kind of leaves the board and then you
push<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.720> foot<00:01:06.930> down<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.250> got<00:01:08.400> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
push your foot down so we got to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.390 
push your foot down so we got to
increase<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> contact<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.470> actual<00:01:11.100> top

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
increase the contact from the actual top

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.390 
increase the contact from the actual top
of<00:01:11.700> your<00:01:12.150> your<00:01:12.750> shoe<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.439> suede<00:01:13.830> part<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
of your your shoe on that suede part to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.490 
of your your shoe on that suede part to
the<00:01:14.520> grip<00:01:14.760> tape<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.210> needs<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.509> be<00:01:15.659> stuck<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the grip tape it needs to be stuck to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.020 
the grip tape it needs to be stuck to
the<00:01:16.619> board<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> whole<00:01:17.159> time<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.700> really

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the board the whole time and really

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.030 
the board the whole time and really
dragging<00:01:18.540> up<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.439> need<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.619> keep

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
dragging up and then you need to keep

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.730 
dragging up and then you need to keep
that<00:01:20.310> front<00:01:20.640> foot<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.330> up<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.470> right

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
that front foot going up it's like right

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.890 
that front foot going up it's like right
at<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> point<00:01:23.250> where<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:24.240> should<00:01:24.450> continue

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
at the point where you should continue

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.020 
at the point where you should continue
lifting<00:01:25.290> your<00:01:25.619> front<00:01:25.890> foot<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.640> more

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
lifting your front foot up to get more

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.600 
lifting your front foot up to get more
heights<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.780> start<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.770> push<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.159> down<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
heights you start to push it down and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.429 
heights you start to push it down and
that's<00:01:29.790> when<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.810> front<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.259> board

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that's when the front of your board

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.749 
that's when the front of your board
drops<00:01:31.770> down<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.909> also<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.430> thing<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.700> be

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
drops down so also the thing that can be

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.030 
drops down so also the thing that can be
a<00:01:35.880> bit<00:01:36.119> tricky<00:01:36.570> with<00:01:36.689> ollie<00:01:37.110> when<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:37.860> very

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
a bit tricky with ollie when your very

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.249 
a bit tricky with ollie when your very
first<00:01:38.250> starting<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.000> getting<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> timing

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
first starting out is getting the timing

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.730 
first starting out is getting the timing
right<00:01:40.920> between<00:01:41.810> when<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.020> pop<00:01:43.290> your<00:01:43.560> back

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
right between when you pop your back

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.069 
right between when you pop your back
foot<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.909> drag<00:01:45.329> your<00:01:45.600> front<00:01:45.899> foot

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
foot and when you drag your front foot

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.440 
foot and when you drag your front foot
to<00:01:46.350> bring<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.829> board<00:01:47.159> really<00:01:47.610> fully<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:48.119> into

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
to bring that board really fully up into

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.080 
to bring that board really fully up into
the<00:01:48.570> air<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.829> soon<00:01:50.040> as<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.280> pop<00:01:50.549> your<00:01:50.790> tail

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the air so as soon as you pop your tail

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.260 
the air so as soon as you pop your tail
on<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> ground<00:01:51.560> your<00:01:52.560> front<00:01:53.220> foot<00:01:53.460> has<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.090> be

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
on the ground your front foot has to be

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.600 
on the ground your front foot has to be
like<00:01:54.540> sliding<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.320> board<00:01:55.770> instantly

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
like sliding up the board instantly

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.539 
like sliding up the board instantly
because<00:01:57.329> as<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:58.350> slide<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.159> front<00:01:59.520> foot

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
because as that slide of your front foot

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
because as that slide of your front foot
up<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> board<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.270> going<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.719> what<00:02:01.290> brings

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
up the board is going to be what brings

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.490 
up the board is going to be what brings
your<00:02:02.490> back<00:02:02.880> wheels<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.509> your<00:02:03.540> tail<00:02:03.869> up<00:02:04.140> off<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
ground so if you pop the tail and then

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.990 
ground so if you pop the tail and then
you<00:02:07.530> slide<00:02:07.740> your<00:02:07.950> front<00:02:08.129> foot<00:02:08.250> up<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:08.819> your
