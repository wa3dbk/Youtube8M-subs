Hello everyone. I am doctor Sirisha Singh.
I am a consultant dermatologist and cosmetic

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.459
dermatologist. What we are going to discuss
is yellowing of the nails happening due to

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:16.460
the use of nail polish. You would know that
yellowing of the nails is due to use of a

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.369
particular nail polish when your nails which
were completely normal suddenly start to look

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.910
yellow after nail paint has been removed with
a nail polish remover. You are more likely

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.759
to have yellowing of the nails with nail polish
if you have used brighter colours like reds

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.489
or shades of reds like pink, orange, burgundy,
purple etc. The reason being that these shades

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.670
of red have iron oxides mixed in them and
these iron oxide reacts with nail bed and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.150
causes the nail to go yellow in colour very
similar to the process of rusting that happens

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:57.210
with metals which are exposed to air and water
and metals which are made of iron. Coming

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.840
to how we can prevent yellowing of the nails
due to use of nail polish. One very effective

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.720
method that you can use that is commonly known
amongst people working in salons is to use

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.510
a base coat. If you use a base coat before
you apply the colour nail paint on your nails

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.270
it kind of provides a protective layer between
the nail paint and the nail bed and prevents

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.960
the pigment from penetrating into your skin
and causing pigmentation of the nail bed.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.470
Another trick you can use is avoid shades
of red and stick to other colours like greens

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.480
or blues or lighter shades like peaches and
light purples and skin coloured or light pinks.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.010
The amount of iron oxide in these nail paints
is very less and they are less likely to cause

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.210
yellowing of your nail bed. Another trick
you need to use is avoid using acetone as

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.790
your nail polish remover. Acetone makes nails
porous and increases permeability of iron

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.360
oxide inside your nail plate. Another trick
that you could employ is to make sure that

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.390
your nail paint is cleansed out frequently.
The longer the nail paint has been in contact

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.170
with your nails the higher are the chances
of yellowing of your nails. So if you cleanse

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.930
out the nail paint very frequently, say if
you wipe it off once every week or once every

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.560
ten days and you can reapply the nail paint
again but the gap prevents the pigment from

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.739
entering the nail plate and causing colouring
of the nail plate. If you have been unfortunate

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:28.849
and if you have already developed some yellowing
of the nails then what you can do to get rid

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.810
of the yellowing of the nails is that you
can dip your fingers in water mixed with hydrogen

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.709
peroxide. You can mix one part of hydrogen
peroxide with three parts of water. Soak your

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.030
nails thoroughly in this solution and you
can take away a large amount of yellow discolouration.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.480
Another cleanser which is commonly used is
and is effective in treating yellow nails

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.390
is lemon water. Soak your nails in lemon water
and lemon which is acidic can pull out the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.760
iron oxide from the nail plate and can help
in cleansing out the nail plate and bring

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.480
back the natural colour of your nails. You
could also moisturize your nail plate in an

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.999
attempt to soothe the nail plate and cleanse
out the pigment from the nail plate. Here

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:14.499
were a few tips on managing yellow nails.
I hope you never have this problem. But if

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:19.731
you do have any queries and wish to contact
me my contact details are given in the description
