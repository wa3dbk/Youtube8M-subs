you about using Hilldale itself the
bedding<00:00:10.889> pellets<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.809> you<00:00:12.809> need<00:00:12.959> a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
bedding pellets so you need a

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.320 
bedding pellets so you need a
wheelbarrow<00:00:13.369> preferably<00:00:14.369> a<00:00:14.490> plastic<00:00:15.000> one<00:00:15.119> but

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
wheelbarrow preferably a plastic one but

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.990 
wheelbarrow preferably a plastic one but
it<00:00:15.449> doesn't<00:00:15.750> really<00:00:15.900> matter<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:17.039> bedding<00:00:17.670> fork

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
it doesn't really matter a bedding fork

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.880 
it doesn't really matter a bedding fork
I<00:00:18.270> use<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> plastic<00:00:18.869> one<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.440> you<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:19.650> use<00:00:19.859> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
I use a plastic one but you can use a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.279 
I use a plastic one but you can use a
metal<00:00:20.759> one<00:00:21.029> as<00:00:21.240> long<00:00:21.419> as<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> tines<00:00:21.960> aren't

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
metal one as long as the tines aren't

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.269 
metal one as long as the tines aren't
too<00:00:22.470> wide<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.330> a<00:00:24.330> bucket<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.929> water<00:00:25.109> at<00:00:25.890> this

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
about two minutes normally I will add

the time I'm done a stall which is less
than<00:01:04.769> five<00:01:04.979> minutes

store and then around their wet spots
and<00:01:20.780> sometimes<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.929> can<00:01:22.109> see<00:01:22.289> them<00:01:22.609> sometimes

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
and sometimes you can see them sometimes

and sometimes you can see them sometimes
it's<00:01:24.060> more<00:01:24.810> hidden<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.289> beddings<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.829> little

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
it's more hidden if beddings a little

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.120 
it's more hidden if beddings a little
deeper<00:01:26.749> and<00:01:27.749> I'll<00:01:27.929> just<00:01:28.170> scrape<00:01:28.469> away<00:01:28.679> the<00:01:28.799> dry

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
deeper and I'll just scrape away the dry

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.120 
deeper and I'll just scrape away the dry
stuff<00:01:31.249> the<00:01:32.249> wet<00:01:32.990> shavings<00:01:33.990> stick<00:01:34.289> together<00:01:34.499> so

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
stuff the wet shavings stick together so

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.129 
stuff the wet shavings stick together so
they<00:01:35.219> come<00:01:35.429> out<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> clump<00:01:36.030> because<00:01:36.990> my

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:37.139 
they come out in a clump because my

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:41.590 
they come out in a clump because my
voice<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.439> always<00:01:38.189> team<00:01:38.670> exactly<00:01:39.359> sings<00:01:39.659> Bob

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
voice is always team exactly sings Bob

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.389 
voice is always team exactly sings Bob
scooper<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.200> dry<00:01:43.439> pallet<00:01:43.950> standard

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
scooper to of a dry pallet standard

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.440 
scooper to of a dry pallet standard
because<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.299> know<00:01:45.359> they're<00:01:45.749> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.049> be

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
because I know they're going to be

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:55.400 
because I know they're going to be
soaked<00:01:48.450> by<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.810> horse

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.170 

the<00:01:56.410> reason<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:56.860> add<00:01:56.980> water<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.700> shavings

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
the reason you add water to the shavings

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.780 
the reason you add water to the shavings
is<00:01:58.540> to<00:01:59.020> get<00:01:59.200> them<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.380> expand<00:01:59.980> and<00:02:00.190> break<00:02:00.520> down

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
is to get them to expand and break down

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.400 
is to get them to expand and break down
this<00:02:01.240> makes<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.540> more<00:02:01.690> comfortable<00:02:01.960> bedding

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
this makes a more comfortable bedding

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.830 
this makes a more comfortable bedding
surface<00:02:02.920> for<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.310> horse<00:02:03.550> and<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.510> smaller

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
surface for the horse and the smaller

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.200 
surface for the horse and the smaller
surface<00:02:05.740> area<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.280> shavings<00:02:06.670> actually

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
surface area of the shavings actually

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.700 
surface area of the shavings actually
makes<00:02:07.360> them<00:02:07.540> more<00:02:07.750> absorbent<00:02:08.229> see<00:02:08.410> these<00:02:08.590> are

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
makes them more absorbent see these are

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.100 
makes them more absorbent see these are
already<00:02:08.800> softening<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.780> can<00:02:10.869> see<00:02:10.959> them

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
already softening you can see them

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.760 
already softening you can see them
crumbling<00:02:11.970> that's<00:02:12.970> what<00:02:13.150> you're<00:02:13.270> looking<00:02:13.510> for

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
crumbling that's what you're looking for

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.080 
crumbling that's what you're looking for
there's<00:02:14.770> no<00:02:14.980> water<00:02:15.220> sitting<00:02:15.580> at<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.910> bottom

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
there's no water sitting at the bottom

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:24.240 
there's no water sitting at the bottom
of<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.630> wheel<00:02:17.230> barrel<00:02:22.890> makes<00:02:23.890> excellent

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
of the wheel barrel makes excellent

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.250 
of the wheel barrel makes excellent
compost<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:28.300> stuff<00:02:28.540> becomes<00:02:28.690> with<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
compost this stuff becomes with the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.930 
compost this stuff becomes with the
manure<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.800> as<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.040> breaks<00:02:30.160> down<00:02:30.310> it's<00:02:30.670> almost

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
manure and as it breaks down it's almost

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.610 
manure and as it breaks down it's almost
like<00:02:31.209> peat<00:02:31.450> moss<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:31.930> makes<00:02:32.200> really<00:02:32.440> great

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
like peat moss so makes really great

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:58.790 
like peat moss so makes really great
stuff<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.670> put<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:33.880> your<00:02:33.940> garden

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.950 

I<00:02:58.860> found<00:02:59.670> when<00:02:59.850> I<00:02:59.880> first<00:03:00.210> set<00:03:00.420> up<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> stalls

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
I found when I first set up the stalls

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.620 
I found when I first set up the stalls
these<00:03:01.290> are<00:03:01.470> twelve<00:03:01.740> by<00:03:01.890> twelve<00:03:01.920> stalls<00:03:02.630> that

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
these are twelve by twelve stalls that

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.140 
these are twelve by twelve stalls that
we<00:03:04.140> put<00:03:04.350> in<00:03:04.470> eight<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:04.920> ten<00:03:04.950> bags<00:03:05.430> per<00:03:05.790> stall

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
we put in eight to ten bags per stall

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.920 
we put in eight to ten bags per stall
