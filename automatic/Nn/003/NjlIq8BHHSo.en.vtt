think when we meet her in this story

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.110 
think when we meet her in this story
it's<00:01:32.740> her<00:01:32.920> first<00:01:33.160> time<00:01:33.310> falling<00:01:33.850> in<00:01:34.060> love<00:01:34.270> and

it's her first time falling in love and

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.930 
it's her first time falling in love and
but<00:01:37.120> it's<00:01:37.270> more<00:01:37.510> than<00:01:37.750> just<00:01:38.250> her<00:01:39.250> first<00:01:39.550> love

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
but it's more than just her first love

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.670 
but it's more than just her first love
you<00:01:40.210> can<00:01:40.390> tell<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.780> this<00:01:40.960> is<00:01:41.110> really<00:01:41.380> the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
you can tell that this is really the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.520 
you can tell that this is really the
love<00:01:41.860> of<00:01:41.979> her<00:01:42.130> life<00:01:42.340> for<00:01:42.880> or<00:01:43.630> in<00:01:43.990> her<00:01:44.229> world

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
love of her life for or in her world

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
she's quite innocent but I wouldn't say

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.520 
she's quite innocent but I wouldn't say
naive<00:01:48.520> she's<00:01:49.450> because<00:01:49.750> she's<00:01:49.930> smart<00:01:50.080> and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530

know takes everything as it comes I did

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.810 
know takes everything as it comes I did
do<00:02:08.290> quite<00:02:08.320> a<00:02:08.590> bit<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.830> research<00:02:09.130> about<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.520> just

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
do quite a bit of research about it just

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.690 
do quite a bit of research about it just
to<00:02:10.030> know<00:02:10.209> because<00:02:10.929> for<00:02:11.250> then<00:02:12.250> things<00:02:12.520> were

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
to know because for then things were

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.520 
to know because for then things were
just<00:02:12.730> different<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.450> know<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:13.810> just<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.440> to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
just different you know you just have to

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.860 
just different you know you just have to
think<00:02:14.620> about<00:02:14.920> what<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.370> was<00:02:15.459> like<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:16.780> them

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
think about what it was like for them

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.810 
think about what it was like for them
then<00:02:17.140> which<00:02:17.350> is<00:02:17.380> great<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.130> have<00:02:18.250> Richard

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
then which is great that I have Richard

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.699 
then which is great that I have Richard
around<00:02:19.300> because<00:02:19.660> he<00:02:19.870> remembers<00:02:20.290> firsthand

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
around because he remembers firsthand

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.130 
around because he remembers firsthand
what<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.220> was<00:02:21.340> like<00:02:21.459> during<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.940> war<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.330> it

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
what it was like during the war so it

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.930 
what it was like during the war so it
makes<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.560> lot<00:02:23.680> easier<00:02:23.739> for<00:02:24.130> me<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.700> his

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
makes it a lot easier for me and his

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.699 
makes it a lot easier for me and his
wife<00:02:25.150> remembers<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.959> it's<00:02:26.080> interesting<00:02:26.620> to

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
wife remembers and it's interesting to

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.520 
wife remembers and it's interesting to
talk<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.070> her<00:02:27.220> about<00:02:27.400> what<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.810> was<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:28.989> then

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
talk to her about what it was like then

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.720 
talk to her about what it was like then
but<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:29.830> did<00:02:30.070> a<00:02:30.100> lot<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:31.170> research<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.830> American

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
but I did a lot of research on American

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.640 
but I did a lot of research on American
nurses<00:02:34.239> because<00:02:34.570> it<00:02:34.840> was<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.959> different<00:02:35.620> thing

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
nurses because it was a different thing

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.610

like<00:04:43.400> very<00:04:44.400> well-rounded<00:04:54.289> she<00:04:55.289> I<00:04:55.320> think<00:04:55.680> she's

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
like very well-rounded she I think she's

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.580 
like very well-rounded she I think she's
an<00:04:55.979> extremely<00:04:56.430> compassionate<00:04:57.320> character<00:04:58.320> and

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
an extremely compassionate character and

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.529 
an extremely compassionate character and
I<00:04:59.220> don't<00:04:59.669> mean<00:05:00.090> that<00:05:00.150> in<00:05:00.389> like<00:05:00.509> a

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
I don't mean that in like a

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.060 
I don't mean that in like a
condescending<00:05:01.080> way<00:05:01.380> about<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.770> way<00:05:01.860> she

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
condescending way about the way she

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.800 
condescending way about the way she
abused<00:05:02.310> Teddy<00:05:02.580> but<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:02.910> think<00:05:03.210> that<00:05:03.389> part<00:05:03.660> of

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
abused Teddy but I think that part of

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.920 
abused Teddy but I think that part of
what<00:05:04.050> she<00:05:04.800> really<00:05:05.250> loves<00:05:05.669> him<00:05:05.940> for<00:05:05.970> is<00:05:06.449> that<00:05:06.840> he

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
what she really loves him for is that he

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.290 
what she really loves him for is that he
doesn't<00:05:07.259> have<00:05:07.380> much<00:05:07.650> but<00:05:08.520> he<00:05:08.669> just<00:05:08.849> loves<00:05:09.090> her

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
doesn't have much but he just loves her

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.629 
doesn't have much but he just loves her
so<00:05:10.110> it's<00:05:10.259> a<00:05:10.320> very<00:05:10.500> simple<00:05:11.009> kind<00:05:11.190> of<00:05:11.430> love

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
so it's a very simple kind of love

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.040 
so it's a very simple kind of love
because<00:05:12.030> he<00:05:12.120> has<00:05:12.240> nothing<00:05:12.389> really<00:05:12.570> to<00:05:12.810> offer

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
because he has nothing really to offer

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.409 
because he has nothing really to offer
her<00:05:13.380> so<00:05:14.220> I<00:05:14.250> think<00:05:14.400> she<00:05:14.699> feels<00:05:14.849> she's<00:05:15.180> his

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
her so I think she feels she's his

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:22.399 
her so I think she feels she's his
protector<00:05:16.050> and<00:05:16.259> she's<00:05:17.130> you<00:05:17.970> know<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:21.409> just

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
protector and she's you know I just

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.800 
protector and she's you know I just
think<00:05:22.650> that<00:05:22.800> everything<00:05:23.490> for<00:05:23.909> Athlon<00:05:24.419> clicks

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
think that everything for Athlon clicks

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.300 
think that everything for Athlon clicks
into<00:05:25.080> place<00:05:25.110> when<00:05:25.590> she<00:05:26.300> you<00:05:27.300> know<00:05:27.830> feels<00:05:28.830> that

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
into place when she you know feels that

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.670 
into place when she you know feels that
love<00:05:29.639> reciprocated<00:05:30.449> from<00:05:30.659> teddy<00:05:30.870> because

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
love reciprocated from teddy because

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.560 
love reciprocated from teddy because
yeah<00:05:31.949> I<00:05:32.070> think<00:05:32.400> he's<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:32.849> kind<00:05:33.060> of<00:05:33.120> character

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
yeah I think he's the kind of character

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.089 
yeah I think he's the kind of character
where<00:05:33.750> it's<00:05:33.930> difficult<00:05:34.139> for<00:05:34.500> him<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.680> profess

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
where it's difficult for him to profess

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.430 
where it's difficult for him to profess
the<00:05:35.280> way<00:05:35.370> he<00:05:35.490> feels<00:05:35.639> about<00:05:35.880> her<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:36.509> he's<00:05:37.139> not

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
the way he feels about her and he's not

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.230 
the way he feels about her and he's not
easy<00:05:37.830> for<00:05:38.130> him<00:05:38.250> to<00:05:38.310> say<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.789> she<00:05:39.030> knows<00:05:39.210> that

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
easy for him to say and she knows that

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.420 
easy for him to say and she knows that
and<00:05:39.690> she<00:05:39.840> can<00:05:39.870> see<00:05:40.259> that<00:05:40.500> and<00:05:40.710> she<00:05:40.919> pulls<00:05:41.250> the

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
and she can see that and she pulls the

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.060 
and she can see that and she pulls the
best<00:05:41.639> out<00:05:41.849> of<00:05:41.880> him<00:05:42.060> and<00:05:42.479> that<00:05:43.050> makes<00:05:43.770> her<00:05:44.039> a

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
best out of him and that makes her a

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.219 
best out of him and that makes her a
very<00:05:44.159> compassionate<00:05:44.699> loving<00:05:45.180> person<00:05:45.810> and<00:05:45.930> so

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
very compassionate loving person and so

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.350 
very compassionate loving person and so
they<00:05:46.919> sort<00:05:47.190> of<00:05:47.310> are<00:05:47.550> lost<00:05:47.940> in<00:05:48.180> their<00:05:48.330> own

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
they sort of are lost in their own

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.480 
they sort of are lost in their own
bubble<00:05:48.719> taking<00:05:49.560> care<00:05:49.770> of<00:05:49.800> each<00:05:49.979> other<00:05:50.250> and

bubble taking care of each other and

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:57.350

everybody<00:05:50.669> else<00:05:50.969> is<00:05:51.150> pushed<00:05:51.509> out<00:05:51.690> of<00:05:51.870> it

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.150 

it's<00:05:58.360> a<00:05:58.480> real<00:05:58.690> marriage<00:05:58.900> and<00:05:59.230> in<00:05:59.500> Ethel<00:06:00.010> Anne's

him and that makes it as real as it
needs<00:06:13.600> to<00:06:13.720> be<00:06:13.780> for<00:06:14.110> her<00:06:14.200> because<00:06:14.410> she<00:06:14.620> knows

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
needs to be for her because she knows

emotional and crumbling experience for

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.570 
emotional and crumbling experience for

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:57.640 
that and you know honestly I think that

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.560 
that and you know honestly I think that
if<00:06:57.790> anybody<00:06:58.180> is<00:06:58.300> sort<00:06:59.260> of<00:06:59.760> the<00:07:00.760> mark<00:07:01.060> of<00:07:01.360> that

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.570 
if anybody is sort of the mark of that

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.030 
if anybody is sort of the mark of that
it<00:07:01.750> would<00:07:01.840> be<00:07:01.960> Richard<00:07:02.350> so<00:07:02.620> he's<00:07:02.830> like<00:07:03.010> the

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.040 
it would be Richard so he's like the

it would be Richard so he's like the
perfect<00:07:03.520> I<00:07:03.970> mean<00:07:04.120> he<00:07:04.300> believes<00:07:04.450> him<00:07:05.110> and<00:07:05.230> his
