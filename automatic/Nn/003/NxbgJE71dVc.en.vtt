00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.740
 however 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.209
 clear river 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.689
 the wise old man calmed his grandson and said fondly 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.880
 let me tell you a story 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.279
 I myself sometimes feel very sorry for those who have offended me, but without 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.919
 attendance 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:27.989
 however 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.539
 may occur is our intimacy but do not hurt our enemy 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.500
 is the same as taking poison wishing that the enemy fine 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 hulu has many times against these feelings 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.890
 the net listened carefully to the grandfather's considerations 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.110
 and he continued 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.160
 it's like there are two new ones inside of me 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.490
 one of them is good 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.760
 do not hurt anyone 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.660
 live in harmony with all and not suffer 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.370
 it will only come back when it is right to do this and the right way 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.620
 but another group 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.550
 this full of anger 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.200
 Even the nasty little things easily lift you up 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.790
 hackers 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.360
 he fights with one all the time without any reason 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.360
 so irrational that he can never change anything 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.110
 sometimes it's hard to get along with these two new ones inside of me because 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.300
 both try to dominate in the spirit 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.510
 the golden boy intensely in the eyes of his grandfather and asked 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.910
 and which one has insurance 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.510
 the new one smiled and responded in style 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.510
 the one that is the food most frequently 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.650
 the figure of the world is significant 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.290
 since it represents the degree of animosity that still remains of our 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.700
 actions 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.579
 as a human being does not develop all the virtues that have elevated him to 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.170
 superior spirit category 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.170
 there will always be in your intimacy a little of the irrational 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.869
 and this internal struggle is what will define our tomorrow according to the side that 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.660
 but feeds years 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.700
 sometimes 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.929
 the simple act unthought a simple unhappy action 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.929
 we can bring bitter consequences for a long time 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.089
 the great and apostle of Christianity 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.089
 I well identify this intimate struggle when I said 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.749
 The good I want and if I do not 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:25.049
 but the evil I do not want and if I do 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.010
 indignant for some times still being overwhelmed by the old man at a loss 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.189
 of the young man who wanted to be 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.639
 paulo blew up and left us this great mission 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.079
 it is necessary to persevere 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.930
 it is necessary to let this new thirst for revenge and obsessed with anger that 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.759
 still finds vitality and in the sub-21 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:50.739
 receive no food and disappear from time to time giving way to man 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.739
 morally renewed that we wish to be 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.179
 acting this way 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:59.189
 may we one day not too far away 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.139
 say as the apostle Paul himself said after beating himself 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.889
 it's not me who decides 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.469
 It's the Christ that lives in me. 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:11.969
 but for us to get to that point 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.529
 we have to wage many internal battles in order to make the 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.059
 teachings and examples of jesus 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:19.909
 the master par excellence 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.239
 make sense to us to the point of being 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.239
 propel our thoughts and actions 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:40.969
 did you know that paulo de tarsus renounced many things to follow jesus 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:45.400
 he was one of the first persecutors of Christians on behalf of 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:47.119
 your religious belief 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.519
 after I saw the master the doors of the damask city 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.949
 became his faithful follower until the last days of his life 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.419
 but for this it was necessary to silence often the inner beast who tried 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.019
 speak more loud 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.370
 it was necessary to renounce oneself 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.199
 leave pride aside 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.779
 take of your cross in following in the footsteps of - traders 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:14.079
 will rarify
