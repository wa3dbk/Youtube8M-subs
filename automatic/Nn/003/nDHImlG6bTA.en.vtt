00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.990
 young people with another 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.360
 Subscribers gameplay though it is yes 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.789
 not a whole gameplay it's just one 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.960
 that's just a cam strike street 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:30.140
 to the garden stop social into the endgame 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.780
 domination warhawk hany azer and each 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.230
 a lot of mountain specialists he's been up for 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.899
 specializes fighting to earn so 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.920
 lator and linked again and now 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.540
 But actually comes to the topic for 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.129
 today because the people are me now 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.600
 Been subscribed to it for a long time 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.469
 I have not had it for a long time 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.079
 made what i find quotes totally awesome 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.749
 and finally I have one again 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.510
 I had to smile 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:01:00.499
 and that is a quote 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.960
 oliver wendell holmes does not become one 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:05.120
 I quite honestly know I have one 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.990
 Googled a bit and that was it 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.690
 about 1800 something yes so how it's done 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.000
 old quote will still be so 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.909
 and yes I 'll just go now 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.530
 unwilling to fade in and because now 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.360
 Definitely a few people again 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.520
 maybe a little reading breaks or 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.500
 can not read nice greetings to you 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.610
 my dear hater, I mean there 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.240
 not that I have come this far 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.500
 so if you read this, you too 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.170
 whole time here now 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.670
 so people do not stop playing 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.860
 because they are getting old 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.399
 they get old because they stop 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.439
 play and that's really easy 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.240
 so yes you can do it differently 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:51.109
 So yes, there are always many people 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.799
 Adolescents who want to be so different 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:56.719
 teenagers are and are older 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.140
 want to be as they actually are and 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:04.179
 so much fun just once 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.460
 To play means to have fun and why 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.530
 should then all just to older 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.970
 Act 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.480
 why do you want to take the fun 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.890
 why should older people enjoy themselves 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.750
 take 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.290
 to play something and be it now 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.200
 call of duty 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.000
 and there is even call of duty I am 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.189
 not the youngest here any more 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.180
 many of my subscribers could be easy 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.340
 be out my children 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.230
 So far, I'm not the one 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.900
 oldest so I'm still with me 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.890
 in the friendship list people still 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.650
 are older than me 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.280
 and you also like to play well 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.239
 not to believe 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.040
 Well, now no kg of 80 determines 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.920
 or below or something like that 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.590
 which is then also totally sausage because 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.049
 also ideas not get out once again here 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.970
 a died two times is my can 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.689
 you can not reach cam strike x 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.659
 or mopo de nuke or what was there 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:02.669
 still clever lea therefore the need themselves 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.919
 not before any people with it 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.840
 breasts suitable yesterday again 80 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:10.019
 Million camp for excel game 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.049
 that just does not matter and you know 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.889
 why because they are just real 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.500
 have discovered 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:19.079
 why you should play his hobby 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.870
 actually does not deserve here so 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.479
 money with for an hour played 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.720
 has trained call of duty play for 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:29.400
 around 20 euros per hour and things bow 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.159
 play a bit taxed directly 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.379
 who is great but not so and so 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.879
 we just have that for ourselves 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.919
 made 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:41.180
 i go places that work hard 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:44.430
 When I moved then I pulled out of fun 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:50.069
 this is perhaps the one or what 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:53.159
 other younger players are still learning 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.109
 should and with that and because of the gameplay 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.459
 is already finished I will to 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.049
 conclusion for this comments com

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.359
 be moved between how the 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.549
 Do not make quite that much only when I am 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.680
