super super spicy the only thing that
this<00:03:20.849> is<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.209> I've<00:03:21.329> never<00:03:21.359> had<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.840> happen

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
I think it's just because this is a kind

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.909 
I think it's just because this is a kind
of<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.359> different<00:03:24.750> bun<00:03:24.989> different<00:03:25.409> bread<00:03:25.650> is
