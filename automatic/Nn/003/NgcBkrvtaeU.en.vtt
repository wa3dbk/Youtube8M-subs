essentially a gasoline engine the DS

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.180 
essentially a gasoline engine the DS
approach<00:00:46.840> comes<00:00:47.200> from<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.530> fact<00:00:47.770> that<00:00:47.890> we

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
approach comes from the fact that we

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.190 
approach comes from the fact that we
utilize<00:00:48.610> a<00:00:48.640> combustion<00:00:49.270> process<00:00:49.450> which

utilize a combustion process which

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.080 
utilize a combustion process which
functions<00:00:50.680> in<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:50.980> manner<00:00:51.160> similar<00:00:51.460> to<00:00:51.730> the
