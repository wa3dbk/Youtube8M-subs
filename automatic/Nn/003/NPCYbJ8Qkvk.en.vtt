find i have called alpha wave so this
one<00:00:13.890> was<00:00:13.980> brought<00:00:14.190> up<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.430> me<00:00:14.700> by<00:00:15.030> the

one's<00:00:22.620> a<00:00:22.740> little<00:00:23.340> bit<00:00:23.730> simpler<00:00:24.270> than<00:00:24.390> some<00:00:24.570> of

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
one's a little bit simpler than some of

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.930 
one's a little bit simpler than some of
the<00:00:24.930> other<00:00:25.080> finds<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.010> I've<00:00:26.130> had<00:00:26.340> recently

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
the other finds that I've had recently

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.380 
the other finds that I've had recently
it's<00:00:27.480> still<00:00:27.690> a<00:00:27.720> really<00:00:27.990> good<00:00:28.110> game

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
it's still a really good game

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
it's still a really good game
interestingly<00:00:30.390> enough<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.080> actually<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
interestingly enough it's actually a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.709 
interestingly enough it's actually a
shooter<00:00:31.770> game<00:00:31.949> as<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.430> see<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.390> kind<00:00:33.659> of

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
shooter game as you can see it's kind of

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.319 
shooter game as you can see it's kind of
asteroids<00:00:34.649> meets<00:00:35.010> space<00:00:35.460> invaders<00:00:35.940> type<00:00:36.179> of

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
asteroids meets space invaders type of

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.380 
asteroids meets space invaders type of
game<00:00:37.429> but<00:00:38.429> what's<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:38.909> interesting<00:00:39.120> about

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
game but what's really interesting about

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.750 
game but what's really interesting about
this<00:00:39.659> is<00:00:39.719> I've<00:00:40.319> had<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.800> many<00:00:41.039> of<00:00:41.190> these<00:00:41.399> finds

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
this is I've had so many of these finds

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.329 
this is I've had so many of these finds
now<00:00:42.089> that<00:00:43.050> keep<00:00:43.260> turning<00:00:43.649> up<00:00:43.739> as<00:00:44.010> these

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
now that keep turning up as these

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.899 
now that keep turning up as these
shooter<00:00:45.030> games<00:00:45.239> they're<00:00:46.199> all<00:00:46.319> really<00:00:46.499> good

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
shooter games they're all really good

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.299 
shooter games they're all really good
but<00:00:47.909> maybe<00:00:48.870> there's<00:00:49.109> something<00:00:49.379> about<00:00:49.859> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
but maybe there's something about a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.869 
but maybe there's something about a
nostalgia<00:00:51.269> thing<00:00:51.479> or<00:00:52.019> I<00:00:52.799> you<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.519> don't

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
nostalgia thing or I you know I don't

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.789 
nostalgia thing or I you know I don't
know<00:00:53.999> maybe<00:00:54.239> they're<00:00:54.449> easier<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.139> do<00:00:55.319> and<00:00:55.649> so

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.799 
know maybe they're easier to do and so

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.299 
know maybe they're easier to do and so
teams<00:00:56.549> of<00:00:56.760> smaller<00:00:56.969> people<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:58.309> fewer

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
teams of smaller people can a fewer

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.279 
teams of smaller people can a fewer
people<00:00:59.489> actually<00:00:59.729> smaller<00:01:00.149> people<00:01:00.449> teams<00:01:01.139> of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
people actually smaller people teams of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.259 
people actually smaller people teams of
fewer<00:01:01.559> people<00:01:01.979> can<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.489> crank<00:01:02.909> these<00:01:03.030> games

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
fewer people can can crank these games

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.270 
fewer people can can crank these games
out<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> little<00:01:03.600> better<00:01:04.039> but<00:01:05.039> you<00:01:05.129> should

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
out a little better but you should

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.380 
out a little better but you should
notice<00:01:05.610> some<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.360> interesting

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
notice some of the really interesting

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.899 
notice some of the really interesting
things<00:01:06.810> about<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.170> game<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.610> 3d

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
things about this game is the the 3d

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
rendering on all the different sprites

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.389 
rendering on all the different sprites
and<00:01:11.340> different<00:01:11.610> models<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.240> good<00:01:13.399> but

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
and different models is really good but

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.130 
and different models is really good but
all<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.729> asteroids<00:01:15.119> look<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.450> good<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
all the asteroids look really good the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.920 
all the asteroids look really good the
background<00:01:16.649> though<00:01:17.219> it's<00:01:17.759> not<00:01:17.939> really<00:01:18.329> a<00:01:18.509> 3d

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
background though it's not really a 3d

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.719 
background though it's not really a 3d
background<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.619> looks<00:01:19.649> like<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> 3d<00:01:20.280> background

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
background it looks like a 3d background

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.520 
background it looks like a 3d background
it's<00:01:21.659> pretty<00:01:21.869> good<00:01:22.049> pretty<00:01:22.259> good

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
it's pretty good pretty good

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.609 
it's pretty good pretty good
rendered<00:01:23.130> pretty<00:01:23.369> well<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.289> object<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
rendered pretty well so the object of

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.490 
rendered pretty well so the object of
this<00:01:25.710> game<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:27.210> blow<00:01:27.600> up<00:01:27.990> that's

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
this game is to just blow up that's

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.539 
this game is to just blow up that's
what<00:01:28.649> it<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.770> you're<00:01:29.100> trying<00:01:29.219> to<00:01:29.369> blow

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
what it is you're trying to blow

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.550 
what it is you're trying to blow
everything<00:01:29.759> up<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.179> see<00:01:30.359> I<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:31.380> waved

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
everything up you can see I just waved

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.490 
everything up you can see I just waved
up<00:01:32.090> on<00:01:33.090> my<00:01:33.240> wave<00:01:33.420> too<00:01:33.630> now<00:01:33.810> there<00:01:34.409> are

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
up on my wave too now there are

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.050 
up on my wave too now there are
different<00:01:34.770> power-ups<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.280> well<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.789> idea

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
different power-ups as well but the idea

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
different power-ups as well but the idea
is<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.329> break<00:01:36.899> stuff<00:01:37.229> until<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.829> level<00:01:38.219> up

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
is just break stuff until you level up

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
is just break stuff until you level up
and<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.609> keep<00:01:38.820> leveling<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.689> your<00:01:40.079> score

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
and you keep leveling up and your score

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.609 
and you keep leveling up and your score
goes<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.859> and<00:01:41.130> until<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.969> die<00:01:42.530> that's<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
goes up and until you die that's a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.480 
goes up and until you die that's a
weapon<00:01:43.799> do<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.219> get<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.490> yes

just get the highest score of all and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.320 
just get the highest score of all and
the<00:02:01.040> interesting<00:02:01.700> thing<00:02:01.729> is<00:02:01.880> there's

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
the interesting thing is there's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.240 
the interesting thing is there's
different<00:02:03.020> power-ups<00:02:03.530> but<00:02:03.920> there's<00:02:04.039> also

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
different power-ups but there's also

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.219 
different power-ups but there's also
power<00:02:04.610> downs<00:02:04.970> like<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:05.539> for<00:02:05.780> instance

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
power downs like that for instance

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.190 
power downs like that for instance
that's<00:02:06.619> a<00:02:06.770> speed<00:02:07.070> down<00:02:07.369> power<00:02:07.729> power<00:02:08.420> down<00:02:08.720> not

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
that's a speed down power power down not

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.990 
that's a speed down power power down not
up<00:02:09.319> speed<00:02:09.560> down<00:02:09.709> power<00:02:09.979> up<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.580> speed<00:02:10.850> down

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
up speed down power up to speed down

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.640 
up speed down power up to speed down
power<00:02:11.390> down<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.330> right<00:02:14.720> there<00:02:14.750> was

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
power down and that right there was

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.720 
power down and that right there was
aptly<00:02:16.630> described<00:02:17.630> as<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.590> shitty<00:02:18.950> weapon

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.000

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
one for right hitting them will make you

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.360 
one for right hitting them will make you
go<00:02:38.660> in<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.049> direction<00:02:39.230> there<00:02:39.980> are<00:02:40.160> no

go in that direction there are no

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.490 
go in that direction there are no
alternate<00:02:40.910> control<00:02:41.209> schemes<00:02:41.569> which<00:02:42.200> for<00:02:42.410> me

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
alternate control schemes which for me

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.840 
alternate control schemes which for me
kind<00:02:42.830> of<00:02:42.980> was<00:02:43.900> unfortunate<00:02:44.900> but<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:46.340> works

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
kind of was unfortunate but it works

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.880 
kind of was unfortunate but it works
what-what-what-what<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:48.230> developer<00:02:48.620> has

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
what-what-what-what the developer has

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.729 
what-what-what-what the developer has
made<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.609> game<00:02:49.790> really<00:02:50.600> works<00:02:50.840> well<00:02:51.350> and

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
made in the game really works well and

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.610 
made in the game really works well and
so<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.600> don't<00:02:53.600> think<00:02:53.870> anybody's<00:02:54.230> gonna<00:02:54.350> feel

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620

Kaniksu also have access to the bombs

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.680 
Kaniksu also have access to the bombs
which<00:03:14.490> are<00:03:14.610> on<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.760> left<00:03:14.790> hand<00:03:15.120> side<00:03:15.330> which<00:03:15.510> if

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
which are on the left hand side which if

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.940 
which are on the left hand side which if
I<00:03:15.780> were<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.050> use<00:03:16.080> that<00:03:17.090> it'll<00:03:18.090> recharge<00:03:18.950> over

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
I were to use that it'll recharge over

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.410 
I were to use that it'll recharge over
the<00:03:20.070> course<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.520> maybe<00:03:20.700> about<00:03:20.790> 10<00:03:21.150> or<00:03:21.270> 15

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
the course of maybe about 10 or 15

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.390 
the course of maybe about 10 or 15
seconds<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:22.230> then<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.740> can<00:03:22.770> only<00:03:22.980> use<00:03:23.220> it

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
seconds and then you can only use it

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.940 
seconds and then you can only use it
that<00:03:23.550> often<00:03:23.760> there<00:03:24.660> we<00:03:24.750> go<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:24.900> use<00:03:25.200> one<00:03:25.410> so

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
that often there we go just use one so

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.400 
that often there we go just use one so
now<00:03:26.070> it's<00:03:26.220> recharging<00:03:26.960> maybe<00:03:27.960> takes<00:03:28.260> as

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
now it's recharging maybe takes as

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.810 
now it's recharging maybe takes as
little<00:03:28.650> as<00:03:28.740> five<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:32.280> there<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.490> go<00:03:32.610> it's

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
little as five so there you go it's

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.220 
little as five so there you go it's
probably<00:03:33.150> about<00:03:33.300> ten<00:03:33.540> seconds<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.020> looks<00:03:34.140> like

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
probably about ten seconds it looks like

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.330 
probably about ten seconds it looks like
it's<00:03:34.380> about<00:03:34.500> ten<00:03:34.680> seconds<00:03:35.040> it's<00:03:35.190> almost

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
it's about ten seconds it's almost

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.210 
it's about ten seconds it's almost
charged<00:03:35.910> now<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:37.620> on<00:03:37.710> the<00:03:37.800> right<00:03:37.950> hand<00:03:38.130> side

thing<00:03:51.360> about<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.170> gun<00:03:52.440> thing<00:03:52.830> is<00:03:53.070> is<00:03:53.280> that

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
thing about the the gun thing is is that

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.460 
thing about the the gun thing is is that
it<00:03:53.490> changes<00:03:53.910> per<00:03:54.180> gun<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:55.110> it's<00:03:55.290> this

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
it changes per gun so it's this

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.560 
it changes per gun so it's this
limited-time<00:03:55.950> fire<00:03:56.490> that<00:03:56.850> only<00:03:57.060> works<00:03:57.390> for

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
limited-time fire that only works for

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.500 
limited-time fire that only works for
about<00:03:57.660> five<00:03:58.020> seconds<00:03:58.500> through<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.740> game<00:03:58.920> and

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
about five seconds through the game and

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.010 
about five seconds through the game and
there<00:04:00.510> we<00:04:00.600> go

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
there we go

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.500 
there we go
and<00:04:01.110> there<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.410> goes<00:04:02.220> awesomely<00:04:02.880> time<00:04:03.270> to

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
and there it goes awesomely time to

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.030 
and there it goes awesomely time to
press

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
press

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.100 
press
we<00:04:05.819> haven't<00:04:06.030> caught<00:04:06.180> on<00:04:06.360> yet<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.659> actually

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
we haven't caught on yet I actually

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.740 
we haven't caught on yet I actually
reported<00:04:07.590> this<00:04:07.709> not<00:04:08.340> live<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:09.060> played<00:04:09.569> through

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
reported this not live I played through

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.119 
reported this not live I played through
the<00:04:09.840> game<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.200> then<00:04:10.290> decided<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.739> do<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:10.890> voice

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
the game and then decided to do a voice

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.670 
the game and then decided to do a voice
over<00:04:11.750> because<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:12.870> game<00:04:13.079> does<00:04:13.290> require<00:04:13.590> a

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
over because this game does require a

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.080 
over because this game does require a
little<00:04:13.860> bit<00:04:14.010> of<00:04:14.129> concentration<00:04:14.909> and<00:04:15.000> I

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
little bit of concentration and I

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.430 
little bit of concentration and I
probably<00:04:15.269> would<00:04:15.540> have<00:04:15.629> just<00:04:15.780> had<00:04:15.810> massive

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
probably would have just had massive

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.469 
probably would have just had massive
fail<00:04:16.709> if<00:04:16.919> I<00:04:17.010> was<00:04:17.160> trying<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.579> concentrate<00:04:18.239> on

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
fail if I was trying to concentrate on

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.979 
fail if I was trying to concentrate on
the<00:04:18.540> game<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.109> talk<00:04:19.799> at<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.100> same<00:04:20.280> time<00:04:20.989> so

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
the game and talk at the same time so

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.270 
the game and talk at the same time so
anyways<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.410> cool<00:04:22.590> thing<00:04:22.740> is<00:04:22.889> is<00:04:23.039> that<00:04:23.100> each

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
anyways the cool thing is is that each

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.159 
anyways the cool thing is is that each
gun<00:04:23.550> has<00:04:23.789> its<00:04:23.970> own<00:04:24.150> graphic<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:24.810> its<00:04:24.930> own

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
gun has its own graphic and its own

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.290 
gun has its own graphic and its own
really<00:04:25.590> cool<00:04:25.919> super<00:04:26.370> weapon<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:26.699> you<00:04:27.000> can<00:04:27.180> do

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
really cool super weapon that you can do

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.730 
really cool super weapon that you can do

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
when that thing's powered up and that

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.730 
when that thing's powered up and that
thing<00:04:29.010> powers<00:04:29.400> up<00:04:29.610> every<00:04:29.970> time<00:04:30.210> that<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.740> get

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
thing powers up every time that you get

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
in the game I've only gotten the exact

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.279

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
the game

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.740 
the game
it's<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.610> pulse<00:04:38.910> thing<00:04:39.320> buckshot

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750

you can see I have the super of that
right<00:04:44.370> now<00:04:44.400> because<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:44.880> it<00:04:45.240> carries<00:04:45.930> over<00:04:46.199> if

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
right now because I it carries over if

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.170 
right now because I it carries over if
you<00:04:46.710> had<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:46.889> super<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.430> other<00:04:47.639> gun<00:04:47.880> when

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
you had a super of the other gun when

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.840 
you had a super of the other gun when
you<00:04:48.270> change<00:04:48.510> guns<00:04:49.070> so<00:04:50.070> if<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.250> were<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.460> super

you change guns so if I were to super

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.370 
you change guns so if I were to super

does change quite a bit I'm not sure how

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.640 
does change quite a bit I'm not sure how
deep<00:05:11.789> that<00:05:11.820> rabbit<00:05:12.419> hole<00:05:12.449> goes<00:05:12.630> but<00:05:13.500> I<00:05:13.530> know

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
deep that rabbit hole goes but I know

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.529 
deep that rabbit hole goes but I know
that<00:05:14.039> as<00:05:14.250> long<00:05:14.580> as<00:05:14.729> I've<00:05:14.910> played<00:05:15.180> through

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.390 
I must have gotten around 35 or 40 but
anyways<00:05:28.320> there<00:05:28.530> was<00:05:28.650> new<00:05:28.770> enemies<00:05:29.130> all<00:05:29.310> the

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
anyways there was new enemies all the

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.589 
anyways there was new enemies all the
way<00:05:29.490> down<00:05:29.699> and<00:05:29.820> it<00:05:29.910> got<00:05:30.060> more<00:05:30.240> and<00:05:30.419> more

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
way down and it got more and more

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.050 
way down and it got more and more
difficult<00:05:31.130> so<00:05:32.130> here's<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.460> super<00:05:32.789> of<00:05:32.910> that

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
difficult so here's the super of that

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.270 
difficult so here's the super of that
gun<00:05:33.240> fires<00:05:33.780> about<00:05:34.020> three<00:05:34.289> times<00:05:34.470> four<00:05:34.979> times

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
gun fires about three times four times

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.029 
gun fires about three times four times
and<00:05:36.260> then<00:05:37.260> you<00:05:37.380> can<00:05:37.500> see<00:05:37.650> on<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.800> right<00:05:37.949> hand

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
and then you can see on the right hand

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:45.890 
and then you can see on the right hand
side<00:05:38.280> now<00:05:38.310> it's<00:05:38.639> not<00:05:38.820> enough<00:05:39.240> anymore

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.020 

and<00:05:46.320> once<00:05:46.500> I<00:05:46.590> grab<00:05:46.830> this<00:05:47.210> it's<00:05:49.700> got<00:05:50.700> some<00:05:50.820> crazy

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
and once I grab this it's got some crazy

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.210 
and once I grab this it's got some crazy
comments<00:05:51.600> coming<00:05:51.870> here<00:05:52.230> I<00:05:52.560> think<00:05:53.010> this<00:05:53.070> is

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
comments coming here I think this is

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.170 
comments coming here I think this is
about<00:05:53.340> where<00:05:53.670> the<00:05:54.000> third<00:05:54.360> gun<00:05:54.600> comes<00:05:54.930> in<00:05:56.180> it's

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
about where the third gun comes in it's

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.810 
about where the third gun comes in it's
in<00:05:57.240> here<00:05:57.420> somewhere

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.310 

so<00:06:02.360> it<00:06:02.420> gets<00:06:02.570> really<00:06:02.660> interesting<00:06:02.810> where<00:06:03.230> you

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
gun I can't think what this was called

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.510 
gun I can't think what this was called
this<00:06:25.850> the<00:06:26.840> Vulcan<00:06:27.230> cannon<00:06:27.620> it's<00:06:28.280> pretty

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
this the Vulcan cannon it's pretty

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.240 
this the Vulcan cannon it's pretty
effective<00:06:29.080> the<00:06:30.080> supercharge<00:06:30.710> of<00:06:30.890> that<00:06:31.010> is

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
effective the supercharge of that is

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.370 
effective the supercharge of that is
actually<00:06:31.700> pretty<00:06:32.060> fun<00:06:32.330> one<00:06:33.020> interesting

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
actually pretty fun one interesting

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.110 
actually pretty fun one interesting
thing<00:06:33.410> is<00:06:33.710> the<00:06:34.100> shield<00:06:34.400> if<00:06:34.730> you<00:06:34.820> were<00:06:34.880> to<00:06:35.000> pick

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
thing is the shield if you were to pick

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.820 
thing is the shield if you were to pick
up<00:06:35.240> a<00:06:35.330> shield<00:06:35.600> then<00:06:35.870> you<00:06:35.930> already<00:06:36.110> had<00:06:36.380> full<00:06:36.680> if

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
up a shield then you already had full if

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.380 
up a shield then you already had full if
you<00:06:36.950> had<00:06:37.040> a<00:06:37.070> hundred<00:06:37.340> percent<00:06:37.460> it'll<00:06:38.270> actually

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
you had a hundred percent it'll actually

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.970 
you had a hundred percent it'll actually
give<00:06:38.660> you<00:06:38.750> an<00:06:38.840> additional<00:06:39.290> twenty<00:06:39.620> but<00:06:39.860> it's

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
give you an additional twenty but it's

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.950 
give you an additional twenty but it's
slowly<00:06:40.400> degenerate<00:06:40.760> as<00:06:41.270> if<00:06:41.480> your<00:06:41.600> shield<00:06:41.840> was

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
slowly degenerate as if your shield was

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.390 
slowly degenerate as if your shield was
kind<00:06:42.170> of<00:06:42.230> overcharged<00:06:45.040> do<00:06:46.040> they<00:06:46.160> do<00:06:46.220> this

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
kind of overcharged do they do this

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.590 
kind of overcharged do they do this
really<00:06:46.670> weird<00:06:46.910> thing<00:06:47.120> where<00:06:47.270> they<00:06:47.330> like<00:06:47.450> they

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
really weird thing where they like they

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.090 
really weird thing where they like they
come<00:06:47.810> at<00:06:47.930> you<00:06:48.050> then<00:06:48.200> they<00:06:48.290> they<00:06:48.440> run<00:06:48.740> away<00:06:48.950> and

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
come at you then they they run away and

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.790 
come at you then they they run away and
then<00:06:49.220> shoot<00:06:49.430> it's<00:06:50.330> actually<00:06:50.660> pretty<00:06:50.870> cool<00:06:53.800> it

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
then shoot it's actually pretty cool it

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.590 
then shoot it's actually pretty cool it
makes<00:06:55.100> it<00:06:55.250> more<00:06:55.430> hectic<00:06:55.910> when<00:06:56.090> there's<00:06:56.240> a<00:06:56.330> lot

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
makes it more hectic when there's a lot

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.550 
makes it more hectic when there's a lot
of<00:06:56.780> things<00:06:56.960> in<00:06:57.050> the<00:06:57.140> screen

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
of things in the screen

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.610 
of things in the screen
so<00:06:57.800> there's<00:06:57.980> the<00:06:58.130> supercharged<00:06:58.730> of<00:06:59.000> it

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
so there's the supercharged of it

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:06.180 
so there's the supercharged of it
pretty<00:07:00.610> extreme<00:07:01.300> pretty<00:07:01.900> extreme<00:07:04.979> alright<00:07:05.979> so

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
pretty extreme pretty extreme alright so

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.879 
pretty extreme pretty extreme alright so
