00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
one thing that a term that comes up so

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.200 
one thing that a term that comes up so
real<00:00:41.280> quick<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.329> we've<00:00:42.570> got<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:44.210> cord

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
real quick you know we've got a cord

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.040 
real quick you know we've got a cord
will<00:00:45.390> pick<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> chord<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.020> G<00:00:46.230> chord<00:00:46.260> there's<00:00:47.039> G

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
will pick a chord a G chord there's G

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.900 
will pick a chord a G chord there's G
okay<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.070> G<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> reed<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> E

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
okay so that is G with the reed on the E

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.630 
okay so that is G with the reed on the E
string<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.420> also<00:00:51.690> play<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.770> bar<00:00:53.340> chord

10th<00:01:06.659> fret<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.500> should<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.369> know

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
10th fret you should just know you know

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.570 
10th fret you should just know you know
start<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> know<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.150> already<00:01:10.490> found<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
start to know that already found the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.440 
start to know that already found the
root<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.939> string

root on the a string

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.859 
root on the a string
okay<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.640> G<00:01:14.640> major<00:01:14.850> chord<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:17.210> string<00:01:18.210> root<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
okay so G major chord a string root a

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.440 
okay so G major chord a string root a
string<00:01:19.710> looking<00:01:20.070> shape<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.909> that's<00:01:21.000> G<00:01:21.240> major

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
string looking shape so that's G major

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.569 
string looking shape so that's G major
we<00:01:22.049> had<00:01:26.119> all<00:01:27.119> right<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.080> G<00:01:28.350> chord

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
we had all right so that was a G chord

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.499 
we had all right so that was a G chord
but<00:01:29.579> let's<00:01:30.479> say<00:01:31.079> G<00:01:31.290> minor<00:01:31.560> no<00:01:32.180> can't<00:01:33.180> play<00:01:33.390> it

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
but let's say G minor no can't play it

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.830 
but let's say G minor no can't play it
as<00:01:33.570> an<00:01:33.689> open<00:01:33.810> chord<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.750> moved<00:01:36.750> on

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
as an open chord really so we moved on

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.980 
as an open chord really so we moved on
the<00:01:36.930> E<00:01:36.960> string<00:01:37.079> G<00:01:37.799> right<00:01:38.009> there<00:01:38.360> war<00:01:39.360> minor<00:01:39.720> now

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the E string G right there war minor now

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.590 
the E string G right there war minor now
so<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.259> plug<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.590> an<00:01:40.710> E<00:01:40.950> minor<00:01:41.220> looking<00:01:41.850> shape<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
so I plug in an E minor looking shape to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.120 
so I plug in an E minor looking shape to
get<00:01:42.720> G<00:01:43.079> minor

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.209

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
gee on the a string a string a minor G

just a regular a7 chord
you<00:05:34.790> can<00:05:34.940> see<00:05:35.150> where<00:05:35.390> that<00:05:35.690> 12th<00:05:36.110> fret<00:05:36.490> is<00:05:37.490> the

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
you can see where that 12th fret is the

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.090 
you can see where that 12th fret is the
starting<00:05:38.150> over<00:05:38.450> point<00:05:38.690> and<00:05:38.990> now<00:05:39.290> our<00:05:39.650> fingers

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
starting over point and now our fingers

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.330 
starting over point and now our fingers
you<00:05:40.880> know<00:05:41.020> serving<00:05:42.020> as<00:05:42.140> that<00:05:42.410> nut<00:05:42.740> and<00:05:43.070> then<00:05:43.190> we

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
you know serving as that nut and then we

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:56.680 
you know serving as that nut and then we
plug<00:05:43.610> in<00:05:43.760> that<00:05:43.940> a7<00:05:44.570> shape<00:05:44.750> again<00:05:55.510> so<00:05:56.510> that's

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
plug in that a7 shape again so that's

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.430 
plug in that a7 shape again so that's
the<00:05:56.810> seven<00:05:57.080> core<00:05:57.230> so<00:05:57.470> then<00:05:57.680> you<00:05:58.460> start<00:05:58.910> putting

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
the seven core so then you start putting

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.980 
the seven core so then you start putting
together<00:06:02.500> different<00:06:04.120> you<00:06:05.120> know<00:06:05.240> combinations

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
together different you know combinations

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.750 
together different you know combinations
of<00:06:06.080> those<00:06:06.260> chords<00:06:06.680> you<00:06:06.800> know<00:06:06.890> take<00:06:07.130> programs<00:06:07.520> I

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
of those chords you know take programs I

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.080 
of those chords you know take programs I
said<00:06:08.030> it<00:06:08.120> before<00:06:08.180> me<00:06:08.450> take<00:06:08.690> progressions<00:06:09.230> that

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
said it before me take progressions that

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.420 
said it before me take progressions that
you<00:06:11.090> already<00:06:11.240> know<00:06:11.600> and<00:06:12.080> then<00:06:12.290> see<00:06:12.919> if<00:06:13.100> you<00:06:13.250> can

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
you already know and then see if you can

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.300 
you already know and then see if you can
change<00:06:13.760> the<00:06:14.600> voicings<00:06:15.140> of<00:06:15.500> them<00:06:15.919> I<00:06:15.950> think

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
change the voicings of them I think

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.810 
change the voicings of them I think
that's<00:06:16.520> you<00:06:17.450> know<00:06:17.600> really<00:06:17.900> valuable<00:06:18.290> so<00:06:18.950> let's

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
that's you know really valuable so let's

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.600 
that's you know really valuable so let's
say<00:06:20.030> a<00:06:20.380> minor<00:06:21.380> to<00:06:22.010> D<00:06:22.040> minor<00:06:22.580> to<00:06:22.990> G<00:06:23.990> a<00:06:24.620> minor<00:06:25.340> to<00:06:25.580> D

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
say a minor to D minor to G a minor to D

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.680 
say a minor to D minor to G a minor to D
minor<00:06:25.970> to<00:06:26.180> G<00:06:26.210> so<00:06:26.419> a<00:06:26.870> minor

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
minor to G so a minor

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.110 
minor to G so a minor
the<00:06:29.140> D<00:06:29.350> minor

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
the D minor

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.749 
the D minor
