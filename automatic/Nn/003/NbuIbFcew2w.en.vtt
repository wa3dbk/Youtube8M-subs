so<00:00:03.730> brachytherapy<00:00:04.090> is<00:00:04.660> another<00:00:04.930> way<00:00:05.109> of

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.140 
so brachytherapy is another way of

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.049 
so brachytherapy is another way of
delivering<00:00:05.649> radiotherapy<00:00:06.370> so<00:00:06.580> it's<00:00:06.819> a

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:07.059 
delivering radiotherapy so it's a

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:08.640 
delivering radiotherapy so it's a
brachytherapy<00:00:07.420> means<00:00:07.779> short<00:00:08.050> distance<00:00:08.470> so

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
brachytherapy means short distance so

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.710 
brachytherapy means short distance so
it's<00:00:08.800> radiation<00:00:09.130> provided<00:00:10.059> internally

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:10.720 
it's radiation provided internally

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.390 
it's radiation provided internally
there's<00:00:11.350> two<00:00:11.530> different<00:00:11.860> ways<00:00:11.950> that<00:00:11.980> we<00:00:12.280> do

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
there's two different ways that we do

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.620 
there's two different ways that we do
that<00:00:12.580> one<00:00:12.790> is<00:00:12.910> with<00:00:13.030> permanent<00:00:13.360> seed

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
that one is with permanent seed

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.690 
that one is with permanent seed
brachytherapy<00:00:14.110> here<00:00:14.500> it's<00:00:14.620> called<00:00:14.830> LDR<00:00:15.430> low

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
brachytherapy here it's called LDR low

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.550 
brachytherapy here it's called LDR low
dose<00:00:15.940> rate<00:00:16.240> those<00:00:16.720> are<00:00:16.869> little<00:00:17.050> seeds<00:00:17.289> that<00:00:17.410> go

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
dose rate those are little seeds that go

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.839 
dose rate those are little seeds that go
into<00:00:17.800> the<00:00:17.890> prostate<00:00:18.250> and<00:00:18.310> stay<00:00:18.580> in<00:00:18.640> there<00:00:18.760> the

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849 
into the prostate and stay in there the

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.660 
into the prostate and stay in there the
rest<00:00:18.970> of<00:00:19.150> your<00:00:19.240> life<00:00:19.800> HDR<00:00:20.800> brachytherapy<00:00:21.039> or

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
rest of your life HDR brachytherapy or

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.330 
rest of your life HDR brachytherapy or
temporary<00:00:22.300> brachytherapy<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:24.070> when

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
temporary brachytherapy is when

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.950 
temporary brachytherapy is when
catheters<00:00:24.850> are<00:00:24.970> inserted<00:00:25.420> inside<00:00:25.539> of<00:00:25.869> the

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
catheters are inserted inside of the

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.750 
catheters are inserted inside of the
prostate<00:00:26.380> a<00:00:26.440> literal<00:00:26.890> radioactive<00:00:27.460> seed

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
prostate a literal radioactive seed

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.490 
prostate a literal radioactive seed
which<00:00:28.000> is<00:00:28.029> a<00:00:28.180> hint<00:00:28.330> of<00:00:28.420> a<00:00:28.510> wire<00:00:28.690> and<00:00:28.840> a<00:00:28.930> robot<00:00:29.289> is

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
which is a hint of a wire and a robot is

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.870 
which is a hint of a wire and a robot is
put<00:00:29.710> in<00:00:29.800> in<00:00:29.920> different<00:00:30.279> areas<00:00:30.580> in<00:00:30.760> the

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
put in in different areas in the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.450 
put in in different areas in the
prostate<00:00:31.359> so<00:00:31.539> it's<00:00:31.930> actually<00:00:32.199> only<00:00:32.349> inside<00:00:33.039> of

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
prostate so it's actually only inside of

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.419 
prostate so it's actually only inside of
the<00:00:33.910> gland<00:00:34.210> for<00:00:34.629> about<00:00:34.899> 10<00:00:35.559> or<00:00:35.710> 15<00:00:36.039> minutes

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:36.429 
the gland for about 10 or 15 minutes

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:37.829 
the gland for about 10 or 15 minutes
provides<00:00:36.969> all<00:00:37.089> that<00:00:37.120> raishin<00:00:37.539> that's<00:00:37.690> your<00:00:37.809> a

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
provides all that raishin that's your a

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.270 
provides all that raishin that's your a
period<00:00:38.109> of<00:00:38.140> time<00:00:38.350> but<00:00:38.559> then<00:00:38.710> it<00:00:38.739> doesn't<00:00:39.100> stay

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
period of time but then it doesn't stay

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.410 
period of time but then it doesn't stay
inside<00:00:39.519> but<00:00:39.729> they're<00:00:39.879> both<00:00:39.999> ways<00:00:40.239> they're

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
inside but they're both ways they're

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.439 
inside but they're both ways they're
giving<00:00:40.659> internal<00:00:41.139> radiation<00:00:41.999> which<00:00:42.999> so<00:00:43.300> that

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
giving internal radiation which so that

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.569 
giving internal radiation which so that
will<00:00:43.719> decrease<00:00:44.139> the<00:00:44.559> risk<00:00:44.769> of<00:00:44.889> exposure<00:00:45.309> to

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
will decrease the risk of exposure to

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.889 
will decrease the risk of exposure to
the<00:00:45.670> rectum<00:00:45.999> again<00:00:46.300> which<00:00:46.389> is<00:00:46.510> behind<00:00:46.659> the

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
the rectum again which is behind the

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.209 
the rectum again which is behind the
prostate<00:00:47.319> in<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.530> bladder<00:00:47.769> which<00:00:47.949> is<00:00:48.100> in

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
prostate in the bladder which is in

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.090 
prostate in the bladder which is in
front<00:00:48.399> of<00:00:48.489> it<00:00:48.929> those<00:00:49.929> seeds<00:00:50.350> only<00:00:50.589> give

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
front of it those seeds only give

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.309 
front of it those seeds only give
radiation<00:00:51.370> around<00:00:51.879> the<00:00:52.120> seed<00:00:52.359> so<00:00:53.019> you<00:00:53.079> give<00:00:53.289> a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
radiation around the seed so you give a

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.020 
radiation around the seed so you give a
very<00:00:53.710> high<00:00:53.859> dose<00:00:54.249> of<00:00:54.399> radiation

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
very high dose of radiation

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.360 
very high dose of radiation
internally<00:00:55.690> but<00:00:56.109> very<00:00:56.440> little<00:00:56.709> gets<00:00:56.829> outside

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
internally but very little gets outside

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.329 
internally but very little gets outside
so<00:00:57.819> it's<00:00:57.940> great<00:00:58.120> for<00:00:58.329> those<00:00:58.389> cancers<00:00:58.870> that<00:00:58.899> are

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
so it's great for those cancers that are

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.439 
so it's great for those cancers that are
localized<00:01:00.339> to<00:01:00.549> the<00:01:00.639> gland<00:01:00.909> because<00:01:01.209> you<00:01:01.329> can

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
localized to the gland because you can

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:02.939 
localized to the gland because you can
get<00:01:01.569> a<00:01:01.600> lots<00:01:01.869> of<00:01:02.019> radiation<00:01:02.469> into<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.679> gland

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
get a lots of radiation into the gland

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.859 
get a lots of radiation into the gland
itself<00:01:03.100> very<00:01:03.819> little<00:01:04.089> else<00:01:04.210> word<00:01:04.449> so<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.690> side

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
itself very little else word so the side

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.110 
itself very little else word so the side
effects<00:01:05.140> are<00:01:05.290> less<00:01:05.580> whereas<00:01:06.580> external

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
effects are less whereas external

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.120 
effects are less whereas external
radiation<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.840> advantage<00:01:08.350> of<00:01:08.560> it<00:01:08.710> in<00:01:08.830> those

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
radiation the advantage of it in those

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.830 
radiation the advantage of it in those
cases<00:01:09.370> that<00:01:09.520> have<00:01:09.760> higher<00:01:10.030> grade<00:01:10.360> disease<00:01:10.660> or

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
cases that have higher grade disease or

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.180 
cases that have higher grade disease or
disease<00:01:11.080> you<00:01:11.200> think<00:01:11.410> is<00:01:11.500> maybe<00:01:11.680> outside<00:01:11.860> of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
disease you think is maybe outside of

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.520 
disease you think is maybe outside of
the<00:01:12.280> gland<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:12.760> bathes<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.630> entire<00:01:13.960> prostate

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
the gland it bathes the entire prostate

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.470 
the gland it bathes the entire prostate
with<00:01:14.680> radiation<00:01:15.130> but<00:01:15.310> also<00:01:15.490> gives<00:01:15.820> an<00:01:15.970> area<00:01:16.270> of

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
with radiation but also gives an area of

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.070 
with radiation but also gives an area of
a<00:01:17.070> rim<00:01:18.070> or<00:01:18.430> insurance<00:01:18.880> policy<00:01:19.360> around<00:01:19.810> the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
a rim or insurance policy around the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.260 
a rim or insurance policy around the
gland<00:01:20.320> that<00:01:20.650> gets<00:01:21.190> a<00:01:21.280> high<00:01:21.430> dose<00:01:21.640> just<00:01:21.970> in<00:01:22.120> case

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
gland that gets a high dose just in case

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.400 
gland that gets a high dose just in case
a<00:01:22.300> little<00:01:22.480> of<00:01:22.600> that<00:01:22.660> cancer<00:01:23.020> head<00:01:23.170> creeped

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
a little of that cancer head creeped

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.900 
a little of that cancer head creeped
outside<00:01:23.770> of<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:23.950> gland<00:01:24.100> itself<00:01:24.490> so

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
outside of the gland itself so

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.580 
outside of the gland itself so
brachytherapy<00:01:25.300> is<00:01:25.630> very<00:01:25.840> good<00:01:26.020> for<00:01:26.170> internal

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
brachytherapy is very good for internal

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.620 
brachytherapy is very good for internal
radiation<00:01:26.830> it<00:01:27.370> only<00:01:27.820> provides<00:01:28.150> radiation

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
radiation it only provides radiation

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.510 
radiation it only provides radiation
around<00:01:28.840> that<00:01:29.050> area<00:01:29.350> was<00:01:29.500> external<00:01:30.070> radiation

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
around that area was external radiation

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.800 
around that area was external radiation
because<00:01:30.940> of<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.150> fact<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:31.480> it's<00:01:31.660> going

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
because of the fact that it's going

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.630 
because of the fact that it's going
through<00:01:31.900> things<00:01:32.320> in<00:01:32.560> fact<00:01:33.040> we'll<00:01:33.220> give<00:01:33.370> a<00:01:33.400> rim

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
through things in fact we'll give a rim

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.980 
through things in fact we'll give a rim
of<00:01:33.790> radiation<00:01:34.180> around<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.510> prostate<00:01:34.780> and

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
of radiation around the prostate and

beam brachytherapy really is for men

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.490 
beam brachytherapy really is for men

that have disease that is you is very

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.410 
that have disease that is you is very
likely<00:01:47.830> to<00:01:48.100> be<00:01:48.220> just<00:01:48.460> localized<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.300> the

likely to be just localized to the
prostate<00:01:49.810> gland<00:01:49.870> itself<00:01:50.260> so<00:01:51.040> in<00:01:51.340> in<00:01:52.090> a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
clinical sense it's men that have either

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
low risk prostate cancer so low grade

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
men with intermediate grade cancers that

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.630 
men with intermediate grade cancers that
you<00:02:02.050> think<00:02:02.350> that<00:02:02.560> mostly<00:02:03.010> this<00:02:03.250> is<00:02:03.400> in<00:02:03.550> the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
you think that mostly this is in the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.390 
you think that mostly this is in the
gland<00:02:04.050> that's<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.229> big<00:02:05.440> gray<00:02:05.740> zone<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:06.280> that's

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
gland that's a big gray zone and that's

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.830 
gland that's a big gray zone and that's
why<00:02:06.580> kind<00:02:06.880> of<00:02:06.940> discussing<00:02:07.300> things<00:02:07.540> with<00:02:07.720> the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
why kind of discussing things with the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.089 
why kind of discussing things with the
ratio<00:02:08.080> in<00:02:08.140> college<00:02:08.379> is<00:02:08.500> important<00:02:08.950> because

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
ratio in college is important because

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.589 
ratio in college is important because
for<00:02:09.399> some<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.789> even<00:02:09.970> in<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.209> intermediate

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
for some and even in that intermediate

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.720 
for some and even in that intermediate
risk<00:02:11.109> they're<00:02:11.739> probably<00:02:12.010> better<00:02:12.249> off<00:02:12.340> served

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730

essence is for people that you really

essence is for people that you really
think<00:02:23.530> have<00:02:23.680> localized<00:02:24.280> disease<00:02:24.490> so<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.090> tends

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
think have localized disease so it tends

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.790 
think have localized disease so it tends
to<00:02:25.330> be<00:02:25.420> men<00:02:25.600> with<00:02:25.720> lower<00:02:26.020> grade<00:02:26.290> tumors<00:02:26.650> with

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
having disease outside the prostate so

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.460

an<00:04:41.520> ultrasound<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.150> guide<00:04:42.330> we<00:04:42.990> do<00:04:43.140> planning

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
an ultrasound to guide we do planning

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.130 
an ultrasound to guide we do planning
right<00:04:44.010> there<00:04:44.250> so<00:04:44.520> scans<00:04:45.480> are<00:04:45.660> done<00:04:45.870> to

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
right there so scans are done to

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.410 
right there so scans are done to
determine<00:04:46.290> where<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.890> seed<00:04:47.100> should<00:04:47.340> be<00:04:47.550> we

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
determine where the seed should be we

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.090 
determine where the seed should be we
have<00:04:48.510> computing<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.080> be<00:04:49.170> able<00:04:49.290> to<00:04:49.440> get<00:04:49.890> us<00:04:49.980> a

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
have computing to be able to get us a

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.830 
have computing to be able to get us a
plan<00:04:50.310> very<00:04:50.490> quickly<00:04:50.790> and<00:04:51.090> then<00:04:51.420> that<00:04:51.540> seed<00:04:51.810> has

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
plan very quickly and then that seed has

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.250 
plan very quickly and then that seed has
little<00:04:52.410> stations<00:04:52.950> along<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.430> area<00:04:54.150> that<00:04:55.020> that

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
little stations along the area that that

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.110 
little stations along the area that that
like<00:04:55.740> dwell<00:04:56.040> time<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.520> it'll<00:04:56.610> stay<00:04:56.910> in<00:04:57.030> a

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
like dwell time so it'll stay in a

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.220 
like dwell time so it'll stay in a
certain<00:04:57.360> area<00:04:57.450> for<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.750> certain<00:04:57.990> amount<00:04:58.080> of

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
times to ensure that the prostate gets a

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.060 
times to ensure that the prostate gets a
uniform<00:05:00.480> dose<00:05:00.750> roughly<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.680> same<00:05:01.800> dose

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
uniform dose roughly the same dose

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.800 
uniform dose roughly the same dose
entire<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.460> whole<00:05:02.580> clan<00:05:02.850> with<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.390> little<00:05:03.720> bit

of sparing of some of the areas that you

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.170 
of sparing of some of the areas that you
want<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.430> make<00:05:05.550> sure<00:05:05.670> that<00:05:05.790> you<00:05:05.940> don't<00:05:06.090> have

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
want to make sure that you don't have

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.030 
want to make sure that you don't have
side<00:05:06.420> effects<00:05:06.750> so<00:05:07.290> men<00:05:07.500> are<00:05:07.590> usually<00:05:07.830> sleep

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
side effects so men are usually sleep

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.090 
side effects so men are usually sleep
for<00:05:08.160> about<00:05:08.310> an<00:05:08.430> hour<00:05:08.720> they<00:05:09.720> wake<00:05:09.900> up<00:05:09.980> they<00:05:10.980> go

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
for about an hour they wake up they go

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.890 
for about an hour they wake up they go
off<00:05:11.280> into<00:05:11.460> our<00:05:11.730> recovery<00:05:12.450> room<00:05:12.630> make<00:05:12.870> sure

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
off into our recovery room make sure

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.960 
off into our recovery room make sure
that<00:05:13.140> they<00:05:13.290> can<00:05:13.500> pee<00:05:13.740> then<00:05:14.190> they<00:05:14.370> go<00:05:14.490> home<00:05:14.670> so

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
that they can pee then they go home so

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.510 
that they can pee then they go home so
it's<00:05:15.120> really<00:05:15.390> a<00:05:15.480> half-day<00:05:15.990> procedure<00:05:16.520> very

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
it's really a half-day procedure very

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.450 
it's really a half-day procedure very
similar<00:05:17.910> to<00:05:18.060> our<00:05:18.180> LDR<00:05:19.460> permanency

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
similar to our LDR permanency

similar to our LDR permanency
brachytherapy<00:05:20.880> again<00:05:21.390> those<00:05:21.540> men<00:05:21.690> are<00:05:21.780> put<00:05:21.960> to

brachytherapy again those men are put to

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.370 
brachytherapy again those men are put to
sleep

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
sleep

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.050 
sleep
although<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.160> week<00:05:23.280> before<00:05:23.640> they've<00:05:23.820> had<00:05:24.030> a

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
although the week before they've had a

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.760 
although the week before they've had a
scan<00:05:24.510> done<00:05:24.750> so<00:05:24.930> that<00:05:25.050> we<00:05:25.140> know<00:05:25.350> where<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.620> put

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
scan done so that we know where to put

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.890 
scan done so that we know where to put
the<00:05:25.950> seeds<00:05:26.220> we<00:05:27.030> order<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.360> seeds<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:27.780> they're

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
the seeds we order the seeds and they're

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.030 
the seeds we order the seeds and they're
kind<00:05:28.170> of<00:05:28.200> made<00:05:28.380> in<00:05:28.500> a<00:05:28.560> certain<00:05:28.680> configuration

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
kind of made in a certain configuration

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.040 
kind of made in a certain configuration
and<00:05:29.760> then<00:05:29.850> the<00:05:29.940> seeds<00:05:30.150> are<00:05:30.300> inserted<00:05:30.780> so<00:05:30.930> it's

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
and then the seeds are inserted so it's

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.140 
and then the seeds are inserted so it's
roughly<00:05:31.260> the<00:05:31.500> same<00:05:31.650> procedure<00:05:32.160> one<00:05:32.820> is<00:05:32.970> just

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
roughly the same procedure one is just

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.550 
roughly the same procedure one is just
the<00:05:33.270> seeds<00:05:33.510> stay<00:05:33.750> permanently<00:05:34.230> in<00:05:34.290> them<00:05:34.410> for

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
the seeds stay permanently in them for

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.020 
the seeds stay permanently in them for
the<00:05:34.620> rest<00:05:34.770> of<00:05:34.860> their<00:05:35.010> life<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.730> other<00:05:35.880> one

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
the rest of their life the other one

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.940 
the rest of their life the other one
with<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.360> HDR<00:05:36.690> is<00:05:36.960> that<00:05:37.140> is<00:05:37.290> that<00:05:37.500> is<00:05:37.650> in<00:05:37.830> just

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
with the HDR is that is that is in just

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.800 
with the HDR is that is that is in just
a<00:05:38.100> temporary<00:05:38.400> that<00:05:38.670> seed<00:05:38.940> is<00:05:39.120> inserted<00:05:39.690> just

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
a temporary that seed is inserted just

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.210 
a temporary that seed is inserted just
for<00:05:40.020> that<00:05:40.110> small<00:05:40.350> period<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.710> time<00:05:40.890> and<00:05:41.130> then

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
for that small period of time and then

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.860 
for that small period of time and then
they<00:05:41.490> walk<00:05:41.700> on<00:05:41.880> with<00:05:42.030> nothing<00:05:42.330> inside<00:05:42.630> of<00:05:42.780> them

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
they walk on with nothing inside of them

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.900 
they walk on with nothing inside of them
so<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:43.919> most<00:05:44.010> common<00:05:44.430> side<00:05:44.580> effects<00:05:44.820> of

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
so the most common side effects of

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.360 
so the most common side effects of
brachytherapy<00:05:45.300> are<00:05:45.990> because<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.890> prostate

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
brachytherapy are because the prostate

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.070 
brachytherapy are because the prostate
does<00:05:47.580> swell<00:05:47.910> up<00:05:48.120> a<00:05:48.330> little<00:05:48.570> bit<00:05:48.720> built<00:05:48.930> because

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
does swell up a little bit built because

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.630 
does swell up a little bit built because
there's<00:05:49.350> been<00:05:49.470> lots<00:05:49.650> of<00:05:49.800> needles<00:05:50.040> put<00:05:50.340> into<00:05:50.550> it

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
there's been lots of needles put into it

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.670 
there's been lots of needles put into it
but<00:05:50.669> also<00:05:50.850> because<00:05:51.030> the<00:05:51.240> radiation<00:05:51.480> is<00:05:51.810> active

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
but also because the radiation is active

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.900 
but also because the radiation is active
and<00:05:52.860> it's<00:05:52.950> actually<00:05:53.280> causing<00:05:53.669> a<00:05:53.730> bit<00:05:53.880> of

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
and it's actually causing a bit of

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.180 
and it's actually causing a bit of
inflammation<00:05:54.300> his<00:05:55.050> men<00:05:55.290> will<00:05:55.470> have<00:05:55.890> a<00:05:55.919> feeling

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
inflammation his men will have a feeling

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.370 
inflammation his men will have a feeling
of<00:05:56.600> having<00:05:57.600> this<00:05:57.660> down<00:05:57.870> there<00:05:58.050> we<00:05:58.140> call<00:05:58.290> that

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
of having this down there we call that

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.690 
of having this down there we call that
prostatitis<00:05:58.980> so<00:05:59.220> they<00:05:59.310> can<00:05:59.460> feel<00:05:59.610> like

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
prostatitis so they can feel like

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.730 
prostatitis so they can feel like
someone<00:05:59.970> kicked<00:06:00.120> them<00:06:00.270> in<00:06:00.360> the<00:06:00.450> crotch<00:06:00.680> for<00:06:01.680> a

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
someone kicked them in the crotch for a

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.280 
someone kicked them in the crotch for a
few<00:06:02.070> weeks<00:06:02.280> and<00:06:02.610> a<00:06:02.940> few<00:06:03.210> months<00:06:03.600> not<00:06:03.750> painful

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
few weeks and a few months not painful

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.860 
few weeks and a few months not painful
but<00:06:04.620> they<00:06:04.740> can<00:06:04.980> feel<00:06:05.220> it<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:06.270> men<00:06:06.450> well<00:06:06.600> some

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
but they can feel it the men well some

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.630 
but they can feel it the men well some
men<00:06:06.990> will<00:06:07.110> also<00:06:07.350> slow<00:06:07.560> down<00:06:07.710> their<00:06:07.860> water<00:06:08.070> need

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
men will also slow down their water need

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.159 
men will also slow down their water need
to<00:06:08.730> take<00:06:08.880> medications<00:06:09.480> to<00:06:09.600> do<00:06:09.720> that<00:06:09.930> and

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
to take medications to do that and

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.750 
to take medications to do that and
there's<00:06:10.890> that<00:06:10.980> very<00:06:11.190> small<00:06:11.430> risk<00:06:11.669> that

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
there's that very small risk that

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.159 
there's that very small risk that
they'll<00:06:11.910> obstruct<00:06:12.450> their<00:06:12.600> urine<00:06:12.900> to<00:06:12.960> need<00:06:13.110> to

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
they'll obstruct their urine to need to

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:14.690 
they'll obstruct their urine to need to
have<00:06:13.260> a<00:06:13.320> catheter<00:06:13.620> put<00:06:14.040> in<00:06:14.160> that's<00:06:14.580> probably

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
have a catheter put in that's probably

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.980 
have a catheter put in that's probably
the<00:06:15.030> important<00:06:15.450> reason<00:06:15.690> why<00:06:15.780> we<00:06:15.960> really

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
the important reason why we really

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.110 
the important reason why we really
screen<00:06:16.800> men<00:06:17.010> to<00:06:17.160> see<00:06:17.310> who<00:06:17.490> are<00:06:17.640> good

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
screen men to see who are good

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.670 
screen men to see who are good
candidates<00:06:18.480> are<00:06:18.630> not<00:06:18.960> good<00:06:19.140> cancer<00:06:19.470> for<00:06:19.560> that

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
candidates are not good cancer for that

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.800 
candidates are not good cancer for that
procedure<00:06:20.000> because<00:06:21.000> having<00:06:21.180> catheter<00:06:21.570> put<00:06:21.720> in

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
procedure because having catheter put in

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.060 
procedure because having catheter put in
for<00:06:21.930> several<00:06:22.169> months<00:06:22.230> those<00:06:22.740> guys<00:06:22.890> aren't

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
for several months those guys aren't

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.100 
for several months those guys aren't
happy<00:06:23.280> so<00:06:23.850> if<00:06:23.970> we<00:06:24.120> can<00:06:24.330> predict<00:06:24.750> those<00:06:24.900> men

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
happy so if we can predict those men

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.450 
happy so if we can predict those men
beforehand<00:06:25.620> are<00:06:25.680> gonna<00:06:25.770> have<00:06:25.950> the<00:06:26.040> problem<00:06:26.370> we

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
beforehand are gonna have the problem we

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.860 
beforehand are gonna have the problem we
usually<00:06:26.669> don't<00:06:26.760> offer<00:06:27.030> them<00:06:27.330> to<00:06:27.510> have<00:06:27.690> the

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
usually don't offer them to have the

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.360 
usually don't offer them to have the
brachytherapy<00:06:28.230> or<00:06:28.620> we<00:06:28.830> use<00:06:28.980> different

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
brachytherapy or we use different

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.370 
brachytherapy or we use different
hormonal<00:06:30.090> manipulations<00:06:30.780> to<00:06:30.870> shrink<00:06:31.200> their

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
hormonal manipulations to shrink their

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.129 
hormonal manipulations to shrink their
gland<00:06:31.620> down

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
gland down

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.969 
gland down
for<00:06:32.349> the<00:06:32.530> the<00:06:32.710> brachytherapy<00:06:33.280> is<00:06:33.639> done
