but it's gonna it's like doing an
opposite<00:00:34.200> outline<00:00:34.559> since<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> nails<00:00:35.190> already

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
opposite outline since the nails already

opposite outline since the nails already
black<00:00:35.670> we're<00:00:35.850> not<00:00:35.940> gonna<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.149> black<00:00:36.329> outline

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
black we're not gonna do black outline

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.569 
black we're not gonna do black outline
we're<00:00:36.840> gonna<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.110> gold<00:00:37.290> one<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.070> then<00:00:38.190> fill<00:00:38.430> in

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
we're gonna do gold one so then fill in

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.200 
we're gonna do gold one so then fill in
the<00:00:38.610> tip<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:39.090> black<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.879> wanted

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the tip with black and if you wanted

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.520 
the tip with black and if you wanted
instead<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.600> having<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.930> fill<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> tip

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
instead of having to fill in the tip

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.990 
instead of having to fill in the tip
with<00:00:43.649> black<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.129> could<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.700> applied

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
with black you could have just applied

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.400 
with black you could have just applied
the<00:00:45.030> glitter<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> top<00:00:45.840> portion<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.320> your

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the glitter on the top portion of your

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.380 
the glitter on the top portion of your
nail<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> decided<00:00:47.760> since<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.090> wanted<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
nail but I decided since I wanted the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.850 
nail but I decided since I wanted the
glitter<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> go<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:49.020> around<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.739> hard

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
glitter to go all around and it's hard

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.080 
glitter to go all around and it's hard
to<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.160> those<00:00:50.219> little<00:00:50.460> corners<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.910> might

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
to get in those little corners I might

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.029 
to get in those little corners I might
as<00:00:51.149> well<00:00:51.239> do<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.629> way<00:00:51.809> plus<00:00:52.469> then<00:00:52.800> it'll

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
as well do it this way plus then it'll

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.920 
as well do it this way plus then it'll
be<00:00:53.129> easier<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.430> paint<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.910> numbers<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.449> top<00:00:54.480> of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
be easier to paint the numbers on top of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.450 
be easier to paint the numbers on top of
the<00:00:55.050> black<00:00:55.260> acrylic<00:00:55.620> instead<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> black

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the black acrylic instead of the black

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.060 
the black acrylic instead of the black
polish<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.690> then<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:58.140> I'm<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.710> mentioned

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
polish so then as I'm just mentioned

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.680 
polish so then as I'm just mentioned
we're<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.370> painting<00:00:59.789> our<00:01:00.059> numbers

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
we're going to be painting our numbers

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.849 
we're going to be painting our numbers
on<00:01:00.870> our<00:01:01.020> clock<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.800> be

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
on our clock and I'm going to be

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.020 
on our clock and I'm going to be
painting<00:01:02.100> Roman<00:01:02.520> numerals

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
painting Roman numerals

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539 
painting Roman numerals
and<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:03.840> because<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.470> kind<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.830> add<00:01:05.040> I

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and not just because they kind of add I

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.090 
and not just because they kind of add I
think<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:06.090> look<00:01:06.240> more<00:01:06.420> elegant<00:01:07.110> more<00:01:07.710> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
think they look more elegant more I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100 
think they look more elegant more I
don't<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:09.299> they<00:01:09.420> also<00:01:09.600> are<00:01:09.810> gonna<00:01:09.990> be

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
don't know but they also are gonna be

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.690 
don't know but they also are gonna be
easier<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.560> paint<00:01:10.799> since<00:01:11.130> they're<00:01:11.310> all<00:01:11.430> just

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
easier to paint since they're all just

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.609 
easier to paint since they're all just
little<00:01:11.909> lines<00:01:12.240> instead<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.200> having<00:01:13.380> any

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
little lines instead of having any

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.100 
little lines instead of having any
curves<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.850> two<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.630> twelve<00:01:15.900> or

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
curves like on the two of the twelve or

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.840 
curves like on the two of the twelve or
you<00:01:16.830> know<00:01:16.950> they're<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.159> gonna<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.549> straight

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
you know they're just gonna be straight

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.219 
you know they're just gonna be straight
lines<00:01:18.030> instead<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.420> any<00:01:18.540> curves<00:01:18.780> anything

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
lines instead of any curves anything

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.870 
lines instead of any curves anything
funny<00:01:19.439> he's<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> little<00:01:20.549> easier<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.850> paint

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.510

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
the weird coloring in my video it's a

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.330 
the weird coloring in my video it's a
new<00:01:57.050> camera<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.530> I'm<00:01:57.860> kind<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.130> still

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
new camera and I'm kind of still

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.930 
new camera and I'm kind of still
figuring<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:58.850> out<00:01:58.909> so<00:01:59.300> bear<00:02:00.050> with<00:02:00.080> me<00:02:00.289> I<00:02:00.500> guess

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
and so then on the middle nail we're

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.690 
and so then on the middle nail we're
going<00:02:05.300> to<00:02:05.390> be<00:02:05.450> painting<00:02:05.869> 2015<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.100> I'm<00:02:07.460> going

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
to start with number one I'm going to do

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.830 
to start with number one I'm going to do
that<00:02:09.979> just<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.369> little<00:02:10.580> bit<00:02:10.820> below<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.420> center

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
that just a little bit below the center

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.600 
that just a little bit below the center
of<00:02:11.959> my<00:02:12.080> nail<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.470> then<00:02:12.950> paint<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.400> five

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
of my nail and then paint the five

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.040 
of my nail and then paint the five
underneath<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:16.030> then<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.239> zero<00:02:17.630> above<00:02:17.930> it

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
underneath it and then a zero above it

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.050 
underneath it and then a zero above it
and<00:02:18.230> last<00:02:18.920> but<00:02:19.100> not<00:02:19.220> least<00:02:19.430> I'm<00:02:19.610> going<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.880> add

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
and last but not least I'm going to add

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.569 

and<00:02:36.780> I'm<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.170> add<00:02:37.379> a<00:02:37.409> line<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.219> either

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
and I'm going to add a line on either

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:52.030 
and I'm going to add a line on either
side<00:02:38.969> of<00:02:38.999> the<00:02:39.450> 2015

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.890 

and<00:02:52.129> now<00:02:52.760> I'm<00:02:52.879> gonna<00:02:53.060> be<00:02:53.180> adding<00:02:53.480> just<00:02:53.720> like<00:02:53.870> a

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
and now I'm gonna be adding just like a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.619 
and now I'm gonna be adding just like a
little<00:02:54.260> loop<00:02:54.799> almost<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.030> like<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.269> really

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
little loop almost this is like a really

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.119 
little loop almost this is like a really
simple<00:02:56.989> little<00:02:57.110> lace<00:02:57.409> pattern<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.010> have

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
simple little lace pattern so I have

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.520 
simple little lace pattern so I have
loops<00:03:01.370> at<00:03:01.610> both<00:03:01.790> sides<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.599> mine<00:03:03.500> just

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
loops at both sides and mine just

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.460 
loops at both sides and mine just
happens<00:03:04.129> to<00:03:04.189> fit<00:03:04.430> for<00:03:04.760> if<00:03:05.750> your<00:03:05.930> nails<00:03:06.079> longer

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
happens to fit for if your nails longer

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.500 
happens to fit for if your nails longer
obviously<00:03:06.980> paint<00:03:07.549> more<00:03:07.730> if<00:03:07.970> it's<00:03:08.120> shorter

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
obviously paint more if it's shorter

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.630 
obviously paint more if it's shorter
well<00:03:08.720> paint<00:03:08.989> less<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:12.069> then<00:03:13.069> I'm<00:03:13.280> gonna<00:03:13.400> add<00:03:13.610> a

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
well paint less and then I'm gonna add a

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.690 
well paint less and then I'm gonna add a
little<00:03:13.760> dot<00:03:14.150> in<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.450> center<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:14.720> each<00:03:14.900> loop<00:03:18.700> on

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
little dot in the center of each loop on

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.280 
little dot in the center of each loop on
your<00:03:20.030> pinky<00:03:20.390> now<00:03:20.510> I'm<00:03:20.629> going<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.840> be<00:03:20.900> painting

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
your pinky now I'm going to be painting

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.069 
your pinky now I'm going to be painting
a<00:03:21.439> black<00:03:21.739> half<00:03:22.040> moon<00:03:22.340> at<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.849> cuticle<00:03:23.689> of<00:03:23.840> my

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
a black half moon at the cuticle of my

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:33.220 
a black half moon at the cuticle of my
nail<00:03:29.379> and<00:03:30.670> then<00:03:31.670> similar<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.450> middle<00:03:33.079> nail

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
nail and then similar to the middle nail

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.360 
nail and then similar to the middle nail
I'm<00:03:33.379> just<00:03:33.530> gonna<00:03:33.620> be<00:03:33.739> adding<00:03:33.950> those<00:03:34.040> little

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
I'm just gonna be adding those little

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.470 
I'm just gonna be adding those little
loops<00:03:36.099> but<00:03:37.099> instead<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.400> pointing<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:38.030> dot<00:03:38.209> in

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
loops but instead of pointing the dot in

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.759 
loops but instead of pointing the dot in
the<00:03:38.629> middle<00:03:38.840> I'm<00:03:39.019> gonna<00:03:39.200> put<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:39.409> dot<00:03:39.560> on<00:03:39.590> the

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
the middle I'm gonna put the dot on the

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.410 
the middle I'm gonna put the dot on the
outside<00:03:40.129> of<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.340> loops<00:03:40.519> in<00:03:40.700> between<00:03:41.060> each<00:03:41.209> one

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
outside of the loops in between each one

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.289 
outside of the loops in between each one
and<00:03:41.690> then<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.889> course<00:03:42.920> add<00:03:43.430> a<00:03:43.459> layer<00:03:43.879> of<00:03:44.120> top

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
and then of course add a layer of top

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:56.480 
and then of course add a layer of top
coat
