00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.890 

I<00:01:26.820> could<00:01:27.820> believe<00:01:28.060> that<00:01:28.120> with<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.570> number<00:01:28.810> of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
I could believe that with the number of

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.270 
I could believe that with the number of
cars<00:01:29.110> that<00:01:29.200> we've<00:01:29.410> seen<00:01:29.650> stuck<00:01:30.010> on<00:01:30.190> the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
cars that we've seen stuck on the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.830 
cars that we've seen stuck on the
highway<00:01:30.430> that<00:01:30.670> if<00:01:31.180> you<00:01:31.300> don't<00:01:31.450> have<00:01:31.600> minor

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
highway that if you don't have minor

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.720 
highway that if you don't have minor
accidents<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.680> there's<00:01:33.130> no<00:01:33.280> way<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.490> get<00:01:33.700> off

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
accidents and there's no way to get off

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.090 
accidents and there's no way to get off
the<00:01:34.030> highway<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.570> can<00:01:35.380> see<00:01:35.530> how<00:01:35.650> that<00:01:35.860> would<00:01:35.950> be

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
the highway I can see how that would be

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.560 
the highway I can see how that would be
easily<00:01:36.310> done<00:01:36.610> with<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.970> weather<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.360> way<00:01:37.390> it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
easily done with the weather the way it

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.910 
easily done with the weather the way it
is<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.960> roads<00:01:38.140> would<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.440> way<00:01:38.560> they<00:01:38.740> are

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
is the roads would the way they are

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.800 
is the roads would the way they are
there<00:01:39.130> people<00:01:39.310> just<00:01:39.430> get<00:01:39.729> out<00:01:39.850> there<00:01:40.060> then<00:01:40.780> I

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
there people just get out there then I

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.420 
there people just get out there then I
snuck<00:01:41.320> up<00:01:41.530> on<00:01:41.680> over<00:01:41.890> there<00:01:42.010> even<00:01:42.310> though

they've<00:01:42.580> been<00:01:42.610> hearing<00:01:42.940> about<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.270> for<00:01:43.300> a

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
they've been hearing about it for a

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.390 
they've been hearing about it for a
while<00:01:43.510> they<00:01:43.750> kind<00:01:43.960> of<00:01:44.110> got<00:01:44.229> stuck<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.770> then

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400

we're<00:02:11.980> doing<00:02:12.189> pretty<00:02:12.219> good<00:02:12.489> I<00:02:12.549> think<00:02:12.849> we've

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969 
we're doing pretty good I think we've

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.759 
we're doing pretty good I think we've
probably<00:02:13.150> got<00:02:13.359> another<00:02:13.569> 30<00:02:13.870> 45<00:02:14.379> minutes

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
probably got another 30 45 minutes

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.170 
probably got another 30 45 minutes
before<00:02:14.920> we're<00:02:15.159> gonna<00:02:15.249> have<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.609> stop<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.120> to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
before we're gonna have to stop and to
