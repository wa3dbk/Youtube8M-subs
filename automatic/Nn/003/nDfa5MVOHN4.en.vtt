the size of your fist right it's a snowy
hill<00:01:55.829> snow<00:01:56.759> ball<00:01:56.939> starts<00:01:57.210> rolling<00:01:57.450> down<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
hill snow ball starts rolling down the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.660 
hill snow ball starts rolling down the
hill<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.380> obviously<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> continues<00:01:59.640> down

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
hill and obviously as it continues down

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.179 
hill and obviously as it continues down
the<00:01:59.909> whole<00:02:00.060> Hill<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.630> picks<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:01.860> of

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
