to vamps which are all on what we call

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.639 
to vamps which are all on what we call
that's<00:00:42.420> them<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.020> see<00:00:43.140> at<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.290> top<00:00:43.440> there

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
there's like a fluctuating current bro

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.319 
there's like a fluctuating current bro
every<00:00:46.890> amp<00:00:47.039> before<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.399> even<00:00:47.520> gets<00:00:47.700> put<00:00:47.940> into<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
every amp before it even gets put into a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.119 
every amp before it even gets put into a
natural<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.890> chassis<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.340> actually<00:00:50.760> tested

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
natural the chassis is actually tested

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.959 
natural the chassis is actually tested
flipped<00:00:53.129> rate<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.460> current<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.850> through

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
flipped rate and current going through

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.869 
flipped rate and current going through
it<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.420> every<00:00:54.629> kind<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.219> frequency<00:00:56.219> possible

it so every kind of frequency possible

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.610 
it so every kind of frequency possible
to<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.090> through<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> test<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> bowels<00:00:58.050> test

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
to go through it to test the bowels test

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.830 
to go through it to test the bowels test
all<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> components<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.370> ran<00:00:59.840> constantly

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
all the components is ran constantly

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.660 
all the components is ran constantly
before<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.320> easy<00:01:01.500> how<00:01:01.920> about<00:01:02.100> wall<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.460> wind

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
before it's easy how about wall of wind

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.700 
before it's easy how about wall of wind
before<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.329> even<00:01:03.780> actually<00:01:04.379> put<00:01:04.559> together

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
before it's even actually put together

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.830 
before it's even actually put together
so<00:01:05.159> they're<00:01:05.280> all<00:01:05.369> tested<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> max<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
so they're all tested to the max you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.260 
so they're all tested to the max you
know<00:01:07.010> bulletproof<00:01:08.010> testing<00:01:08.460> that's

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
know bulletproof testing that's

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.520 
know bulletproof testing that's
interesting<00:01:09.750> obviously<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.439> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
interesting obviously here that is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.120 
interesting obviously here that is

hampers<00:01:34.280> come<00:01:35.280> you're<00:01:35.460> going<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.640> go<00:01:35.850> three

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
hampers come you're going to go three

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.520 
hampers come you're going to go three
three<00:01:36.710> wide<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.310> morning<00:01:42.409> check<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
three wide up this one morning check it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.440 
three wide up this one morning check it
out<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.159> where<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> gear<00:01:45.149> goes

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
out this is where all of the gear goes

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.199 
out this is where all of the gear goes
down<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.319> being<00:01:46.469> wired<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> 50<00:01:49.619> L

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.209 
down so it's being wired so it's a 50 L

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:57.630 
down so it's being wired so it's a 50 L
so<00:01:51.209> this<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.450> where<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> sweet<00:01:51.899> tone<00:01:52.110> starts

there's a guy who tests all beams look

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.750 
there's a guy who tests all beams look
it's<00:03:37.890> still<00:03:38.070> in<00:03:38.160> jail<00:03:38.340> more<00:03:38.670> check<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.120> out

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
it's still in jail more check this out

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:49.190 
it's still in jail more check this out
so<00:03:41.760> we<00:03:42.330> can<00:03:42.450> see<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:43.490> check<00:03:44.490> it<00:03:44.640> out<00:03:48.200> tone

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
so we can see that check it out tone
