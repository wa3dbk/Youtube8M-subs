to do an exam they then get undressed

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.980 
to do an exam they then get undressed
and then<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.549> come<00:01:17.759> back<00:01:17.820> yet<00:01:18.150> think<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:18.900> many

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and then I come back yet think for many

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.289 
and then I come back yet think for many
women<00:01:19.290> approachability<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.580> very<00:01:20.790> important

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
women approachability is very important

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.429 
women approachability is very important
in<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.509> physician<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.290> something

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
in a physician and that's not something

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.310 
in a physician and that's not something
that<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:22.860> necessarily<00:01:23.869> find<00:01:24.869> through

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that you can necessarily find through

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.289 
that you can necessarily find through
looking<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:25.920> their<00:01:26.220> degrees<00:01:26.729> where<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.150> went

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
looking at their degrees where they went

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.819 
looking at their degrees where they went
to<00:01:27.390> school<00:01:27.450> those<00:01:27.900> sorts<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.200> things<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.590> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
to school those sorts of things but I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.780 
to school those sorts of things but I
think<00:01:29.250> also<00:01:29.430> by<00:01:30.329> keeping<00:01:30.810> them<00:01:31.170> closed

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
think also by keeping them closed

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.770 
think also by keeping them closed
individual<00:01:32.790> women<00:01:32.909> clothes<00:01:33.360> while<00:01:33.630> we're

individual women clothes while we're

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.450 
individual women clothes while we're
talking<00:01:33.960> makes<00:01:34.740> me<00:01:34.890> much<00:01:35.040> more<00:01:35.070> approachable

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
