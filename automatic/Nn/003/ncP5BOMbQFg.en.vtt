00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
there we go now we're starting to build

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
there we go now we're starting to build
this<00:01:19.020> foundation<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.860> see<00:01:20.040> some<00:01:20.250> patterns

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
this foundation we see some patterns

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.179 
this foundation we see some patterns
developing<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:22.380> starting<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> open<00:01:22.950> up

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
developing and it's starting to open up

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.289 
developing and it's starting to open up
a<00:01:23.310> little<00:01:23.549> bit<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.820> we're<00:01:23.970> starting<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.210> see

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
a little bit and we're starting to see

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.780 
a little bit and we're starting to see
some<00:01:24.390> hope<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.040> move<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.340> down<00:01:26.580> over

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
some hope you can move this down over

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.609 
some hope you can move this down over
there<00:01:27.000> if<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.180> feel<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.750> want<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
there if you feel like you want to it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.710 
there if you feel like you want to it
doesn't<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.100> matter<00:01:29.369> though<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.509> you

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
doesn't really matter though but as you

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.240 
doesn't really matter though but as you
look<00:01:30.900> through<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.140> board<00:01:31.380> obviously<00:01:31.710> there's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
look through the board obviously there's

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.460 
look through the board obviously there's
