00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.820
 Nagasaki prefectures do at the venue but for consumers 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.569
 One point lesson 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.569
 The matter of judgment is a promise 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.249
 8 o'clock to review the basics 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.759
 I went around 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.309
 Let's review the basics This time will be before 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.270
 Last week was a good throw 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.510
 You understand 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.690
 We had established this 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.250
 The distribution behavior is called from the old days. 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.710
 There is not much sound 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.969
 This sounds 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.410
 It's already been done over a big wall 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.900
 I think so 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.650
 In the same way with Edohori 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.670
 Same hc4 lost 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.980
 It is quite difficult from the state 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.900
 More than a sound 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.790
 I have focused on explaining that I understand 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.120
 For example, after being conquered by running with that rude form station, this action 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.780
 I will say that 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.090
 So it never happens to it 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.590
 Even if you say putt out together 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.200
 In practice 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.110
 First of all it is to understand which 12 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.510
 For example, on the contrary 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.630
 Which form 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.380
 First of all understand what it means 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.890
 I think if you can 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.300
 Those 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.960
 When put together 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.790
 Generally you can play lead guitar or 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.280
 Arrange yourself or what was arranged 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.150
 When you try to study well 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.560
 Very understanding 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.740
 Useful and useful 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.000
 It also leads to a sense of speed 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 If you understand them, look at other methods 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.230
 Even looking at the face 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.190
 I tried to practice with Tosa's arrangement 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.669
 Very often completed or understood that day 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.019
 I'm getting faster 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.479
 For example, depending on the long-side station 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.230
 Each cup action and answer 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.939
 I can not catch up with me if I can not move Nico 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.639
 It's just like positioning, speaking in reverse 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.429
 If you try to process it 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:29.029
 Music has 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.439
 It is fine that I can not catch up with the convenience 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.089
 Less than 90% and music will not be it someday 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.809
 Ne 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.679
 That's why 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:42.549
 Even if you arrange yourself 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.879
 I also want to understand single-family houses in times and one more 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.259
 Some players have come out, but I am happy to meet the open 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:50.729
 It is called 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:52.149
 Some people are more 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.699
 I think that the width of the lake shore spread 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.699
 For example, it will be a luxury item 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:05.109
 Such 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.260
 It is 27 cases to meet 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.489
 Also in the environmental field 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.959
 The first three items are good to put in perfection 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:17.539
 This was nothing more 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.170
 Even in the same year of 2002 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.729
 And on top of that it's a bit dark 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.549
 It is also a high school 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.169
 After taking over the benefits 1.2 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.469
 Mason 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:29.569
 15th year 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.559
 It is net decrease of Park yuan, but of this code 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:36.739
 After 5 years, I will leave my friend -based 1 to 4 as it is 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.769
 Bring it to open the highlands, that is to say, avoid long-term 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.429
 Well theft 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:43.859
 maran 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:44.809
 Originally 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:50.079
 Osaka Hidaka and one after another originally at 7 trillion 800 billion yen 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.549
 It is a meat effective but it is a form to direct stuffing 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.609
 Bringing the base of the 15th year 7th year to the 6th year 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.789
 And at the same time when mievb-1 flies in full flight 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:06.789
 If you just take more than 1 yen and take it 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.809
 And the next melodic 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:12.700
 It will be touching in Yemen and 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.249
 next 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:16.430
 To the goal net 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.840
 Kobe color form that is conquered, which is effective, this is advanced technology 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.580
 But after that statement 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.199
 The three who presented in place of Ecofred's fourth achievement were 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:27.939
 As it is 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.169
 I will do it 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.169
 In other words, it has a shape with many openings 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.710
 middle aged 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.639
 Yes, it's a day of trouble by knowing so many haiku 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.419
 Difficult fluorescent lights or 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.340
 From low to high From high to low 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.330
 When it flies 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.860
 Registration word is also 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.500
 Well in between 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.670
 In the place where it makes it easier to resume 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.710
 I will come 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.509
 If you understand the Econo 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.740
 It is also possible for the director to lead himself 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.069
 I think it's not far away again 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.699
 I think I will come out of the key, but if I review the past two criteria 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.599
 This is the end 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.990
 Didn't we be able to resell twice? 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.990
 Questions from you in this section 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:20.949
 What can i do 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.330
 Please accept this as it is accepted 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.310
 Please send a private room to the program blog. 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.000
 Luminescent stick pointer input well at search site 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.479
 You will find it 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.909
 Also watch this section in the video from the show time 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.339
 You can help improve your guitar 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:36.360
 Please give me 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.360
 We exchanged part-time sales talk 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.900
 rain 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.889
 further.
