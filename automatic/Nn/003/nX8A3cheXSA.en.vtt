00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.139
 Come on, folks, here's good. 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.139
 Welcome to my good channel. 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.170
 today we will spend a single voice 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.640
 I'm going to separate this from here, which is a 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.269
 just to get pacu number 8 is I go in 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.150
 castro to another also 3/0 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.399
 okay and before anything anyone 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.910
 Ask me this is one of the countless 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.629
 ways you have to be able to chaste 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.379
 arranged good in cassol consisting of you 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.820
 to tie a wire a wire rope a wire 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:51.120
 hard or even line to protect plus gives 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.780
 more resistance year when the fish catches 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.520
 good I'll separate here I was for 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.309
 number 16 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.379
 not necessarily also need is not 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.030
 necessarily to go to the ta but it's 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.340
 It could be some other fish I'm 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.320
 using the as 16 is in my box has 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.840
 one with a lot of wire type 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.530
 with a lot of hook- talking number 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.830
 on wire 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.229
 I'll get an ak 103mm that 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.610
 here is specific purchase in store 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:30.119
 fishing is the equivalent of number 28 and 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:37.439
 This is where I'm going to put the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:39.990
 fish angling for pacu the smallest items 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.640
 ischemia which also what is a chopstick 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.200
 with a thread there at the end a good year and 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.100
 This is what I told you is the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:56.130
 3/0 and use it to pick up tambaqui tambacu 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.579
 big leaves of 18 pounds pulls 20 pounds 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.430
 and calmly take this system 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.860
 What are we going to do? What are we going to do? 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.409
 There in my walrus there in the front I have 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.899
 two players with pliers at this end 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.290
 I'll hold the wire. 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.510
 I put the hook here tÃ¡ 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.629
 I will hold with pliers and there I started 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.400
 my brand my tool had I 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.040
 I will cheer 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.840
 of the five laps 17 laps there goes from 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.439
 I like the customer 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.010
 then it is easy there are people who already handle 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:35.099
 which already turns straight hook on the wire I do not 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.959
 I think it's cool because it's going to work. 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.659
 resistance on the hook there and suddenly 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.510
 The way you play after he fell 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.989
 in the water it gets twisted and this way 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.859
 he is not very flexible because lupi 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.810
 there from the hook in the eye of the hook with a 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.269
 wire loop 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.409
 gives a certain flexibility and this is 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.329
 very good 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.530
 there will be a little tip I'll get a 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.019
 cutting pliers 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.730
 I'm going to finish here alone. 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.829
 simple cut 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.250
 Like I said this is one of the ways 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.590
 people who do 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.379
 He passes the hook here in the same way. 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.810
 that I made it right to give the finish 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.120
 also 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.590
 and contrary to what I 'm going to do now 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.199
 want to cut 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.139
 not that he does he picks up another one 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:29.190
 tool with a generator and a piece of 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:31.590
 Dick holds holds a hook and already does 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.720
 lupi on the wire where I'm putting the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.970
 decat here the bag 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.760
 So he picks it up there. 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.239
 I had it and spin it, I did not cut it 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.949
 and put a hook there in the spinner and then I go 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.760
 make another goal I'll give you one 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.760
 set here 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:55.949
 so what does he do? 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.540
 He takes the one I'm going to do. 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.150
 hold here and now I'm going to mourn 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.060
 Where will I get the line? 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.030
 So it's a way of doing the 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.129
 I'll do it then, suddenly in another 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.090
 occasion I think there is no need to 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:14.040
 have a good time on the internet there 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.009
 in that other way 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.289
 This is the way I use people here. 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:21.419
 It's cool, it's cool and with practice. 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.729
 You always do the same size as you. 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.850
 it takes a measure to this piece of 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.670
 wood goes hacking custom farm 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:33.050
 the same measure always remains so 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:35.840
 same size and beauty as it is 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.850
 so it goes quiet catches big fish 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:43.070
 it will not burst 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:45.050
 It's no longer necessary there is a wire 05 has 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.510
 dental shop that sells equipment with 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:52.250
 dentist has also okay to cool 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:56.620
 rain what else are we going to do now? 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.860
 piapara of piapara that accused 16 and wire 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.470
 03 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.010
 it is very flexible're so even 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.960
 scheme to make the hook here safe with 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:11.410
 pliers picks up an ischemia 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:16.940
 tool had and make it lupi on the wire 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:21.470
 here and there you will realize what it is that 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.930
 this lupi leaves her hook is to work 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.590
 cool he understands he does not keep a 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.170
 Sun 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.510
 contrary to what the staff already rotates 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:32.540
 straight in the hook is a form is a form 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.520
 It's what I say has no prescription for 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.420
 things in the fishing to work out 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.600
 understood is the practice and the training I do 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.070
 that way the other person can 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.140
 another and so on 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.350
 You saw there how it stays there stays 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.420
 flexible only stays loose in the wire loop 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:55.520
 I finish here 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:58.160
 short and good simple of everything and hold 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.640
 blue on the other side even secure layout 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:07.730
 with pliers and the 25 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:09.710
 spin and good people are good at it then I 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.770
 I'm going to stay here, you follow with a 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.350
 bit of the rest of the video and at the end 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.730
 have some detailed beauty photos of me 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.730
 Thank you and see you next time.
