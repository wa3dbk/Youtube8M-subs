 this wake finally 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.680
 compared to other planes I find 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.709
 that it's a lot more 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.450
 quiet economy class several 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.129

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.680
 the chain there are pasta at the 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.960
 Bolognese and the other possibility is 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.730
 the 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.910
 to beg steers but on the ladder 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.910
 inferior 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.150
 nine passengers bought a ticket 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:32.220

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.510
 behind the curtain a couple of actors 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.130

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.130
 the a380 they have a real bed 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.220

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.460
 against hearings be coaching 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.460
 already 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.880
 he voted yes 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.410
 in the tail of the plane a space 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.290
