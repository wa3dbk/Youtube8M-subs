00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:19.520
 In the 2013 World Champion protest car, the Master Boom 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:22.820
 The third leg of the final confrontation, the path I'm in charge of the proceeding and decision 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.620
 Left player cyano balls'm right player i5 b 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.710
 Now, the game is one situation. 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:34.290
 Oh, the rest of the time. 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.290
 Is a representation of meditation there is this 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:44.449
 It's time limit. 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.449
 I know that you match colors to a game known as 1 hour 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:55.440
 But if you look at the first and second games, 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.440
 It looks like the game is huge. 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:05.149
 I was given a time when I could not finish the game. 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.149
 Randros' chair is going to be in a hurry. Yes, 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.120
 Oh, but this 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.530
 There's one thing that's not good. 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.530
 Oh, what about you? 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:27.500
 That's why andoenya you to buff your other mantra 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:31.880
 It's so simple I can not give a knockout to Cobar with this statement poke 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:36.170
 It does not matter what you do if you just slice it up with Land's clothes. 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.039
 I can not write to the land, you have to shoot down the opponent emong gande doorway daughter 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:44.549
 Also be slightly flexible g 11 damage damage damage 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:47.560
 I used to get toktok Turning works Thank think it's the milk 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.220
 Give me a full punch . 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.150
 There may be cases where you can write 2 ridges, but you have to write 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.630
 do not have 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.939
 Now, where the nose dries out the energy denoted by one third each kid will usually represent enemies or anything 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.509
 You have three c's and you have a replacement . 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.509
 Its real 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.520
 The game really gets better. 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:14.220
 I just created, and then also in the first nine're dokchae pulley so as to catch something 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.510
 There's no way I can. 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.510
 Ah, it really is. 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:26.930
 Mark has written a rope just high but has spent the catcher to catch me speechless m Garma 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:32.389
 I have to drop the 30 bench image just like this. 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.040
 But the game is going to spent their principal tying the molars Cooler gone this way, 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:38.329
 I do not have to say that. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:42.909
 North liabilities did not have a reason why bother writing a hurry so it is dokchae wrote the original plane 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.909
 I'm not hurry love itself is a single-phase large 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.829
 This is 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.829
 I can see the Pay Capture. 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.720
 You can not do this. 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.480
 I am 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:05.980
 Randros player was originally aware of the urgency of the Jesus bit, but 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.920
 So write because I see that two hours earlier time left shoulder Games 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.060
 When I started, I did 7 minutes. 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.930
 That means that dog games are hard to beat 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.270
 It is. 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:21.490
 In the first leg and the second leg of the first four aspects of these cases is that eating Site 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.270
 I do not. 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:31.510
 Large dressing ex bit warmer mean a multi-line seven-point 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:35.980
 But how did it happen ? 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.120
 So getting a rope to escape the cave that is why this matters is you know death bubbles 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.390
 You should not be. 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:46.990
 I'm sorry to have started this buff before. 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.270
 The real thing is that the game is going to flow like this 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:55.560
 I told you what I said. 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:04:02.810
 And this dukedong name had a place of abuse. 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.810
 This is the game I end up eating the ridiculously site first one 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.220
 The next time, especially when the enemy but yes 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.959
 If the remaining time is short , 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.750
 You have to eat at least one size. 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.760
 There was a foreclosure catcher, and something back on the bench 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.760
 If your opponent does not use a replacement card anyway 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:41.300
 Ahm's going to have to keep on the bench. So Mercedes and 2 damage accumulate. 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.300
 You can bring something down to the second turning 

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:47.449
 I think I should have blacked it. 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:58.400
 I do not think I was wrong. 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:58.400
 I do not know what the boat was like, but in my eyes, I came in before Capture. 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.190
 Can greatly before the transition and ensure the so-fold 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:18.979
 You 're very familiar with this time. 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:23.500
 Because of the time limit, the game is still 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.500
 It's hard to play games with the law 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:39.320
 You may only accept something that is not good this time limit can not help it 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:46.919
 This is the part where you do not have it. 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:49.950
 It is the user's responsibility to use it , but I can not blame it for forgery. 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:54.750
 As I have just said , 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.500
 There is no problem to solve in this way because it is a specified clause. 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.050
 do not have 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.050
 So do not let the horse 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:08.260
 In fact, what it is that the player can enjoy looking at doing their duty 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.260
 I can hang it. 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:19.500
 And if I think about the time constraint I experienced , 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:24.210
 That's about 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:26.870
 The man I know is often easier time left now, this minute to 10 in 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.870
 You were plain. 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:37.050
 Doegin to very old in the past two Hittite Iranian origin but that was before the house 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:41.159
 It's a time limit, three full years. 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:44.069
 1 The time limit for one turn is Samsun 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:47.639
 It 's something you can beat. 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:51.840
 But if you pulled those three minutes, it was a real four. 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:55.300
 How to win the site right first 2 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.510
 Six of these days of victory against five 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.230
 It 's over now . 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.230
 here 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:05.210
 Given an additional hour of 1 minute 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:13.660
 I will not finish the game if I do not have enough time for one minute. 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.850
 Whether I go to some of Turner's next opponent 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:22.000
 I do not know exactly because I have not experienced this. 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:25.150
 Now, let's get rid of the nose 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.570
 The number of lines can be sometimes give something inde requirements to export something 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.570
 There is not 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:36.410
 This game is over at the moment when the turn is just too great. 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:40.900
 Oh, the right player 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.900
 while accounting for io bisque victory 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:49.320
 2013 World Championship Second qualifying Master Boom wins the final 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.560
 Occupies 

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:55.710
 So far, he's a caster and commentator. 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.280
