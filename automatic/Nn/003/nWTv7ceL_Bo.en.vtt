00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 it's all to all these reactions mvm 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.670
 and so today we will end up 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.889
 to live all in real how to settle 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.380
 the problem of untimely cuts or 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.269
 micro-cuts of pv for 1 pvp for 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:22.949
 be sorry its relief the newspapers 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:24.930
 so for those who have this happened 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.000
 it happened to me and it lasted for a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.470
 month and a half and I do not really have too much 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.439
 of solution is a little seek it by 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.770
 I tell them I'll go 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.930
 show how to adjust that so 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.450
 kleenex in power I was looking for a lot 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.090
 of time I finally go to finally see 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.700
 short if you want it's good 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.989
 I think that's the video know about 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.530
 the problem and for those who watch 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.629
 like that for them too it happens to them 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.010
 it's actually a message here 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.510
 mark this in red its marks and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.500
 country connections from the country of save 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.530
 harper is 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.760
 and you said their collection is in 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.379
 done every ten seconds it does it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.200
 that's a little bit less of it 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.180
 the tuc toko problem is that dia for 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.360
 look for parties like that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.010
 there it looks finally imagine that moment 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.200
 it finds vincent bessat and like thursday 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.540
 its surroundings is even gone that's all 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.540
 all and 5.6 seconds that made 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.009
 for two three seconds so that 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.290
 takes a lot of time more expensive the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.659
 party is often we are in the menu 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.070
 the selection of champions league 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.070
 legends crash in all 15 months which 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.520
 was happening to me and it's worth it so much 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.729
 horrible 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.090
 that's why today's management 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.360
 problem 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.159
 so in fact it's a little trick 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.869
 that I do not know actually I did two 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.939
 budget mobsters and I did two things 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.299
 today to settle and one of two has 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.299
 market 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:03.450
 my screen so I said I did some 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.620
 things so this is one of the two that works 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.750
 I advise to do both as 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.850
 I did because I did both to 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.950
 so at times these people stuff 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.650
 you download so you go i'll you 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.500
 would of course pass a description you 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:28.900
 download that so we're in love there 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:31.720
 admits downloads you run after 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.140
 you follow as usual nex nex nex and 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.190
 I pass 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.570
 I'm not going to do it because I have 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.160
 already done we wish the dozen the 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.050
 second thing to do we risk 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.930
 to take a little time is to open 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.910
 his level this kind here and to go no 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.430
 no no no in the options so the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.970
 little disease is there and to click 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.410
 fix and I do not know how to do it because 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.200
 what I have to say is to take my 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.600
 time is here normally if you 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.940
 did these two things late all 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.410
 your pc so restarted there and it should 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.050
 walk by the way when you have 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.130
 installed thaler files the 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.260
 darn that you wonder at the end if 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.010
 you want to delay all your pc or more 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.100
 late 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.459
 his mark is close you click yourself 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.959
 on on klose and you're getting ready 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.450
 your tiko more and more to take a 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.560
 twenty minutes luck it's me I 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.390
 do not know that but that's the time it has 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.040
 took my texts at risk to take more 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:43.440
 of time at its marks and the leyre and 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.970
 that was all this tutorial enough 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.110
 fast enough to fix this problem 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.500
 so I hope you enjoyed it and we 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.720
 finds 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.980
 I do not know maybe soon for 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.299
 close to videos deemed not safe to 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.299
 the test of salvation
