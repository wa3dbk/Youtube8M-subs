00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.099
 to achieve it we will win 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.330
 the ft 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.959
 very much I kill you very strange for a different behavior and my the truth 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:13.329
 if you have 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.800
 efecom a stranger with a different creed cdc behavior as he expressed things 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.050
 there I go 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.060
 really explained 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.269
 I do not know how an anxiety like 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.269
 I do not know if that hunger if you to your fleet 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.199
 but what a coincidence 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.930
 you also not 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.370
 arasti just the subject called today 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.940
 is the 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.620
 I'm not in Havana that of an animal 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.570
 and here the Cali country hall that is called this I know it 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.530
 that logo the brown bear yes sir 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.630
 is the same 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.120
 if to him at certain times of the year the same thing happens to you, same thing to me as mine 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.640
 it's time of year 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.020
 the expert but of course 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.440
 the brown luso is one of the largest in the world in competition on average 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.440
 about 380 kilograms ap 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.100
 one of the goals we have here at the zoo of Cali 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.960
 is health both physical 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.380
 emotional I would say of the animals 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.460
 in some each one has to change the housing real estate 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.930
 in other cases you have to change them with the enrichment but we are with it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.079
 the brown bear that that a particular case where change was 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.450
 different 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.940
 how was this change that we had to do with the pair initially we have 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.530
 found that animals season of the year 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.480
 without high stress 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.760
 inés patient 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.970
 I do not know practices for a hundred 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.680
 it has to be their life with it may be that the food is strong 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.740
 valdés is the day 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.570
 or silicone fires 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.570
 the field we find that encourages him to keep getting worse in that way 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.220
 also in the northwestern United States and Canada the peninsula of 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.310
 kamchatka siberia the largest population admit in the ccaa 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.210
 we found that the animals in sirte by the East Kurdish militias but not 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.260
 to hibernate 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.819
 They must have 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.499
 they should try to increase their weight one third above the delphi has 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:13.689
 habitually 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.149
 to support hibernation 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:19.849
 that means that in addition to looking for certain types of special foods to fígar 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.819
 do that there is a time of year when you hold it have cut it because it knows 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.809
 the lean season is coming the winter season 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:30.089
 although here the zoo of cali notimex hibernate thing in its metabolism 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:31.089
 is 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:35.349
 that defensive behavior if he continues with all his process in which 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.460
 every year he must be everything is the same 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.729
 for all this supported by its social activity and equality 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.729
 then in his usual he begins a ceaseless search 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.319
 but I did not find we preached that against what he requires 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:53.779
 at that time of the year the fruit or what we give when allowing does not 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.679
 the fly prey meat 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.129
 that are rich in protein and fat that what can more easily lead to 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.319
 that the number increases in weight 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.939
 used and this feed change 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.199
 that is alone 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:09.519
 even when I rose a whole year how many months as you know is 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.099
 I looked at this change possibly get to him 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.609
 until October approximately in October already 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.519
 to which to start looking for what is 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.179
 the art form the hard shoulder 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:20.459
 definitely 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.719
 the number one interest in the zoo of cali is the welfare of animals 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.219
 we are explorers by nature with connecting it to the network 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:30.390
 a nice 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.059
 Malaga 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:36.139
 inter the section I love it because 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.139
 it's about what research is like an investigation 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.519
 cannon to specific behaviors 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.019
 lopez de ortiz is 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.189
 the chichi this talking to muse told him the reasons 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.699
 beckham of feeding for dallas that manages them to the dt 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:55.079
 the consequences of that path 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.639
 yes although they have also been seen in this 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.319
 this 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.099
 I had like a good taste for cake which is to say who is rich 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.799
 for the fruit that to the glass per day 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.099
 the banana 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.499
 irene medina mind 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:12.409
 must go on 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:18.479
 they are supportive and spent the winter in some cave they only meet with others 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.050
 individuals of their same species in the time of salmon farming the meat and 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.510
 the fat seen you think 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.050
 isis initial to form the necessary reserves for the winter 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.110
 the titan by caesar of the cake the front 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.680
 I made the change for the meat as this change in diet 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.340
 not even changed the behavior is the truth is that he started it 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.550
 have more rest periods 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.400
 the repetitive movement that had it 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.419
 started these weapons i 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.749
 and who self-supplied the wind vane this diet and 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.910
 the meat the chicken 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.490
 that early hour 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.539
 nor what to do 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.770
 eight in the morning maximum 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.800
 latest 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.229
 for what 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.050
 you find there but the time to train consumption in the surroundings 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.069
 of sirte 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.139
 Well, I'm very happy that we have such good results 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.760
 and that you are so dedicated to work we are explorers for 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:15.470
 nature 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.300
 temporary cornet 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.350
 each month 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.809
 humala 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:22.340
 despite being worried about 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.389
 in chunchi descendants three tenths 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.389
 but do not worry, stress is normal 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:34.460
 in Latin the natural habitat animals is also expressed for example 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.259
 how much 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.869
 they look for the most food they do not always find in all the sites here there 

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:39.719
 what to expect 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.999
 or when, for example, there is a very intense rainy season, 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:47.299
 weather camera and pp have expressed or for example animals that may be prey to 

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:47.840
 cars 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.970
 while avoiding 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.159
 and it is expected that the room for the kite 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.529
 to the premiere or when there are pups also that involves behaviors of 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:57.589
 isolation or conceal 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:01.819
 phrases like these it is not normal for animals to suffer in the wild 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.650
 clear stress and here it is very important also because 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.810
 maintain immune levels harps participate 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.340
 so you are three that I have can keep me immune 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.659
 to not get sick 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:14.979
 but it's not like that 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:19.029
 then come and meet the animals come here to the zoo of Cali 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:20.990
 today you can see us on this web page 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.990
 only adicae calcuta by dot com 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:30.210
 we are explorers for current Calabria mask perhaps the winner of 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.169
 the led lamp 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:32.620
 nothing
