 borderlands with marshall is already 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.640
 doing 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.140
 for 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.140
 travelers to the train 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:34.080
 man more than anything for not knowing by 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.080
 where we are left the great dilemma 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.560
 I did not want train travelers not to 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.560
 we deliver 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.060
 for mine will be delivered travelers see 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.630
 it's been so long since I do not remember if 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.820
 we deliver or not 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:01.010
 the redneck rewards 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.390
 as much as I hate using technology 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.699
 hyperion that core that our 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.860
 assistant is already almost burned because no 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.150
 you take it out uncertainly with force is the new 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.700
 the core that you have brought as if 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.040
 minted is still logical no forgiveness is a 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.880
 old saying of the crimson dance a 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.880
 tragic native 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.790
 are the same it seems that it is already 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.800
 a relic of where truck shit 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.590
 It's time for you to tell you secretillo 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.440
 intel works for me deactivating 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.710
 shields of that act and jacques change 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.710
 phase 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.409
 we thought an invading energy core 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.409
 the shields are disabled 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.170
 we have some camera finders 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.950
 every day bras happens something just 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.659
 traverse the shield that had support from the 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.200
 moon the other so begins to extend 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.200
 people 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.810
 a terrible scooter idea has occurred a 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.810
 sanctuary in the air 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.920
 scooter 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.640
 all are impossible until I do 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.640
 that I want 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.000
 I also everyone who looks here is 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.000
 Balance 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.910
 you remember that you had to activate the 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.810
 pillars these if we were the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.810
 Home mechanisms to avoid 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.810
 we will get 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.380
 we have to activate them one by one like this 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.810
 how much we will not do 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.780
 do not 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.069
 is already activated for it I do this 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.910
 you just have to give him the last 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.910
 switch 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.000
 transmission we read the one that you shit 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.750
 it is very well set 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.430
 we are prepared is everyone have 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.930
 state 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.129
 you have realized that it has been done 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.129
 night doing a little while 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.299
 let's say you'll find roland 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.299
 immobilized 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.920
 running or we're dead 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.230
 forget about me take all the injured that 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.850
 you can download and take it to the lille and 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.850
 put something of him alone 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.370
 they do not give it to us 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.500
 the city 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.100
 jump over the balcony and so we go before 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.100
 all right 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.640
 is here the slut I think without a look 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.250
 although an uncle stick 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.300
 perhaps it is a reactor all and very clear 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.570
 he does not let me use it better than you 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.570
 do something 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.120
 and thank goodness that we have to 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.120
 grab something 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.580
 the action 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.760
 I'm sorry it was an accident 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.720
 but I promise we'll go to the other 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.750
 writer side for listening there was a thousand 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.330
 fucking people and it's us 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:49.729
 those who stayed out 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.729
 and on top of taking it for ass you know 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.280
 good me that a car passed by car 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.900
 or yes agreement the bridge no longer produced 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:06.259
 by cars that's all a city 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.660
 strainer and makes them think that you have the 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.710
 more same opportunity cons 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.710
 or the city 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.939
 do not know what for 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.160
 so let's go 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.650
 go to sanctuary 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.050
 I know you will have been angry with me but 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.690

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.360

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.909
 only road to the highlands 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.120
 or if we had just got angry with 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.120

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.129

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.699

 related and so I ask the 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.810
 four last finders of the camera and 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:02.330
