00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
we're gonna one-man-army again and run

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.630 
we're gonna one-man-army again and run
around<00:00:48.880> and<00:00:49.480> find<00:00:50.020> a<00:00:50.110> better<00:00:50.290> spot<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.520> then

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
around and find a better spot and then

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.910 
around and find a better spot and then
throw<00:00:51.820> it<00:00:51.880> down<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.060> it<00:00:52.470> kind<00:00:53.470> of<00:00:53.500> works<00:00:53.710> its

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
throw it down and it kind of works its

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.560 
throw it down and it kind of works its
way<00:00:54.040> through<00:00:54.070> and<00:00:54.610> then<00:00:54.760> the<00:00:54.970> fun<00:00:55.150> part<00:00:55.180> is

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
way through and then the fun part is

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
way through and then the fun part is
finding<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:56.050> and<00:00:56.590> so<00:00:57.450> there<00:00:58.450> it<00:00:58.540> was<00:00:58.690> and<00:00:59.500> you

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
finding it and so there it was and you

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.440 
finding it and so there it was and you
can<00:00:59.710> kind<00:00:59.920> of<00:00:59.980> see<00:01:00.160> how<00:01:00.520> you<00:01:00.579> can<00:01:00.940> get<00:01:01.060> yourself

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
can kind of see how you can get yourself

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.020 
can kind of see how you can get yourself
an<00:01:01.510> advantage<00:01:01.930> if<00:01:02.200> you<00:01:02.579> learn<00:01:03.579> how<00:01:03.700> that<00:01:03.880> works

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
an advantage if you learn how that works

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.880 
an advantage if you learn how that works
you<00:01:04.210> can<00:01:04.360> put<00:01:04.570> claim<00:01:05.170> words<00:01:05.409> without<00:01:05.619> I<00:01:05.649> heard

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
you can put claim words without I heard

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.469 
you can put claim words without I heard
it<00:01:06.070> going<00:01:06.280> down<00:01:06.430> somewhere<00:01:06.820> and<00:01:07.090> then<00:01:07.299> there's

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
it going down somewhere and then there's

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.569 
it going down somewhere and then there's
a<00:01:07.570> little<00:01:07.810> floating<00:01:08.079> clamor<00:01:08.560> they<00:01:09.189> kind<00:01:09.490> of

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
a little floating clamor they kind of

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.969 
a little floating clamor they kind of
get<00:01:09.670> stuck<00:01:09.909> there<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.360> then<00:01:10.780> uh<00:01:10.810> these<00:01:11.619> banana

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
get stuck there and then uh these banana

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.169 
get stuck there and then uh these banana
plants<00:01:12.340> in<00:01:12.460> case<00:01:12.579> you<00:01:12.700> didn't<00:01:12.880> know<00:01:12.939> I<00:01:12.999> just

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179 
plants in case you didn't know I just

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:14.160 
plants in case you didn't know I just
threw<00:01:13.359> this<00:01:13.420> in<00:01:13.600> there<00:01:13.719> for<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:13.899> guys<00:01:13.990> you<00:01:14.139> can

not shoot through them to kill people so

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.590 
not shoot through them to kill people so
can<00:01:18.100> be<00:01:18.189> kind<00:01:18.399> of<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:18.549> pain<00:01:18.729> but<00:01:19.240> you<00:01:19.389> can't

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600

can be kind of a pain but you can't
shoot<00:01:19.749> through<00:01:19.960> them<00:01:20.079> and<00:01:20.200> then<00:01:20.350> this<00:01:21.009> is<00:01:21.189> the

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
shoot through them and then this is the

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.149 
shoot through them and then this is the
original<00:01:21.490> glitch<00:01:22.859> basically<00:01:23.859> are<00:01:23.979> you<00:01:24.069> gonna

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
original glitch basically are you gonna

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.590 
original glitch basically are you gonna
do<00:01:24.340> you're<00:01:24.549> gonna<00:01:24.670> jump<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:25.179> Crouch

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
do you're gonna jump and Crouch

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.139 
do you're gonna jump and Crouch
to<00:01:26.200> crouch<00:01:26.439> before<00:01:26.889> you<00:01:26.979> get<00:01:27.100> there<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.459> then

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
to crouch before you get there and then

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.940 
to crouch before you get there and then
lining<00:01:28.479> yourself<00:01:28.600> up<00:01:29.020> setting<00:01:29.530> yourself<00:01:29.829> up

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
lining yourself up setting yourself up

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.690 
lining yourself up setting yourself up
perfect<00:01:30.399> and<00:01:31.649> that's<00:01:32.649> how<00:01:32.829> I<00:01:32.859> do<00:01:33.009> it<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.520> makes

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
perfect and that's how I do it it makes

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.929 
perfect and that's how I do it it makes
it<00:01:33.850> easier<00:01:34.179> and<00:01:34.810> then<00:01:35.229> turn<00:01:35.859> around<00:01:35.939> face

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
it easier and then turn around face

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.559 
it easier and then turn around face
wherever<00:01:37.179> you<00:01:37.359> want<00:01:37.509> to<00:01:37.600> pop<00:01:37.719> a<00:01:37.749> claymore<00:01:38.259> and

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
wherever you want to pop a claymore and

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.859 
wherever you want to pop a claymore and
just<00:01:41.009> I'm<00:01:42.009> having<00:01:42.249> him<00:01:42.549> go<00:01:42.579> ahead<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.450> then

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
just I'm having him go ahead and then

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.160 
just I'm having him go ahead and then
you<00:01:44.109> just<00:01:44.319> hit<00:01:44.469> our<00:01:44.499> two<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.869> whoop<00:01:46.869> there<00:01:47.139> it

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
you just hit our two and whoop there it

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.719 
you just hit our two and whoop there it
goes<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:49.630> kinda<00:01:49.899> hard<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.079> see<00:01:50.729> I'll

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
goes and it's kinda hard to see I'll

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.129 
goes and it's kinda hard to see I'll
show<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:51.939> in<00:01:52.029> a<00:01:52.060> second<00:01:52.420> it's<00:01:52.749> really

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.139 
show you in a second it's really

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:56.879 
show you in a second it's really
difficult<00:01:53.319> to<00:01:53.619> see<00:01:54.659> cool<00:01:55.659> transition<00:01:56.259> and<00:01:56.439> so

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
difficult to see cool transition and so

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:58.289 
difficult to see cool transition and so
that's<00:01:57.130> what<00:01:57.279> it<00:01:57.310> looks<00:01:57.639> like<00:01:57.999> from<00:01:58.149> other

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
that's what it looks like from other

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.779 
that's what it looks like from other
people's<00:01:58.659> point<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:58.929> view<00:01:59.369> you<00:02:00.369> actually

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789
