 of the structure allowing the installation of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.619
 glass wool and execution of the installations 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:30.480
 before closing 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:32.040
 all pipes pass through the

 pipe 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.230
 after completion of the installation 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.899
 complements and the realization of all 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:59.280

 be made with the aid of bushes 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.939
 for materials based on 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.360
 application of reinforcements that 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.040
 higher loads per attachment point 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.770
 see the guide brasilit systems 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.360

 8 format courses 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:42.350
 then with stylet the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.230
 better finishing of the opening after a 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.140
 hole the specific electric box for the 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:57.560
 construction is fixed through 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:02:00.830
 clips for the execution of a 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.690
