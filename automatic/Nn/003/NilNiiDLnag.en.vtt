00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
clear plan of what I wanted to do but

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.170 
clear plan of what I wanted to do but
part<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.020> thing<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.180> wanted

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
part of the thing is when you I wanted

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.730 
part of the thing is when you I wanted
to<00:01:54.240> change<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> show<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> lot<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.530> very

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
to change the show a lot and it's very

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.170 
to change the show a lot and it's very
hard<00:01:56.009> after<00:01:56.310> you've<00:01:56.520> watched<00:01:56.700> four<00:01:57.149> episodes

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
hard after you've watched four episodes

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.929 
hard after you've watched four episodes
to<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.320> change<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.219> show<00:01:59.399> because<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.820> just

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
to just change the show because it just

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.670 
to just change the show because it just
it's<00:02:00.210> difficult<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.469> real

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it's difficult to do so the real

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.730 
it's difficult to do so the real
challenge<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:02.189> sort<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.460> how<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.060> I

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
challenge is sort of how do I

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.709 
challenge is sort of how do I
organically<00:02:04.740> shift<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> show<00:02:05.640> towards<00:02:06.420> more

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
organically shift the show towards more

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.910 
organically shift the show towards more
what<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.899> want<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.259> be<00:02:07.350> without<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
what I want it to be without the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.290 
what I want it to be without the
audience<00:02:08.310> saying<00:02:08.580> hey<00:02:08.819> wait<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> minute<00:02:09.209> it

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
audience saying hey wait a minute it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.609 
audience saying hey wait a minute it
looks<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.780> brand<00:02:09.989> new<00:02:10.080> show<00:02:10.379> this

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
looks like it's a brand new show this

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.200 
looks like it's a brand new show this
doesn't<00:02:10.890> make<00:02:10.950> any<00:02:11.009> sense

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
doesn't make any sense

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.910 
doesn't make any sense
and<00:02:13.300> also<00:02:13.660> incorporate<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.500> things<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:14.740> liked

some<00:02:19.210> great<00:02:19.360> stuff<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:20.260> was<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.440> matter<00:02:20.620> of

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
some great stuff so it was a matter of

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.650 
some great stuff so it was a matter of
sort<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.160> blending<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.940> things<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.270> liked<00:02:22.510> a

lot and the things that he did great

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.950 
lot and the things that he did great
together<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.790> it's<00:02:24.970> not<00:02:25.120> easy<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.600> be<00:02:25.720> honest

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
together and it's not easy to be honest

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.350 
together and it's not easy to be honest
with<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.170> um<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:27.160> know<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.640> it's<00:02:27.880> hard<00:02:28.210> once

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
with you um you know the it's hard once

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.210 
with you um you know the it's hard once
you<00:02:28.540> have<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.660> pilot<00:02:29.080> written<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.530> buy<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.040> so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
you have a pilot written to buy it so

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.590 
you have a pilot written to buy it so
important<00:02:30.580> because<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.790> pilot<00:02:31.090> does<00:02:31.270> sort<00:02:31.570> of

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
important because a pilot does sort of

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.360 
important because a pilot does sort of
create<00:02:31.900> what<00:02:32.080> this<00:02:32.260> show<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.500> going<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.980> be<00:02:33.130> and

create what this show is going to be and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.370 
create what this show is going to be and
you<00:02:34.090> want<00:02:34.300> everything<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.840> build<00:02:35.050> from<00:02:35.320> that

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
could be a backorder of 92 even though

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.100 
could be a backorder of 92 even though
you're<00:03:12.430> only<00:03:12.520> given<00:03:12.850> 13<00:03:13.270> you<00:03:13.540> always<00:03:13.780> prepare

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
for a full season order because you have

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.330 
for a full season order because you have
to<00:03:15.580> be<00:03:15.670> ready<00:03:15.820> if<00:03:16.000> they<00:03:16.090> order<00:03:16.270> more<00:03:16.710> so<00:03:17.710> what

to be ready if they order more so what

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.100 
to be ready if they order more so what
happened<00:03:18.670> though<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:18.760> when<00:03:19.630> they<00:03:19.720> cut<00:03:19.930> things

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
happened though is when they cut things

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.420 
happened though is when they cut things
down<00:03:20.320> I<00:03:20.350> just<00:03:20.710> really<00:03:20.920> had<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.070> make<00:03:21.280> some

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
down I just really had to make some

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.570 
down I just really had to make some
really<00:03:21.580> tough<00:03:21.880> choices<00:03:22.180> about<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:23.080> know

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
really tough choices about you know

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.290 
really tough choices about you know
specifically<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:24.700> lot<00:03:24.850> of<00:03:24.940> people<00:03:25.120> said<00:03:25.180> well

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
specifically a lot of people said well

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.180 
specifically a lot of people said well
like<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.570> ending<00:03:25.840> it's<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.320> cliffhanger<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.980> I

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
like the ending it's a cliffhanger and I

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.460 
like the ending it's a cliffhanger and I
didn't<00:03:27.490> I<00:03:27.610> felt<00:03:27.970> like<00:03:28.060> do<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.600> end<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.990> show<00:03:29.170> on

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
didn't I felt like do I end the show on

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.680 
didn't I felt like do I end the show on
episode<00:03:29.830> 10<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:30.850> it<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.150> me<00:03:31.240> it<00:03:31.330> didn't<00:03:31.570> feel

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
episode 10 and it to me it didn't feel

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.380 
episode 10 and it to me it didn't feel
organic<00:03:32.080> and<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:33.160> decided<00:03:33.460> that<00:03:33.640> I<00:03:33.790> would<00:03:34.000> end

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
organic and I decided that I would end

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.930 
organic and I decided that I would end
the<00:03:35.290> season<00:03:35.530> in<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.160> way<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.460> think<00:03:36.700> could

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
the season in a way that I think could

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.910 
the season in a way that I think could
possibly<00:03:37.510> be<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.990> version<00:03:38.380> of<00:03:38.440> an<00:03:38.530> ending<00:03:38.770> or

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
possibly be a version of an ending or

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.220 
possibly be a version of an ending or
using<00:03:39.160> your<00:03:39.250> imagination<00:03:39.750> if<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:40.900> wanted<00:03:41.110> to

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
using your imagination if you wanted to

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.870 
using your imagination if you wanted to
you<00:03:41.830> could<00:03:41.920> extrapolate<00:03:42.220> where<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:42.760> would<00:03:42.850> go

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
you could extrapolate where it would go

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.240 
you could extrapolate where it would go
from<00:03:43.180> from<00:03:43.480> from<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.900> final<00:03:44.320> frame<00:03:44.530> but<00:03:45.100> also

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
from from from the final frame but also

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.530 
from from from the final frame but also
felt<00:03:45.580> like<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.820> want<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.030> leave<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.240> a<00:03:46.300> place

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
felt like I want to leave it a place

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.930 
felt like I want to leave it a place
where<00:03:46.720> if<00:03:46.810> we<00:03:46.870> get<00:03:47.020> more<00:03:47.110> episodes<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.830> can<00:03:48.130> keep

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
where if we get more episodes I can keep

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.270 
where if we get more episodes I can keep
