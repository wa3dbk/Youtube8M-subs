like less than a thousand years and they

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.950 
like less than a thousand years and they
would<00:00:36.950> be<00:00:37.040> right<00:00:37.220> between<00:00:37.370> other<00:00:37.850> videos<00:00:38.300> that

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
those videos every once in a while I

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.160

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
1105 views and so what I did is I went

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.290 
1105 views and so what I did is I went
through<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:54.380> made<00:00:54.530> a<00:00:54.560> spreadsheet<00:00:54.950> of<00:00:55.670> all

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300
