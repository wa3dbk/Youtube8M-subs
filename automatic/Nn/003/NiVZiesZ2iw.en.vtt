00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
little while so I thought what better

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.879 
little while so I thought what better
time<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.480> compare<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.170> contrast<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.710> two

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
time to a compare and contrast the two

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.260 
features on either console and answer
the<00:00:16.199> question<00:00:16.680> which<00:00:17.430> one<00:00:17.609> does<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.940> better

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
the question which one does it better

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.140 
the question which one does it better
so<00:00:18.570> I'm<00:00:18.840> sitting<00:00:19.350> here<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.770> my<00:00:20.070> little<00:00:20.550> little

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
so I'm sitting here and my little little
