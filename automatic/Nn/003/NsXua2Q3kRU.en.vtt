hi<00:00:03.330> guys<00:00:03.570> in<00:00:03.870> today's<00:00:04.049> tutorial<00:00:04.380> we<00:00:04.830> would

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
hi guys in today's tutorial we would

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.619 
hi guys in today's tutorial we would
like<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.190> show<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.640> how<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.120> can<00:00:06.299> build<00:00:06.450> a

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
like to show you how you can build a

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.450 
like to show you how you can build a
super<00:00:07.170> simple<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.620> super<00:00:07.710> funny<00:00:08.130> elevator

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
super simple and super funny elevator

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.640 
super simple and super funny elevator
and<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:08.970> concept<00:00:09.360> was<00:00:09.599> made<00:00:09.870> up<00:00:09.990> by<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.469> guy

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
and this concept was made up by this guy

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.680 
and this concept was made up by this guy
over<00:00:10.800> here<00:00:10.920> why<00:00:11.460> Timmy<00:00:11.759> why<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.389> guess<00:00:12.540> he

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
over here why Timmy why and I guess he

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.200 
over here why Timmy why and I guess he
will<00:00:12.809> explain<00:00:13.049> now<00:00:13.170> what<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.860> all<00:00:14.070> about

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 
will explain now what this is all about

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.379 
will explain now what this is all about
yep

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
yep

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.380 
yep
so<00:00:15.719> hello<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.350> had<00:00:17.160> an<00:00:17.279> idea<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.580> elevator<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
so hello I had an idea of elevator and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.560 
so hello I had an idea of elevator and
pedi<00:00:18.930> made<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.289> way<00:00:19.529> faster<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.090> clock

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
pedi made it way faster with this clock

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.200 
pedi made it way faster with this clock
down<00:00:21.840> here<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.279> basically<00:00:23.430> works<00:00:24.000> like

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
down here so and it basically works like

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.269 
down here so and it basically works like
that<00:00:24.390> there<00:00:24.840> are<00:00:24.930> four<00:00:25.199> Pistons<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> sides

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
that there are four Pistons on the sides

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.370 
that there are four Pistons on the sides
and<00:00:26.580> they<00:00:26.699> push<00:00:26.939> all<00:00:27.330> these<00:00:27.570> blocks<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
and they push all these blocks in the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.209 
and they push all these blocks in the
middle<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.519> circle<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.380> go<00:00:31.650> through

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
middle in a circle so it can go through

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.180 
middle in a circle so it can go through
the<00:00:32.340> elevator<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.940> oops<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:36.649> pushes<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.829> to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the elevator and oops and pushes you to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.470 
the elevator and oops and pushes you to
the<00:00:38.219> top<00:00:39.860> so<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.309> go<00:00:41.460> out<00:00:41.610> again<00:00:41.640> okay

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the top so then you go out again okay

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.229 
the top so then you go out again okay
now<00:00:43.230> you're<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.730> go<00:00:45.000> down

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
now you're here and then you can go down

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.500 
now you're here and then you can go down
the<00:00:45.870> other<00:00:46.020> side

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
the other side

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.660 
the other side
yeah<00:00:48.510> works<00:00:48.930> perfect<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.160> might<00:00:50.309> know<00:00:50.460> this

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
yeah works perfect you might know this

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.810 
yeah works perfect you might know this
concept<00:00:51.180> named<00:00:52.079> si<00:00:52.559> Paternoster<00:00:53.340> that's<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
concept named si Paternoster that's a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.090 
concept named si Paternoster that's a
quite<00:00:54.149> basic<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.110> old<00:00:55.350> elevator<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
quite basic and old elevator that you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.910 
quite basic and old elevator that you
might<00:00:56.280> find<00:00:56.550> an<00:00:56.670> old<00:00:56.820> building<00:00:57.059> still<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.920> I

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
might find an old building still and I

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.520 
might find an old building still and I
guess<00:00:59.160> we'll<00:00:59.550> now<00:00:59.820> get<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> tutorial<00:01:01.289> part

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
guess we'll now get to the tutorial part

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.700 
guess we'll now get to the tutorial part
and<00:01:01.800> show<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.100> how<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.699> build<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.710> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and show you how you can build this to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.630 
and show you how you can build this to
build<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.220> will<00:01:05.339> need<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> following

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
build this you will need the following

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.570 
build this you will need the following
materials<00:01:06.350> six<00:01:07.350> repeater<00:01:07.740> some<00:01:08.340> redstone

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
materials six repeater some redstone

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.240 
materials six repeater some redstone
dust<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.600> comparator<00:01:10.200> two<00:01:10.530> sticky<00:01:10.860> pistons

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
dust one comparator two sticky pistons

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.800 
dust one comparator two sticky pistons
for<00:01:11.490> normal<00:01:11.820> Pistons<00:01:12.180> some<00:01:12.390> building<00:01:12.689> blocks

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
for normal Pistons some building blocks

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.840 
for normal Pistons some building blocks
and<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.320> course<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> actual<00:01:14.340> elevator

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and of course for the actual elevator

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.420 
and of course for the actual elevator
cells<00:01:15.210> some<00:01:15.930> iron<00:01:16.350> trapdoors<00:01:16.860> because<00:01:17.310> you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
cells some iron trapdoors because you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.550 
cells some iron trapdoors because you
can't<00:01:17.610> open<00:01:17.759> them<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.240> some<00:01:18.869> fence<00:01:19.080> gates<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
can't open them and some fence gates and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.740 
can't open them and some fence gates and
you<00:01:19.890> need<00:01:20.040> not<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> stack<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.180> those<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.540> course

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
you need not a stack of those of course

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.660 
you need not a stack of those of course
you<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.170> need<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.560> many<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:23.040> he<00:01:23.189> wants<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you just need as many as he wants to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.170 
you just need as many as he wants to
build<00:01:23.820> those<00:01:24.030> cages<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.490> want<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.759> start

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
build those cages so we want to start

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.240 
build those cages so we want to start
with<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.630> clock<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.020> controls<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.829> piston

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
with the clock that controls the piston

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.770 
with the clock that controls the piston
moving<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.610> blocks<00:01:29.790> around<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.420> therefore

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
moving the blocks around and therefore

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.300 
moving the blocks around and therefore
you<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:30.900> goes<00:01:31.290> three<00:01:31.560> blocks<00:01:31.829> below<00:01:32.009> your

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you just goes three blocks below your

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.520 
you just goes three blocks below your
floor<00:01:32.549> block<00:01:32.700> place<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> block<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.960> lever

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
floor block place a block with a lever

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.950 
floor block place a block with a lever
on<00:01:34.770> top<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.820> create<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.390> clock<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
on top so we can create a clock with a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.410 
on top so we can create a clock with a
comparator<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.770> substract<00:01:38.310> mode<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:39.060> some

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
comparator in substract mode then some

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.200 
comparator in substract mode then some
blocks<00:01:39.780> around<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.590> put<00:01:41.400> redstone<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:42.150> top

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
blocks around and put redstone on top

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.749 
blocks around and put redstone on top
with<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.020> repeater<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> two<00:01:44.490> tick

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
with a repeater so we get a two tick

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.899 
with a repeater so we get a two tick
clock<00:01:45.149> over<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.369> then<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.700> bring

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
clock over here and then we can bring

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.260 
clock over here and then we can bring
this<00:01:48.060> up<00:01:48.240> later<00:01:48.570> into<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.670> staircase<00:01:50.670> was<00:01:51.030> half

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
this up later into a staircase was half

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.569 
this up later into a staircase was half
slept<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.140> make<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.710> big<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.520> we

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
slept so we can make it as big as we

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.490 
slept so we can make it as big as we
want<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.570> want<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.840> take<00:01:54.990> care<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
want but we want to take care of the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.770 
want but we want to take care of the
mechanism<00:01:56.430> down<00:01:56.549> below<00:01:56.820> first<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.390> put<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
mechanism down below first so we put a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.100 
mechanism down below first so we put a
redstone<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:59.130> then<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.670> sticky<00:02:00.659> piston<00:02:00.810> with

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
redstone here then a sticky piston with

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.719 
redstone here then a sticky piston with
a<00:02:01.140> block<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.500> create<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.829> one<00:02:02.040> tick<00:02:02.219> pass<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.610> of

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
a block to create a one tick pass out of

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.840 
a block to create a one tick pass out of
this<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.090> bring<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:04.020> tick<00:02:04.200> pads<00:02:04.469> around

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
this and bring this one tick pads around

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.330 
this and bring this one tick pads around
into<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.030> block<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.740> from<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.890> block<00:02:08.160> we

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
into this block and from this block we

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.460 
into this block and from this block we
want<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.610> put<00:02:08.849> two<00:02:09.149> more<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.840> tick<00:02:10.080> repeater

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
want to put two more one tick repeater

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.650 
want to put two more one tick repeater
so<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.830> keep<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.550> wanted<00:02:11.819> parts<00:02:12.120> inside<00:02:12.420> and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
so we keep the wanted parts inside and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.710 
so we keep the wanted parts inside and
put<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.959> into<00:02:13.200> another

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
put it into another

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.870 
put it into another
block<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.110> on<00:02:14.860> both<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.280> those<00:02:15.400> we<00:02:15.610> put

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
block and on both of those we put

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.450 
block and on both of those we put
redstone<00:02:16.150> next<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.320> this<00:02:17.680> redstone<00:02:18.040> we<00:02:18.250> put

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
redstone next to this redstone we put

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.300 
redstone next to this redstone we put
the<00:02:18.760> piston<00:02:19.570> facing<00:02:19.780> upwards<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.800> next<00:02:21.190> to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
the piston facing upwards and next to

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.730 
the piston facing upwards and next to
this<00:02:21.460> one<00:02:21.640> we<00:02:21.790> put<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.300> block<00:02:23.200> on<00:02:23.350> top<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
this one we put a block on top of the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.310 
this one we put a block on top of the
lever<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.280> then<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.150> piston<00:02:25.600> facing<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.170> the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
lever and then a piston facing to the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.230 
lever and then a piston facing to the
site<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.800> if<00:02:26.920> we<00:02:27.070> turn<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.400> on<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.850> can

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
site and if we turn this on you can

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.090 
site and if we turn this on you can
already<00:02:28.480> see<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.780> those<00:02:29.110> two<00:02:29.380> up<00:02:29.560> housing

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
already see that those two up housing

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.580 
already see that those two up housing
always<00:02:30.520> alternating<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.870> first<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.440> have<00:02:35.560> to

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
always alternating so first you have to

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.590 
always alternating so first you have to
build<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.040> frame<00:02:36.250> around<00:02:36.550> your<00:02:36.790> elevator<00:02:37.270> so

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
build the frame around your elevator so

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.720 
build the frame around your elevator so
you<00:02:37.690> can't<00:02:37.930> glitch<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.380> out<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.860> then<00:02:39.610> you

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
you can't glitch it out and then you

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.160 
you can't glitch it out and then you
have<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:39.970> decide<00:02:40.270> how<00:02:40.480> many<00:02:40.660> floors<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.140> want

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
have to decide how many floors you want

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.620 
have to decide how many floors you want
to<00:02:41.500> build<00:02:41.680> we<00:02:42.310> have<00:02:42.460> two<00:02:42.700> right<00:02:42.970> here<00:02:43.240> and<00:02:43.420> the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
to build we have two right here and the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.760 
to build we have two right here and the
maximum<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:44.290> three<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:46.110> twenty<00:02:47.110> cages<00:02:47.590> you

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
maximum is three and twenty cages you

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.460 
maximum is three and twenty cages you
have<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.010> place<00:02:48.270> one<00:02:49.270> block<00:02:49.750> at<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.050> bottom<00:02:50.320> of

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
have to place one block at the bottom of

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.250 
have to place one block at the bottom of
each<00:02:50.620> floor<00:02:51.220> then<00:02:51.640> when<00:02:51.910> one<00:02:52.270> trapdoor<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.020> top

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
block here again now to power up the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.370 
block here again now to power up the
Pistons<00:03:13.330> that<00:03:13.450> we<00:03:13.660> were<00:03:13.750> placed<00:03:14.020> at<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.350> top

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
Pistons that we were placed at the top

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.380 
Pistons that we were placed at the top
to<00:03:14.770> make<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.010> blocks<00:03:15.459> spinning<00:03:16.000> in<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.209> circle

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
to make the blocks spinning in a circle

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.080 
to make the blocks spinning in a circle
we<00:03:17.110> want<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.560> bring<00:03:17.769> this<00:03:17.950> half<00:03:18.760> slab

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
we want to bring this half slab

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.449 
we want to bring this half slab
staircase<00:03:19.989> up<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.680> top<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:21.010> we<00:03:21.100> can<00:03:21.130> place

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
staircase up to the top so we can place

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.310 
staircase up to the top so we can place
the<00:03:21.640> redstone<00:03:21.970> on<00:03:22.030> top<00:03:22.060> therefore<00:03:22.570> just<00:03:23.110> place

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
the redstone on top therefore just place

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.229 
the redstone on top therefore just place
some<00:03:23.500> blocks<00:03:23.680> next<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.370> so<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:24.940> have<00:03:25.090> an

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
some blocks next to it so you have an

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.560 
some blocks next to it so you have an
easier<00:03:25.510> time<00:03:25.840> bringing<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:26.769> up<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.570> then

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
easier time bringing this up and then

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.870 
easier time bringing this up and then
add<00:03:28.840> one<00:03:29.200> space<00:03:29.560> somewhere<00:03:30.430> in<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.580> middle

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
add one space somewhere in the middle

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.810 
add one space somewhere in the middle
you<00:03:31.090> want<00:03:31.300> to<00:03:31.570> stop<00:03:32.440> your<00:03:32.620> half<00:03:33.280> slab<00:03:33.550> Tower

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
you want to stop your half slab Tower

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.449 
you want to stop your half slab Tower
put<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.330> sticky<00:03:34.780> piston<00:03:35.019> with<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:35.800> block<00:03:36.160> on<00:03:36.250> top

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
put a sticky piston with a block on top

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.070 
put a sticky piston with a block on top
because<00:03:36.580> we<00:03:36.880> need<00:03:37.030> another<00:03:37.269> one<00:03:37.540> take<00:03:37.750> paths

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
because we need another one take paths

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.530 
because we need another one take paths
generator<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:39.070> then<00:03:39.820> you<00:03:40.000> can<00:03:40.180> just<00:03:40.390> wire

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
generator and then you can just wire

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.970 
generator and then you can just wire
this<00:03:40.720> up<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.230> person<00:03:41.380> you'll<00:03:41.620> see<00:03:41.800> that

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
this up to the person you'll see that

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.280 
this up to the person you'll see that
red<00:03:42.190> stones<00:03:42.459> going<00:03:42.700> into<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.269> then<00:03:44.019> put

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
red stones going into it then put

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.470 
red stones going into it then put
another<00:03:44.530> block<00:03:44.769> next<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.459> repeater<00:03:46.150> and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
another block next to it a repeater and

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.080 
another block next to it a repeater and
from<00:03:47.350> here<00:03:47.560> on<00:03:47.590> we<00:03:47.980> can<00:03:48.190> then<00:03:48.370> power<00:03:48.670> up<00:03:48.910> our

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
from here on we can then power up our

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.259 
from here on we can then power up our
Pistons<00:03:49.930> so<00:03:50.620> one<00:03:51.130> piston<00:03:51.580> will<00:03:51.880> be<00:03:52.030> sitting

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
Pistons so one piston will be sitting

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.810 
Pistons so one piston will be sitting
right<00:03:52.570> here<00:03:52.600> pushing<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.440> over<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.370> this<00:03:54.760> side

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
right here pushing it over to this side

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.690 
right here pushing it over to this side
and<00:03:55.360> up<00:03:55.900> here<00:03:56.470> we<00:03:56.620> want<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.799> have<00:03:56.980> one<00:03:57.220> that

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
and up here we want to have one that

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.090 
and up here we want to have one that
pushes<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.209> blocks<00:03:58.480> downwards<00:03:59.170> so<00:03:59.620> like<00:03:59.830> this

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
pushes the blocks downwards so like this

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.750 
pushes the blocks downwards so like this
and<00:04:00.510> then<00:04:01.510> as<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:01.810> can<00:04:01.930> see<00:04:02.140> we<00:04:03.130> need<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.400> push

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
and then as you can see we need to push

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.210 
and then as you can see we need to push
power<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.989> piston<00:04:05.350> that<00:04:05.380> faces<00:04:05.830> downwards

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
power the piston that faces downwards

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.650 
power the piston that faces downwards
first<00:04:06.549> so<00:04:06.730> that's<00:04:06.850> good<00:04:07.090> that<00:04:07.239> we<00:04:07.330> brought<00:04:07.540> it

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
first so that's good that we brought it

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.630 
first so that's good that we brought it
to<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.930> other<00:04:08.049> side<00:04:08.170> now<00:04:08.560> because<00:04:09.280> then<00:04:09.519> we

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
to the other side now because then we

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.509 
to the other side now because then we
can<00:04:09.850> just<00:04:09.880> bring<00:04:10.810> up<00:04:10.989> our<00:04:11.170> redstone<00:04:11.560> again<00:04:12.310> in

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
can just bring up our redstone again in

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.400 
can just bring up our redstone again in
a<00:04:13.090> half<00:04:13.690> slip<00:04:14.019> staircase<00:04:14.470> like<00:04:15.250> so<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:16.410> power

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
a half slip staircase like so and power

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.890 
a half slip staircase like so and power
up<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.769> first<00:04:18.010> piston<00:04:18.519> like<00:04:18.910> this<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.359> then

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
up the first piston like this and then

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.370 
up the first piston like this and then
just<00:04:20.229> put<00:04:20.830> some<00:04:21.519> blocks<00:04:21.849> next<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.360> it<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.960> one

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
just put some blocks next to it to one

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.610 
just put some blocks next to it to one
take<00:04:23.590> repeaters<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:25.000> redstone<00:04:25.450> dust

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
take repeaters and a redstone dust

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.800 
take repeaters and a redstone dust
and<00:04:26.710> that's<00:04:27.190> all<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.699> redstone<00:04:28.090> already<00:04:28.600> in

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
and that's all the redstone already in

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.540 
and that's all the redstone already in
place<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:32.020> turn<00:04:32.199> the<00:04:32.440> elevator<00:04:32.860> on<00:04:33.220> for<00:04:33.460> the

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
place to turn the elevator on for the

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.879 
place to turn the elevator on for the
first<00:04:33.729> time<00:04:34.030> you<00:04:34.210> have<00:04:34.389> our<00:04:34.630> dirt<00:04:35.169> block<00:04:35.470> and

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
first time you have our dirt block and

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.820 
first time you have our dirt block and
that<00:04:38.889> piston<00:04:39.490> here<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:40.780> and<00:04:41.139> then<00:04:41.470> you<00:04:41.650> can

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
that piston here so and then you can

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.640 
that piston here so and then you can
click<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.250> lever<00:04:42.430> here<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:43.050> your<00:04:44.050> elevator

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
click the lever here and your elevator

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.030
