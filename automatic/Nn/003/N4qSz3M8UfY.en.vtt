00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 welcome you that beautiful 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.990
 Look back, well , I have one 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.940
 I get a good question about it 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.630
 many useful questions 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.750
 came in 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.099
 that makes me very happy I try too 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.230
 always answer everyone 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.490
 personally, it's not all about everything 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.020
 That's why I'm trying, so to speak 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.580
 to grasp the knowledge together and in the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.619
 I have answered everything from video 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.400
 One hundred percent to the comments I 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.179
 do not need a single yet 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.560
 delete comment which I find very good 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.480
 I think it is just like that show things to 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.820
 censor 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.910
 there I am like the lot 24 or to 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.579
 beach figure the rigorous and stringent 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.690
 Any criticism, so to speak, immediately in the bud 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.059
 want to suffocate 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.379
 I think that's not bad, I think 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.270
 that even have to say so well the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.239
 people, so to speak, a negative 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.309
 example another extreme but if 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.120
 you speak to other people at the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.379
 people pretend it and sticks 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.750
 to form your own opinion 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.430
 I do not know if this is so great that 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.750
 I do not do I invite all paléo 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.939
 people cordially 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.030
 all the people who eat my meat healthy 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.229
 and so on and I have no problem 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.299
 People only have a problem with it 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.630
 if they start when they know 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.909
 Kern that what they are doing shit 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.680
 the thing is 18 10 so you stop 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.390
 many against the wall or contradiction 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.920
 more is possible 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.850
 nothing can really be earned with that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.430
 on the contrary 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.540
 These are simple things so simple 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.000
 living at its best 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.640
 such simple things that everyone practices 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.079
 can and ultimately lead to that 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.180
 you think clearly in my head it for now 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.549
 and ultimately none 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.770
 bock has more from the as nancy greene 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.810
 which demons and the people want 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.509
 sell people times sell all of them 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.509
 possible super powder super food 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.750
 madness protein powder and because the whole 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.060
 stuff and that's why it's automatic 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.950
 all the same I have no 80 den 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.500
 seen the coach does the right thing yes 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.760
 shit i need a political 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.300
 problem 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:11.820
 cacau was now so beautiful 10 would now 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.320
 to ask so it has someone written 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.430
 I will not say the name simply 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.060
 to no one on the necktie to 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.250
 to step 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.440
 hello so I think so very much 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.790
 obvious what you would give of yourself 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.990
 I like to stay in my direction for a long time 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.550
 vegetarian or vegan diet 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.560
 but I have the problem to change 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.050
 that I am very slim though I am 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.320
 that's why it's very high in calories 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.060
 I hesitate so I do not want to 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.760
 but what will be thinner? 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.620
 will be if I only vegetables etc 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.050
 eat fruits or many greetings 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.680
 good question meaningful question sometimes 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.600
 actually gaining problems 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.310
 I have increased to cc after 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.770
 I with the high-fat story with 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.570
 The cocos took about three 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.100
 kilo 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.860
 I also have muscle and so on 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.080
 built there was no problem what 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.610
 It is important as a beginner is on everyone 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.890
 If you count the calories right now 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.270
 as a beginner that's so important because he 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.680
 has no idea at all 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.400
 A lot of calories means you are now 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.510
 really big amount of fruits and vegetables 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.910
 So you had to research what your whole 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.700
 For decades the third is theirs 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.160
 eat eaten volume shrinks and 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.080
 west 43 is eaten and eaten 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.600
 fatty food has the property 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.700
 the name is already very high in calories 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.320
 that means a lot of energy 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.180
 low volume and there are the problem 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.590
 that is over decades decades is one 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.340
 whole digestive tract know 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.300
 highly elastic system is stunted and 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.070
 you have to turn it for now 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.590
 get used and I know you want from zero 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.290
 But that's the way it goes 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.340
 rather slowly because you have more of 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.930
 and then you do that, so to speak 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.019
 sustainable and right not against the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.350
 completely fogged off you just need 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.990
 years and 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.430
 large quantities of fruits and vegetables too 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:02.610
 food is just like that too i had to 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.820
 recognize and with me is still 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.130
 increase potential 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.080
 This is clearly noticeable every week 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.820
 to week you notice per grass where I 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.920
 earlier when the crowd burst 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.230
 am i feeling well today when i am 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.150
 the food and that 's just the point 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.290
 so calorie counting and the whole 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.739
 start slowly 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.500
 if you like high energy life 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.850
 always want to be fully present when you 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.090
 physically if you want to exercise 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.850
 if you are a multitasking manager, so to speak 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.520
 and so on families because then then 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.120
 Do you need good calories and enough 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.900
 from that 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.020
 you are if you are too little, so to speak 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.370
 yes, I could also have a 1800 1700 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.680
 I would get it I would 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.390
 lying on the couch all day and 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.090
 So ball train and so on 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.760
 I could not be right either 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.780
 that's just sitting around like us 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.700
 so beat yourself off 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.770
 nothing tells that people that 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.050
 you reduce your calories or 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.190
 respect but that's the biggest 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.360
 mistakes you can make 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.280
 for me , minimum minimum is 2500 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.040
 calories or do I really have to be sluggish 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.360
 and lazy to the day if you just sport 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.520
 make it then go up quickly 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.160
 goes faster up there, so to speak 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.090
 and you have the right amount of calories once 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.010
 right to mars or bit whole 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.530
 day out and work physically 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.430
 or masters is needed quickly 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.680
 of extra 2000 3000 calories extra and 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.360
 to cover the fruits by creating the 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.000
 I then come not just because 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.790
 already in the cinema and potatoes and 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.770
 Such things just added because the very 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.050
 High energy density has 350 calories 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.259
 on 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.909
 For example, you know exactly when you are 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.289
 if you are enough , nothing can happen 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.300
 the next point of them still quite 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:51.080
 in short we have to start 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.729
 again a healthy relationship to 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.379
 people to the human body too 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.710
 develop to human physiology 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:06:00.409
 and I have not experienced it myself 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:05.030
 self and my environment, so to speak a 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.479
 People then move, so to speak 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.599
 get 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.780
 you are you töre this can not be healthy 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.780
 his 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.330
 the people do not even know anymore 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.190
 what a snake is healthy body 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.129
 70 years ago which not at all 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:26.539
 noticed so fast were there 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:28.819
 all so if you are her if you are so 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.919
 Show me energy I have physically 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:34.009
 be fit when you 're feeling good 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:37.430
 then feel then do not listen to the people 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:40.789
 the people themselves are bloated by the 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:44.360
 Whole proteins are in fat of that 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:46.130
 all understand is that is not 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.900
 clue that is not 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.050
 clue no comparison maybe 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.330
 do you come along then if he does 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.150
 so to speak, how fit they are and how 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:59.060
 much as you should, it is all very very 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:02.479
 subjectively watt per kilogram that's it 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.610
 which is very power per weight and then 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:08.150
 who notice very quickly and 80 c 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.310
 that goes through the ceiling so catches 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.840
 really healthy again once a 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.940
 relationship to the human body too 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.810
 develop that so the second point 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.250
 I would do that 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.250
 Count next to the calories
