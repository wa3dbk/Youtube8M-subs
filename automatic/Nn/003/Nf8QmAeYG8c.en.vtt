00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Almost every day there are important news 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.879
 xbox and playstation 4 we have for 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.710
 you summarized the most important and 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.139
 Welcome to the replica of the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.420
 calendar week 47 my name is raffael 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.160
 and these are our top news nextgen 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.809
 goes away like hot cakes both the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.460
 xbox one as well as the playstation 4 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.680
 have within the first 24 hours 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.420
 this sold over a million times 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.890
 but number does not conceal the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.609
 that the consoles are having problems too 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.260
 have to fight 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.970
 luc holtz or the green 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.560
 Screen of death are just two defects 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.330
 with which the console players fight 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.859
 Especially when the xbox one is the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.780
 list of different errors long 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.360
 but a reboot the console one 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.010
 Silent headset the error 100 or 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.079
 a completely denied an xbox 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.309
 to the already mentioned green screen of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.440
 death to the so-called 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.629
 transformer drive where the drive 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.340
 after inserting one of the very strange 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.140
 noise makes microsoft speaks 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.850
 the same as sony from one 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.199
 very small percentage newest 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.420
 According to rumors, Microsoft is planning 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.340
 Nevertheless, at the beginning of 2014, a new one 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.699
 Revision of the xbox were on the market too 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 bring 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.030
 that leaves a lot of room for maneuver 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.070
 speculation with the power consumption 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.750
 and volume has the xbox were none 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.790
 problems starting points would be that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.650
 comparatively large housing as well as the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.150
 external power supply also changes and 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.720
 production costs would be saved 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.520
 conceivable 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.500
 with all the different mistakes 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.130
 when the xbox when you come a little 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.659
 to ponder 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.310
 these are you out there you have yours 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.439
 xbox one already she has any 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.479
 fault or does it work perfectly 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.150
 down in the comments 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.220
 stay with the xbox one or at 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.619
 your controller has in these 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.930
 Microsoft allegedly 100 million dollars 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.610
 Something was put into the development 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.619
 considered perfect by many 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.600
 can usually be improved rather less 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.610
 the manager for accessories permanent manager too 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.560
 Nevertheless, many called for the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.899
 controller the xbox one for the xbox one 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.790
 review goals microsoft employees 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.200
 thought this crazy as you do now 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.759
 knows the new xbox one 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.560
 controller not changed significantly 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.270
 however, some of them became too 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.100
 Experiments in the development status 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.960
 carried out there were probably hundreds 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.820
 models that were also built underneath 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.460
 controller with screen a touchpad 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.229
 a camera speakers a mini 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.820
 projector and even a copy 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.540
 the various odors are spent 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.280
 could become 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.960
 But all these ideas are aimed at because 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.700
 they either needed too much energy 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.270
 or not appealing to the testers 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.880
 met 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.710
 sony comes with a whole 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.060
 new controller therefore and microsoft 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.460
 stays with well -tried 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.170
 what do you think he is the xbox 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.630
 one controller type or the sony 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.320
 Playstation 4 controller deep down in 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.580
 the comments 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.620
 have you ever already? 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.690
 asked what you have a nextgen console in 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.430
 production costs now we know 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.470
 how much does one actually cost 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.450
 Playstation 4 really is the website 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.550
 information handling service short saas 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.930
 The question has been investigated and has the 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.000
 costs for the production of one 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.000
 Playstation 4 calculates the price 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.430
 at about $ 300 81 usd with sony 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.260
 a profit of 18 US dollars enters 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.610
 in this country it is a few dollars more 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.520
 because the console comes here for 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.500
 the equivalent of $ 400 54 on the 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.690
 but there are also the costs of the market 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.220
 for the inter-trade as a comparison 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.800
 Sony has the launch of the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.230
 playstation 3 in 2006 a loss 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.210
 taken from the 306 dollars in the 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.800
 bulk of the $ 400 console 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.630
 From the house Sony takes the guest in the 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.380
 types of all this with around 100 us 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.260
 dollars 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.160
 the gddr5 memory beats at 88 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.380
 US dollars to book 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.250
 Meanwhile, sony is planning a new bundle of his 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.050
 playstation 4 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.120
 why together with the playstation vita 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.130
 at the next gen console remote play 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.660
 supported to be sold officially 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.920
 the bundle is not yet announced 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.050
 however, have been swearing for a long time 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.310
 such rumors through the internet now 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.930
 are first pictures to the packing 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.790
 surfaced that confirm this 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.130
 The bundle is supposed to be for 500 to 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.040
 550 dollars are sold and still ahead 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.020
 Christmas in the trade 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.030
 381 dollars production costs and 18 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.320
 winning dollar you manzoni he suffer 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.690
 right for your customer that will 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.880
 thought and to the theme of playstation 4 and 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.100
 Playstation again transforms well one 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.020
 vita blog I do not think so already 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.300
 graphics card market which has one the one yes 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.970
 small earthquake triggered on the cpu 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.610
 but market it's something different than 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.290
 in january 2014 one will become the new one 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.480
 position for the mainstream market with 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.790
 the codename kwg publish one 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.080
 amd's updated roadmap shows that 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.540
 you in the coming year in the performance 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.890
 Great to do nothing and no new sxc 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.670
 ps on steam dollar base 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.900
 publish 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.940
 because you do not stop the rumors 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.650
 stubbornly according to which from the 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.010
 withdraw high end market position 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.959
 want 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.670
 it would be possible that amd internet 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.919
 example follows and only processors 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.770
 offer with integrated graphics unit 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.120
 would like to stay where mdr stagnates intel 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.340
 on 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.930
 cycle after intels roadmap it goes for 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.630
 next year with haswell like flash 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.699
 continue on 90 ps on the basis of deer 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.800
 allowed for the second half of 2014 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.690
 At least processors are expected 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.840
 with casa fix the end of the coming 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.449
 year then probably core i7 4 770 k and 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.610
 the 5 46 70 degrees from bread world replaced 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.590
 then I will hope that it 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.780
 somehow creates against the strong 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.340
 to fight competition from intel 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.080
 because if she does not get it 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.900
 it really gets very tight for her 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.910
 on the cpu market for as a little kid 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.050
 I've played with lego and one 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.210
 giant fan of it 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.280
 Maybe this is probably synonymous with the 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.340
 Smartphone possible insofar as you look for 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.110
 so-called project always decides 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.090
 own the latest smartphone 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.860
 for many gis out there almost one 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.960
 but duty is pretty much over time 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.010
 into the money came the idea of ​​dave 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.530
 heckens a modular structure 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.720
 developing a smartphone just right 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.460
 the basic idea instead describes all 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.780
 couple of years, a completely new smartphone 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.789
 you should buy single 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.710
 to buy components and in the form of 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.900
 exchange blocks 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.280
 Google smartphone expert at Motorola 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.229
 took up this idea and 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.880
 developed the project but the 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.830
 Developers stress that there is a free 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.660
 and open hardware platform should be 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.400
 which enables high modular smartphones 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.500
 project a should be in the field of 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.450
 hardware will be what android for software 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.039
 is still such a block though 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.960
 not finished and the 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.010
 There is development at the beginning 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.020
 first progress 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.520
 google has its own with 3d systems 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.740
 first partner for the construction of a 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.479
 production plant found another 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.460
 important step would be now manufacturer 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.110
 like qualcomm or nvidia for the construction of 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.210
 to get components into the boat 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.949
 a smartphone that is personalized 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.970
 put together and according to need 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.740
 can upgrade 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.510
 that is extremely innovative and of it 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.889
 could not have dreamed of massive jobs 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.389
 Now I would like to know about you 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.610
 what do you think that would make you so 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.500
 guess a blog from pick yes or no 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.210
 times down in the comments and that 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.160
 was it with is the calendar week 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.300
 47 if you like it gives us 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.099
 a thumbs up 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.510
 yes and visit us on our 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:22.210
 channel and of course on facebook 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.310
 at www.facebook.com layer world ev 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.380
 like what was on the pin board 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.120
 I will count the days up now 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.979
 my playstation 4 finally at my 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.570
