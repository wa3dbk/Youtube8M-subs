00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
how do you avoid that from happening

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.520 
how do you avoid that from happening
first<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.220> all<00:02:11.370> never<00:02:12.330> bring<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.810> line<00:02:12.989> back

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
first of all never bring the line back

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.380 
first of all never bring the line back
through<00:02:13.799> the

through the
however<00:02:15.390> if<00:02:15.659> you<00:02:15.810> have<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.349> for<00:02:16.560> example<00:02:16.590> if

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
however if you have to for example if

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.949 
however if you have to for example if
you're<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.909> to<00:02:17.970> do<00:02:18.299> maintenance<00:02:18.569> on<00:02:18.900> your

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
you're going to do maintenance on your

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.890 
you're going to do maintenance on your
reel<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.560> remove<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.519> spool<00:02:20.819> there's<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.720> good

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
reel and remove the spool there's a good

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.360 
reel and remove the spool there's a good
chance<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.349> everything<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.010> going<00:02:23.159> to<00:02:23.189> get

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
chance that everything is going to get

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.929 
chance that everything is going to get
out<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.610> sync<00:02:23.909> so<00:02:24.689> how<00:02:24.900> do<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.110> reset<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.939> well

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
out of sync so how do you reset it well

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.380 
out of sync so how do you reset it well
what<00:02:27.329> I<00:02:27.360> do<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.019> replace<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.860> spool<00:02:29.390> insert

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
what I do is I replace the spool insert

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.199 
what I do is I replace the spool insert
it<00:02:30.599> back<00:02:30.780> into<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.200> reel<00:02:31.409> and<00:02:31.849> I<00:02:32.849> start

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
it back into the reel and I start

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.160 
it back into the reel and I start
pulling<00:02:33.450> off<00:02:33.720> line<00:02:35.930> until<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.989> see<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.989> way

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
pulling off line until I see the way

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.949 
pulling off line until I see the way
it's<00:02:40.379> beginning<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.890> come<00:02:41.010> off<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.730> reel<00:02:41.959> okay

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
it's beginning to come off the reel okay

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.460 
it's beginning to come off the reel okay
at<00:02:43.079> this<00:02:43.230> point<00:02:43.430> I've<00:02:44.430> found<00:02:44.970> my<00:02:45.959> winding

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
at this point I've found my winding

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.569 
at this point I've found my winding
point<00:02:47.209> which<00:02:48.209> is<00:02:48.390> right<00:02:48.569> here<00:02:49.129> what<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.280> level

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
point which is right here what the level

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.000 
point which is right here what the level
wind<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:51.480> over<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.049> side<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.739> to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
wind is over to the side so I have to

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.589 
wind is over to the side so I have to
get<00:02:53.159> that<00:02:53.310> level<00:02:53.609> wine<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:54.120> match<00:02:54.299> this

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
get that level wine to match this

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.670 
get that level wine to match this
position<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.319> simply<00:02:56.159> come<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.609> open<00:02:56.940> side

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
position I simply come to the open side

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.539 
position I simply come to the open side
touch<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.889> level<00:02:59.190> wind<00:02:59.450> gear<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:01.220> move<00:03:02.220> the

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
touch the level wind gear and move the

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.770 
touch the level wind gear and move the
level<00:03:02.849> wind<00:03:04.609> to<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:05.730> position<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.329> line<00:03:06.510> is

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
level wind to the position the line is

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.500 
level wind to the position the line is
coming<00:03:07.139> off<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.349> spool<00:03:08.000> then<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.120> can<00:03:09.269> replace

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
coming off the spool then I can replace

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.569 
coming off the spool then I can replace
my<00:03:09.989> side<00:03:10.260> plate<00:03:11.299> everything<00:03:12.299> should<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:12.810> in

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
my side plate everything should be in

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.430 
my side plate everything should be in
sync<00:03:14.579> now<00:03:15.239> they<00:03:15.389> got<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.599> put<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.959> line<00:03:16.139> back

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
sync now they got to put the line back

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:26.839 
sync now they got to put the line back
through<00:03:17.389> the<00:03:18.389> level<00:03:18.660> wine<00:03:18.810> mechanism<00:03:25.849> all

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
through the level wine mechanism all

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.530 
through the level wine mechanism all
right<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.269> now<00:03:27.569> as<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.900> can<00:03:28.199> see<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:30.180> level

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
right and now as you can see the level

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.830 
right and now as you can see the level
line<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.859> line<00:03:32.099> that's<00:03:32.430> on<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.849> reel<00:03:33.030> or
