from the ground or that comes out from

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.040 
from the ground or that comes out from
the<00:00:40.410> wall<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.920> my<00:00:40.950> case<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.760> right<00:00:42.000> here<00:00:42.390> now

the wall in my case it is right here now

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.200 
the wall in my case it is right here now
to<00:00:43.110> ensure<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.820> correct

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
to ensure that it is the correct

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.600 
to ensure that it is the correct
plumbing<00:00:46.079> pipe<00:00:46.320> or<00:00:46.530> plumbing<00:00:46.890> line<00:00:47.070> you're

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
plumbing pipe or plumbing line you're

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.069 
plumbing pipe or plumbing line you're
just<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.000> double<00:00:48.329> check<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.629> it

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
just going to double check that it

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.880 
just going to double check that it
connects<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.460> way<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.469> toilet<00:00:52.469> tank

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
connects all the way to the toilet tank

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.459 
connects all the way to the toilet tank
so<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
so you can see that I here have a

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.220 
so you can see that I here have a
plumbing<00:00:56.100> pipe<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.480> connected<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
plumbing pipe that is connected to a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380 
plumbing pipe that is connected to a
steel<00:00:58.620> braided<00:00:58.980> line<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.820> connects<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
steel braided line that connects to the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.049 
steel braided line that connects to the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
toilet to the toilet tank so I know that

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.929 
toilet to the toilet tank so I know that
this<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> correct<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.430> will<00:01:05.610> see

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
this is the correct one now you will see

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.070 
this is the correct one now you will see
some<00:01:06.810> sort<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.200> knob<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:09.030> plumbing<00:01:09.900> line

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
some sort of knob on that plumbing line

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.219 
some sort of knob on that plumbing line
and<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.409> knob<00:01:10.920> will<00:01:11.220> sort<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:12.229> connected

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and that knob will sort of be connected

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.590 
and that knob will sort of be connected
to<00:01:13.409> both<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:13.979> steel<00:01:14.549> braided<00:01:14.880> line<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
to both the the steel braided line and

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.749 
to both the the steel braided line and
the<00:01:15.869> plumbing<00:01:16.140> pipe<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.040> you'll<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> knob

again<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:49.140> simply<00:01:49.320> go<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.890> exact<00:01:50.280> same

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
again you simply go to that exact same

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.670 
again you simply go to that exact same
knob<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.030> then<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.780> rotate<00:01:52.500> it

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
knob and then you rotate it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.530 
knob and then you rotate it
counterclockwise<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.970> will<00:01:54.090> open<00:01:54.270> up

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
counterclockwise and that will open up

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.800 
counterclockwise and that will open up
the<00:01:54.600> lines<00:01:55.020> again<00:01:55.409> now<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.180> unfortunate

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the lines again now in the unfortunate

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.490 
the lines again now in the unfortunate
case<00:01:58.909> where<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.210> does<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.689> stop<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.259> water

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
case where this does not stop the water

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.990 
case where this does not stop the water
supply<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.950> your<00:02:02.100> toilet<00:02:02.280> let's<00:02:02.640> say<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.820> have

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
supply to your toilet let's say you have

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.609 
supply to your toilet let's say you have
a<00:02:03.090> faulty<00:02:03.689> knob<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.829> our<00:02:05.340> faulty<00:02:05.759> valve<00:02:06.000> and

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
a faulty knob and our faulty valve and

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.559 
a faulty knob and our faulty valve and
you<00:02:07.619> turn<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.099> clockwise<00:02:08.399> all<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.030> way<00:02:09.179> and

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
you turn it clockwise all the way and

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.840 
you turn it clockwise all the way and
the<00:02:09.720> water<00:02:09.989> supply<00:02:10.590> still<00:02:11.459> ends<00:02:12.450> up

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
the water supply still ends up

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.790 
the water supply still ends up
going<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.210> your<00:02:13.300> toilet<00:02:13.630> then<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.530> will<00:02:14.650> have

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
going to your toilet then you will have

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.760 
going to your toilet then you will have
to<00:02:14.980> locate<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.820> main<00:02:16.210> water<00:02:16.870> line<00:02:17.020> in<00:02:17.470> your

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
to locate the main water line in your

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.460 
to locate the main water line in your
house<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.510> what<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.900> main<00:02:20.110> water

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
house so this is what the main water

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.160 
house so this is what the main water
line<00:02:20.650> from<00:02:21.220> my<00:02:21.430> house<00:02:21.700> looks<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:22.930> if<00:02:23.050> I

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
line from my house looks like so if I

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.440 
line from my house looks like so if I
was<00:02:23.320> in<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.470> situation<00:02:24.190> where<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.790> turned<00:02:25.210> off

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
was in a situation where I turned off

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.300 
was in a situation where I turned off
the<00:02:25.480> valve<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.290> connects<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.890> toilet

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
the valve that connects to the toilet

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.190 
the valve that connects to the toilet
and<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.580> water<00:02:27.820> continued<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.750> get<00:02:28.960> to<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
and the water continued to get to the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.320 
and the water continued to get to the
toilet<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.740> would<00:02:30.160> come<00:02:30.430> down<00:02:30.460> here<00:02:30.670> in<00:02:31.120> my

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
toilet I would come down here in my

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330 
toilet I would come down here in my
basement<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:32.020> I<00:02:32.290> would<00:02:32.440> turn<00:02:32.710> that<00:02:32.770> knob

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
basement and I would turn that knob

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.190 
basement and I would turn that knob
right<00:02:33.700> there<00:02:33.760> which<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.690> knob<00:02:34.960> that<00:02:34.990> is

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
right there which is a knob that is

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.040 
right there which is a knob that is
connected<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.950> main<00:02:36.190> water<00:02:36.880> line<00:02:37.060> that

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
connected to the main water line that

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.140 
connected to the main water line that
comes<00:02:38.320> into<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.740> house<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.700> would<00:02:39.880> stop

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
comes into the house and that would stop

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.230 
comes into the house and that would stop
water<00:02:40.870> from<00:02:41.350> all<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:42.190> water<00:02:42.430> from<00:02:42.790> coming

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
water from all the water from coming

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.090 
water from all the water from coming
into<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.660> household<00:02:43.960> all<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.530> pipes<00:02:44.800> all

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
into the household all of the pipes all

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.070 
into the household all of the pipes all
of<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.730> water<00:02:45.940> pipes<00:02:46.270> in<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.540> house<00:02:46.660> would<00:02:46.900> no

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
of the water pipes in the house would no

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.380 
of the water pipes in the house would no
longer<00:02:47.110> have<00:02:47.590> any<00:02:47.830> water<00:02:48.160> going<00:02:48.910> through<00:02:49.180> them

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
longer have any water going through them

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.030 
longer have any water going through them
which<00:02:49.600> would<00:02:49.780> obviously<00:02:50.140> include<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.830> pipe

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
which would obviously include the pipe

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.230 
which would obviously include the pipe
that<00:02:51.280> goes<00:02:51.490> to<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.760> toilet<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:54.310> basically<00:02:54.820> if

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
that goes to the toilet so basically if

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.780 
that goes to the toilet so basically if
you<00:02:55.420> need<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.870> stop<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.410> water<00:02:56.650> supply<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
you need to stop the water supply to the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.510 
you need to stop the water supply to the
toilet<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.930> are<00:02:59.260> going<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.620> look<00:02:59.800> for<00:02:59.860> a<00:03:00.190> knob

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
toilet you are going to look for a knob

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.850 
toilet you are going to look for a knob
just<00:03:00.910> like<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:01.450> one<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:02.170> connects<00:03:02.620> the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
just like this one that connects the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.950 
just like this one that connects the
pipe<00:03:03.100> that<00:03:03.340> comes<00:03:03.640> from<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.030> ground<00:03:04.180> or<00:03:04.690> wall

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
pipe that comes from the ground or wall

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.950 
pipe that comes from the ground or wall
to<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:06.070> steel<00:03:06.460> braided<00:03:06.850> line<00:03:07.270> that<00:03:07.600> goes<00:03:07.750> to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
to the steel braided line that goes to

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.410 
to the steel braided line that goes to
the<00:03:08.080> toilet<00:03:08.290> tank<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:09.000> you're<00:03:10.000> going<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.210> turn

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
the toilet tank and you're going to turn

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.720 
the toilet tank and you're going to turn
it<00:03:10.600> clockwise<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:11.350> cut<00:03:11.980> off<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.280> water<00:03:12.490> supply

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.580 
it clockwise to cut off the water supply
and<00:03:13.300> then<00:03:13.840> you're<00:03:14.110> going<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.290> turn<00:03:14.440> it

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
and then you're going to turn it

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.710 
and then you're going to turn it
counterclockwise<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.940> start<00:03:16.270> that<00:03:16.450> water

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
counterclockwise to start that water

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.960 
counterclockwise to start that water
supply<00:03:17.170> up<00:03:17.350> again<00:03:17.680> now<00:03:18.250> in<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.520> unfortunate

event<00:03:20.100> where<00:03:21.100> this<00:03:21.580> does<00:03:21.850> not<00:03:21.970> work<00:03:22.240> let's<00:03:22.690> say

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
event where this does not work let's say

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.660
