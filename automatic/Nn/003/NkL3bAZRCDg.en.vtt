card<00:00:29.099> I've<00:00:29.250> come<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.519> trying<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> play<00:00:30.119> with

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
card I've come in trying to play with

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.490 
card I've come in trying to play with
this<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.359> little<00:00:30.420> bit<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.779> balance<00:00:31.080> card<00:00:31.260> feels

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
this a little bit the balance card feels

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500 
this a little bit the balance card feels
a<00:00:31.679> little<00:00:31.920> tough<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.520> pull<00:00:32.820> out<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> little

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
a little tough to pull out and a little

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.380 
a little tough to pull out and a little
bit<00:00:33.719> flimsier<00:00:34.230> than<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.530> Canon<00:00:34.829> 580<00:00:35.219> x2<00:00:35.760> which

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
bit flimsier than the Canon 580 x2 which

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.560 
bit flimsier than the Canon 580 x2 which
is<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> use<00:00:36.930> primarily<00:00:37.350> for<00:00:37.590> weddings

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
is what I use primarily for weddings

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.790 
is what I use primarily for weddings
that's<00:00:39.570> not<00:00:39.780> really<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> big<00:00:40.140> deal<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.350> me<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
that's not really a big deal to me the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.229 
that's not really a big deal to me the
construction<00:00:41.309> looks<00:00:41.370> pretty<00:00:41.640> good

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
construction looks pretty good

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.970 
construction looks pretty good
the<00:00:42.600> way<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> batteries<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.590> mounted<00:00:43.710> are

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the way the batteries are mounted are

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.979 
the way the batteries are mounted are
kind<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.219> funny<00:00:44.539> kind<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.600> show<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.780> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
kind of funny kind of show you this

kind of funny kind of show you this
there<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.500> there<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.180> kind<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.239> staggered

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
there and there so kind of staggered

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.180 
there and there so kind of staggered
it's<00:00:48.899> interesting<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.559> don't<00:00:49.620> know<00:00:49.890> why<00:00:50.039> they

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
it's interesting I don't know why they

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.950 
it's interesting I don't know why they
did<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:50.670> nothing<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.570> can't<00:00:51.600> live

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960

also when you turn it off it goes Y in

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.599 
also when you turn it off it goes Y in
568<00:01:00.960> off<00:01:01.140> something<00:01:01.949> kind<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.219> cool<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.460> don't

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you fire unless if I can focus the thing

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.530 
you fire unless if I can focus the thing
it's<00:01:20.640> kind<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.850> nice<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.180> let<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.509> that

your<00:01:30.210> batteries<00:01:30.630> are<00:01:30.659> charged<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.409> couple

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
your batteries are charged so a couple

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.170 
your batteries are charged so a couple
of<00:01:32.189> things<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.460> noticed<00:01:32.790> right<00:01:32.909> out<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
of things I noticed right out of the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.890 
of things I noticed right out of the
gate<00:01:33.530> it's<00:01:34.530> very<00:01:34.740> simple<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.189> use<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:36.240> ETTL

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
gate it's very simple to use the ETTL

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.420 
gate it's very simple to use the ETTL
works<00:01:37.140> great<00:01:37.530> I've<00:01:37.740> done<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> couple<00:01:38.070> test

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
works great I've done a couple test

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.560 
works great I've done a couple test
shots<00:01:38.640> around<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> house<00:01:39.150> something<00:01:39.509> I'm

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
shots around the house something I'm

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.550

that the old batch of wine 6 22s that I

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.970 
that the old batch of wine 6 22s that I
