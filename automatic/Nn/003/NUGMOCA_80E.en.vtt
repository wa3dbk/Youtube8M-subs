00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
kind of noticeable but you know what I

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.179 
kind of noticeable but you know what I
overlooked<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.380> he<00:01:49.380> was<00:01:49.470> very<00:01:49.649> hard<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> come

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
overlooked it he was very hard to come

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.910 
overlooked it he was very hard to come
by<00:01:50.340> when<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> first<00:01:50.790> got<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.149> figure<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.890> I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
by when I first got this figure so I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.679 
by when I first got this figure so I
paid<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> little<00:01:53.340> more<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.880> him<00:01:53.970> everything

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
paid a little more for him everything

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.370 
paid a little more for him everything
now<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.530> think<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.159> find<00:01:56.369> him<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:57.380> bit

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
now I think you can find him a bit

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.039 
now I think you can find him a bit
easier<00:01:58.409> but<00:01:59.149> to<00:02:00.149> get<00:02:00.299> more<00:02:00.479> into<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.810> figure

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
