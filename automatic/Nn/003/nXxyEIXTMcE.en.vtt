a good idea because otherwise sometimes

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.889 
a good idea because otherwise sometimes
it<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:35.760> look<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.000> bit<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> jumble<00:00:36.660> sale

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
something with stripes on lately but I

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.640 
something with stripes on lately but I
don't<00:01:20.430> know<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.689> looked<00:01:21.930> right<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.470> me

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.130 
don't know just not looked right on me
and<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.240> pleased<00:01:24.450> with<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.810> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and so I was really pleased with this it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600 
looks really nice jeans and black boots
but<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.290> think<00:01:28.500> it'll<00:01:28.650> look<00:01:28.770> nice<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.189> well<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.460> i

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
but I think it'll look nice as well as i

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.340 
but I think it'll look nice as well as i
thought<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> scooter<00:01:30.420> scale<00:01:30.659> something<00:01:31.200> in

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
thought the scooter scale something in

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.050 
thought the scooter scale something in
the<00:01:31.439> spring<00:01:31.710> when<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.950> weather<00:01:32.159> warms<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.700> if

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the spring when the weather warms up if

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.569 
the spring when the weather warms up if
it<00:01:33.630> warms<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.380> England<00:01:34.770> fingers

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
it warms up here in England fingers

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.850 
it warms up here in England fingers
cross<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:37.079> don't<00:01:37.229> really<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.680> i

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
cross and but don't really like this i

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.640 
cross and but don't really like this i
think<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.130> was<00:01:38.189> about<00:01:38.310> eight<00:01:38.820> pounds<00:01:39.560> not<00:01:40.560> one

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
think it was about eight pounds not one

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.140 
think it was about eight pounds not one
hundred<00:01:40.710> percent<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.250> max<00:01:41.430> i<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.759> taken<00:01:42.060> the

of an iron this does look really nice on
it's<00:02:58.340> quite<00:02:58.520> basic<00:02:58.760> but<00:02:59.240> at<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.510> back<00:02:59.830> it's

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
it's quite basic but at the back it's

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.680 
it's quite basic but at the back it's
got<00:03:01.040> these<00:03:01.160> lovely<00:03:01.370> pleats<00:03:01.880> down<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.480> back

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
and chiffon pleats and I think that's

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.970 
and chiffon pleats and I think that's

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
what makes it really looks really nice

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.410 
what makes it really looks really nice
with<00:03:07.250> jeans<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:08.830> kind<00:03:09.830> of<00:03:10.060> casual<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.180> front

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
with jeans and kind of casual the front

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.210 
with jeans and kind of casual the front
but<00:03:11.600> a<00:03:11.630> bit<00:03:11.780> dressy<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.350> back<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:12.890> looks<00:03:12.920> a

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
but a bit dressy the back and it looks a

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.930 
but a bit dressy the back and it looks a
lot<00:03:13.340> more<00:03:13.400> expensive<00:03:13.790> then<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:15.320> is<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.070> it<00:03:16.820> was

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
lot more expensive then it is and it was

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.960 
lot more expensive then it is and it was
10<00:03:17.270> pounds<00:03:17.780> which<00:03:17.870> really<00:03:18.320> is<00:03:18.620> more<00:03:18.850> maybe<00:03:19.850> as

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
10 pounds which really is more maybe as

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.970 
10 pounds which really is more maybe as
a<00:03:20.000> bit<00:03:20.330> expensive<00:03:20.510> for<00:03:20.810> Primark<00:03:21.410> but<00:03:21.739> I<00:03:21.800> think

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
a bit expensive for Primark but I think

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.250 
a bit expensive for Primark but I think
it's<00:03:22.100> worth<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.610> because<00:03:22.640> this<00:03:23.570> pleats<00:03:23.959> at<00:03:24.170> the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
it's worth it because this pleats at the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.050 
it's worth it because this pleats at the
back<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.470> really<00:03:24.890> pretty<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.640> they<00:03:25.760> did<00:03:25.910> have

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
back is really pretty and they did have

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.880 
back is really pretty and they did have
it<00:03:26.150> in<00:03:26.239> black<00:03:26.390> as<00:03:26.660> well<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.110> I<00:03:27.470> think<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.739> might

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
it in black as well and I think I might

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.260 
it in black as well and I think I might
have<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.070> go<00:03:28.280> back<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.760> get<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:28.940> black<00:03:29.090> one

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
have to go back and get the black one

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.760 
have to go back and get the black one
because<00:03:29.540> it's<00:03:29.690> really<00:03:29.810> nice<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.140> easy<00:03:30.560> to

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
because it's really nice and easy to

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:37.420 
because it's really nice and easy to
laugh<00:03:31.300> the<00:03:32.300> next<00:03:32.900> thing<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.709> got<00:03:34.250> was<00:03:36.190> pajamas<00:03:37.190> I

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560
