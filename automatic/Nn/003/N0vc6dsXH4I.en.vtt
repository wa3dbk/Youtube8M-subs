discussion about the nexus one whether

people saying that it's been disabled

enabled<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.279> UK<00:00:26.970> models<00:00:27.330> now<00:00:27.990> we're<00:00:28.380> pretty

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
enabled on UK models now we're pretty

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.250 
enabled on UK models now we're pretty
sure<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:30.269> were<00:00:30.420> pretty<00:00:30.630> sure<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
sure that we were pretty sure that the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.380 
sure that we were pretty sure that the
device<00:00:31.500> itself<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.130> hardware<00:00:32.550> was<00:00:33.059> capable

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
device itself the hardware was capable

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.090 
device itself the hardware was capable
of<00:00:33.660> multi-touch<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.620> certainly<00:00:34.800> know

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
of multi-touch and we certainly know

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.650 
of multi-touch and we certainly know
that<00:00:35.130> android<00:00:35.790> OS<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.300> capable<00:00:36.600> of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
that android OS is capable of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.569 
that android OS is capable of
multi-touch<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.040> was<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> little<00:00:38.309> bit<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.520> a

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
multi-touch so it was a little bit of a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.209 
multi-touch so it was a little bit of a
surprise<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.200> the<00:00:40.200> device<00:00:40.500> when<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.920> started

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
surprise that the device when it started

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.299 
surprise that the device when it started
shipping<00:00:41.430> didn't<00:00:41.910> support<00:00:42.090> multitouch<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
shipping didn't support multitouch and

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.740 
shipping didn't support multitouch and
out<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.520> box<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.969> actual<00:00:45.270> fact<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.570> doesn't

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
out of the box in actual fact it doesn't

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.990 
out of the box in actual fact it doesn't
support<00:00:46.079> multitouch<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:46.829> i<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.940> to

support multitouch if i can just go to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.650 
support multitouch if i can just go to
the<00:00:48.210> standard<00:00:48.750> browser<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.379> maybe<00:00:49.770> go<00:00:50.039> to

video the pages and the web browser are
exceptionally<00:01:01.109> fast<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.620> renders<00:01:01.920> very<00:01:02.129> very

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
exceptionally fast it renders very very

quickly so this is our site and as you
can<00:01:05.729> see<00:01:05.760> using<00:01:06.510> two<00:01:06.720> fingers<00:01:06.930> has<00:01:07.740> absolutely

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
can see using two fingers has absolutely

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.660 
can see using two fingers has absolutely
no<00:01:08.220> effect<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:09.090> will<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.330> scroll<00:01:10.130> but<00:01:11.130> using

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
no effect it will just scroll but using

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.090 
no effect it will just scroll but using
two<00:01:11.820> fingers<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.390> pinch<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.930> zoom<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:14.010> out

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
two fingers for pinch to zoom in and out

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.460 
two fingers for pinch to zoom in and out
pinch<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.670> pull<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:15.450> don't<00:01:15.630> work<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:16.350> up

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
pinch and pull just don't work going up

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.590 
pinch and pull just don't work going up
and<00:01:16.619> rotate<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> browser<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.420> just

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and rotate the browser and it just

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.359 
and rotate the browser and it just
doesn't<00:01:18.869> work<00:01:18.990> nothing<00:01:19.560> actually<00:01:19.860> happens

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
doesn't work nothing actually happens

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.730 
doesn't work nothing actually happens
unfortunately<00:01:20.810> which<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.200> bit<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.470> shame

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
unfortunately which is a bit of a shame

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.090 
unfortunately which is a bit of a shame
I<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:23.189> there's<00:01:23.490> two<00:01:23.729> places<00:01:23.850> where<00:01:25.100> zoom

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I think there's two places where zoom

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.670 
I think there's two places where zoom
boom<00:01:26.520> multi-touch<00:01:27.360> will<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.650> useful

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
boom multi-touch will be very useful

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.490 
boom multi-touch will be very useful
with<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.340> pinch<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.030> zoom<00:01:30.350> certainly<00:01:31.350> within

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
with the pinch to zoom certainly within

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.660 
with the pinch to zoom certainly within
the<00:01:31.590> web<00:01:31.740> browser<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.189> certainly<00:01:32.490> within

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the web browser and certainly within

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.730 
the web browser and certainly within
maps<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.240> zooming<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.020> general<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.500> very

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
maps and zooming in general is very

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.370 
maps and zooming in general is very
useful<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.369> two<00:01:35.850> fingers<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.450> think<00:01:36.659> many

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
useful with two fingers I think many

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.840 
useful with two fingers I think many
people<00:01:37.740> kind<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.250> come<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.520> accept<00:01:38.579> that

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
people kind of just come to accept that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.179 
people kind of just come to accept that
as<00:01:39.060> being<00:01:39.240> pretty<00:01:40.229> much<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> standard<00:01:40.740> feature

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
as being pretty much a standard feature

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.219 
as being pretty much a standard feature
other<00:01:42.000> handsets<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.750> certainly<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
other handsets do it certainly the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.030 
other handsets do it certainly the
iphone<00:01:43.619> office<00:01:44.340> does<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.729> pinch<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.149> zoom<00:01:45.180> so

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
iphone office does the pinch to zoom so

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.160 
iphone office does the pinch to zoom so
so<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.130> actual<00:01:47.369> fact<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:48.000> handset<00:01:48.689> hardware

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
so in actual fact the handset hardware

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.060 
so in actual fact the handset hardware
and<00:01:49.439> os<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.820> support<00:01:51.149> multitouch<00:01:51.770> it's<00:01:52.770> just

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and os do support multitouch it's just

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.230 
and os do support multitouch it's just
that<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> applications<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.090> been

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
that the applications that have been

I then use two fingers I can actually

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.899 
I then use two fingers I can actually
zoom<00:02:36.180> out<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.280> zoo<00:02:38.280> mean<00:02:38.489> it's<00:02:38.700> quite

zoom out and zoo mean it's quite

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.539 
zoom out and zoo mean it's quite

movement if your fingers in order to

movement if your fingers in order to
actually<00:02:43.769> do<00:02:44.099> that<00:02:44.420> but<00:02:45.420> also<00:02:46.109> you<00:02:46.319> can<00:02:46.470> scroll

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
actually do that but also you can scroll

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.759 
actually do that but also you can scroll
and<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.459> zoom<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.260> out<00:02:49.260> using<00:02:49.530> two

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.539 
and you can zoom in and out using two
fingers<00:02:50.299> rotating<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.390> display<00:02:51.750> also<00:02:52.549> he

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
fingers rotating the display also he

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.280 
fingers rotating the display also he
rotates<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> image<00:02:54.299> on<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.450> screen<00:02:54.629> and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
rotates the image on the screen and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.250 
rotates the image on the screen and
again<00:02:55.769> zoom<00:02:56.370> does<00:02:56.609> work<00:02:56.879> in<00:02:57.720> actual<00:02:58.019> fact<00:02:58.049> I

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
again zoom does work in actual fact I

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.539 
again zoom does work in actual fact I
have<00:02:58.409> found<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.680> dolphin<00:02:59.099> browser<00:02:59.190> does

have found that dolphin browser does

the<00:03:26.970> operating<00:03:27.299> system<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:28.079> just

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
the operating system it's just

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.379 
the operating system it's just
unfortunately<00:03:29.010> at<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.370> moment<00:03:29.400> the

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
unfortunately at the moment the

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.210 
unfortunately at the moment the
installed<00:03:30.750> applications<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:31.620> browser<00:03:31.859> and

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
installed applications the browser and

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.210 
installed applications the browser and
the<00:03:32.370> maps<00:03:32.549> don't<00:03:33.239> support<00:03:33.629> multitouch<00:03:34.220> let's

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
the maps don't support multitouch let's

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.890 
the maps don't support multitouch let's
hope<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:35.910> then<00:03:36.150> later<00:03:36.480> supported

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
hope that that is then later supported

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.229 
hope that that is then later supported
with<00:03:37.260> peps<00:03:37.530> an<00:03:37.680> add-on<00:03:37.829> for<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:38.879> rails<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.180> the
