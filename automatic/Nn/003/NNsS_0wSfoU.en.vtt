this isn't really a great demo of what
people<00:00:04.859> are<00:00:04.950> actually<00:00:05.130> using<00:00:05.490> virtual

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
people are actually using virtual

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.030 
people are actually using virtual
machines<00:00:06.359> for<00:00:06.629> but<00:00:06.930> it's<00:00:07.080> still<00:00:07.259> fun<00:00:07.560> so<00:00:07.980> I'm

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
stupid virtual pc tricks so I mentioned

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.209 
stupid virtual pc tricks so I mentioned
that<00:00:12.960> we're<00:00:13.139> working<00:00:13.290> right<00:00:13.620> now<00:00:13.650> on<00:00:13.799> this

back to a previous Colonel some of you
are<00:00:42.090> probably<00:00:42.210> even<00:00:42.480> too<00:00:42.690> young<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.050> remember

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
are probably even too young to remember

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.560 
are probably even too young to remember
windows<00:00:43.770> three<00:00:44.160> windows<00:00:46.160> 3135<00:00:47.160> yeah<00:00:47.760> 35<00:00:48.120> was

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
windows three windows 3135 yeah 35 was

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.110 
windows three windows 3135 yeah 35 was
the<00:00:48.719> first<00:00:48.989> NT<00:00:49.829> version<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> colonel<00:00:51.030> the

the first NT version of the colonel the

first modern kernel that was

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.130 
first modern kernel that was
incorporated<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:53.879> does<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.960> when

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
incorporated in when does this is when

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.560 
incorporated in when does this is when
windows<00:00:55.710> NT<00:00:56.039> 4<00:00:56.430> which<00:00:56.940> some<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.360> might

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
windows NT 4 which some of you might

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.840 
windows NT 4 which some of you might
remember<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:59.100> running<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.550> virtual

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.990 
remember and it's running in a virtual
machine<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.949> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> has<00:01:02.340> some<00:01:02.879> of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
machine and you can see it has some of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
machine and you can see it has some of
the<00:01:03.030> same<00:01:03.329> feel<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.350> today's<00:01:04.619> operating

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the same feel of today's operating

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.859 
the same feel of today's operating
system<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:08.210> it's<00:01:09.210> running<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.630> virtual

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
machine and for those of you who have

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.690 
machine and for those of you who have
used<00:01:12.000> products<00:01:12.720> virtual<00:01:13.229> pc<00:01:13.530> or<00:01:13.830> vmware<00:01:14.460> or

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
used products virtual pc or vmware or

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
used products virtual pc or vmware or
other<00:01:15.240> similar<00:01:15.659> products<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
other similar products you know that you

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.050 
other similar products you know that you
can<00:01:16.710> very<00:01:16.860> quickly<00:01:16.979> save<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.670> state<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.880> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
can very quickly save the state of a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.570 
can very quickly save the state of a
virtual<00:01:18.390> machine<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.020> disk<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.560> reload<00:01:20.430> it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
virtual machine to disk and reload it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.300 
virtual machine to disk and reload it
back<00:01:20.759> from<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> point<00:01:21.360> where<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.920> stopped

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
back from the point where it it stopped

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.819 
back from the point where it it stopped
so<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> pretty<00:01:24.450> cool<00:01:24.720> trick<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.799> is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
so that's a pretty cool trick so this is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.240 
so that's a pretty cool trick so this is
windows<00:01:29.640> 311<00:01:30.479> which<00:01:31.470> some<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.070> may

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
windows 311 which some of you may

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
windows 311 which some of you may
remember<00:01:32.750> probably<00:01:33.750> not<00:01:33.930> fondly<00:01:35.960> it<00:01:36.960> happens

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
remember probably not fondly it happens

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.789 
remember probably not fondly it happens
to<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.560> an<00:01:37.920> application<00:01:38.549> installed<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.600> it

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
to have an application installed on it

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.810 
to have an application installed on it
that<00:01:40.799> some<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.250> may<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.490> heard<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:43.820> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
that some of you may have heard of it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.940 
that some of you may have heard of it
wants<00:01:45.060> me<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> make<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> backup<00:01:48.439> so<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.710> that

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
wants me to make a backup so that that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.100 
wants me to make a backup so that that
was<00:01:50.100> not<00:01:50.250> necessarily<00:01:51.090> Microsoft's<00:01:51.720> proudest

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
was not necessarily Microsoft's proudest

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.580 
was not necessarily Microsoft's proudest
moment<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.790> but<00:01:53.790> windows<00:01:54.720> 3<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.290> really

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
moment there but windows 3 was really

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.520 
moment there but windows 3 was really
the<00:01:55.770> third<00:01:56.100> rev<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.729> windows<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.990> lot<00:01:58.409> of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the third rev of windows and a lot of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.530 
the third rev of windows and a lot of
people<00:01:58.649> don't<00:01:58.920> realize<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.420> there<00:02:00.420> were

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
people don't realize that there were

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.120 
people don't realize that there were
actually<00:02:00.780> two<00:02:01.020> versions<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.680> windows<00:02:01.950> before

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
actually two versions of windows before

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.219 
actually two versions of windows before
that<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.640> were<00:02:02.729> not<00:02:02.909> big<00:02:03.420> successes<00:02:03.840> it

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
that that were not big successes it

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.490 
that that were not big successes it
takes<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.740> while<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:06.329> change<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.780> paradigm<00:02:07.200> or

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
takes a while to to change a paradigm or

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.100 
takes a while to to change a paradigm or
two<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:08.069> get<00:02:08.280> people<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> new<00:02:09.750> platform

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
two to get people on to a new platform

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.140 
two to get people on to a new platform
and<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.879> actually<00:02:12.000> have<00:02:12.450> windows<00:02:12.870> too

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
and so I actually have windows too

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.530 
and so I actually have windows too
here<00:02:15.890> now<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.400> was<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.640> bios<00:02:17.940> booting<00:02:18.390> you

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
here now that was the bios booting you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.120 
here now that was the bios booting you
can<00:02:18.780> see<00:02:18.900> how<00:02:19.020> fast<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.470> booted<00:02:19.860> that's

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
can see how fast it booted that's

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.090 
can see how fast it booted that's
windows<00:02:20.550> too<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:22.260> can<00:02:22.410> see<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.680> came<00:02:22.890> with

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
windows too and you can see it came with

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.950 
windows too and you can see it came with
some<00:02:23.280> nice<00:02:23.460> little<00:02:23.700> utility<00:02:23.970> utilities<00:02:24.930> like

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
some nice little utility utilities like

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:34.400 
some nice little utility utilities like
calculator<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.510> there's<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.930> calculator

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
calculator so there's the calculator

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:42.670 
calculator so there's the calculator
functionality<00:02:35.959> can<00:02:36.959> start<00:02:37.290> notepad<00:02:39.200> paint

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.490 

looks<00:02:43.680> just<00:02:43.920> like<00:02:44.040> Photoshop<00:02:44.490> huh<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:49.230> that's

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
looks just like Photoshop huh so that's

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.820 
looks just like Photoshop huh so that's
that<00:02:49.860> was<00:02:50.040> windows<00:02:50.370> too<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.880> actually<00:02:51.120> have

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
that was windows too I actually have

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.330 
that was windows too I actually have
windows<00:02:52.830> one<00:02:53.070> here<00:02:53.340> also<00:02:54.290> this<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:56.160> can

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
windows one here also this one you can

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.370 
windows one here also this one you can
watch<00:02:56.459> how<00:02:56.670> fast<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:57.060> one<00:02:57.270> boots<00:03:00.170> nice<00:03:01.170> and

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
watch how fast this one boots nice and

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.100 
watch how fast this one boots nice and
fast<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:02.820> one<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.150> hard<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.450> navigate<00:03:03.630> in

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
fast this one is hard to navigate in

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.780 
fast this one is hard to navigate in
because<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.470> doesn't<00:03:04.739> know<00:03:04.890> about<00:03:05.010> arrow<00:03:05.370> keys

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
because it doesn't know about arrow keys

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.910 
because it doesn't know about arrow keys
arrow<00:03:06.239> keys<00:03:06.570> weren't<00:03:06.840> on<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.260> keyboards<00:03:07.770> at

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
arrow keys weren't on the keyboards at

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.479 
arrow keys weren't on the keyboards at
the<00:03:08.040> time<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:09.030> also<00:03:09.209> doesn't<00:03:09.450> know<00:03:09.780> about<00:03:09.930> mice

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
the time it also doesn't know about mice

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.990 
the time it also doesn't know about mice
so<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.580> basically<00:03:11.970> have<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.810> type<00:03:13.350> select<00:03:14.000> so

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
so you basically have to type select so

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.050 
so you basically have to type select so
like<00:03:15.420> i'll<00:03:15.570> hit<00:03:15.720> p<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.260> get<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.500> paint<00:03:17.060> so

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
like i'll hit p to get the paint so

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.199 
like i'll hit p to get the paint so
there's<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.519> was<00:03:20.640> windows<00:03:20.970> one

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
there's the so that was windows one

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.100 
there's the so that was windows one
point<00:03:21.480> 0<00:03:22.459> so<00:03:23.459> let<00:03:23.580> me<00:03:23.670> fast<00:03:24.450> forward<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.989> the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
point 0 so let me fast forward to the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.020 
point 0 so let me fast forward to the
future<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.709> i'll<00:03:26.700> show<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:28.760> something<00:03:29.760> that

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
future and i'll show you something that

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.470 
future and i'll show you something that
we<00:03:30.120> did<00:03:30.269> recently<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.890> core<00:03:32.250> of

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
we did recently this is the core of

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.850 
we did recently this is the core of
windows<00:03:33.480> seven<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> collection<00:03:34.650> of

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
windows seven this is a collection of

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.160 
windows seven this is a collection of
components<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.610> we've<00:03:35.790> taken<00:03:36.090> out<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.750> lot<00:03:37.080> of

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
components that we've taken out a lot of

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.600 
components that we've taken out a lot of
people<00:03:37.350> think<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.620> windows<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.250> really

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
people think of windows is this really

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.280 
people think of windows is this really
large<00:03:39.350> bloated<00:03:40.350> operating<00:03:41.010> system<00:03:41.370> and

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
large bloated operating system and

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.780 
large bloated operating system and
that's<00:03:43.290> maybe<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.620> fair<00:03:43.860> characterization<00:03:44.280> I

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
that's maybe a fair characterization I

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.210 
that's maybe a fair characterization I
have<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.030> admit<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:45.989> large<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.739> contains<00:03:47.130> a

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
have to admit it is large it contains a

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.060 
have to admit it is large it contains a
lot<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.579> stuff<00:03:47.850> in<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.170> but<00:03:49.170> at<00:03:49.290> its<00:03:49.440> core<00:03:49.500> the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
lot of stuff in it but at its core the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.490 
lot of stuff in it but at its core the
colonel<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.660> components<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.260> make

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
colonel and the the components that make

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.530 
colonel and the the components that make
up<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:53.010> very<00:03:53.340> core<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.850> operating<00:03:54.239> system

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
up the very core of the operating system

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.560 
up the very core of the operating system
actually<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:55.170> pretty<00:03:55.680> streamlined<00:03:56.570> it's

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
actually is pretty streamlined it's

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.120 
actually is pretty streamlined it's
still<00:03:57.780> bigger<00:03:57.989> than<00:03:58.170> I'd<00:03:58.290> like<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.799> be<00:03:58.950> but

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
still bigger than I'd like it to be but

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.300 
still bigger than I'd like it to be but
we've<00:03:59.850> taken<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.329> shot<00:04:00.739> recently<00:04:01.739> at<00:04:01.980> really

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
we've taken a shot recently at really

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.009 
we've taken a shot recently at really
stripping<00:04:02.730> out<00:04:02.940> all<00:04:03.239> of<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.570> layers<00:04:03.750> above

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
stripping out all of the layers above

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.569 
stripping out all of the layers above
and<00:04:04.410> making<00:04:04.680> making<00:04:04.980> sure<00:04:05.220> that<00:04:05.400> we<00:04:05.459> had<00:04:05.549> a

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
and making making sure that we had a

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.600 
and making making sure that we had a
clean<00:04:05.940> architectural<00:04:06.660> layer<00:04:06.900> there<00:04:07.200> and<00:04:07.610> we

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
clean architectural layer there and we

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.460 
clean architectural layer there and we
created<00:04:08.820> what<00:04:09.090> we<00:04:09.180> call<00:04:09.209> min<00:04:09.600> win<00:04:09.810> this<00:04:10.230> is<00:04:10.350> an

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
created what we call min win this is an

about 25 mags on disk

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.460 
about 25 mags on disk
you<00:04:27.220> compare<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:28.240> four<00:04:28.720> gigs<00:04:29.110> on

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
you compare that to the four gigs on

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.379 
you compare that to the four gigs on

other than text in this particular bill

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.050 
other than text in this particular bill
so<00:04:36.969> you<00:04:37.060> can<00:04:37.210> see<00:04:37.330> that's<00:04:37.509> our<00:04:37.810> windows<00:04:38.199> flag

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
so you can see that's our windows flag

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.339 
so you can see that's our windows flag
this<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.210> running<00:04:40.509> in<00:04:40.689> 40<00:04:41.680> megs<00:04:41.889> of<00:04:42.039> memory<00:04:43.349> so

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
this is running in 40 megs of memory so

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.959 
this is running in 40 megs of memory so
a<00:04:45.990> lot<00:04:46.990> less<00:04:47.229> than<00:04:47.439> your<00:04:47.620> your<00:04:48.159> 2gig<00:04:48.520> machine

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969 
a lot less than your your 2gig machine

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.629 
a lot less than your your 2gig machine
that<00:04:49.150> you're<00:04:49.330> used<00:04:49.539> to<00:04:49.780> and<00:04:50.069> what<00:04:51.069> it<00:04:51.159> has<00:04:51.189> is<00:04:51.610> a

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
that you're used to and what it has is a

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:57.300 
that you're used to and what it has is a
very<00:04:52.060> simple<00:04:55.229> has<00:04:56.229> a<00:04:56.259> very<00:04:56.650> simple<00:04:56.949> HTTP

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
very simple has a very simple HTTP

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.260 
very simple has a very simple HTTP
server<00:04:58.030> running<00:04:58.270> inside<00:04:58.689> of<00:04:58.870> it<00:04:59.879> so<00:05:00.879> if<00:05:01.090> this

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
server running inside of it so if this

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:15.080 
server running inside of it so if this
works<00:05:01.599> I<00:05:01.930> should<00:05:02.199> be<00:05:02.349> able<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:05.099> talk<00:05:06.099> to<00:05:06.340> it

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.970 

and<00:05:15.240> so<00:05:15.720> you<00:05:15.840> can<00:05:16.110> see<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:16.919> HTTP<00:05:17.490> server<00:05:17.730> is<00:05:17.970> is

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
and so you can see the HTTP server is is

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.860 
and so you can see the HTTP server is is
not<00:05:19.980> very<00:05:20.220> full-featured<00:05:20.490> is<00:05:21.060> designed<00:05:21.720> to

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
not very full-featured is designed to

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.379 
not very full-featured is designed to
just<00:05:22.050> spit<00:05:22.290> out<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.770> task<00:05:23.160> list<00:05:23.580> you<00:05:24.120> can<00:05:24.270> see

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
just spit out the task list you can see

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.510 
just spit out the task list you can see
this<00:05:24.510> very<00:05:24.750> very<00:05:25.470> small<00:05:25.710> number<00:05:26.010> of<00:05:26.040> tasks

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
this very very small number of tasks

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.350 
this very very small number of tasks
running<00:05:26.699> on<00:05:27.000> there<00:05:28.580> there's<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.669> total<00:05:30.030> list<00:05:30.210> of

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
running on there there's a total list of

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.000 
running on there there's a total list of
the<00:05:30.449> files<00:05:30.720> that<00:05:30.990> make<00:05:31.350> up<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.800> system

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
the files that make up the system

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.360 
the files that make up the system
there's<00:05:32.610> about<00:05:33.150> a<00:05:33.210> hundred<00:05:33.300> files<00:05:33.810> total

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
there's about a hundred files total

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.650 
there's about a hundred files total
compare<00:05:35.370> that<00:05:35.490> to<00:05:35.550> about<00:05:35.790> the<00:05:35.970> five<00:05:36.180> thousand

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
compare that to about the five thousand

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.680 
compare that to about the five thousand
files<00:05:36.870> that<00:05:37.199> make<00:05:37.350> up<00:05:37.560> all<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:37.770> Windows<00:05:38.220> and

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
files that make up all of Windows and

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.750 
files that make up all of Windows and
then<00:05:39.690> here's<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.020> memory<00:05:40.380> statistics<00:05:40.979> so<00:05:41.729> I

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
then here's the memory statistics so I

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.000 
then here's the memory statistics so I
have<00:05:41.940> it<00:05:42.030> configured<00:05:42.330> to<00:05:42.510> run<00:05:42.750> with<00:05:43.010> just

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
have it configured to run with just

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.710 
have it configured to run with just
under<00:05:44.280> forty<00:05:44.580> megs<00:05:44.790> of<00:05:44.940> memory<00:05:45.270> and<00:05:45.419> their

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
under forty megs of memory and their

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:54.110 
under forty megs of memory and their
seven<00:05:45.960> Meg's<00:05:46.260> free<00:05:50.389> so<00:05:52.820> so<00:05:53.820> that's<00:05:53.940> kind<00:05:54.090> of

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
seven Meg's free so so that's kind of

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.790 
seven Meg's free so so that's kind of
proof<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:54.540> there<00:05:55.110> is<00:05:55.229> actually<00:05:55.350> a<00:05:55.590> pretty

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
proof that there is actually a pretty

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.980 
proof that there is actually a pretty
nice<00:05:55.979> little<00:05:56.280> core<00:05:56.520> inside<00:05:57.000> of<00:05:57.240> inside<00:05:57.690> of

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
nice little core inside of inside of

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:06.950 
nice little core inside of inside of
Windows<00:05:58.290> yeah<00:05:58.590> question<00:06:05.690> yeah<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:06.840> question

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
Windows yeah question yeah the question

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.420 
Windows yeah question yeah the question
is<00:06:07.200> is<00:06:07.380> min<00:06:07.530> win<00:06:07.680> a<00:06:07.710> good<00:06:07.889> way<00:06:08.010> to<00:06:08.070> run<00:06:08.250> web

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
is is min win a good way to run web

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.700 
is is min win a good way to run web
servers<00:06:08.789> you<00:06:09.150> need<00:06:09.389> a<00:06:09.419> lot<00:06:09.960> more<00:06:10.020> than<00:06:10.380> minhwan

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
servers you need a lot more than minhwan

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.700 
servers you need a lot more than minhwan
to<00:06:10.889> run<00:06:11.100> a<00:06:11.130> full-featured<00:06:11.910> web<00:06:12.120> server<00:06:12.710> most

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
to run a full-featured web server most

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.969 
to run a full-featured web server most
web<00:06:13.979> servers<00:06:14.370> today<00:06:15.229> serve<00:06:16.229> up<00:06:16.440> dynamic

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
web servers today serve up dynamic

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.510 
web servers today serve up dynamic
content<00:06:17.570> you<00:06:18.570> need<00:06:18.780> a<00:06:18.810> lot<00:06:19.020> more<00:06:19.050> than<00:06:19.229> this<00:06:19.520> we

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
content you need a lot more than this we

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.940 
content you need a lot more than this we
do<00:06:20.760> we<00:06:21.210> are<00:06:21.330> starting<00:06:21.630> on<00:06:21.840> this<00:06:22.020> path<00:06:22.320> at

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
do we are starting on this path at

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.040 
do we are starting on this path at
multiple<00:06:23.460> layers<00:06:23.669> of<00:06:23.820> the<00:06:23.970> system<00:06:24.450> so<00:06:24.750> windows

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
multiple layers of the system so windows

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.860 
multiple layers of the system so windows
server<00:06:25.260> 2008<00:06:25.950> is<00:06:26.310> based<00:06:27.270> on<00:06:27.479> this<00:06:27.660> thing

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
server 2008 is based on this thing

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.960 
server 2008 is based on this thing
called<00:06:28.110> windows<00:06:28.500> windows<00:06:28.800> server<00:06:29.250> core<00:06:29.669> and

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
called windows windows server core and

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.010 
called windows windows server core and
it's<00:06:31.099> it<00:06:32.099> basically<00:06:32.550> ships<00:06:33.000> in<00:06:33.300> this<00:06:33.479> minimal

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
it's it basically ships in this minimal

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.140 
it's it basically ships in this minimal
state<00:06:34.349> and<00:06:34.620> when<00:06:34.830> I<00:06:34.860> say<00:06:35.070> minimal<00:06:35.550> it's<00:06:35.820> it's

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
state and when I say minimal it's it's

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.839 
state and when I say minimal it's it's
about<00:06:36.389> a<00:06:36.419> gig<00:06:36.690> and<00:06:36.810> a<00:06:36.900> half<00:06:37.110> on<00:06:37.410> disk<00:06:37.729> which<00:06:38.729> is

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
about a gig and a half on disk which is

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.460 
about a gig and a half on disk which is
still<00:06:39.330> a<00:06:39.389> lot<00:06:39.720> bigger<00:06:39.960> than<00:06:40.200> what<00:06:40.349> we're

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
still a lot bigger than what we're

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.140 
still a lot bigger than what we're
talking<00:06:40.740> about<00:06:40.770> with<00:06:41.010> men<00:06:41.250> win<00:06:41.430> but<00:06:41.910> it<00:06:41.940> has

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
talking about with men win but it has

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.779 
talking about with men win but it has
all<00:06:42.419> the<00:06:42.450> stuff<00:06:42.780> necessary<00:06:43.320> to<00:06:43.500> run<00:06:43.789> the

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:44.789 
all the stuff necessary to run the

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.700 
all the stuff necessary to run the
different<00:06:45.210> server<00:06:45.479> workloads<00:06:46.139> and<00:06:46.380> so<00:06:46.560> then

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
different server workloads and so then

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.100 
different server workloads and so then
you<00:06:46.830> can<00:06:47.010> install<00:06:47.340> a<00:06:47.400> web<00:06:47.849> server<00:06:48.090> or<00:06:48.450> you<00:06:48.930> can

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
you can install a web server or you can

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.920 
you can install a web server or you can
install<00:06:49.440> the<00:06:49.800> virtualization<00:06:50.610> role<00:06:51.180> or<00:06:51.510> you

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
install the virtualization role or you

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
install the virtualization role or you
can<00:06:52.080> install<00:06:52.410> the<00:06:53.810> database<00:06:54.810> role<00:06:55.139> and<00:06:55.410> then

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
can install the database role and then

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.320 
can install the database role and then
it<00:06:56.039> adds<00:06:56.190> just<00:06:56.520> the<00:06:56.639> components<00:06:57.210> necessary

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
it adds just the components necessary

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.690 
it adds just the components necessary
for<00:06:57.870> that<00:06:58.020> role<00:06:58.260> and<00:06:58.530> so<00:06:59.250> it<00:06:59.340> keeps<00:06:59.490> the

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
for that role and so it keeps the

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.580 
for that role and so it keeps the
footprint<00:07:00.150> down<00:07:00.210> I<00:07:00.690> mentioned<00:07:01.229> gig<00:07:01.410> and<00:07:01.530> a

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
footprint down I mentioned gig and a

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.350 
footprint down I mentioned gig and a
half<00:07:01.800> on<00:07:02.099> disk<00:07:02.370> that's<00:07:02.580> still<00:07:02.760> pretty<00:07:02.849> big<00:07:03.150> in

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
half on disk that's still pretty big in

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.480 
half on disk that's still pretty big in
memory<00:07:03.840> it's<00:07:04.020> much<00:07:04.260> smaller<00:07:04.560> so<00:07:05.460> that

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
memory it's much smaller so that

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.029 
memory it's much smaller so that
contains<00:07:06.030> all<00:07:06.210> the<00:07:06.240> drivers<00:07:06.660> and<00:07:07.320> many<00:07:07.889> of

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 
contains all the drivers and many of

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:09.140 
contains all the drivers and many of
which<00:07:08.160> you<00:07:08.280> don't<00:07:08.400> need<00:07:08.639> for<00:07:08.849> any<00:07:08.970> given

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
which you don't need for any given

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.480 
which you don't need for any given
platform<00:07:09.780> so<00:07:10.560> yeah<00:07:10.740> we're<00:07:10.919> going<00:07:11.130> down<00:07:11.280> that

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490 
platform so yeah we're going down that

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.580 
platform so yeah we're going down that
approach<00:07:11.880> but<00:07:12.270> it'll<00:07:12.810> be<00:07:12.840> a<00:07:12.930> while<00:07:13.139> before<00:07:13.320> you

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
approach but it'll be a while before you

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.529 
approach but it'll be a while before you
could<00:07:13.950> build<00:07:14.070> something<00:07:14.370> directly<00:07:14.760> on<00:07:15.090> top<00:07:15.300> of

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 
could build something directly on top of

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:21.170 
could build something directly on top of
this<00:07:16.530> really<00:07:17.010> tiny<00:07:17.340> core<00:07:19.849> like<00:07:20.849> I<00:07:20.940> said<00:07:21.090> we

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 
this really tiny core like I said we

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.230 
this really tiny core like I said we
don't<00:07:21.300> have<00:07:21.510> any<00:07:21.780> any<00:07:22.550> product<00:07:23.550> ization<00:07:23.820> plans

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
don't have any any product ization plans

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:36.109 
don't have any any product ization plans
it's<00:07:24.539> more<00:07:24.780> of<00:07:24.870> an<00:07:24.960> internal

00:07:36.109 --> 00:07:36.119 

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:37.920 

like<00:07:37.119> I<00:07:37.149> said<00:07:37.270> we<00:07:37.509> don't<00:07:37.599> have<00:07:37.779> any

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:37.930 
like I said we don't have any

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.540 
like I said we don't have any
privatisation<00:07:38.680> plans<00:07:38.830> for<00:07:39.189> it<00:07:39.309> we're

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:39.550 
privatisation plans for it we're

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.589 
privatisation plans for it we're
definitely<00:07:39.699> going<00:07:39.969> to<00:07:40.059> be<00:07:40.149> using<00:07:40.389> this

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599 
definitely going to be using this

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:42.480 
definitely going to be using this
internally<00:07:41.169> to<00:07:41.199> build<00:07:41.559> all<00:07:41.830> the<00:07:42.039> products

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:42.490 
internally to build all the products

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.700 
internally to build all the products
that<00:07:42.520> are<00:07:42.669> based<00:07:42.909> on<00:07:43.119> Windows<00:07:43.509> we<00:07:44.169> build<00:07:44.379> a<00:07:44.499> lot

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:44.710 
that are based on Windows we build a lot

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.070 
that are based on Windows we build a lot
of<00:07:44.889> products<00:07:45.219> based<00:07:45.430> on<00:07:45.580> this<00:07:45.729> kernel<00:07:46.119> it's

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.080 
of products based on this kernel it's

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.379 
of products based on this kernel it's
not<00:07:47.259> just<00:07:47.319> the<00:07:48.309> the<00:07:48.550> operating<00:07:48.909> system<00:07:49.210> that's

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:49.389 
not just the the operating system that's

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:50.999 
not just the the operating system that's
running<00:07:49.569> on<00:07:49.779> many<00:07:50.020> of<00:07:50.139> the<00:07:50.229> laptops<00:07:50.710> in<00:07:50.919> the

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:51.009 
running on many of the laptops in the

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:53.070 
running on many of the laptops in the
room<00:07:51.219> it's<00:07:51.909> also<00:07:52.119> the<00:07:52.360> OS<00:07:52.629> that<00:07:52.809> we<00:07:52.899> use<00:07:53.020> for

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 
room it's also the OS that we use for

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.799 
room it's also the OS that we use for
media<00:07:53.439> center<00:07:53.909> that's<00:07:54.909> running<00:07:55.149> in<00:07:55.360> a<00:07:55.509> lot<00:07:55.659> of

00:07:55.799 --> 00:07:55.809 
media center that's running in a lot of

00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:58.599 
a lot of people's living rooms it's used

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:01.950 
a lot of people's living rooms it's used
for<00:07:58.689> servers<00:07:59.169> it's<00:07:59.800> used<00:08:00.129> for<00:08:00.960> smaller

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:01.960 
for servers it's used for smaller

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.529 
for servers it's used for smaller
embedded<00:08:02.469> devices<00:08:02.770> it's<00:08:03.399> used<00:08:03.729> in<00:08:03.999> a<00:08:04.300> lot<00:08:04.479> of

embedded devices it's used in a lot of

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:07.829 
embedded devices it's used in a lot of
different<00:08:04.990> ways<00:08:05.020> and<00:08:06.270> this<00:08:07.270> will<00:08:07.449> provide<00:08:07.779> us

00:08:07.829 --> 00:08:07.839 
different ways and this will provide us

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:10.309 
different ways and this will provide us
the<00:08:07.990> ability<00:08:08.169> to<00:08:08.619> move<00:08:08.770> into<00:08:09.009> even<00:08:09.339> more<00:08:09.369> areas

00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 
the ability to move into even more areas

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:14.279 
the ability to move into even more areas
yeah<00:08:12.270> yeah<00:08:13.270> yeah<00:08:13.659> let's<00:08:13.899> open<00:08:14.080> it<00:08:14.139> up<00:08:14.259> for
