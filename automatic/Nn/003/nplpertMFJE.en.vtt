I<00:00:58.079> don't<00:00:58.140> know<00:00:58.350> how<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> call<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.340> it's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
I don't know how to call it but it's

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.340 
I don't know how to call it but it's
really<00:01:00.090> great<00:01:00.390> because<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.840> controls<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
really great because it controls the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.290 
really great because it controls the
amount<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.590> product<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.030> you

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
amount of product that you get and you

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.660 
amount of product that you get and you
can<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.660> lock<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.260> doesn't<00:01:04.619> spill<00:01:05.040> so

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
can just lock it so it doesn't spill so

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.660 
can just lock it so it doesn't spill so
I<00:01:06.290> usually<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.530> use<00:01:07.619> one<00:01:08.010> pump<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.580> I

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
I usually just use one pump because I

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.039 
I usually just use one pump because I
don't<00:01:08.880> want<00:01:09.119> heavy<00:01:09.390> coverage<00:01:09.840> especially

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
don't want heavy coverage especially

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.300

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
as well it's just a really great way to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:15.130

think it's called

I've been using lately and they work

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.370 
I've been using lately and they work
really<00:03:16.320> well<00:03:16.910> from<00:03:17.910> this<00:03:18.420> video<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.840> can<00:03:19.140> tell

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
really well from this video you can tell

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.090 
really well from this video you can tell
that<00:03:19.770> it<00:03:20.010> has<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.930> natural<00:03:21.930> coverage<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.920> then

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
that it has a natural coverage and then

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.980 
that it has a natural coverage and then
you<00:03:23.340> can<00:03:23.490> build<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.880> up<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.150> medium<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.750> then

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
you can build it up to medium and then

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.810 
you can build it up to medium and then
you<00:03:25.170> can<00:03:25.320> build<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.710> up<00:03:25.800> even<00:03:26.100> more<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.490> a<00:03:26.520> full

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
you can build it up even more to a full

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.320 
you can build it up even more to a full
coverage<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.870> what<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.140> like<00:03:28.410> about<00:03:28.620> this

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
coverage and what I like about this

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.090 
coverage and what I like about this
foundation<00:03:30.330> is<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.840> doesn't<00:03:31.050> have<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.380> smell<00:03:31.650> to

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
foundation is it doesn't have a smell to

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.120 
foundation is it doesn't have a smell to
it<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.640> then<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:33.450> sinks<00:03:33.960> really<00:03:34.440> fast<00:03:34.740> onto

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
it and then it sinks really fast onto

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.360 
it and then it sinks really fast onto
your<00:03:35.310> skin<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.600> dries<00:03:36.960> quick<00:03:37.410> but<00:03:37.740> not<00:03:38.070> too

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
your skin and it dries quick but not too

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.250 
your skin and it dries quick but not too
quick<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.090> won't<00:03:39.300> be<00:03:39.420> able<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.810> blend<00:03:40.050> it

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
quick that you won't be able to blend it

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.730 
quick that you won't be able to blend it
any<00:03:40.470> more<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:41.480> um<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.570> really<00:03:43.290> really<00:03:43.530> like

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
that and it just kind of it settles on

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.730 
that and it just kind of it settles on
the<00:03:47.880> skin<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.330> makes<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.810> feel<00:03:49.140> like<00:03:49.440> your<00:03:49.710> own

I'm not too sure about about that so I
don't<00:03:59.160> even<00:03:59.430> know<00:03:59.610> how<00:03:59.820> to<00:03:59.880> test<00:04:00.210> if<00:04:00.510> it's

the<00:04:29.150> time<00:04:29.390> I<00:04:29.660> know<00:04:29.990> for<00:04:30.500> a<00:04:30.530> fact<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:31.100> I

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
the time I know for a fact that I

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.560 
the time I know for a fact that I
finished<00:04:31.760> my<00:04:31.970> entire<00:04:32.240> makeup<00:04:32.570> around<00:04:33.200> 1:00<00:04:34.010> um

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
finished my entire makeup around 1:00 um

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.050 
finished my entire makeup around 1:00 um
so<00:04:35.570> I<00:04:36.050> applied<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.740> foundation<00:04:36.890> around<00:04:37.400> 12:00

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
so I applied the foundation around 12:00

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.220 
so I applied the foundation around 12:00
to<00:04:38.390> 1:00<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.050> now<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:40.010> is

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
to 1:00 and now it is

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.500 
to 1:00 and now it is
4:42<00:04:42.230> in<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.950> afternoon<00:04:43.580> so<00:04:44.330> that's

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
4:42 in the afternoon so that's

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.660 
4:42 in the afternoon so that's
approximately<00:04:44.720> three<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.680> four<00:04:45.710> hours<00:04:46.340> and

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
approximately three to four hours and

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.940 
approximately three to four hours and
this<00:04:46.940> is<00:04:47.000> how<00:04:47.360> my<00:04:47.540> face<00:04:47.780> looks<00:04:47.930> like<00:04:48.230> J<00:04:48.770> you<00:04:48.830> can

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
this is how my face looks like J you can

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.490 
this is how my face looks like J you can
tell<00:04:49.310> that<00:04:49.490> I<00:04:49.550> have<00:04:49.940> a<00:04:50.210> lot<00:04:50.480> of<00:04:50.510> shiny<00:04:50.900> spots

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
tell that I have a lot of shiny spots

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.370 
tell that I have a lot of shiny spots
I'm<00:04:51.710> not<00:04:52.010> solely<00:04:52.580> on<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.780> sides<00:04:54.020> of<00:04:54.200> my<00:04:54.350> face

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
I'm not solely on the sides of my face

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.730 
I'm not solely on the sides of my face
but<00:04:55.010> this<00:04:55.250> one's<00:04:55.490> just<00:04:55.670> the<00:04:56.240> main<00:04:56.990> character

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
but this one's just the main character

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.430 
but this one's just the main character
here<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:58.630> yeah<00:04:59.630> that's<00:04:59.870> kind<00:05:00.050> of<00:05:00.110> a<00:05:00.200> bugger

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
here and yeah that's kind of a bugger

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.730 
here and yeah that's kind of a bugger
because<00:05:00.950> that's<00:05:01.840> more<00:05:02.840> than<00:05:03.020> half<00:05:03.200> of<00:05:03.350> my<00:05:03.530> face

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
because that's more than half of my face

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.350 
because that's more than half of my face
you<00:05:04.010> know<00:05:04.040> and<00:05:04.190> it's<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.640> right<00:05:04.910> smack<00:05:05.150> in<00:05:05.330> the

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
you know and it's the right smack in the

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.280 
you know and it's the right smack in the
middle<00:05:05.450> and<00:05:06.160> um<00:05:07.160> it's<00:05:07.970> been<00:05:08.150> about<00:05:08.630> 3-4<00:05:09.260> hours

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
middle and um it's been about 3-4 hours

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.170 
middle and um it's been about 3-4 hours
and<00:05:09.980> this<00:05:10.100> is<00:05:10.220> how<00:05:10.340> it<00:05:10.430> looks<00:05:10.610> like<00:05:10.760> but<00:05:10.820> if<00:05:11.030> I

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
and this is how it looks like but if I

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.300 
and this is how it looks like but if I
were<00:05:11.330> outside<00:05:11.810> this<00:05:12.230> would<00:05:12.470> have<00:05:12.620> probably

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
were outside this would have probably

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.380 
were outside this would have probably
happened<00:05:14.210> in<00:05:14.860> just<00:05:15.860> after<00:05:16.040> like<00:05:16.460> two<00:05:16.760> hours<00:05:17.150> or

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
happened in just after like two hours or

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.950 
happened in just after like two hours or
so<00:05:17.620> we<00:05:18.620> will<00:05:18.740> check<00:05:19.100> I<00:05:19.280> will<00:05:19.550> check<00:05:19.820> back<00:05:20.090> in<00:05:20.450> a

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
so we will check I will check back in a

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.690 
so we will check I will check back in a
few<00:05:20.990> hours<00:05:21.230> so<00:05:21.860> you<00:05:21.919> can<00:05:22.160> see<00:05:22.340> how<00:05:22.550> it<00:05:22.669> looks

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
few hours so you can see how it looks

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.570 
few hours so you can see how it looks
like<00:05:23.060> in<00:05:23.270> about<00:05:23.630> six<00:05:24.500> eight<00:05:24.710> more<00:05:24.950> hours<00:05:25.010> and

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
like in about six eight more hours and

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.670 
like in about six eight more hours and
then<00:05:25.640> I<00:05:26.270> will<00:05:26.780> talk<00:05:26.990> to<00:05:27.110> you<00:05:27.260> about<00:05:27.380> what<00:05:27.650> I

general overview of this foundation I'm

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.450 
general overview of this foundation I'm
actually<00:06:47.960> a<00:06:48.170> little<00:06:48.500> bit<00:06:48.680> disappointed<00:06:49.340> at

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
actually a little bit disappointed at

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.520 
actually a little bit disappointed at
how<00:06:49.610> it<00:06:49.790> performed<00:06:50.210> on<00:06:50.360> me<00:06:50.690> just<00:06:51.200> because<00:06:51.380> I

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 
how it performed on me just because I

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.130 
how it performed on me just because I
had<00:06:51.830> high<00:06:51.980> expectations<00:06:52.940> it's<00:06:53.660> pro<00:06:53.900> longwear

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
had high expectations it's pro longwear

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.850 
had high expectations it's pro longwear
it's<00:06:54.650> um<00:06:55.220> from<00:06:55.460> MEC<00:06:55.700> it's<00:06:55.970> 31<00:06:56.780> dollars<00:06:56.930> I<00:06:57.470> would

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
it's um from MEC it's 31 dollars I would

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.890 
it's um from MEC it's 31 dollars I would
assume<00:06:58.130> that<00:06:58.190> it<00:06:58.520> would<00:06:58.820> stay<00:06:59.240> put<00:06:59.270> almost<00:06:59.690> a

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
assume that it would stay put almost a

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.380 
assume that it would stay put almost a
lot<00:07:00.230> better<00:07:00.590> than<00:07:00.680> it<00:07:01.160> did<00:07:01.190> and<00:07:01.790> you<00:07:02.000> can<00:07:02.030> see

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.390 
lot better than it did and you can see

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.570 
lot better than it did and you can see
how<00:07:02.630> it<00:07:02.840> performed<00:07:03.260> on<00:07:03.350> my<00:07:03.440> face<00:07:03.650> because<00:07:04.310> I

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
how it performed on my face because I

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.770 
how it performed on my face because I
can't<00:07:04.880> really<00:07:04.970> say<00:07:05.210> that<00:07:05.240> it's<00:07:05.540> because<00:07:05.630> I

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:05.780 
can't really say that it's because I

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.690 
can't really say that it's because I
didn't<00:07:06.140> wear<00:07:06.260> primer<00:07:06.620> and<00:07:07.010> setting<00:07:07.310> spray<00:07:07.520> and

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:07.700 
didn't wear primer and setting spray and

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.520 
didn't wear primer and setting spray and
all<00:07:07.760> that<00:07:07.910> stuff<00:07:08.150> because<00:07:08.510> even<00:07:08.870> if<00:07:08.960> I<00:07:09.080> do<00:07:09.140> wear

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
all that stuff because even if I do wear

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.700 
all that stuff because even if I do wear
primer<00:07:09.770> it<00:07:10.210> still<00:07:11.210> gets<00:07:11.690> really<00:07:12.050> oily<00:07:12.230> and

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
primer it still gets really oily and

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.220 
primer it still gets really oily and
around<00:07:13.240> two<00:07:14.240> or<00:07:14.330> three<00:07:14.480> hours<00:07:14.810> if<00:07:14.960> I'm<00:07:15.050> outside

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.230 
around two or three hours if I'm outside

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.320 
around two or three hours if I'm outside
and<00:07:15.740> I've<00:07:16.460> been<00:07:16.670> trying<00:07:16.850> to<00:07:16.910> figure<00:07:17.030> out<00:07:17.150> what

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.330

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.140 
and I've been trying to figure out what
to<00:07:17.450> do<00:07:17.600> to<00:07:17.840> kind<00:07:17.990> of<00:07:18.110> control<00:07:18.500> that<00:07:18.560> I'm<00:07:19.150> trying
