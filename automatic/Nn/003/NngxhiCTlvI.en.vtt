00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.070
 friends of animals and four animals 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.080
 we are together again Claudia from 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.689
 edward and to not walk she leaves the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.520
 first today we travel a 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.140
 little bit to the outside of the 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.599
 city ​​and not leaving us a bit of 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.000
 urbanity to the right place for a 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.579
 hotel in the best conditions for 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.140
 our eyes and super cute because 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.180
 apart we are outside the city but 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.700
 we are really like inside then 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.920
 it's a station 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.920
 combines the best for your dog 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.790
 they are the founders of corn 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.700
 what 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.750
 the difference between a hotel and a 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.040
 pension is very clear in the medical city 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.080
 have proliferated a lot what are the 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.080
 pensions pensions are places 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.850
 closed normally you can find 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.280
 inside the city and then the dogs 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.020
 they are tucked and sheltered in a cage 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.630
 there is not enough space for 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.159
 to undergo a physical activity is 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.110
 the difference between our concept 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.780
 our concept is a concept 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.790
 campirano that is on the shores of 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.649
 the city of mexico where effectively 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.270
 it's a hotel because the dogs rest 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.800
 besides they have programmed 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.380
 physical activities all the time 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.759
 we have the difference in our 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.500
 concept is that we have spaces for 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.410
 that dogs have game in areas 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.880
 greens and treadmills we have a sandbox 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.530
 so that dogs can look for 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.110
 things can scratch then the people the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.030
 people are going with the motivation that their 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.280
 dog will be submitted in itinerary 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.810
 of physical activities besides that 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.490
 We are the only hotel in the city of 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.069
 Mexico that has a circuit 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.929
 closed 24 hours so that you 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.380
 you can go on vacation and you can see 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.750
 the posibilities 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.229
 I do not have to feel guilty about myself 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.229
 leave but is sad in a cage 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.229
 strange 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.370
 and you can see it by your sleeve 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.410
 pool as you can be in cancún you can 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.000
 you can see how your dog is 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.160
 treated with love we have an opening 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.459
 total our philosophy is we what 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:37.910
 we treat how you treat it and your case the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:37.910
 of the exercises 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.819
 to be able to locate the locations 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.769
 probable where I could be if not 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.510
 be in his career he means 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.340
 which is in the aesthetic zone in the area 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.690
 of game the different positions that 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.370
 let's have for the cameras we have 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.319
 also a space for cats in addition 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.120
 the mega enrichment curtain 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.090
 environmental where the cats are 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.349
 protected from the weather 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:17.010
 where they interact with each other because 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:19.319
 we are always discriminated against by all dogs 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.090
 when they enter the hotel they will have 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.959
 an activity log where the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.480
 owner opens 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.370
 We will try to provide a blog where 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.560
 we probably schedule the time of 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.450
 activity and the activity will be in the 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.209
 game in the garden with a game of 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.180
 frisbee ball is going to have exercise in 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.739
 treadmill would be the owner what 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.900
 he decides also wading 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.150
 we have many activity options 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.150
 physical for the dog ok and if I have a 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.890
 sick puppy and he 's heart disease 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.110
 thing like that can come clear of course 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.549
 that yes that has to be indicated with 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.430
 the owner will give you a video 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.319
 special and then we will know that you should not 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.209
 be submitted to disguise class exercise 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.450
 but a moderate exercise maybe 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.870
 walk a bit in the garden on a leash 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.500
 the game controlled so there's no 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.500
 no problem 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.970
 and we have home delivery too 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.209
 we see from simple rooms 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.209
 conditioned rooms 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:35.280
 could be the truth is important 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.770
 because we are not very 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.880
 convinced of the anthropomorphic concept 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.980
 that we know that the dog is very 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.150
 important a link of the family but 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.740
 we like to think that the dog is 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.330
 respected in his dog universe and the 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.400
 cat in your cat universe is your health 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.380
 it's pretty we know how fond they are 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.820
 has but we understand that they are species 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.920
 different and this is the concept 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.960
 why the birth of this hotel 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.449
 because we understood the need for 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.719
 the animals 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.460
 have a game and have a real 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:02.360
 space for them so that people 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.669
 can enjoy your vacation 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.319
 calm while we enjoy 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.650
 of their dogs because for us it is a 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.650
 enjoyment 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:16.009
 we are under construction however 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:19.159
 we have two cell numbers and 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:25.960
 passionate about cell phones is 55 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:25.960
 54 12 93 76 and the 55 50 60 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.620
 in this next holy week what good 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.089
 enjoy your holidays we have the 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.089
 agreement package 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:59.670
 nutrition program will have if 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.290
 you need an element as well as a doctor 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.360
 have 24 hours that you can 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.980
 monitor pets all the time 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.660
 that with that they confirm that they are going to 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.100
 treat as you would treat us good 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.690
 nothing more than an expert news more 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.920
 pending so I think it's going to go to 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.680
 Sometimes we will do better here than in your 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:20.130
 own house
