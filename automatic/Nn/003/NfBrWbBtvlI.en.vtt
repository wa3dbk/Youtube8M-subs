00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello everyone, good time of day, ladies and 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.900
 gentlemen and today you are greeted by the channel 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.700
 and now yes there is some name for us 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.309
 name 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.630
 here and today we will talk about this fashion 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.640
 like our mod nuclear war 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.420
 so he adds a few 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.849
 weapons this here they are in my menu 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.719
 presented here this here we do not 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:38.579
 weapons are urgently ours is our first 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.090
 weapons are our gas grenade gas 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.600
 grenade 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.770
 This mod, by the way, forgot to say it fits 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.010
 for multiplayer 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.980
 so that you play with friends 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.530
 had fun making fun of this grenade 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.739
 also very suitable for multiply player 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.739
 I hope on the shelf I use 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.440
 means to appear such a cloud and if we 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.440
 we will enter this cloud 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.550
 slowness poisoning something that will give 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.750
 blindness 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.580
 all this will soon pass as will 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:30.690
 pass we need to get out of the circle 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:31.400
 I again I really do not have it we have plasma 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.730
 a gun 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.690
 I don't really know why we need 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.690
 probably just making fun 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.540
 but if something like that 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:53.569
 Yes, even in no childhood can be from 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:02:00.509
 stay mobs obs from where only there 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:02:02.750
 the spider where she can also be yourself on 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.750
 her 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.210
 move as you can 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.549
 this 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.310
 and come 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.670
 the next is a flamethrower he shoots at 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.080
 block business 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.080
 convince here so here I am right now on top 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.080
 will demonstrate 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.620
 like this doll 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.560
 I didn't know how to turn the sand into glass 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.360
 awesome 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.760
 the following is our reactive 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.800
 grenade launcher and rocket launcher at 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.560
 him 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.970
 drawing is good and now we 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.920
 look further too we leave good 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.870
 from here we will stop one hundred percent 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.459
 palm tree 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.459
 I missed the weather in the foliage 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.770
 the dome but on endermen he is not if 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.770
 sorry 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.770
 here 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.570
 so normal 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.570
 but most of the blocks he does not destroy 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.630
 foliage turning 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:44.310
 earth so 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.310
 impregnation is drawn and in the sky there will be 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:57.490
 won we saw in the sky but he 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:04:00.130
 there debility tank tank 11 we take 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.600
 kill octopus not necessarily octopus 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.600
 but it is necessary to water 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:18.720
 garden water after a while is not like 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.720
 explode but baguettes and garden 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.020
 The following is our sapper shovel 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.039
 it's not good to do 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:37.520
 for the blocks there so that 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:42.319
 In my fast dig I do not know what 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:46.330
 among the faster to quickly drip in my 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:50.419
 ikki new block which he adds 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.960
 all such blocks are the following legs there 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.740
 us but also good water above the well 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.030
 probably or 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:03.440
 I do not know what kind of landing there in general have 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:06.009

 angry for two demons find the hour 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:27.520

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:29.460

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:37.830

 because we check the next tesla not 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.040
 I know why the tesla creeper immediately feared 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.570

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.570

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:20.180
 Tesla type such a cool gun which 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:22.370
 kills all of ours 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:27.410

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:30.940

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:15.250
