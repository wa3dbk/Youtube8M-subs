00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello girls the girl today will be sui 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.429
 blush in cream pupa lay from I have 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.380
 four colors were sent to me 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.030
 about two months ago from the pupa to steal them 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.549
 1 bought in Italy dangerous 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.039
 scilly so I tell you immediately are six and 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:22.410
 color I am the number 101 200 and 12 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.320
 one hundred and three and then what I am 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.230
 bought which is the darkest one that it is 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.230
 the number 203 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.450
 the first is 101 with a little brighter than the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.790
 201 is a very light peach almost not even 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.010
 we see then we have this which is a bit 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.809
 plus a mix between a peach and a rose is 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 this which instead a little more coral the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:54.420
 203 price is 13 euros 50 inside 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.430
 There are 4.4 ml of the product 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.789
 consistency we say that it is not weighing 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.620
 cream blush is more dusty on the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.909
 face therefore seems almost a fifth power 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.229
 that I don't know how it translates into Italian e 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.799
 what you notice that lasts a lot 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.810
 short i mean i really tried them a 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.640
 lots of times before you succeed in 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.979
 get an idea of ​​it because I was one 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.570
 unique products that I could not 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.369
 deciding me nice sim didn't like them 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.040
 because the effect on the face is very 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.930
 natural but I just couldn't 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.460
 to understand 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.500
 like I didn't go out a couple of hours ago 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.450
 he came back home there was no going 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.430
 more in a cabbage 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 a little better and darker colors then 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.090
 for example the last one I bought 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.460
 number 203 is surely the best of the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.740
 four that I definitely have the worst is 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.130
 the number 201 that practically does not exist 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.689
 sees 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.850
 but I like to see the effect on my face 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.850
 with 201 you can see 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.460
 and very light about the duration for me 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.350
 on the two oretta then slowly begins to 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.820
 to vanish 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.740
 this is number 203 if you have skin 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.360
 dry v where they have a little more if 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.540
 you already tend to have a little skin 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.820
 fat or anyway you have problems already with 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.130
 peacock cases make me these powders 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.070
 they will measure my motto very little 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.220
 so for this product it is roll of 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.040
 drums six and a half you know I put why 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.540
 let's say I expected a little more than 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.900
 this blush but in terms of duration 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.040
 really my skin type or even 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.570
 on that of a friend of mine because 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.980
 present before leaving for Italy 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.300
 for the holidays 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.820
 I had given one to a friend of mine 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.110
 approve it seems the number 202 if 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.120
 the one I came back I sent him a 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.890
 message to ask why back 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.870
 glass because I have to talk view and you 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.930
 wrote that it is clear however it is one 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.490
 show dots dots does not last and has had 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.240
 without the two receiving that he does not have them 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.830
 wanted to have my say 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.930
 my impression was the same 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.750
 purposes that I had that anyway is a 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.140
 plus what a nice start is not 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.140
 lasts a long time
