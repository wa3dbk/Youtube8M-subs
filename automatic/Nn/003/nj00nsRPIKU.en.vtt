body gets rid of it and so we look for
high-risk<00:02:23.420> strains<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.079> there's<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.290> few<00:02:24.470> of

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
high-risk strains and there's a few of

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.640 
high-risk strains and there's a few of
those<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:25.010> then<00:02:25.310> as<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:26.209> get<00:02:26.390> older<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:27.290> near

sexually active
what<00:02:40.819> does<00:02:40.970> sexually<00:02:41.329> active<00:02:41.480> mean<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.590> me

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
what does sexually active mean so to me

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.149 
what does sexually active mean so to me
it<00:02:43.010> means<00:02:43.480> basically<00:02:44.680> mucous<00:02:45.680> membrane

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
it means basically mucous membrane

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.449 
it means basically mucous membrane
contact<00:02:46.700> whether<00:02:47.150> that's<00:02:47.389> mouth<00:02:47.840> anus<00:02:48.829> penis

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
contact whether that's mouth anus penis

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.330 
contact whether that's mouth anus penis
vagina<00:02:50.049> so<00:02:51.049> contacting<00:02:51.709> those<00:02:51.889> can

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
vagina so contacting those can

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.550 
vagina so contacting those can
potentially<00:02:52.819> transmit<00:02:53.420> disease<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.139> that's

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
potentially transmit disease and that's

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.349 
potentially transmit disease and that's

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
to get that pretty much anywhere what

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.370 
to get that pretty much anywhere what

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.200 
happens if there's something wrong so if
after<00:04:51.860> my<00:04:52.250> pelvic<00:04:52.580> exam

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
after my pelvic exam

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.470 
after my pelvic exam
we're<00:04:53.570> during<00:04:53.840> my<00:04:53.930> pelvic<00:04:54.290> exam<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:54.710> know

we're during my pelvic exam you know

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.330 
we're during my pelvic exam you know
what<00:04:56.480> would<00:04:56.630> happen<00:04:56.930> it's<00:04:57.560> pretty<00:04:57.950> rare<00:04:58.310> that

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
what would happen it's pretty rare that

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.400 
what would happen it's pretty rare that
you<00:04:58.730> would<00:04:58.850> actually<00:04:59.060> see<00:04:59.380> something<00:05:00.380> very

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
you would actually see something very

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.800 
you would actually see something very
abnormal<00:05:00.950> on<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.670> cervix<00:05:02.030> itself<00:05:02.360> that's<00:05:02.690> why

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
abnormal on the cervix itself that's why

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.840 
abnormal on the cervix itself that's why
we<00:05:02.900> do<00:05:03.050> paps<00:05:03.320> it's<00:05:03.590> preventative<00:05:04.130> you<00:05:04.550> know<00:05:04.670> we

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
we do paps it's preventative you know we

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.610 
we do paps it's preventative you know we
see<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.180> abnormal<00:05:05.600> cells<00:05:05.630> before<00:05:06.050> we<00:05:06.260> see<00:05:06.440> any

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
see the abnormal cells before we see any

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.470 
see the abnormal cells before we see any
cancer<00:05:07.010> so<00:05:07.490> sort<00:05:07.730> of<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.820> next<00:05:08.060> step<00:05:08.300> after

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
cancer so sort of the next step after

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.500 
cancer so sort of the next step after
that<00:05:08.750> would<00:05:08.900> be<00:05:09.050> colposcopy<00:05:09.790> and<00:05:10.790> are<00:05:11.270> you

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
that would be colposcopy and are you

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.240 
that would be colposcopy and are you
familiar<00:05:11.600> with<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:11.960> at<00:05:12.110> all<00:05:12.200> they're<00:05:13.010> not

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
familiar with that at all they're not

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.370 
familiar with that at all they're not
they're<00:05:13.610> not<00:05:13.850> so<00:05:14.150> colposcopy<00:05:14.510> is<00:05:14.990> basically

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
they're not so colposcopy is basically

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.600 
they're not so colposcopy is basically
taking<00:05:15.940> a<00:05:17.290> magnifying<00:05:18.290> device<00:05:18.460> again<00:05:19.460> with

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
taking a magnifying device again with

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.240 
taking a magnifying device again with
the<00:05:19.700> speculum<00:05:20.120> exam<00:05:20.420> and<00:05:20.750> you<00:05:20.870> you<00:05:21.110> paint<00:05:21.470> some

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
the speculum exam and you you paint some

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.370 
the speculum exam and you you paint some
essentially<00:05:22.880> vinegar<00:05:23.360> what<00:05:23.720> we<00:05:23.810> call<00:05:23.990> a<00:05:24.020> Seto

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
essentially vinegar what we call a Seto

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.400 
essentially vinegar what we call a Seto
white<00:05:24.560> on<00:05:24.740> there<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:26.240> look<00:05:26.690> for<00:05:26.840> changes<00:05:26.870> and

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
white on there and look for changes and

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.260 
white on there and look for changes and
if<00:05:27.650> there's<00:05:27.830> changes<00:05:28.220> oftentimes<00:05:28.790> you<00:05:28.970> take<00:05:29.240> a

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
if there's changes oftentimes you take a

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.770 
if there's changes oftentimes you take a
biopsy

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
biopsy

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.720 
biopsy
meaning<00:05:30.050> you<00:05:30.220> pull<00:05:31.220> a<00:05:31.250> little<00:05:31.460> piece<00:05:31.610> of

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
meaning you pull a little piece of

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.010 
meaning you pull a little piece of
tissue<00:05:31.880> off<00:05:32.150> and<00:05:32.330> you<00:05:32.390> send<00:05:32.570> it<00:05:32.630> to<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:32.840> lab

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
tissue off and you send it to the lab

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.080 
tissue off and you send it to the lab
and<00:05:33.200> you<00:05:33.260> see<00:05:33.470> what's<00:05:33.680> going<00:05:33.950> on<00:05:34.070> that<00:05:34.340> said

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
and you see what's going on that said

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.020 
and you see what's going on that said
again<00:05:35.420> this<00:05:35.630> is<00:05:35.810> like<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.800> worst<00:05:37.010> end<00:05:37.310> very

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
again this is like the worst end very

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.370 
again this is like the worst end very
uncommon<00:05:38.510> the<00:05:38.840> most<00:05:39.050> common<00:05:39.440> thing<00:05:39.650> is<00:05:39.920> your

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
uncommon the most common thing is your

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.750 
uncommon the most common thing is your
PAP<00:05:42.380> comes<00:05:42.650> back<00:05:42.860> and<00:05:43.100> there's<00:05:43.220> some<00:05:43.310> abnormal

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
PAP comes back and there's some abnormal

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.910 
PAP comes back and there's some abnormal
cells<00:05:44.000> that<00:05:44.720> are<00:05:44.870> mildly<00:05:45.260> abnormal<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:45.830> we

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
cells that are mildly abnormal and we

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.590 
cells that are mildly abnormal and we
say<00:05:46.100> Lindsey<00:05:46.850> the<00:05:46.970> good<00:05:47.120> some<00:05:47.330> I'll<00:05:47.450> be

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
say Lindsey the good some I'll be

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.120 
say Lindsey the good some I'll be
abnormal<00:05:47.990> cells<00:05:48.170> we'll<00:05:48.530> check<00:05:48.710> again<00:05:48.830> in<00:05:49.070> a

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
abnormal cells we'll check again in a

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.520 
abnormal cells we'll check again in a
year<00:05:49.160> what<00:05:49.640> do<00:05:49.700> I<00:05:49.760> do<00:05:49.850> if<00:05:50.300> my<00:05:50.570> doctor<00:05:50.840> discounts
