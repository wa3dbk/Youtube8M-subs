 paris beach we wish you good 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.809
 holidays of course during all this 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.920
 season there are things that we have 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.360
 marked of course it's watches 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.309
 connect the connected bracelets that has 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.350
 been really season 2 that's what 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.050
 type of object with the lawn of course 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.160
 android ware and then stay at the end of 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.109
 this video of this zapping 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.519
 we got you an amazing concept 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.199
 it may be the watch of the future 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.679
 maybe that will never come out my in 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.930
 anyway we liked what we did 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.399
 liked well it's still taking in 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.649
 hand which is very fast ie 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.239
 only after an hour or two without reading 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.460
 no instructions for use we quickly understood 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.739
 how does it work with both buttons 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.510
 ie the crown on the top 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.399
 the little push button on the side that 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.870
 allows you to view right away 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.579
 all your contacts and we can very well 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.629
 to be and also interact with this 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.670
 plants simply by flicking the screen 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.890
 and even speaking to him there is the command 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.180
 vocal siri 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.789
 it's the second round watch that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.940
 arrives after the bike 360 ​​with a screen 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.110
 of 1 inch 3 a screen with a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.129
 particularity is that it is in 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.240
 oled plastic 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.130
 I think it's one of the first 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.170
 watches to have this technology that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.450
 brings a brightness and a contrast 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.490
 impressive there are real 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.830
 needle is a real watch 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.990
 classic but down the little band 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.729
 black is a screen what is it for and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.009
 to display notifications in 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.170
 from the smartphone 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.509
 there are also sensors 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.909
 temperature then body temperature 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.619
 but also the ambient temperature so 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.079
 and watch and his little sensors are 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.159
 inside the bracelet and the idea 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.329
 it is necessary that they are in 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.090
 contact with the skin so that they 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.130
 can collect this data 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.310
 today it is equipped with a screen a 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.450
 technology screen so have the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.000
 technology found on 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.240
 reading lights it's a technology that makes 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.460
 the very readable screen is for once 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.170
 pretty original which is very little for 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.409
 the moment of grace connect them equipped 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.590
 of this technology and then it's 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.049
 pretty pretty at the design level this is the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.149
 mikami case that means my intelligence 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.799
 communication focused on him and that's 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.850
 available only in the usa 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.019
 that's why we're happy with you 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.789
 show it today in France where he 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.319
 made a small fast passing what 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.610
 what's good is the pitcher one of 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.980
 very first bracelets connected in 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.349

 it only works with one 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.030
 subscription and does it hold we offered 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.400
 on our personalization studio in 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.650

 online studio where only signs 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.239
 exterior of modernity these are 12 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.010
 diodes that are inside the frame 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.230
 in 12 diodes that can display 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.670
 notifications but also the number 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.470
 of packages you perform in the 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.799
 day according to a goal that you you 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.209
 are set a concept that does not evolve 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.319
 since if it's called tall band this 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.209
 is not the bracelet that speaks to you 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.280
 but rather the bracelet that we are talking about 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.290
 it's almost magical the module that we 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.750
 can extract from the body of the bracelet itself 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.280
 turns into auricles if we understand 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.489
 Well, here is a bracelet 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.760
 throws on the on the arm on the front 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.130
 arms 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.280
 actually a little a little screen on 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.870
 which one can interact the one that is 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.260
 intended to replace or supplement a 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.260
 smartphone
