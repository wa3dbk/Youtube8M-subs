00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.969 
regardless how good you are we'll be
having<00:01:08.680> fun<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:11.200> gameplay<00:01:11.500> is<00:01:11.950> a

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
having fun and this gameplay is a

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.310 
having fun and this gameplay is a
two-minute<00:01:12.789> mob<00:01:13.210> on<00:01:13.359> the<00:01:13.450> map<00:01:13.600> carbon<00:01:14.109> and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
two-minute mob on the map carbon and

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.830 
two-minute mob on the map carbon and
although<00:01:15.100> two<00:01:15.460> minutes<00:01:15.789> yes<00:01:16.270> that<00:01:16.420> is<00:01:16.539> fast

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
although two minutes yes that is fast

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.510 
although two minutes yes that is fast
but<00:01:17.469> the<00:01:17.530> reason<00:01:17.799> why<00:01:17.979> i<00:01:18.009> think<00:01:18.070> that's<00:01:18.310> really

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
but the reason why i think that's really

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.730 
but the reason why i think that's really
impressive<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:19.000> because<00:01:19.299> this<00:01:19.479> is<00:01:19.570> in<00:01:19.689> 6v6<00:01:20.170> not

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
impressive is because this is in 6v6 not

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.380 
impressive is because this is in 6v6 not
ground<00:01:21.100> war<00:01:21.310> so<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.990> has<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.200> very<00:01:23.380> quick

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
ground war so it has a very quick

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.359 
ground war so it has a very quick
domination<00:01:25.390> mob<00:01:25.600> for<00:01:26.020> 6v6<00:01:26.619> because<00:01:27.159> obviously

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
domination mob for 6v6 because obviously

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.130 
domination mob for 6v6 because obviously
there<00:01:27.700> is<00:01:27.759> as<00:01:27.909> much<00:01:27.969> people<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:28.630> it's<00:01:28.810> harder

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
there is as much people so it's harder

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.130 
there is as much people so it's harder
to<00:01:29.170> get<00:01:29.439> you<00:01:29.829> know<00:01:29.950> fashion<00:01:30.189> elapsed<00:01:30.579> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
to get you know fashion elapsed and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.330 
to get you know fashion elapsed and
really<00:01:32.140> it's<00:01:32.259> just<00:01:32.380> harder<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.740> get<00:01:32.920> like

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
really it's just harder to get like

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.399 
really it's just harder to get like
higher<00:01:33.640> scoring<00:01:33.999> game<00:01:34.240> plays<00:01:34.450> like<00:01:34.719> a<00:01:34.899> lot<00:01:35.289> of

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
higher scoring game plays like a lot of

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.370 
higher scoring game plays like a lot of
kills<00:01:35.649> and<00:01:35.890> stuff<00:01:36.039> like<00:01:36.159> that<00:01:36.219> but<00:01:36.549> i<00:01:37.380> really

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380
