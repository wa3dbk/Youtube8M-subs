all<00:00:01.650> right<00:00:01.829> we're<00:00:02.820> going<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.060> create<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.480> rear

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
all right we're going to create the rear

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.660 
all right we're going to create the rear

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
sketch and manipulate to your views so

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.570 
sketch and manipulate to your views so
that<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.170> can<00:00:13.349> see<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> rear<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.340> car

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
that you can see the rear of the car

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.349 
that you can see the rear of the car
fairly<00:00:15.450> clearly<00:00:16.640> if<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.699> accidentally

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
fairly clearly if you accidentally

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.160 
fairly clearly if you accidentally
rotate<00:00:18.869> your<00:00:19.260> shape<00:00:19.830> like<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.990> there's<00:00:21.990> an

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
rotate your shape like that there's an

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.009 
rotate your shape like that there's an
icon<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.710> bottom<00:00:22.740> which<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.490> normal<00:00:24.240> view

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and this will bring it back to a normal

and this will bring it back to a normal
view<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:27.990> your<00:00:28.170> plane<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.859> flat<00:00:29.310> to

let's<00:02:20.950> do<00:02:21.160> let's<00:02:21.519> do<00:02:21.700> three<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:23.050> then<00:02:23.170> we'll

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
let's do let's do three and then we'll

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.580 
let's do let's do three and then we'll
put<00:02:23.590> one<00:02:23.830> more<00:02:24.010> dimension<00:02:24.310> on<00:02:24.700> here<00:02:25.440> right<00:02:26.440> now

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
put one more dimension on here right now

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.570 
put one more dimension on here right now
it's<00:02:26.769> 43<00:02:27.610> let's<00:02:27.910> move<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.239> 50<00:02:28.950> ok<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.430> that

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
it's 43 let's move that 50 ok so that

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.130 
it's 43 let's move that 50 ok so that
looks<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:31.180> looks<00:02:31.239> ok

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.780 

so<00:02:38.140> we'll<00:02:38.319> exit<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:38.829> workbench<00:02:39.189> and<00:02:41.760> make<00:02:42.760> a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
so we'll exit this workbench and make a

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.199 
so we'll exit this workbench and make a
pad<00:02:43.090> out<00:02:43.299> of<00:02:43.450> what<00:02:43.629> we've<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:43.810> drawn<00:02:45.180> for<00:02:46.180> a

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
pad out of what we've just drawn for a

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.240 
pad out of what we've just drawn for a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.050 

there<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.459> our<00:02:51.609> airfoil<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.760> end<00:02:54.909> of

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
there is our airfoil that is the end of

there is our airfoil that is the end of
