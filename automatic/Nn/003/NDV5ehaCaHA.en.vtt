00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.349
 that we're going to play rock and that's why I'm 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.349
 in a chair 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:26.330
 to suffer clear if I have a picket 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:46.600
 it's real if it's a man if he's alive if 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.600
 it is Spanish

 since it is marginal you have to break the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.899
 name and so is an American like 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.390

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.460

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.560
 artist is an actor 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:33.240

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.810
 Chan Chan 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.159
 a question this year I think I'm not going to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.610

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.610

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.770

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.300
 so you know what to think according to how 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.300

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.400
