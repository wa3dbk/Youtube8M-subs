 and overall the model leaves very good 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:23.420
 impression if minus something very 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.420
 simple bottom as you can see 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.510
 well basically 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.010
 most modern 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.829
 models because manufacturers 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.060
 expect that you will never 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:45.360
 take your model off delivery so i 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.940
 saw even worse specimens 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.879
 let's say the model costs 200 euros but she has 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.390
 completely flat bottom and there is no 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.430
 detailing and this was a review of the reno model 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.670
