 And in the first video, it looks like this 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.519

 First Cho packing of guitar 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:07.259
 I would like to input a choice of guitar amplifier 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.520
 If it does so, it will come out if it feels like this, but for the time being sound making will be left 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.030
 First of all 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.930

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.780
 I will 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.570
 true 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:02:01.219
 Cw- do 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.410

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.930
 b 9 minutes 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.830
 If you try to ask

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.290
 With the sensitivity of packing guitar 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.060
 But one 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.410
 Like Again across the guitar amplifier since it is possible to sandwich the class here only one after 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.420
 I think 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.420

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.030
 First of all, if you ask 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:05:01.370
 Do you going to change the original lend the security dismantled and put it in to this not such a feeling 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.360

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:28.380
 He's gone eight times or so 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.390
 So here comes the tube in the name of Tatsuo Fileo 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.390
 I was taking 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.390

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.220
 phat 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:53.330
 Like this 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.059
 me 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:16.059
 me 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.730
 But I do not have a clear negative dipped try 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:32.979
 me 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.740
 me 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.480
 me 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.820
 f 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:58.440
 Well, it means that this sound source was done 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:02.670
 A track that can be made with just the ipad iphone on six of the top children 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.450
 Japan's but what is also probably felt that say play Le track if there is ie 9 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:08.729
 Or 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:11.969
 It seems to be a castle enough here alone, but do not you think that it is a very small number until here is entered? 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:14.350
 Ipad iphone or like this 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:17.860
 It is funny that I enjoy it a lot 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:22.030
 It feels like you should enjoy the music 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:26.200
 I think I've done a little bit of a sound difficult story but 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:30.850
 You can watch this video again after you get used to it while watching 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:34.340
 Then I think that there are quite a lot of discoveries, so feel free to refer to it 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:39.290
 So I think I really understand 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:41.650
 Here you will find at the end really it nerd Sagara not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not
