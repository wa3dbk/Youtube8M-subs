making multiple casts to that even a
short<00:02:13.510> cast<00:02:14.370> will<00:02:15.370> trigger<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.910> fish<00:02:16.180> to

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
short cast will trigger that fish to

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.660 
short cast will trigger that fish to
bite<00:02:18.750> now<00:02:19.750> when<00:02:19.900> I'm<00:02:19.989> making<00:02:20.140> close<00:02:20.590> cast<00:02:21.069> to

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
guys this is pretty cool the Akuma's

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.070 
guys this is pretty cool the Akuma's
have<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.580> little<00:02:36.849> dial<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.360> here<00:02:37.599> one<00:02:37.870> through

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
have a little dial in here one through

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.850 
have a little dial in here one through
six<00:02:38.549> six<00:02:39.549> obviously<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.090> tighter<00:02:40.440> zero<00:02:41.440> or<00:02:41.650> one

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
six six obviously is tighter zero or one

six six obviously is tighter zero or one
is<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.069> looser<00:02:42.489> so<00:02:42.640> if<00:02:42.730> I'm<00:02:42.819> an<00:02:42.940> open-water

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
is a looser so if I'm an open-water

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.089 
is a looser so if I'm an open-water
thorn<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:43.959> think<00:02:44.140> heavy<00:02:44.290> bait<00:02:44.530> I'll<00:02:44.709> put<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.010> on
