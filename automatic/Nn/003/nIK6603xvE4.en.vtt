that<00:02:34.780> we've<00:02:34.900> taken<00:02:35.110> our<00:02:35.410> first<00:02:35.620> three<00:02:35.799> points

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
that we've taken our first three points

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.619 
that we've taken our first three points
from<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.430> division<00:02:36.819> which<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.030> excellent

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
from this division which is excellent

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.140 
from this division which is excellent
and<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.470> does<00:02:38.650> mean<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.099> we<00:02:39.430> can<00:02:39.730> continue

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
and it does mean that we can continue

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.580 
and it does mean that we can continue
rolling<00:02:40.480> on<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:40.989> looks<00:02:41.170> like<00:02:41.380> we're

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
rolling on and it looks like we're

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.410 
rolling on and it looks like we're
pretty<00:02:41.769> solid<00:02:42.069> we<00:02:42.370> haven't<00:02:42.730> lost<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:43.060> thinking

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
pretty solid we haven't lost I thinking

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.069 
pretty solid we haven't lost I thinking
about<00:02:43.660> at<00:02:44.650> least<00:02:45.239> seven<00:02:46.239> games<00:02:46.480> now<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.750> think

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
about at least seven games now I think

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.020 
about at least seven games now I think
so<00:02:47.380> we're<00:02:47.680> really<00:02:48.010> really<00:02:48.190> going<00:02:48.670> through<00:02:48.790> now

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
so we're really really going through now

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.330 
so we're really really going through now
we<00:02:49.090> managed<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:49.660> one<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.260> our<00:02:50.500> trading<00:02:50.950> or

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
we managed to so one of our trading or

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
we managed to so one of our trading or
one<00:02:51.549> of<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.730> players<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.030> we're<00:02:52.150> trying<00:02:52.269> to

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
one of the players that we're trying to

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
however it was a shortlist celebration

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.270 
however it was a shortlist celebration
from<00:06:17.169> the<00:06:17.259> guy<00:06:17.349> even<00:06:17.710> though<00:06:17.740> he<00:06:17.860> celebrated

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
from the guy even though he celebrated

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
for ages and we end up getting this if

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.760 
for ages and we end up getting this if
you<00:06:21.430> look<00:06:21.669> carefully<00:06:21.940> I<00:06:22.810> think<00:06:23.320> it's<00:06:23.469> Royce

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
you look carefully I think it's Royce

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.040 
you look carefully I think it's Royce
gets<00:06:24.340> taken<00:06:24.580> out<00:06:24.909> on<00:06:25.060> the<00:06:25.150> edge<00:06:25.270> of<00:06:25.389> his<00:06:25.509> box<00:06:25.810> by

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
gets taken out on the edge of his box by

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.659 
gets taken out on the edge of his box by
one<00:06:26.259> of<00:06:26.349> his<00:06:26.440> players<00:06:26.620> just<00:06:26.889> walks<00:06:27.130> into<00:06:27.550> it

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
one of his players just walks into it

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.029 
one of his players just walks into it
and<00:06:27.909> it<00:06:28.419> gives<00:06:28.539> us<00:06:28.750> a<00:06:28.839> penalty<00:06:29.320> I<00:06:29.349> think<00:06:29.830> that<00:06:30.010> I

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
and it gives us a penalty I think that I

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.680 
and it gives us a penalty I think that I
probably<00:06:30.339> should<00:06:30.760> have<00:06:30.789> put<00:06:31.150> it<00:06:31.240> wide<00:06:31.419> or

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
probably should have put it wide or

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.610 
probably should have put it wide or
something<00:06:31.960> because<00:06:32.139> it<00:06:32.320> was<00:06:32.409> a<00:06:32.440> bit<00:06:32.560> harsh

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
something because it was a bit harsh

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.650 
something because it was a bit harsh
to<00:06:33.979> actually<00:06:34.340> take<00:06:34.580> this<00:06:34.729> penalty<00:06:35.060> and<00:06:35.300> score

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
to actually take this penalty and score

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.590 
to actually take this penalty and score
it<00:06:35.870> but<00:06:36.680> on<00:06:37.250> the<00:06:37.310> other<00:06:37.490> hand<00:06:37.610> I'm<00:06:38.030> not<00:06:38.360> going

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
it but on the other hand I'm not going

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.820 
it but on the other hand I'm not going
to<00:06:38.720> give<00:06:38.840> him<00:06:38.900> the<00:06:38.990> chance<00:06:39.229> to<00:06:39.380> win<00:06:39.530> a<00:06:39.560> game

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
to give him the chance to win a game

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.200 
to give him the chance to win a game
especially<00:06:40.130> when<00:06:40.610> we're<00:06:40.729> on<00:06:40.790> such<00:06:40.970> a<00:06:41.000> hot

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
especially when we're on such a hot

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.520 
especially when we're on such a hot
streak<00:06:41.479> so<00:06:41.630> there<00:06:41.750> you<00:06:41.810> go<00:06:41.930> Royce<00:06:42.199> takes<00:06:42.440> the

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
streak so there you go Royce takes the

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.900 
streak so there you go Royce takes the
penalty<00:06:42.620> puts<00:06:43.130> it<00:06:43.250> into<00:06:43.370> the<00:06:43.460> back<00:06:43.580> of<00:06:43.610> the<00:06:43.760> net

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
penalty puts it into the back of the net

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.900 
penalty puts it into the back of the net
in<00:06:44.270> the<00:06:44.330> 54th<00:06:45.050> minute<00:06:45.229> to<00:06:45.800> make<00:06:45.919> it<00:06:46.070> 3-1<00:06:46.370> to<00:06:46.760> us
