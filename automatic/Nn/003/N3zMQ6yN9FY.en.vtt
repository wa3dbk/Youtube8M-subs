00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.330
 welcome to a preview video of Need for Speed ​​Shift 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.289
 first league video 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:11.449
 the preview wish us very advanced 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:12.349
 you have to say 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:13.409
 so come on 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:17.759
 Truly try out Police Mainz right here in the Audi r8 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.679
 set and 3 0 through London so as graphic designers can there are 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:23.779
 actually none 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.789
 interesting route as London 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.359
 exactly and we are here also in the cockpit perspective there is 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.770
 Of course, a lot to see in each of the buddies of the speedometer 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.659
 and hat 

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:34.870
 not just that 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.870
 for adornment there but really have to be on opponents 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.990
 the paddles force to do something in a nutshell 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.580
 the many moving the paddle shifters on the steering wheel 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.180
 and take a look over the bridge and of course have the same 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.520
 the track missed wrong turn 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.710
 something happened to the CD as well 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.230
 the content of the guardrail Walser Dental is blurred 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.290
 Black And White It's just so you can not do anything like that for two seconds 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.260
 see more correctly 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.850
 and not always avoid being too much attached to them 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.729
 Guardrail uses as a buffer 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.340
 Peter Meyer the outside perspective lady also briefly outlined 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.340
 Damage Model 10 10 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.140
 I have to say my favorite example deep is still the bumpers 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.240
 because there just the speed feeling Westerburg and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.820
 Thomas Leif Diaz Martin discusses percent of opponents running best 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.180
 you look what surpassed the construction site Wasserkopf 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.980
 So I also like the bumper fixed by Nilsson 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.940
 a scar even if they allow it like the oxen 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.840
 chosen a different perspective 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.840
 then, of course, offers such a camera from the cockpit 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.570
 or if they prefer their animals or homing not so tight the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.430
 Industry slightly evening attracts the beautiful reflection 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.200
 on the hood of the rhine-main Mettingen 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.009
 her car 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.179
 I have to say the environment 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.869
 we are very pretty 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.719
 To viewers move even if so admonishes edge of the track are the 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.639
 Damage model is so the direction is it's not suspicious reference 

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:00.350
 but it 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.270
 did you know 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.010
 you can say that for 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.820
 Year 2009 very contemporary animal in which they always repeat through as well 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.500
 great but also the Rubber Soul 0 indirectly according to her 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.949
 in turn zoomed only on the steering wheel these are the paddles 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:17.909
 On the right the Navi pulls really big really add 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.339
 as if you really are in such a nem 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.919
 Percent real Audi r8 sits 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:25.069
 and by the way also its the newspapers are beautifully cut beautiful 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.629
 camera angles 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.089
 as I said 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:29.289
 across the bridge 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:30.599
 crashed 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.169
 and as you can see 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:35.169
 Leave track as missed 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.319
 because they still left the tires 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.919
 the flying also through the area Alonso 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.199
 at the track edge 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.439
 Tires are started 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.749
 which neither 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.539
 a racing game and the Nordschleife 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:50.779
 with Shift 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.959
 the new Lamborghini over the Nordschleife we ​​are here in the day 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:56.789
 out of focus that is 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:59.309
 the faster you drive Christianity 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:03.919
 Proksa wants to look at the track at Tegut 52 samples witnesses - outside blindfold 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.919
 that's why he gets a little out of focus 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:12.429
 Crash anyway 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:15.649
 so the opponents percent see also here 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:18.899
 Fear that they try on this symbol has pushed my way 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:22.259
 I have to sink so maybe it's not too easy to drive around 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:23.210
 so flown 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.899
 as they already are 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:28.899
 because carriage 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.719
 Of course, that happens too 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.719
 stay here both make but also much more 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.659
 Janssen Chile sank down and I over it 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.369
 but he brings nothing more 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:41.519
 and 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.689
 then the message is the other one 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.989
 Until then, only the problem is 50 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.459
 but you notice her new team's new engine 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.189
 In January from the beginning, emphasis was placed on it this time 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.389
 Adriana cities can realize the frame rate and it shows them 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:57.999
 these 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:00.769
 not quite China teachers have all know many 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.919
 Lörrach also here the time must be up 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.919
 and percent 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.650
 it is and technically impeccable Need for Speed 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.539
 around and until it actually yes 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.240
 useless touch and usual because the last four game days who really 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.730
 technically flawed goods were therefore clearly and simulated 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.950
 because in the racing game who wants to have group and I'm doing it 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.069
 possible fun program going on and I say so too 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.580
 Altogether at 30 degrees not quite so qualities and so there is 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.300
 a little bit 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.759
 respectively 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.759
 "We have potential rowing canoes and rowing Protestants 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.949
 where Vaduz is possible for five years in Münster
