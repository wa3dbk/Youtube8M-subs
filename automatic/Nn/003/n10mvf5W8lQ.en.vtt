00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.020 
everything it's great uh but obviously
not<00:04:27.840> what<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.590> would<00:04:28.680> consider<00:04:28.919> a<00:04:29.250> pumpkin<00:04:29.820> beer

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
not what I would consider a pumpkin beer

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.290 
not what I would consider a pumpkin beer
so<00:04:30.300> what<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.110> would<00:04:31.229> change<00:04:31.560> probably<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.880> little

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
so what I would change probably a little

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.980 
so what I would change probably a little
less<00:04:33.570> of<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.930> V<00:04:34.110> animal<00:04:34.590> that<00:04:34.919> I<00:04:34.979> put<00:04:35.310> into<00:04:35.520> it

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
less of the V animal that I put into it

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:43.070 
less of the V animal that I put into it
maybe<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.789> not<00:04:38.789> so<00:04:39.180> high<00:04:39.930> of<00:04:40.229> an<00:04:40.380> L<00:04:41.479> of<00:04:42.479> the

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
maybe a not so high of an L of the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.279 
maybe a not so high of an L of the
caramel<00:04:43.650> malt<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.509> color<00:04:45.840> would

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
caramel malt so that the color would

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.249 
caramel malt so that the color would
tone<00:04:46.500> down<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.830> color<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:47.750> of<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:49.050> and

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
tone down the color and of it and

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.980 
tone down the color and of it and
probably<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.370> little<00:04:50.550> bit<00:04:50.820> that<00:04:51.240> it<00:04:51.360> would<00:04:51.509> you

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
probably a little bit that it would you

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.749 
probably a little bit that it would you
bring<00:04:52.410> out<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.620> pumpkin<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.160> little<00:04:53.460> bit<00:04:53.580> more

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
bring out the pumpkin a little bit more

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.540 
bring out the pumpkin a little bit more
I<00:04:53.820> believe<00:04:54.150> but<00:04:54.389> I<00:04:54.539> did<00:04:54.810> like<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.800> hops<00:04:56.039> I<00:04:56.280> used

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
I believe but I did like the hops I used

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.490 
I believe but I did like the hops I used
I<00:04:56.729> do<00:04:56.789> like<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.180> earthy<00:04:57.690> tones<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.199> think<00:04:58.410> the

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
I do like the earthy tones I think the

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.390 
I do like the earthy tones I think the
bago<00:04:58.889> would<00:04:59.220> go<00:04:59.430> well<00:04:59.729> with<00:04:59.870> the<00:05:00.870> pumpkin<00:05:01.410> so

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
bago would go well with the pumpkin so

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.430 
bago would go well with the pumpkin so
I'm<00:05:02.820> going<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.030> finish<00:05:03.210> this<00:05:03.330> up<00:05:03.720> guys<00:05:04.020> but<00:05:04.410> I

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
I'm going to finish this up guys but I

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.390
