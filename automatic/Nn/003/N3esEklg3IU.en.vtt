00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the thing that is the most surprising is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.350 
the thing that is the most surprising is
the<00:01:05.910> ride<00:01:06.590> quality

the ride quality
you<00:01:08.660> know<00:01:08.750> I<00:01:08.780> talked<00:01:09.050> about<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.500> in<00:01:09.560> the

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
you know I talked about that in the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.600 
you know I talked about that in the
first<00:01:09.950> video<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:12.140> michelin<00:01:12.770> hydro<00:01:13.400> edged

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
first video and the michelin hydro edged

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.680 
first video and the michelin hydro edged
higher<00:01:13.970> is<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.450> much<00:01:16.030> much<00:01:17.470> softer<00:01:19.360> riding<00:01:20.360> tire

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
higher is a much much softer riding tire

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.070 
higher is a much much softer riding tire
that<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.230> Pirelli<00:01:21.500> before<00:01:22.070> was<00:01:22.540> which<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:23.870> me

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
that the Pirelli before was which to me

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.250 
that the Pirelli before was which to me
seems<00:01:24.470> very<00:01:24.880> unusual<00:01:25.880> for<00:01:26.210> an<00:01:26.660> ultra-high

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
seems very unusual for an ultra-high

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.570 
seems very unusual for an ultra-high
mileages<00:01:27.950> tire<00:01:29.590> used<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.920> get<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.250> real

nice<00:01:31.850> soft<00:01:32.360> ride<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:33.320> had<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.590> use<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.920> softer

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
nice soft ride you had to use the softer

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.850 
nice soft ride you had to use the softer
rubbers<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.990> know<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.230> softer<00:01:36.650> rubber

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
rubbers and you know the softer rubber

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.500 
rubbers and you know the softer rubber
stump<00:01:37.430> get<00:01:37.730> as<00:01:38.620> high<00:01:39.620> a<00:01:39.650> mileage<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:40.970> it's<00:01:41.270> kind

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
stump get as high a mileage so it's kind

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.150 
stump get as high a mileage so it's kind

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
would give the Michelin a 5 I'd give the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.350 
would give the Michelin a 5 I'd give the
Pirelli<00:01:52.760> P<00:01:53.119> 4<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:54.770> 4<00:01:55.990> still<00:01:56.990> not<00:01:57.229> bad<00:01:57.470> but<00:01:57.920> not

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
Pirelli P 4 of 4 still not bad but not

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.450 
Pirelli P 4 of 4 still not bad but not
not<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.660> ride<00:01:59.869> of<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.260> mission<00:02:01.510> handling

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
not the ride of the mission handling

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.460 
not the ride of the mission handling
handling<00:02:04.460> I<00:02:05.210> would<00:02:05.420> give<00:02:05.660> to<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:06.020> Pirelli

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
handling I would give to the Pirelli

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.010 
handling I would give to the Pirelli
before<00:02:07.460> by<00:02:08.060> that<00:02:08.270> same<00:02:08.540> five<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:09.050> four<00:02:09.260> margin

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
before by that same five to four margin

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.410 
before by that same five to four margin
the<00:02:12.020> hydro<00:02:12.830> edge<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.519> think<00:02:13.790> it's<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.150> same

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
the hydro edge and I think it's the same

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.320 
the hydro edge and I think it's the same
thing<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.720> gives<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.320> nice<00:02:15.830> ride

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
thing that gives it that nice ride

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.009 
thing that gives it that nice ride
it<00:02:18.290> seems<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:19.190> little<00:02:19.660> squishy<00:02:20.660> on<00:02:20.690> the

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
it seems a little squishy on the

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.170 
it seems a little squishy on the
handling<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.860> know<00:02:22.280> it's<00:02:22.489> I've<00:02:22.880> used

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
handling and that I know it's I've used

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.060 
handling and that I know it's I've used
many<00:02:23.390> different<00:02:23.840> terms<00:02:24.019> between<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.860> last

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
many different terms between the last

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.320 
many different terms between the last
video<00:02:25.519> in<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:25.850> one<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.510> is<00:02:26.570> kind<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.140> hard<00:02:27.470> to

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
video in this one it is kind of hard to

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.100 
video in this one it is kind of hard to
describe<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:31.860> just<00:02:31.980> not<00:02:32.370> as

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
describe but it just it's just not as

describe but it just it's just not as
crisp<00:02:34.110> as<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.890> forelli<00:02:35.760> fee<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.270> was<00:02:36.510> it's

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
crisp as the forelli fee for was it's

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.490 
crisp as the forelli fee for was it's
not<00:02:37.530> bad<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:39.150> think<00:02:39.569> what<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.200> do<00:02:40.350> is

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
not bad I I think what you have to do is

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.010 
not bad I I think what you have to do is
make<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.740> decision<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.670> where<00:02:42.630> are<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.870> going

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
make a decision on where are you going

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.410 
make a decision on where are you going
to<00:02:43.080> use<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.470> tire<00:02:43.760> if<00:02:44.760> you're<00:02:44.970> going<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.180> spend

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
to use the tire if you're going to spend

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.630 
to use the tire if you're going to spend
a<00:02:45.540> whole<00:02:45.810> lot<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:46.380> time<00:02:46.680> just<00:02:47.040> out<00:02:47.250> on<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.430> wide

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
a whole lot of time just out on the wide

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.809 
a whole lot of time just out on the wide
open<00:02:48.030> highways<00:02:48.450> like<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.989> do<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:50.069> softer<00:02:50.580> ride

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
open highways like I do the softer ride

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.140 
open highways like I do the softer ride
is<00:02:51.450> nice<00:02:52.220> if<00:02:53.220> you're<00:02:53.370> gonna<00:02:53.489> spend<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.850> lot<00:02:54.090> of

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
is nice if you're gonna spend a lot of

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.070 
is nice if you're gonna spend a lot of

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
lots of freeway setting where you've got

side door to side door I think the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.830

these michelin hydro edges that's not
bad<00:03:42.060> for<00:03:42.980> my<00:03:43.980> little<00:03:44.220> Dodge<00:03:44.459> Magnum<00:03:44.880> with<00:03:45.360> the

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
highways I would be very happy but

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.460 
highways I would be very happy but
that's<00:03:54.650> that's<00:03:55.010> not<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.520> norm<00:03:55.880> it<00:03:56.630> seems<00:03:57.140> that

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
that's that's not the norm it seems that

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.110 
that's that's not the norm it seems that
the<00:03:57.650> mileage<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.400> at<00:03:58.640> least<00:03:59.240> as<00:03:59.630> good<00:04:00.610> but<00:04:01.610> at

the mileage is at least as good but at
