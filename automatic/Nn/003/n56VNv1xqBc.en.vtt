00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.840
 subway when she comes the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.119
 Of course, subway also goes with the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.779
 necessary small change is even a taxi 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.720
 ready 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.820
 or you live in your own car 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.820
 with the fixed costs the gasoline and in 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.650
 park fees but there are resourceful 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.329
 Business people said hey too if you 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.719
 you do not need your car 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.070
 own power gives carsharing in berlin 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.860
 There are many providers I call it 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.350
 Four car to go with the smarts multi city 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.719
 from citroen with the electric cars city 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.600
 came with the cheapest fare but 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.309
 with monthly fee and drive now from 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.289
 bmw there is still that I try the same 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.390
 but generally how does that work? 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.340
 at DriveNow I have I made 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.440
 I registered in the network then I am 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.239
 with my driving license to sixth the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.370
 have on the driver's license so and nfc 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.949
 It's ok, too 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.510
 I can now have three cars 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.360
 So far, of course, I could search for that 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.979
 do not go in but with the nfc chip 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.869
 on the driver's license I can the car 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.750
 now catch up with the counter 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.580
 later start and loose the principle 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.960
 is at all the same in practice has 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.700
 then you have an app on the phone with 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.070
 his card we will all be available 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.600
 I can also see my cars 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.390
 show last rides and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.470
 have reservations for 15 minutes 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.060
 I can do that too 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.740
 to navigate 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.450
 if necessary, I can the car too 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.430
 flash it via app that is 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.860
 especially at night in large parking lots 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.420
 of course super handy when I am at 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.970
 car i always go around first 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.930
 look at me if it has any damage here 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.420
 example is on the back 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.000
 fender what more about it equal there 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.430
 minis in various form also convertibles 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.100
 but this rare then still 1er bmws 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.170
 and x1 opened the car as just 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.790
 explained with the driver's license one stops 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.500
 The doors open and you open 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.149
 Can get in club door on the inside 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.100

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.360
 presented to a small mini and will 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.860
 welcomed by name 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.899
 and then I have to do a few 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.310
 Unfortunately, this information is and it is 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.630
 manko you do not know if the time is right now 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.940
 already running or not yet 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.350
 patty is called our car I press times 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.550
 to state the pin admit it's something that 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.110
 so not just someone with that 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.470
 stolen driving license can drive 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.420
 how clean is the vehicle nadal put 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.050
 down to the ground we'll see otherwise 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.900
 Okay, let's say the thing is good 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.910
 I press well too next step I 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.250
 get the damages listed and 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.870
 can then buy a protection package 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.030
 that costs one euro and the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.760
 Co-participation becomes in case of damage 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.350
 from 750 to 350 euros we have lowered 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.390
 just seen there is already something there 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.070
 it happened quickly, one should 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.170
 consider if you do that I do it 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.270
 almost always then you can start the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.770
 cars have all the navi i can do right away 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.870
 choose if I want to navigate or 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.489
 only the card wants to see everything 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.620
 hard to Tomtom so well 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.200
 actually no major problems 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.120
 and then will start driven at 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.480
 nice weather, of course, if you have it 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:12.430
 with open sunroof so nice thing 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.500
 and 321 and zack 31 cents per minute 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.720
 the fun costs a kilometer or not 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.880
 Monthly price of bmw x1 if you take him 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.739
 costs 34 cents per minute 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.840
 You can also buy packages because you look 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.070
 best times on the homepage others 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.840
 providers have partly low 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.820
 minute prices will take but then 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.299
 kilometer prices such as car to 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.739
 go 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.239
 everyone should be driving himself 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.959
 analyze and then in provider 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.970
 choose 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.549
 yes, where do you park such a part? 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.230
 every case in the business district on the 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.970
 navi links the blue is the business district 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.620
 the light right is no longer in the 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.239
 business district could be anywhere for free 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.430
 Parking I also have a parking space 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.140
 found out the car and will 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.090
 asked why I want to park this 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.350
 costs 10 cents per minute but nobody 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.390
 I can snap the car away 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.040
 I can continue to refuel 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.650
 course, drive now or the paid 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.090
 end book then I will 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.850
 reminded to look again because 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.100
 of course it is not to haye 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.370
 yes and that was my experience with 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.500
 Drivenow benefits at all carsharing 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.480
 Suppliers are basically the same 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.709
 you do not have to pay for gasoline 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.170
 insurance no tax no 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.700
 Parking fees benefit at drivenow's 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.430
 I think the good availability of the 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.380
 vehicles and are great dinger disadvantage 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.780
 when drivenow you just pay the one 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.370
 minutes 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.830
 price that is quite well calculable 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.540
 But in the traffic jam will be expensive if it times 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.100
 in Berlin jams and there is 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.930
 Of course, not something like a taximeter 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.310
 where you can see how much coal you have 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.430
 because you have already seen that process 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.290
 Only directly after the ride and if 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.610
 One then got an e-mail this one 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.940
 ride we have made 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.680
 that has ge costs 4 euro 41 now you are 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.940
 her as your experiences are so tuned 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.530
 with carsharing like others 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.090
 providers describe it in the 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.800
 comments subscribe me would be me 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.240
 look forward and have a nice time 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.240
