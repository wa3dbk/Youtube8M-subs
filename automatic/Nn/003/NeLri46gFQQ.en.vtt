00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
implemented so the more we work together

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.350 
implemented so the more we work together
the<00:00:31.779> better<00:00:32.439> so<00:00:32.829> it's<00:00:33.010> different<00:00:33.430> areas<00:00:34.210> of

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360

why

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
why

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.399 
why
today<00:01:08.549> was<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> really<00:01:08.909> remarkable<00:01:09.750> example<00:01:10.380> of

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
today was a really remarkable example of

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.850 
today was a really remarkable example of
how<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.280> game<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:12.090> actually<00:01:12.600> bring<00:01:13.229> Gao<00:01:13.530> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
how a game can actually bring Gao and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.899 
how a game can actually bring Gao and
develop<00:01:15.290> discussion<00:01:16.290> controversy<00:01:17.250> working

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
develop discussion controversy working

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.620 
develop discussion controversy working
out<00:01:18.000> solutions<00:01:19.310> all<00:01:20.310> around<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.090> issues<00:01:21.360> of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
out solutions all around the issues of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.969 
out solutions all around the issues of
the<00:01:21.840> self-directed<00:01:22.350> support<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the self-directed support and

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.070 
the self-directed support and
individualized<00:01:23.490> budgets<00:01:23.940> and<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.570> guess<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> is

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
individualized budgets and I guess it is

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.139 
individualized budgets and I guess it is
a<00:01:25.110> really<00:01:25.650> good<00:01:25.800> opportunity<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:27.000> actually

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
a really good opportunity to actually

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.389 
a really good opportunity to actually

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
good I think training to a student but

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.310 
good I think training to a student but
equally<00:02:53.640> it'd<00:02:54.060> be<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.299> very<00:02:54.329> very<00:02:54.720> good<00:02:54.840> tool<00:02:55.290> to

equally it'd be a very very good tool to

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.310 
equally it'd be a very very good tool to

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
work is about a games a really good way

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.960 
work is about a games a really good way
of<00:03:26.200> doing<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.770> because<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.220> actually<00:03:27.670> people

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
of doing that because it actually people

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.660 
of doing that because it actually people
become<00:03:28.420> quite<00:03:28.750> relaxed<00:03:29.710> in<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:29.950> atmosphere

become quite relaxed in that atmosphere

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.200 
become quite relaxed in that atmosphere
and<00:03:31.000> allow<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.110> let<00:03:32.560> go<00:03:32.740> of<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.940> kind<00:03:34.180> of

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
and allow and let go of this kind of

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.570 
and allow and let go of this kind of
preconceived<00:03:34.960> ideas<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.830> really<00:03:36.250> will<00:03:36.460> start

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
preconceived ideas and really will start

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.640 
preconceived ideas and really will start
to<00:03:36.880> play<00:03:37.090> around<00:03:37.330> with<00:03:37.600> new<00:03:37.810> concepts<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.500> be

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
to play around with new concepts and be

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.250 
to play around with new concepts and be
quite<00:03:38.920> creative<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.120> think<00:03:40.240> it's<00:03:40.600> been<00:03:40.870> and

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
quite creative so I think it's been and

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.330 
quite creative so I think it's been and
it's<00:03:41.410> just<00:03:41.620> something<00:03:41.920> that's<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.190> bit

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
it's just something that's a bit

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.310 
it's just something that's a bit
different<00:03:42.370> it's<00:03:42.940> an<00:03:43.060> added<00:03:43.300> value<00:03:43.330> really<00:03:44.110> to

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
different it's an added value really to

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.710 
different it's an added value really to
their<00:03:44.470> learning<00:03:44.950> experience<00:03:45.670> we<00:03:46.150> are<00:03:46.420> going

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
their learning experience we are going

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.170 
their learning experience we are going
to<00:03:46.900> inform<00:03:47.410> our<00:03:47.890> practice<00:03:48.220> into<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.060> know

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
to inform our practice into you know

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.570 
to inform our practice into you know
what's<00:03:49.690> happening<00:03:50.110> in<00:03:50.260> terms<00:03:50.470> of<00:03:50.710> social<00:03:51.220> work

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
what's happening in terms of social work

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.610 
what's happening in terms of social work
and<00:03:51.790> so<00:03:52.000> we<00:03:52.210> need<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.510> be<00:03:52.630> equipped<00:03:52.959> enough<00:03:53.260> to

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
and so we need to be equipped enough to

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.560 
and so we need to be equipped enough to
be<00:03:53.740> able<00:03:53.800> to<00:03:53.950> do<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.340> job<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:54.730> these<00:03:55.209> are

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.570 

because<00:04:38.770> not<00:04:39.770> only<00:04:39.800> does<00:04:40.190> it<00:04:40.250> could<00:04:40.490> be

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
because not only does it could be

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.820 
because not only does it could be
different<00:04:41.120> questions<00:04:41.629> so<00:04:42.259> we<00:04:42.440> all<00:04:42.560> have

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
chance to discuss them it's also gave us

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.009 
chance to discuss them it's also gave us
some<00:04:47.900> direction<00:04:48.710> as<00:04:48.830> well
