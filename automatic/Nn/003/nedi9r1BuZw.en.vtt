00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.599
 I'm visual consists of a work of 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.180
 puppets and in a song together 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.910
 they form what is with bicycle this 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.380
 invitation to bed because one ends 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.380
 the child protection schedule 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.869
 well 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.350
 says it 's reports a founded group 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.110
 40 years ago and we have worked in 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.809
 continued for 23 time to produce the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.180
 effect I think we try to do 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.300
 for our work in particular with the 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.920
 software and generate a poetry 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.420
 rethink the juan bicycle project 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.740
 of coal and know if they were warping for 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.530
 do it because she 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.720
 they were artists who could do 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.450
 enough sensitivity to be able 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.450
 capture what was juan 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.159
 the end we were using today this is 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.400
 the technique of shadows are plastic 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.290
 transparent which colored 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.720
 basically what we do is a 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.190
 screen a light leaning on the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.190
 screen the character 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.460
 at first we talked a lot about the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.829
 blackjack of who was to be john like 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.860
 it had to be the physiognomy of juan 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.320
 for us it has been fantastic 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.060
 and a lot of song feedback 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.220
 for the audiovisual and the visual with the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.800
 song for us was like a game 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.330
 we are invited to sleep when the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.330
 we are inviting to dream 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.670
 the song that we wrote with román and 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.770
 stick men and that román already had 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.840
 participated in many music albums 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.350
 for children first we do not stop to 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.410
 think a bit from 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:08.650
 from where the message comes for who 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.650
 it was that we were singing to him we arrived 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.930
 to this idea of how good that the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.700
 ministry is to find the point of 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.490
 view of the child just happened to look 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.670
 let's say first subscribe melody we 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.020
 we started humming tunes we 're not 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.540
 in the place of the child that we 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.870
 we also went and the cute message that 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.870
 we wanted 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.410
 the stadium was easy because I kill 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.840
 has a voice a precious voice is not very 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.120
 sweet is what we were looking for me 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.160
 I felt like the last part 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.610
 It cost me a little but a match 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.610
 hard 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.230
 the director of the channel was very close 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.459
 with the ability to include sign language and 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.940
 good we found with carmina since he has 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.709
 worked on our channel project and 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.540
 it was very simple carolina of them had 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.420
 learned the song when the 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.550
 study 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.590
 he stood in front of the camera we threw it 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.069
 I think two or three times a song and 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.000
 It was soon, although she is at the 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.200
 left below the screen 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.620
 universalizes the message left in 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.620
 bike 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.180
 it's good they do not just put up a sign that 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.980
 say here finished the schedule of 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.560
 child protection as good much 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.280
 they are at and if it is not good to put a 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.960
 a video anything with love and and 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.260
 with art 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.620
 that even if it's to give a message that 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.000
 it's good it 's time to go to sleep to 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.090
 the kids that you could do something a lot 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.070
 more technically but anything that 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.980
 be with Gary or art much more 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.740
 remember if you get much more excited about 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.690
 do it than what they are helping you 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.000
 understand what to do at the time 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.890
 what is going to sleep that I think is 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.910
 cute over the day with something like that he got 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.500
 very much love and what I hope is that 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.740
 nothing that people receive from it 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.740
 way
