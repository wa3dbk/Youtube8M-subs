00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
solar but right here it's basically just

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.849

pineapple<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.460> kind<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.000> pointless<00:01:06.150> but

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
pineapple it's kind of pointless but

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.210 
pineapple it's kind of pointless but
it's<00:01:06.750> pretty<00:01:07.200> cool<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.590> i<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:08.040> that

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
it's pretty cool so i like to have that

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.990 
it's pretty cool so i like to have that
but<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:09.270> doesn't<00:01:09.420> really<00:01:10.020> change<00:01:10.170> anything<00:01:10.470> so

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
but it doesn't really change anything so

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.080 
but it doesn't really change anything so
after<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.299> click<00:01:12.689> Next<00:01:14.090> it'll

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
after that you just click Next it'll

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.760 
after that you just click Next it'll
just<00:01:15.119> say<00:01:15.509> make<00:01:15.810> sure<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:16.560> USB
