00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:19.690
 Cancer heart attack among the respondents 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:20.409
 People who have overcome diseases such as Dong strokes have a healthy diet if they can return to the past and exercise every day 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.630
 Want to 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:28.240
 And in the past it did not perform always with the reason I knew that is necessary 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.550

 If you have an answer 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.930
 This is quite a lot of people thought that I think we apply it 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:45.700
 It is also for my own health to improve this 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.750
 I towards the blog 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.829

00:01:49.750 --> 00:02:02.940
 They went their own money every day in the 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:08.240
 I try to wear every day I respect meal I ate from it with muscle training videos 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.250
 Still a little Nde like never began wearing it from April 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.120
 Although the number is small 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.420
 As we update every day, refer to this as reference 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.890
 Exercise just a little bit everyday 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:25.890
 Please have a good meal 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:29.610
 In the example of April 1st, for breakfast, mrp protein and oatmeal 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.640
 I drink a shake called iced coffee with green juice 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.540
 Lunch is Sundub set meal- 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.770
 Almonds for snacks 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.700
 Toka dinner cute rice sashimi fried spinach Itamea in 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:49.760
 It has become something like 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.870
 With regard to meals, it is important to take priority to things with high nutritional value too 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.650
 I will 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.410
 Foods with a lot of calories and no nutrition 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.810
 What 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.110
 Since it has flooded the streets what those things want as much as possible a lady ask to avoid it is 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.870
 Please eat 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:16.820
 Once Ya' I Noman since it is not so much to do many hours I also regard after muscle training 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:18.710
 Roughly even though I often from a few minutes to 10 minutes Toka training time of the side which is also 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.680
 It is to go efficiently 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:26.730
 I think I can continue before 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:30.300
 Of course when you have time, you can do it for an hour or so 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:36.819
 Because I think that many people can not take such time every day 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:42.840
 I think it would be better to go in about 5 minutes while watching this video 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:48.470
 The funny thing is I am writing to spend the other in Monet the future Happy 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.470
 After money health is about human relations 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.890
 Risk taking time after that 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.890
 To continue to grow 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.770
 I've also written a place called investment in the family 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:13.340
 At the end I also write that I have a kind of village respect for myself . 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.340
 I think that it is good to read in one building 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.430
 that's all
