 Star Wars is a worldwide phenomenon 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.620
 almost every person on this planet 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.210

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.719
 It was not just our pop culture

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.440
 film industry 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.500

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.340
 fiction still strongly influenced by the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 Pressing the cold war and are 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.900
 It is topically a new artful art of 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.059
 filmemachens conquers the dream factory of 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.400
 author film script and directing

 more often in a person united film 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.830
 is more than ever as a work of art 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.520
 considered and not as pure 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.170
 entertainment 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.060
 the topics are realistic and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.020
 socially critical sex and violence 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.850
 finally acceptable 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.440
 The Europeans are the pioneers in particular 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.149
 the French nouvelle vague 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.920
 even the classic heroic 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.350
 western is replaced by the gloomy 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.000
 dirty italo-western from former ones 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.800
 Revolver heroes become unscrupulous 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 schurken the pocher should be considered as new

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.500
 deep into the seventies 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.240
 stop springs from some of the biggest 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.940
 movie classics like chinatown the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.080
 Final exam of the pate taxi driver and 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.759
 apocalypse now 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.500
 the latter two are still of those 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.720
 young director martin scorsese and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.069
 francis ford coppola just these two 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.530
 made for the highlights of her 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.420
 generation to two of her friends

 also prepared the new hollywood for 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.170
 always changing 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.729
 steven spielberg and george lucas like that 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.110
 appeared one of the most influential 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.649
 movies of all time 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.929
 the white hai roja 1975 so still two 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.399
 years before star wars should turn mountain 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.050
 horrorfilm than the date 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.240
 most successful movie of all time 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.130
 exposing the white hai left 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.410
 hollywood recognize that once event for 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.060
 Possible are young directors 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.890
 from the era and the claim of the new 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.959
 Hollywood should get the chance 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.940
 expensive elaborate production for one 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.649
 potentially huge audience 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.869
 including george lucas 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.849
 his vision of a space saga the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.050
 the entertaining and adventurous 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.849
 flair the film of his childhood 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.830
 you should transport yourself 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.360
 only times the moment before you with the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.300
 expectation of the previously known 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.959
 at that time sat in the cinema and suddenly that too 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.959
 got face 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.640
 classic epochal filmmusic combined 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.590
 with unprecedented visual effects 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.370
 and an artistic intelligent 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.740
 bildsprache 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.660
 The audience was enthusiastic about the white one 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.130
 hai and star wars broke through in such a way 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.750
 fast the magic 100 million 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.340
 dollar baffle that looks like that 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.780
 Concept of blockbuster returns 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.460
 Although this actually describes one 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.870
 aviation bomb from the second world war 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.240
 but the queues at the box office 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.400
 his been so long that she 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.020
 literally burst the block 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.240
 but above all star was justified with it 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.140
 a new era of blockbuster cinema the 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.240
 continues today 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.770
 and if one concludes one 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.600
 pick moment in movie history 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.610
 would have to deal with the reception of the 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.230
 changing the audience of the film forever 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.230
 then maybe it should be 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.420
 have historically what the world 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.160
 but changed my mind to do this before 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.480
 all want to take her to see more videos 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.650
 this direction I write 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.420
 but please in the comments 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.420
 I look forward to it and until Tuesday
