Juan<00:00:09.389> 28<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.050> I'll<00:00:10.980> start<00:00:11.250> at<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.400> back<00:00:11.580> of

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
Juan 28 and I'll start at the back of

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.760 
Juan 28 and I'll start at the back of
the<00:00:11.790> boat<00:00:11.969> with<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> exhaust<00:00:13.820> and<00:00:15.529> my<00:00:16.529> phone

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
the boat with the exhaust and my phone

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.760 
the boat with the exhaust and my phone
but<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.100> can<00:00:17.220> see<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.550> exhaust<00:00:17.880> here<00:00:18.619> just<00:00:19.619> a

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
but you can see the exhaust here just a

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.040 
but you can see the exhaust here just a
small<00:00:20.279> little<00:00:20.640> exhaust<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.300> fairly

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
small little exhaust it's fairly

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.759 
small little exhaust it's fairly
straightforward

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
straightforward

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.830 
straightforward
note<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> lack<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.580> stainless<00:00:24.060> steel<00:00:24.269> screws

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
note the lack of stainless steel screws

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.429 
note the lack of stainless steel screws
definitely<00:00:27.840> one<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:27.990> use<00:00:28.080> stainless<00:00:28.260> steel

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
definitely one of use stainless steel

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
definitely one of use stainless steel
screws<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.340> was<00:00:29.460> fairly<00:00:29.670> easy<00:00:29.910> just

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
screws but that was fairly easy just

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.720 
screws but that was fairly easy just
drill<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.570> back<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.990> install<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> exhaust

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
drill to the back to install the exhaust

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.780 
drill to the back to install the exhaust
and<00:00:32.730> then<00:00:33.600> well<00:00:34.530> with<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> exhaust<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.610> want

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
and then well with the exhaust you want

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.250 
and then well with the exhaust you want
to<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.210> off<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.630> back<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.079> boat

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
to have that off the back of the boat

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.319 
to have that off the back of the boat
because<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.920> fumes<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.850> getting<00:00:39.210> away

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
because it is fumes and getting away

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.660 
because it is fumes and getting away
from<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> cat<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.170> cabin<00:00:40.530> area<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.040> also

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
from the cat the cabin area and also

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.340 
from the cat the cabin area and also
blows<00:00:42.030> really<00:00:42.270> hot<00:00:42.540> air<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.050> don't<00:00:43.200> want

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
blows really hot air so you don't want

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.630 
blows really hot air so you don't want
to<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:45.110> off<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.379> side<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> boat<00:00:47.010> you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
to have it off the side of the boat you

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.810 
to have it off the side of the boat you
also<00:00:47.820> work<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.600> take<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.899> water<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.320> well<00:00:49.820> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
also work and take in water as well and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.110 
also work and take in water as well and
you<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.329> consider<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:51.899> well<00:00:52.199> so

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
you have to consider that as well so

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.790 
you have to consider that as well so
basically<00:00:54.120> though<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.590> heater

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
basically though here is the heater

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.279 
basically though here is the heater
there's<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> Aaronic<00:00:56.760> heater<00:00:57.020> and<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.050> can

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
there's the Aaronic heater and you can

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.189 
there's the Aaronic heater and you can
see<00:00:58.469> how<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.100> mounted<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.199> board

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
see how I have it mounted on this board

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.619 
see how I have it mounted on this board
here<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.670> board<00:01:02.969> are<00:01:03.090> actually<00:01:03.420> took

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
here and that board are actually took

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.960 
here and that board are actually took
out<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> could<00:01:04.320> put<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> plate<00:01:05.460> mounting<00:01:05.850> on

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
out so I could put the plate mounting on

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.880 
out so I could put the plate mounting on
and<00:01:06.180> drill<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.510> hole<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> heating<00:01:07.560> duct

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
and drill this hole for the heating duct

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.730 
and drill this hole for the heating duct
but<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.479> bottom<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.020> inside<00:01:10.439> there's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
but on the bottom on the inside there's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.700 
but on the bottom on the inside there's
two<00:01:11.040> hoses<00:01:11.970> actually<00:01:12.570> one<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.530> air

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
two hoses actually one is the the air

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.340 
two hoses actually one is the the air
intake<00:01:14.630> actually<00:01:15.630> sorry<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> air<00:01:16.200> in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
intake actually sorry this is the air in

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.340 
intake actually sorry this is the air in
taken<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> exhaust<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:18.170> coming<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.259> from

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
taken but the exhaust is coming up from

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.749 
taken but the exhaust is coming up from
the<00:01:19.439> bottom<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.799> there's<00:01:19.950> just<00:01:20.070> an<00:01:20.220> exhaust

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the bottom and there's just an exhaust

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.850 
the bottom and there's just an exhaust
tube<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.960> comes<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> heater<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.799> it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
tube that comes with the heater and it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.380 
tube that comes with the heater and it
runs<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> back<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:23.970> tricky<00:01:24.360> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
runs out the back and a little tricky to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.350 
runs out the back and a little tricky to
fit<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> back<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:25.380> able<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.799> it

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
fit in the back but I was able to do it

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.969 
fit in the back but I was able to do it
that<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> wiring<00:01:28.080> harness<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that I have the wiring harness here and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.340 
that I have the wiring harness here and
then<00:01:29.880> one<00:01:30.180> set<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.509> wires<00:01:30.659> goes<00:01:30.990> over<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
then one set of wires goes over the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
then one set of wires goes over the
batteries<00:01:31.770> which<00:01:31.979> are<00:01:32.250> underneath<00:01:33.150> all<00:01:33.299> this

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
batteries which are underneath all this

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.060 
batteries which are underneath all this
garbage<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.140> there's<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> battery<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
garbage in here there's the battery and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.880 
garbage in here there's the battery and
then<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> other<00:01:36.299> wack<00:01:36.540> wires<00:01:36.900> go<00:01:37.320> into<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
then the other wack wires go into the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
then the other wack wires go into the
controls<00:01:38.780> by<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.960> by<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.110> fuse<00:01:40.439> panel<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
controls by that by the fuse panel and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.280 
controls by that by the fuse panel and
there's<00:01:41.670> also<00:01:42.060> underneath<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> fuel

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
there's also underneath here the fuel

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.770 
there's also underneath here the fuel
line<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:44.040> goes<00:01:44.670> into<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.090> into<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> diesel

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
line that goes into the into the diesel

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.319 
line that goes into the into the diesel
fuel<00:01:45.990> tank<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.759> that's<00:01:47.759> all<00:01:47.939> there<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.119> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
fuel tank so that's all there is to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.270 
fuel tank so that's all there is to
really<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.470> heater<00:01:49.799> is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
really see there that the heater is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
then underneath you can see here is the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.670 
then underneath you can see here is the
heating<00:02:10.470> duct<00:02:10.709> coming<00:02:11.129> into<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.459> cross

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
heating duct coming into the cross

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.710 
heating duct coming into the cross
and<00:02:12.769> then<00:02:13.129> that<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:13.549> I<00:02:13.640> just<00:02:14.030> once<00:02:14.569> again

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
and then that just I just once again

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.509 
and then that just I just once again
drilled<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.200> big<00:02:15.349> hole<00:02:15.530> into<00:02:15.769> this<00:02:15.890> wall<00:02:16.310> this

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
drilled a big hole into this wall this

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.369 
drilled a big hole into this wall this
is<00:02:16.579> the<00:02:16.849> sink<00:02:17.150> in<00:02:17.299> here<00:02:17.510> just<00:02:17.750> hop<00:02:17.870> back<00:02:17.900> up<00:02:18.260> so

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
is the sink in here just hop back up so

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.210 
is the sink in here just hop back up so
you<00:02:18.470> can<00:02:18.620> see<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:20.000> there's<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.360> sink<00:02:20.659> and<00:02:21.220> then

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
you can see so there's the sink and then

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.759 
you can see so there's the sink and then
it<00:02:22.370> comes<00:02:22.640> through<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.200> can<00:02:24.379> see<00:02:24.560> how

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
it comes through and you can see how

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.039 
it comes through and you can see how
I've<00:02:24.950> run<00:02:25.549> runs<00:02:25.819> it<00:02:25.970> through<00:02:26.000> here<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:26.780> then<00:02:26.959> I

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
I've run runs it through here and then I

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.440 
I've run runs it through here and then I
just<00:02:27.230> curved<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.680> around<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.250> then<00:02:29.239> right

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
just curved it around and then right

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.979 
just curved it around and then right
here<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.470> outlet<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:31.819> I<00:02:32.239> mean<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:32.810> could

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
here is the outlet so I mean I could

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.050 
here is the outlet so I mean I could
have<00:02:33.079> taken<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.439> further<00:02:33.620> forward<00:02:34.099> but<00:02:34.280> this

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
have taken it further forward but this

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.849 
have taken it further forward but this
is<00:02:35.269> it's<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.599> small<00:02:35.720> cabin<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.439> this<00:02:36.650> heater

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
is it's a small cabin and this heater

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.670 
is it's a small cabin and this heater
throws<00:02:37.459> plenty<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:37.909> heat<00:02:38.829> on<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:40.010> other<00:02:40.159> side

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
throws plenty of heat on the other side

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.740 
throws plenty of heat on the other side
this<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.920> fuel<00:02:43.519> tank<00:02:43.549> and<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.329> haven't<00:02:44.599> cut

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
this is the fuel tank and I haven't cut

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.839 
this is the fuel tank and I haven't cut
the<00:02:44.840> wires<00:02:45.049> all<00:02:45.290> secured<00:02:45.739> but<00:02:45.889> this<00:02:46.609> is<00:02:46.760> the

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
the wires all secured but this is the

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.470 
the wires all secured but this is the
fuel<00:02:47.120> line<00:02:47.359> running<00:02:47.599> back<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.500> had<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:49.480> drill

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
fuel line running back so I had to drill

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.449 
fuel line running back so I had to drill
into<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.139> fuel<00:02:51.379> tank<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.829> this<00:02:51.980> is<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.220> pump

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
into the fuel tank and this is the pump

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.720 
into the fuel tank and this is the pump
here<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:52.849> it's<00:02:52.970> pretty<00:02:53.180> easy<00:02:53.299> to<00:02:53.510> do<00:02:53.659> and<00:02:53.930> just

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
here and it's pretty easy to do and just

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.809 
here and it's pretty easy to do and just
put<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.849> pump<00:02:56.060> into<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.359> fuel<00:02:56.540> tank<00:02:57.819> being

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
put the pump into the fuel tank being

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.449 
put the pump into the fuel tank being
careful<00:02:59.180> not<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.359> get<00:03:00.260> my<00:03:00.439> shards<00:03:00.920> from<00:03:01.280> my

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
careful not to get my shards from my

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.099 
careful not to get my shards from my
drill<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:01.909> the<00:03:02.000> tank<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.450> because<00:03:02.959> it's

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
drill in the tank and because it's

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.500 
drill in the tank and because it's
diesel<00:03:03.349> didn't<00:03:03.650> have<00:03:03.769> to<00:03:03.859> worry<00:03:04.010> about<00:03:04.129> the<00:03:04.510> it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
diesel didn't have to worry about the it

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.080 
diesel didn't have to worry about the it
blowing<00:03:05.900> up<00:03:06.049> honey<00:03:06.290> but<00:03:06.829> and<00:03:07.400> then<00:03:07.579> I<00:03:07.609> had<00:03:08.000> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
blowing up honey but and then I had the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.599 
blowing up honey but and then I had the
cable<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.540> wire<00:03:08.750> here<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:10.129> this<00:03:10.310> is<00:03:10.430> also

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
cable the wire here so this is also

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.250 
cable the wire here so this is also
coming<00:03:11.000> from<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.239> back<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:11.689> that<00:03:11.720> all<00:03:11.959> feeds

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
coming from the back so that all feeds

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.440 
coming from the back so that all feeds
through<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.799> there's<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.700> there's<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.180> fuel

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
through and there's the there's the fuel

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.379 
through and there's the there's the fuel
line<00:03:14.629> feeding<00:03:14.930> through<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.379> and<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.889> wire

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
line feeding through this and the wire

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.080 
line feeding through this and the wire
runs<00:03:17.389> up<00:03:17.599> and<00:03:17.810> here's<00:03:17.989> my<00:03:18.139> fuse<00:03:18.410> panel<00:03:18.799> and

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
runs up and here's my fuse panel and

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.680 
runs up and here's my fuse panel and
here's<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.180> controls<00:03:20.889> so<00:03:21.889> basically<00:03:22.400> just

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
here's the controls so basically just

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.960 
here's the controls so basically just
press<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.230> on<00:03:24.319> and<00:03:24.639> you'll<00:03:25.639> hear<00:03:25.849> the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
press that so on and you'll hear the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.789 
press that so on and you'll hear the
fuel<00:03:26.239> line<00:03:26.690> ticking<00:03:27.109> a<00:03:27.199> little<00:03:27.440> bit<00:03:27.560> and

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
fuel line ticking a little bit and

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.069 
fuel line ticking a little bit and
there's<00:03:27.949> a<00:03:28.010> little<00:03:28.220> thermostat<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.090> just

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
there's a little thermostat and just

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.899 
there's a little thermostat and just
really<00:03:30.409> easy<00:03:30.530> basically<00:03:31.069> but<00:03:31.370> I'll<00:03:31.609> just<00:03:31.639> turn

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
really easy basically but I'll just turn

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.280 
really easy basically but I'll just turn
it<00:03:32.000> off<00:03:32.090> we<00:03:32.269> don't<00:03:32.329> need<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.599> get<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.810> going<00:03:32.840> and

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
it off we don't need to get it going and

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.530 
it off we don't need to get it going and
it<00:03:33.680> takes<00:03:33.919> maybe<00:03:34.400> five<00:03:34.669> minutes<00:03:34.819> per<00:03:35.150> tick<00:03:35.389> it

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
it takes maybe five minutes per tick it

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.039 
it takes maybe five minutes per tick it
can<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.810> be<00:03:35.930> pumping<00:03:36.889> full<00:03:37.099> heat<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.900> know

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
can it be pumping full heat but you know

so<00:03:53.419> anyway<00:03:54.049> so<00:03:54.109> I<00:03:54.260> hopefully<00:03:54.889> you<00:03:55.280> find<00:03:55.790> this

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
so anyway so I hopefully you find this

video<00:03:56.449> useful<00:03:56.599> I<00:03:57.199> was<00:03:57.709> thinking<00:03:58.040> of<00:03:58.129> taking

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
video useful I was thinking of taking

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.740 
video useful I was thinking of taking
some<00:03:58.489> pictures<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.150> trying<00:03:59.329> to<00:03:59.389> put<00:03:59.540> it<00:03:59.629> into

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
some pictures and trying to put it into

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.240 
some pictures and trying to put it into
a<00:03:59.840> Word<00:04:00.019> document<00:04:00.049> but<00:04:00.560> I<00:04:00.590> figure<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:00.979> video

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
a Word document but I figure the video

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.390 
a Word document but I figure the video
would<00:04:01.430> be<00:04:03.010> explaining<00:04:04.010> how<00:04:04.069> that<00:04:04.129> worked

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
would be explaining how that worked

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.129 
would be explaining how that worked
quite<00:04:04.489> well<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.000> it's<00:04:05.299> an<00:04:05.419> air<00:04:05.540> tronic<00:04:05.930> heater

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
quite well so it's an air tronic heater

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.619 
quite well so it's an air tronic heater
I<00:04:06.379> know<00:04:07.099> there's<00:04:07.400> sbar<00:04:07.849> heaters<00:04:08.150> as<00:04:08.299> well<00:04:08.449> the

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
I know there's sbar heaters as well the

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.210 
I know there's sbar heaters as well the
ironic<00:04:09.109> seem<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.379> be<00:04:09.500> a<00:04:09.530> little<00:04:09.680> bit<00:04:09.859> cheaper

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
ironic seem to be a little bit cheaper

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.180 
ironic seem to be a little bit cheaper
but<00:04:10.669> honey<00:04:11.120> out<00:04:11.269> there<00:04:11.449> you<00:04:11.540> have<00:04:11.629> it<00:04:11.810> on<00:04:12.190> mice

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
but honey out there you have it on mice

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.139 
but honey out there you have it on mice
