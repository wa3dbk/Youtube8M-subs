so<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.709> think<00:02:35.190> they<00:02:35.430> should<00:02:35.580> stop<00:02:35.850> making<00:02:36.240> other

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.100 
so I think they should stop making other
knives<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.430> make<00:02:38.430> all<00:02:38.610> these<00:02:38.850> that's<00:02:39.600> just<00:02:39.930> my
