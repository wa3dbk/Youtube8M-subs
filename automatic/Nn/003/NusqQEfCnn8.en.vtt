00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.710 
pop and planks its first level I said
I'll<00:00:40.170> start<00:00:40.410> dying<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:40.949> as<00:00:41.600> opposed<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
I'll start dying because as opposed to

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.260 
I'll start dying because as opposed to
the<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:43.079> world<00:00:43.379> which<00:00:44.309> I've<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.210> I

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the first world which I've I think I

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.490 
the first world which I've I think I
played<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.629> first<00:00:45.870> world<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> whole

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
played the first world like a whole

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.729 
played the first world like a whole
bunch<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.010> haven't<00:00:47.430> played<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.260> all<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.590> other

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
bunch I haven't played the all the other

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.689 
bunch I haven't played the all the other
worlds<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.250> much<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.730> played<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> first<00:00:51.539> world

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
worlds as much as played the first world

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.459 
worlds as much as played the first world
so<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:54.000> probably<00:00:54.270> will<00:00:54.449> start<00:00:54.690> dying<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.289> as

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
so I probably will start dying here as

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.369 
so I probably will start dying here as
well<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:56.010> probably<00:00:56.640> missing<00:00:57.120> some<00:00:57.809> things<00:00:58.079> I

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
well as probably missing some things I

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.250 
well as probably missing some things I
was<00:00:59.219> pre<00:00:59.609> play<00:00:59.820> though<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.359> i<00:01:00.390> should<00:01:00.899> i<00:01:01.170> should

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
was pre play though so i should i should

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.660 
was pre play though so i should i should
be<00:01:01.530> able<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.770> find<00:01:01.920> everything<00:01:02.750> presumably

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
be able to find everything presumably

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.160 
be able to find everything presumably
anyway<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.820> got<00:01:05.850> these<00:01:06.060> crab<00:01:06.300> guys<00:01:06.600> these<00:01:07.110> are

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
anyway we got these crab guys these are

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.950 
anyway we got these crab guys these are
going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:08.179> common<00:01:09.179> enemy<00:01:09.360> throughout

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
going to be a common enemy throughout

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.630 
going to be a common enemy throughout
this<00:01:10.170> world<00:01:10.410> i<00:01:10.679> go<00:01:11.070> up<00:01:11.160> here<00:01:11.310> i<00:01:11.340> think<00:01:11.429> is<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
this world i go up here i think is the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.140 
this world i go up here i think is the
first<00:01:11.880> puzzle<00:01:12.060> piece<00:01:12.390> yep<00:01:13.789> kind<00:01:14.789> of<00:01:14.820> reminds

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
first puzzle piece yep kind of reminds

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.920 
first puzzle piece yep kind of reminds
me<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.930> first<00:01:16.049> level<00:01:16.259> jungle<00:01:16.619> high<00:01:16.710> jinks

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
me of the first level jungle high jinks

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.899 
me of the first level jungle high jinks
often<00:01:18.930> these<00:01:19.560> things<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.250> will<00:01:20.610> also

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
often these things here will also

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
often these things here will also
contain<00:01:21.180> puzzle<00:01:21.600> pieces<00:01:21.890> sometimes<00:01:22.890> you'll

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
contain puzzle pieces sometimes you'll

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.859 
contain puzzle pieces sometimes you'll
have<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> hit<00:01:23.460> both<00:01:23.729> sides<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.390> order<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.720> get

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
have to hit both sides in order to get

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.510 
have to hit both sides in order to get
it<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.229> don't<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:25.680> they'd<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:26.040> anything<00:01:26.070> like

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
it I don't think they'd do anything like

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.550 
it I don't think they'd do anything like
that<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.210> while<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.470> keep

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
that for a little while but just keep

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.370 
that for a little while but just keep
that<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.890> mind<00:01:29.299> because<00:01:30.299> that's<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.229> let's

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that in mind because that's what let's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.480 
that in mind because that's what let's
start<00:01:31.590> doing<00:01:31.829> it

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
start doing it

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.030 
start doing it
the<00:01:32.790> shredder<00:01:33.150> chess<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.689> one<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:34.040> it's

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the shredder chess with the one up it's

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.310 
the shredder chess with the one up it's
pretty<00:01:35.250> cool<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:36.240> got<00:01:36.360> shipped<00:01:36.689> off<00:01:36.869> there<00:01:37.200> in

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
pretty cool we got shipped off there in

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830 
pretty cool we got shipped off there in
the<00:01:37.409> distance<00:01:37.610> with<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> barrel<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.720> was

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the distance with a barrel here it was

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.070 
the distance with a barrel here it was
jump<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:42.030> I'll<00:01:42.119> take<00:01:42.299> us<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> mini

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
jump in it and I'll take us to a mini

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.580 
jump in it and I'll take us to a mini
game<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.560> sorts<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.280> DK<00:01:44.670> goes<00:01:44.909> into<00:01:45.299> like

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
game of sorts like DK goes into like

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.779 
game of sorts like DK goes into like
what<00:01:46.590> you'd<00:01:46.710> normally<00:01:46.740> go<00:01:47.130> into<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> mini<00:01:47.579> game

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
what you'd normally go into a mini game

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.480 
what you'd normally go into a mini game
but<00:01:48.119> now<00:01:48.539> we<00:01:48.600> got<00:01:48.810> these<00:01:48.930> crap<00:01:49.229> guys<00:01:49.500> which<00:01:49.860> you

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
but now we got these crap guys which you

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.550 
but now we got these crap guys which you
can<00:01:50.640> fight<00:01:50.880> these<00:01:51.000> guys<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.600> two<00:01:51.750> ways<00:01:51.929> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
can fight these guys one of two ways the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.960 
can fight these guys one of two ways the
first<00:01:52.799> thing<00:01:52.950> you'll<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.429> to<00:01:53.610> them<00:01:53.789> I

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
first thing you'll have to do to them I

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.700 
first thing you'll have to do to them I
don't<00:01:54.539> think<00:01:54.570> founding<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.289> ground<00:01:55.530> does

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
don't think founding the ground does

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.830 
don't think founding the ground does
anything<00:01:55.890> no<00:01:56.159> yeah<00:01:56.729> jump<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.179> them<00:01:57.299> first<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
anything no yeah jump on them first and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.419 
anything no yeah jump on them first and
that<00:01:58.200> will<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.439> them<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.890> raise<00:01:59.070> their<00:01:59.100> claws

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
that will get them to raise their claws

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.980 
that will get them to raise their claws
so<00:01:59.700> now<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.060> either<00:02:00.210> ground<00:02:00.539> pound<00:02:00.810> them

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so now you can either ground pound them

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.850 
so now you can either ground pound them
or<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.679> just<00:02:01.770> roll<00:02:02.009> into<00:02:02.189> them<00:02:02.460> now<00:02:02.880> kill

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
or you can just roll into them now kill

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.499 
or you can just roll into them now kill
so<00:02:04.860> let's<00:02:04.979> do<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.520> other<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:06.209> room
