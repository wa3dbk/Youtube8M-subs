in<00:03:52.610> here<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:52.940> occasionally<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.570> would<00:03:53.780> catch

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
in here and occasionally it would catch

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.930 
in here and occasionally it would catch
but<00:03:54.380> I<00:03:54.440> found<00:03:54.650> by<00:03:54.920> dropping<00:03:55.400> one<00:03:55.550> of<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.700> split

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
but I found by dropping one of the split

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.790 
but I found by dropping one of the split
rings<00:03:56.150> going<00:03:56.390> with<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.630> cut<00:03:56.870> hook<00:03:57.080> right<00:03:57.620> on

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
rings going with the cut hook right on

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.800

to<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.290> guess<00:04:12.350> you<00:04:12.620> could<00:04:12.830> add<00:04:13.010> a<00:04:13.270> side<00:04:14.270> washed

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480

it<00:04:24.950> affords<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.400> few<00:04:25.669> benefits<00:04:26.090> by<00:04:26.540> setting<00:04:26.840> it

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
up this way one when you get a fish you

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.000 
up this way one when you get a fish you
basically<00:04:29.210> got<00:04:29.390> a<00:04:29.450> handle<00:04:29.870> you<00:04:30.020> can<00:04:30.200> grab<00:04:30.590> the

basically got a handle you can grab the

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.920 
basically got a handle you can grab the
the<00:04:31.040> lure<00:04:31.490> you're<00:04:32.090> not<00:04:32.300> worrying<00:04:32.570> about<00:04:32.690> that

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
the lure you're not worrying about that

tail<00:04:33.200> hook<00:04:33.470> you've<00:04:33.650> got<00:04:33.770> a<00:04:33.800> solid<00:04:34.190> hook<00:04:34.340> so<00:04:34.460> you

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
tail hook you've got a solid hook so you

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.400 
tail hook you've got a solid hook so you
can<00:04:34.610> just<00:04:34.850> land

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
can just land

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.920 
can just land
again<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.610> fish<00:04:36.760> cannot<00:04:37.120> gain<00:04:37.390> any<00:04:37.630> torque

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
again the fish cannot gain any torque

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.070 
again the fish cannot gain any torque
they<00:04:38.500> can<00:04:38.680> spin<00:04:38.980> do<00:04:39.250> what<00:04:39.370> it<00:04:39.460> needs<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.760> do<00:04:40.000> and

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
they can spin do what it needs to do and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.390 
they can spin do what it needs to do and
trash<00:04:41.080> go<00:04:41.380> crazy<00:04:41.650> you're<00:04:41.860> not<00:04:41.920> going<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.280> lose

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
trash go crazy you're not going to lose

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.580 
trash go crazy you're not going to lose
that<00:04:42.670> fish<00:04:42.940> you'll<00:04:43.810> probably<00:04:44.020> end<00:04:44.260> up<00:04:44.350> saving

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
that fish you'll probably end up saving

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.620 
that fish you'll probably end up saving
99%<00:04:45.520> of<00:04:45.550> your<00:04:45.670> face<00:04:45.880> but<00:04:46.090> otherwise<00:04:46.300> might

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
99% of your face but otherwise might

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.850 
99% of your face but otherwise might
have<00:04:46.780> popped<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.200> hooks<00:04:47.380> because<00:04:47.500> they<00:04:47.710> could

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
have popped the hooks because they could

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.050 
have popped the hooks because they could
get<00:04:48.010> leverage<00:04:48.280> when<00:04:48.580> they<00:04:48.670> have<00:04:48.760> the<00:04:48.820> front

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
get leverage when they have the front

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.270 
get leverage when they have the front
the<00:04:49.180> tail<00:04:49.360> hooks<00:04:49.660> stuck<00:04:50.350> in<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.560> mouth<00:04:50.680> this

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
the tail hooks stuck in the mouth this

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.880 
the tail hooks stuck in the mouth this
eliminates<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:52.030> problem<00:04:52.590> so<00:04:53.590> that's<00:04:53.650> pretty

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
eliminates that problem so that's pretty

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.380 
eliminates that problem so that's pretty
much<00:04:53.980> it<00:04:54.130> again<00:04:54.580> you<00:04:54.730> know<00:04:54.790> we<00:04:54.940> use<00:04:55.060> this<00:04:55.240> in
