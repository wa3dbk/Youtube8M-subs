00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.920 
an ironworks she's no longer with us for
probably<00:02:10.950> obvious<00:02:11.160> reasons<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.720> think

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
probably obvious reasons and I think

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.800 
probably obvious reasons and I think
there<00:02:13.019> was<00:02:13.110> like<00:02:13.379> I<00:02:13.650> don't<00:02:13.860> know

a<00:02:14.870> million<00:02:15.470> people<00:02:15.650> packed<00:02:17.500> baby<00:02:18.500> there

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
a million people packed baby there

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.170 
a million people packed baby there
should<00:02:18.860> have<00:02:18.950> been<00:02:19.040> like<00:02:19.160> maybe<00:02:19.340> 500<00:02:19.970> people

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.850 
should have been like maybe 500 people
in<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.330> club<00:02:20.599> and<00:02:21.170> there<00:02:21.290> was<00:02:21.410> probably

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
in that club and there was probably

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.260 
in that club and there was probably
3,000<00:02:22.900> but<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:23.989> was<00:02:24.110> an<00:02:25.099> amazing<00:02:25.760> show
