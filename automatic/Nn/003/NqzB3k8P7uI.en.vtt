00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:12.589
 Hellert I greet his ninth part of the here on the door Kraft de 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.509
 Today it's not the environment but a pretty cool function 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.570
 from shopping landscape 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.740
 This was not only the appeal Tatana with the newer version 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.060
 so far already possible already for a long time now can see at online 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.369
 Innovation that brings new Mainka so hard No he also has one 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.160
 pretty horny function with which it is possible to see the duck already 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.620
 to have 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.330
 Grandma dares to take care of a table without the password every time 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.920
 must enter or send to Block Inc 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.800
 and you can even do it automatically when shopping Serve and 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.920
 Sign up online and immediately started or that a single click necessary 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.370
 is 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.910
 There are several options that you can do that you need 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.580
 of course for all three the new my force landscape 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.570
 That's not the first thing now, though, there's been a week since 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.860
 four months but I have discovered this feature as completely new to me and 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.450
 That's why until now I was passing on 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.530
 There are many ways with this a chaplain Sheik now and no immediately 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.390
 on server CEO one can 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.720
 you can do it with shortcuts there is extra tool drag on the designed 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.230
 are 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.609
 or you use workshop days 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.220
 what are your city Ahlen? 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.130
 the neighborhoods have the ending b lot 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.340
 which again a reference to the CeBIT 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.729
 they contain errors over the console, so on the old Docs console 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.330
 also called Combe Arndt can be run immediately 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.850
 and with them it is also possible to start programs and the two 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.560
 States to pass orders and express these commands sense this case 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.150
 Username Bayer password and we also wanted to take the LP of the server 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.450
 needs to shy away from the stove 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.810
 how do you do it all now 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.990
 The first thing that is done by the city is with the right mouse button 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.320
 a click 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.950
 After that he often goes to new and then to a new text document 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.840
 now, for example, took from the servers a write on you want 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.009
 Aldi could also be any other name after that 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.460
 for the content alone is the reporting 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.469
 the ending of this file 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:14.539
 Now you change from PÃ©cs Tel to BHC so the system recognizes that it is 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:16.820
 here is an executable file 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.639
 not a simple text document 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.639
 as soon as she does that, she opens the document 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.519
 Now you need the drive from Achim Mycroft Landscape 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.129
 that could for example find out how to right click on the wine 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.219
 Link for example to the one that the Pope makes 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.340
 and then under properties under target kuckt 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.340
 This animal is the drive from Aramark of Landscape 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:44.159
 Wendeler have no link and you can not find anywhere else 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.409
 just nice on my mind and download a new version of it 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.769
 Store this on the desktop and then you definitely will find it earlier 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.049
 can 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.059
 this file drive now copied one to one simply go Wacker Tirol 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.969
 Now that she is out of control or even saving, you can 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.319
 the Partenkirchener beautiful and it is already my strength open so fast 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.729
 that works now 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.969
 but that's not enough of course you want the king yours too 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.409
 Username Passing the fire password what does she do? 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.349
 First of all, the years first writes the name of the ride and the name of Feuers 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.749
 Mycroft landscape in quotes 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:23.739
 this is important if spaces of races are approaching sooner 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.260
 Times of Dorsts so 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.409
 Pages 4 of the windows environment as we know them today, there was none 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.029
 Spaces were hurried 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.599
 therefore it may be that all systems donate 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.110
 That's why Danielle r draws driving coaches 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.509
 almost simply the name in quotation marks 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:43.099
 Now she really enters a space and then again 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.189
 written in quotes this year in Lubmin advise in one case that is 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.189
 NASA my last way as a copywriter and author 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.619
 then searched again made a space and then yours still go 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:55.530
 password 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.890
 important is that would actually write unencrypted that Hans 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.169
 the launcher can not work with it 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.799
 so here it is interesting that this option is not suitable if you 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.319
 On a PC other people play as they usually have a password 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.689
 but if it is this year own PC is worth it on everyone 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:14.929
 case 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:18.199
 with me that is quite natural now in Zerbst I do not want that 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.719
 you can just under my Macau and log in if you know the whole 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.029
 now enriched on double lays a small window opens the 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.779
 immediately closes that is the console and that ensures that my 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:33.470
 Place now starts with your information and as you can see in my case I 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.580
 will be logged in automatically 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.229
 But that 's not all, what do you do now if that' s on a server CEO 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.009
 Forest 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.599
 June goes back the same file rows and again gives a space one 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.240
 behind an introduction times 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.420
 and now the IATA tester was something on the ground 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.520
 Who does not need if he wanted daughters behind the port 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.350
 One should also do so that there are no complications the whole thing will be 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.259
 again with an introductory price of finished 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.740
 With this simple line, you can write a partita here with one 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.819
 Click immediately on a server join 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.069
 without them ever choosing the Alpine lot or spending a lot of money 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.559
 Change Alpi in the multiplayer mode of Mycroft 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:14.419
 i hope i could help you with this little video i got it on 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.629
 in any case totally helped because I have many partners on the desktop now 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.259
 you can not switch between servers very quickly 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.240
 If you have not understood the whole thing yet, I have you too 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.139
 couple example Baghdad packed and the description these are just one 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.139
 Kilo soon big that means you can just download it quickly 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.620
 in my opinion a real a function which decreases a lot of work and 

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:37.340
 which you should use in any case 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.600
 if you could work with the new Mycroft landscaping i hope i could 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.930
 help you with this little video and you can see you maybe now 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.499
 1 Sorbonne of course logged in by a battery time 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:49.839
 see you soon on the 4th of march Scheer too
