00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
this is the Kingston 32 gigabyte data

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.279 
this is the Kingston 32 gigabyte data
traveller<00:00:09.959> ultimate<00:00:10.410> 3.0<00:00:11.279> g3<00:00:12.119> okay<00:00:12.539> g3<00:00:12.990> stands

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:13.289 
traveller ultimate 3.0 g3 okay g3 stands

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.519 
traveller ultimate 3.0 g3 okay g3 stands
for<00:00:13.469> generating<00:00:13.860> 3a<00:00:14.580> cases<00:00:15.330> primarily<00:00:15.690> usable

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
for generating 3a cases primarily usable

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.060 
for generating 3a cases primarily usable
for<00:00:16.830> USB<00:00:17.250> 3.0<00:00:18.089> but<00:00:18.750> like<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.349> say<00:00:19.560> there<00:00:19.830> is

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
for USB 3.0 but like you say there is

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.359 
for USB 3.0 but like you say there is
backwards<00:00:20.910> compatible<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.839> USB<00:00:22.199> 2.0<00:00:22.980> okay

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
backwards compatible with USB 2.0 okay

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.800 
backwards compatible with USB 2.0 okay
so<00:00:23.429> this<00:00:23.669> will<00:00:23.820> fit<00:00:23.999> most<00:00:24.150> computers<00:00:24.660> some

looks like a little bit of a not sure
whether<00:01:30.140> that<00:01:30.350> light<00:01:30.530> will<00:01:30.709> come<00:01:30.920> on<00:01:30.979> when

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
whether that light will come on when

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.130 
whether that light will come on when
it's<00:01:31.459> in<00:01:31.579> use<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:32.509> all<00:01:32.600> might<00:01:32.810> just<00:01:33.020> be<00:01:33.110> a

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
it's in use it all might just be a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.069 
it's in use it all might just be a
button<00:01:33.759> but<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:34.880> actual<00:01:35.179> design<00:01:35.479> is<00:01:35.750> in<00:01:35.899> like

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
button but the actual design is in like

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.559 
button but the actual design is in like
a<00:01:36.170> chrome<00:01:36.439> silver<00:01:36.740> finish<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.729> intent<00:01:38.240> in<00:01:38.420> the

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
a chrome silver finish the intent in the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.599 
a chrome silver finish the intent in the
inside<00:01:39.049> is<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.380> white<00:01:39.709> and<00:01:39.920> basically<00:01:40.340> what

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
inside is a white and basically what

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:42.819 
inside is a white and basically what
this<00:01:40.729> does<00:01:40.789> got<00:01:41.119> a<00:01:41.149> few<00:01:41.479> grooves<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.590> the

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
this does got a few grooves and the

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.100 
this does got a few grooves and the
grooves<00:01:43.039> allow<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:43.429> to<00:01:43.789> pop<00:01:44.239> open<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.810> device

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
grooves allow you to pop open the device

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.440 
grooves allow you to pop open the device
okay<00:01:45.950> once<00:01:46.250> it's<00:01:46.429> in<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:46.759> position<00:01:47.149> it<00:01:47.270> does

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
okay once it's in this position it does

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.330 
okay once it's in this position it does
lock<00:01:47.869> in<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:48.500> doesn't<00:01:48.770> need<00:01:48.829> some<00:01:49.009> force

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
lock in and it doesn't need some force

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.949 
lock in and it doesn't need some force
to<00:01:49.429> thing<00:01:49.849> get<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.239> back<00:01:50.420> out<00:01:50.569> again

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
to thing get it back out again

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.469 
to thing get it back out again
okay<00:01:51.770> but<00:01:52.039> as<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:52.399> can<00:01:52.549> see<00:01:52.759> once<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.149> device

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
okay but as you can see once the device

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.319 
okay but as you can see once the device
is<00:01:53.509> actually<00:01:53.869> opened<00:01:54.469> up<00:01:54.649> it<00:01:55.610> does<00:01:55.759> click<00:01:56.090> in

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
is actually opened up it does click in

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.059 
is actually opened up it does click in
and<00:01:56.629> it<00:01:56.750> gives<00:01:56.959> it<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.170> capitalist<00:01:57.829> the

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
and it gives it a capitalist the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.609 
and it gives it a capitalist the

gigabyte<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:03.560> 64<00:04:04.040> gigabyte<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:05.060> speeds

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
gigabyte and 64 gigabyte and the speeds

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.140 
gigabyte and 64 gigabyte and the speeds
here<00:04:05.810> are<00:04:06.350> comparable<00:04:06.980> ok<00:04:07.400> so<00:04:07.459> as<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:07.880> can<00:04:07.970> see

here are comparable ok so as you can see

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.170 
here are comparable ok so as you can see
the<00:04:08.270> USB<00:04:08.600> 3.0<00:04:09.170> is<00:04:09.230> 150<00:04:10.160> megabits<00:04:10.550> read<00:04:10.880> speed

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
the USB 3.0 is 150 megabits read speed

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.110 
the USB 3.0 is 150 megabits read speed
and<00:04:11.390> 17<00:04:12.200> megabits<00:04:12.590> write<00:04:12.800> speed<00:04:13.130> ok<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:13.610> that

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
and 17 megabits write speed ok so that

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.120 
and 17 megabits write speed ok so that
will<00:04:14.209> transfer<00:04:14.600> about<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:14.810> 250<00:04:15.290> megabyte<00:04:15.709> file

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
will transfer about a 250 megabyte file

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.500 
will transfer about a 250 megabyte file
in<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:17.060> space<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.330> about<00:04:17.870> 2<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.859> 3<00:04:19.070> seconds<00:04:19.549> USB

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
speed test and review tests I did on

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.340 
speed test and review tests I did on
this<00:04:45.919> device<00:04:46.250> via<00:04:47.030> my<00:04:47.270> PC<00:04:47.690> basically<00:04:48.260> I'll

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
this device via my PC basically I'll

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.080 
this device via my PC basically I'll
just<00:04:48.500> copy<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:48.860> paste<00:04:49.010> the<00:04:49.190> files<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.699> pretty

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
just copy and paste the files is pretty

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.659

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
good to be honest there are a lot of USB

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.420 
good to be honest there are a lot of USB
3.0<00:04:53.240> devices<00:04:53.419> out<00:04:53.900> there<00:04:54.139> and<00:04:54.350> to<00:04:54.979> be<00:04:55.010> honest<00:04:55.370> a

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
3.0 devices out there and to be honest a

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.430 
3.0 devices out there and to be honest a
lot<00:04:55.580> of<00:04:55.669> them<00:04:55.850> can<00:04:56.090> read<00:04:56.330> around<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.870> same<00:04:57.110> and

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
lot of them can read around the same and

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.710 
lot of them can read around the same and
work<00:04:57.710> around<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.100> same<00:04:58.280> speed<00:04:58.639> but<00:04:59.270> what

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
work around the same speed but what

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.070 
work around the same speed but what
tells<00:05:00.020> this<00:05:00.260> a<00:05:00.290> product<00:05:01.040> apart<00:05:01.490> from<00:05:01.699> me<00:05:02.080> from
