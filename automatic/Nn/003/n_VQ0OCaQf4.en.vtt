but<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.180> 6.2<00:01:03.960> earthquake<00:01:04.530> was<00:01:04.739> extremely

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
but this 6.2 earthquake was extremely

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.420

strong now I'm also concerned about

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.940 
strong now I'm also concerned about
tsunamis<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.869> much<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.770> was

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
tsunamis but not as much because it was

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.240 
tsunamis but not as much because it was
really<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:12.210> quake<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.810> inland<00:01:13.409> totally

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
really this quake was inland totally

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.920 
really this quake was inland totally
inland<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:19.369> you<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.610> understand<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
inland and you have to understand the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.200 
inland and you have to understand the
housing<00:01:22.830> construction<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.580> Colombia<00:01:24.030> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
housing construction in Colombia is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.800 
housing construction in Colombia is
better<00:01:24.479> than<00:01:24.689> some<00:01:25.170> places<00:01:26.030> but<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.720> good

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
better than some places but not as good

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.249 
better than some places but not as good
as<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.720> fully<00:01:30.720> up<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.930> code

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
as some you know is not fully up to code

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.210

the fact that there were two solar

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.120 
the fact that there were two solar
flares<00:01:53.780> yesterday<00:01:54.780> both<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.229> them<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:55.829> was<00:01:56.009> an

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
flares yesterday both of them one was an

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.910 
flares yesterday both of them one was an
m5<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:57.060> before<00:01:57.390> last<00:01:57.570> night<00:01:57.899> almost<00:01:58.770> before

m5 just before last night almost before
midnight<00:01:59.460> last<00:01:59.670> night<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.710> morning<00:02:02.009> i

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
midnight last night so this morning i

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.560 
midnight last night so this morning i
did<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.310> video<00:02:02.430> talking<00:02:02.820> about<00:02:03.090> these<00:02:03.270> silver

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
did a video talking about these silver

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.150 
did a video talking about these silver
flares<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.340> said<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.490> know<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:05.880> expecting

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
flares I said you know I'm expecting

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.680 
flares I said you know I'm expecting
look<00:02:08.160> because<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.729> second<00:02:09.239> player<00:02:09.479> was

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
look because that second player was

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.040 
look because that second player was
earth<00:02:09.929> facing<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:12.290> m5<00:02:13.290> plan

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
earth facing and it was a m5 plan

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.130 
earth facing and it was a m5 plan
an<00:02:14.200> m5<00:02:15.190> class<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.730> was<00:02:18.760> earth<00:02:19.330> facing

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
an m5 class so and it was earth facing

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.870 
an m5 class so and it was earth facing
so<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.440> knew<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:20.830> was<00:02:21.190> going<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.370> release<00:02:21.640> some

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
so I knew that was going to release some

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.430 
so I knew that was going to release some
powerful<00:02:22.270> CMI's<00:02:23.160> right<00:02:24.160> toward<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.550> earth

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
powerful CMI's right toward the earth

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.870 
powerful CMI's right toward the earth
thus<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.710> could<00:02:27.040> trigger<00:02:27.310> one<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.730> these

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
thus it could trigger one of these

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.930 
thus it could trigger one of these
tectonic<00:02:28.120> plates<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:29.350> give<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.010> we<00:02:30.730> could

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
tectonic plates to give and we could

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.590 
tectonic plates to give and we could
have<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.120> major<00:02:31.360> quake<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.830> is<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.070> strong<00:02:33.600> 16.2

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
have a major quake this is a strong 16.2

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.130 
have a major quake this is a strong 16.2
just<00:02:35.140> tick<00:02:35.380> Columbia<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:37.630> lot<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:37.930> times

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
just tick Columbia and a lot of times

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.380 
just tick Columbia and a lot of times
folks<00:02:38.350> when<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.770> happens<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.490> earth<00:02:39.910> starts

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
folks when this happens the earth starts

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.690 
folks when this happens the earth starts
reeling<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.930> rocking<00:02:41.460> there<00:02:42.460> could<00:02:42.670> be

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
reeling and rocking there could be

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.360 
reeling and rocking there could be
another<00:02:43.030> quake<00:02:43.390> over<00:02:43.720> six<00:02:44.050> maybe<00:02:44.770> just<00:02:45.160> on<00:02:45.280> the
