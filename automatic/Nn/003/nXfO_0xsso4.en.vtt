00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:02.930
 on foot 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.930
 presenting 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.470
 Red Russia and 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.910
 we flew the study here 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.840
 nearby was not found in 100 days 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.380
 barge was afraid not to hurt sales for 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.050
 I like it did not make play 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.060
 barely potentially today will become 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.970
 simply 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.820
 t 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.990
 earlier 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.990
 football 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.150
 sure today you remember 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
 offers missing construction 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.240
 we used to sit two floors above 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.030
 me through at that meeting of what 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.080
 now we have four 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.330
 five months ago we settled here in 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.140
 ufms reception we then began to decorate 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.549
 and not at all one of them gizmos that 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.229
 network but we show you what's going on 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.060
 the scene let's keep up if 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.060
 want to eat no further 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.920
 will be one cabinet go to full 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
 tiles and sweets 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.850
 and where is our group 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.850
 Well, now everything is like he is a star man 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.720
 see by the window closed very ranks because 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.810
 that all developers are actually in 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.810
 context 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.690
 so here we have gone great 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.160
 part of the office is important if all major 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.340
 these guys work with these hands 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.980
 time told every official 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.339
 head 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.159
 Hulk guard But watch out for your 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.850
 players materials Hamza abilities 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.160
 anaid him by the way not now he's creative 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.280
 director who is the game in many ways 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.319
 depends on it 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.329
 but there are still important employees in another 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.329
 wing for example the department to work on 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:24.109
 tasks 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.099
 besides sometimes specially 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.659
 staged fights between designers and 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.329
 artists even with programmers so 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.739
 the mission is much more interesting 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.639
 the first step in creating when overtaking is to 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.609
 points and here's an important part of the process 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.629
 game designers why do you need to create everything 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.760
 elements of character deals and then 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.519
 these guys get down to business though white and 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.519
 kama wells were born on vacation 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.319
 it is here that they are the best track for 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.319
 bowling 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.439
 in the room we just have each 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.989
 department low meeting room 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.379
 still nearby is a lounge and 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.110
 of course I have a gym 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.110
 they want him 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.449
 besides those who paint working on color 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.260
 design is engaged in the model tekebaev who 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.949
 the same code must still write 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.359
 and these guys competed a year 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.479
 they need to sit together to think it over 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:31.639
 programmers want to be away from everyone 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.780
 they need silence 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.510
 the only thing they think about is 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.039
 key clicking 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:37.989
 I do not know for what reason, but this is nonsense 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.440
 which they print 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.350
 I want to closely turn into a country 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.639
 language so games appear 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.689
 her how they do it 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.479
 thanks for stopping by, i give my heart he 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.699
 by the way is engaged here 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.699
 organizations for you guys 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:56.259
 I cite nothing do not worry 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:58.609
 we have four founders 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.139
 everyone is busy with us now 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.569
 Bruce Chris payments I will introduce later 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.389
 and he still acts correctly producer 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.389
 but we're already on the size 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.859
 okay guys see you on 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.989
 presentations 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.049
 solodkin tribes who sits there in 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.529
 the office he is smarter than all of us together 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:19.669
 fund master of all trades 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.819
 the best this case chris is our guest 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:24.460
 and be sure not to take from him 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.460
 only he knows about aggression 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.860
 and here we are playing football 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.860
 helicopter pilots new so on 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.289
 so no one likes the usa because 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.669
 that we are all to blame, we even put it off 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.649
 try to do the best and so 

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:50.199
 Further 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.719

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.379
 needed actually helps too 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.919
 the game is better they have only a couple 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.919
 weeks 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.270
 to start now see two blocks in 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.699
 that side of the tour 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.460
