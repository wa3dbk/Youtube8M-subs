so<00:01:06.970> that's<00:01:07.300> it<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.810> theta<00:01:08.110> oka<00:01:08.530> monkey<00:01:08.950> and

so that's it the theta oka monkey and

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.320 
so that's it the theta oka monkey and
yeah<00:01:10.660> he<00:01:10.990> has<00:01:11.500> a<00:01:11.530> lot<00:01:11.920> of<00:01:11.950> HP<00:01:12.220> now<00:01:12.640> it's<00:01:13.030> not

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
yeah he has a lot of HP now it's not

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.690 
yeah he has a lot of HP now it's not
like<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:13.600> first<00:01:13.810> time<00:01:14.080> so<00:01:14.830> let's<00:01:15.220> keep<00:01:15.370> moving

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
like the first time so let's keep moving

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.960 
like the first time so let's keep moving
so<00:01:16.060> right<00:01:16.840> here<00:01:16.870> I<00:01:17.140> guess<00:01:17.470> that<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:18.610> balloon

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
so right here I guess that the balloon

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.480 
so right here I guess that the balloon
were<00:01:19.180> metal<00:01:19.570> is<00:01:19.810> also<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.380> reliable<00:01:21.250> one

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
were metal is also a reliable one

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.050 
were metal is also a reliable one
because<00:01:22.150> it's<00:01:22.600> like<00:01:22.960> a<00:01:22.990> closed<00:01:23.440> space<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.370> it

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
because it's like a closed space and it

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.180 
because it's like a closed space and it
deals<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.450> lot<00:01:25.480> of<00:01:25.750> damage<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.290> yeah<00:01:26.530> we're

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
deals a lot of damage so yeah we're

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
deals a lot of damage so yeah we're
gonna<00:01:27.340> keep<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:28.290> metal<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.440> methods<00:01:29.860> for

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210

the<00:02:21.850> sliding<00:02:22.239> dive<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.260> am<00:02:25.110> ok<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:26.170> let's

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
the sliding dive so I am ok so let's

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.550

so<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:38.360> guess<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.410> Pokemon<00:02:40.310> key<00:02:40.880> fight<00:02:41.180> is

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
so I guess that Pokemon key fight is

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.420 
so I guess that Pokemon key fight is
order<00:02:42.410> with<00:02:42.680> Rico<00:02:43.220> as<00:02:43.610> if<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.240> my<00:02:44.420> opinions

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
order with Rico as if that my opinions

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.630 
order with Rico as if that my opinions
and<00:02:46.780> yeah<00:02:47.780> actually<00:02:48.020> it's<00:02:48.650> because<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.190> this

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
and yeah actually it's because of this

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.240 
and yeah actually it's because of this
face<00:02:50.090> when<00:02:50.630> he<00:02:50.900> turns<00:02:51.200> himself<00:02:51.440> in<00:02:51.920> clause

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
face when he turns himself in clause

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.420 
face when he turns himself in clause
it's<00:02:52.610> really<00:02:53.000> annoying<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.980> well<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.250> can

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
it's really annoying and well you can

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.260 
it's really annoying and well you can
actually<00:02:55.610> use<00:02:56.150> slow<00:02:56.960> motion<00:02:57.410> like<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:58.270> but

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
actually use slow motion like this but

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.540 
actually use slow motion like this but
it<00:02:59.660> doesn't<00:03:00.200> deal<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.920> much<00:03:01.160> damage

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
it doesn't deal that much damage

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.660 
it doesn't deal that much damage
actually<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:03.200> let<00:03:03.500> me<00:03:03.530> use<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.010> lunar<00:03:04.220> once

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
actually so let me use the lunar once

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.000 
actually so let me use the lunar once
again<00:03:05.360> let<00:03:06.320> me<00:03:06.350> heal<00:03:06.800> all<00:03:07.340> right<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:08.800> I<00:03:09.800> don't
