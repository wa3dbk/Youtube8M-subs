00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
I like the bigness of it you can see my

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.580 
I like the bigness of it you can see my
hands<00:03:19.829> it's<00:03:20.829> how<00:03:20.920> he's<00:03:21.069> done<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.549> avert<00:03:22.590> it

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
hands it's how he's done it to avert it

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.530 
hands it's how he's done it to avert it
actually<00:03:23.920> still<00:03:24.189> feels<00:03:24.670> wet<00:03:25.000> for<00:03:25.239> some<00:03:25.359> odd

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
actually still feels wet for some odd

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.670 
actually still feels wet for some odd
reason<00:03:26.069> it's<00:03:27.069> really<00:03:27.579> soft<00:03:27.939> I<00:03:28.480> mean<00:03:28.989> really

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
reason it's really soft I mean really

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.580 
reason it's really soft I mean really
really<00:03:30.069> baby<00:03:30.639> soft<00:03:33.629> so<00:03:34.629> if<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:34.900> do<00:03:34.959> something

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
really baby soft so if I do something

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:56.220 
really baby soft so if I do something
with<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.799> out<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:36.489> come<00:03:36.730> back<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:56.079> last

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
with it out that we come back the last

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.300 
with it out that we come back the last
time<00:03:56.469> I<00:03:56.560> did<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:56.769> blowout<00:03:57.040> was<00:03:57.370> July<00:03:57.760> 2010<00:03:58.889> and<00:03:59.889> I

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
time I did a blowout was July 2010 and I

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.479 
time I did a blowout was July 2010 and I
wasn't<00:04:00.579> even<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.879> full<00:04:01.090> meter<00:04:02.159> naturally<00:04:03.159> in<00:04:03.370> it

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
wasn't even a full meter naturally in it

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.050 
wasn't even a full meter naturally in it
so<00:04:03.729> I<00:04:05.189> don't<00:04:06.189> have<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.310> real<00:04:06.579> reason<00:04:06.729> why<00:04:07.030> I

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
so I don't have a real reason why I

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:14.129 
so I don't have a real reason why I
waited<00:04:07.269> so<00:04:07.389> long<00:04:07.769> analogous<00:04:10.680> alright<00:04:11.849> I<00:04:13.139> think

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
waited so long analogous alright I think

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:19.469 
waited so long analogous alright I think
now<00:04:14.229> that<00:04:14.259> you<00:04:14.560> are<00:04:14.590> think<00:04:15.159> I<00:04:17.370> must<00:04:18.370> see<00:04:18.789> you<00:04:19.000> in

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
now that you are think I must see you in

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.099

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
the next video if I can figure out

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.659 
the next video if I can figure out
with<00:04:22.349> my<00:04:22.530> hair<00:04:22.770> maybe<00:04:23.099> ice<00:04:23.310> talent<00:04:25.189> I'm<00:04:26.189> ready

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669
