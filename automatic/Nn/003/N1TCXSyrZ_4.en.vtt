00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:08.100
 hello everyone i 'm htc hd see that it's black 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.680
 it's good to have a little bit of this weird 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.780
 this video gameplay commented because 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.029
 prepares the gameplay was done in madrazo 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.000
 so to speak is one of those days in 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.589
 that has an amazing roe that cock 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.279
 you play the worst, I think 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.570
 this example more or less and x so 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.359
 well I do not expect a cock if its 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.919
 character extermination an english freak 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.359
 fast 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.759
 and well this guy, I'm going to talk 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.350
 little about the fact that I already started classes and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.239
 good something very important for you and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.660
 for me because it's time that they have 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.219
 schedules on the channel technically when 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.050
 I say schedule is that they should have like 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.149
 two weekly videos or I'm not going to 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.980
 make as many videos as it should be 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.140
 neglect that I still have the plan 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.210
 let's save a thread in my hand I have the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.899
 videos and I'm seeing the all one by 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.010
 one although I want to be as they say 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.690
 talk to you about a very subject 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.359
 important that it comes to save 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.940
 hello with the videos I've had many 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.510
 videos in which the audio first that 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.020
 nothing is more or less calculator is to say 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.020
 they can talk 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.600
 the black shelter that I want in the 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.640
 things that is the audio is not understood 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.890
 many people and it costs me a lot 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.720
 know what they say because half of 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.270
 things are different languages ​​like 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.940
 Colombian I think that an Argentine does not 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.410
 I'm sure a Chilean and several 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.330
 Mexicans or not several Mexicans the 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.040
 Most are Mexican but all of them are 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.930
 one they say as their own words 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.050
 of nationalities and it costs me 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.330
 understand with the audio calculator that 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.810
 they have each not all have it there 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.880
 some that are decent audio that 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.070
 they have in the gameplay or in the video in 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.130
 general are decent for some that 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.540
 Corduroy cock kill me another very detail 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.810
 important that you want to discuss with 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.010
 you are that many videos as well 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.930
 that 6 of 10 videos for example or seven 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.970
 of ten videos speak is exactly 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.190
 almost almost the same things that 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.620
 they want in the community in the next 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.720
 halo almost almost that people are 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.040
 they spoke for the one who said ok we're going to 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.900
 put this in our video are of 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.850
 agreement and everyone said sui or 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.640
 they are practically repeating things 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.080
 it's not good because the majority that 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.709
 is voting that they want things in the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.660
 next halo but for me it loses me or 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.790
 I'm wasting quite a lot of time doing 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.220
 a video in which more than repeating is 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.660
 exactly the same things with almost 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.519
 the same opinions because the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.290
 opinions are very general they do not have 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.269
 that be very specific and most of 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.980
 the videos are very general they are no longer 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.680
 as specifically tell 'the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.010
 because they want those things 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.109
 and the third thing you want to discuss about 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.180
 we know and what about the videos is that there 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.400
 some that say very incoherent things 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.200
 for example they are talking about one thing 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.000
 Multiplayer multiplayer and 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.420
 they suddenly say that the inquisitor goes alone 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.920
 to the style so I understand that many 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.389
 people want to think about the campaign 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.609
 but the campaign is not the main reason 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:04.489
 of why this is how it is 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.829
 is marcelo 4 has some better campaigns 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.700
 they have the series I liked 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.769
 rather more than hello a style 3 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.409
 halo 2 the origin and the 4 are my 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.389
 favorite campaigns personally and good 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.340
 that is the inquisitor and all those things 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.620
 they really are not the main reason 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.010
 why that and what has failed 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.540
 lately that the rays and in gilo 4 or 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.609
 be from my point of view if they are more 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.980
 coherent would be a little more the 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.200
 multiplayer there are other things like 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.180
 example they say that the gay flow that 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.370
 they prefer that I exploit turn rich in 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.290
 special when the flow or the living 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.730
 of the hell or 4 is much better to be 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.889
 much more fun from my point of 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.900
 view and really worth a link to 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.400
 ninja is much more balanced in my 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.780
 point of view why not 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.269
 from my point of view but it is a fact and 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.099
 Right, because you have a bit of fun 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.379
 more and is very balanced with the 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.049
 armor that has the flow and the 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.819
 humans and all that but nothing like that 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.590
 more an opinion in higüey the point is 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.959
 that nothing else with those three sayings that 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.760
 I just said consistency the quality 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.189
 of audio and the people who keep repeating 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.680
 I think I'm going to make another plan for the 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:11.870
 project let's save hello what you have 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.409
 what to do is a gameplay commented with 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.959
 the top 20 or top 10 or top 15 things that 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.789
 the people or the community want to be 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.739
 based on the comments that you 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.630
 they left in the video and the videos that 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.580
 you passed me that way I'm going to 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.710
 read try to read all the 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.020
 comments they have made in the 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.310
 gameplay or in my video and that 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.860
 I can include it in a video 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.380
 short of 20 things that we want 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.940
 and we all participate all the things that 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.949
 we more want for the things that 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.750
 they were voted with more likes and all 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.180
 those areas and really I'm going to 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.150
 grab everything in a video I comment and 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.889
 me the subtitles because really a 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.169
 little complicated grab 30 videos 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.969
 put them in English and try to translate 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.769
 something I do not understand 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.599
 well I hope you understand I want 

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:58.610
 your opinion you agree that 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.159
 I made a video commented by the top 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.229
 20 things that the majority of the community 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.269
 wants or that seems to be a priority 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.999
 in the next example I mention it and 

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:11.419
 the subtitle in a short video in six 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:13.189
 wait, well, I do not know, you guys 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.349
 what do you think meanwhile I will be 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:17.269
 leaving a link in the inscription that 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.819
 treats as a vote with people 

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:22.069
 who want me to make a video like that or 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.629
 they want the video of another type is the 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:25.969
 inscription vote I'll be 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:27.860

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.209
 well meanwhile I will try to see 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.709
 what are the best associations that 

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:32.959
 what the community wants and I'm going to 

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:35.839
 try to present it as best and as 

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:37.459
 you do not have too many or you will know 3 costs 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:38.869
 have in series is listening is 

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:40.849
 asking that we criticize the 

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:42.949
 Game as best as possible also ask us 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.449
 that what we want to change is that 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.369
 is what we want to change in thread 4 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.529
 and what things we want new in the 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:49.999
 next game so guys really 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.589
 we have the opportunity with the video of 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.809
 let's save the thread to call attention 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.789
 in 3 4 3 that way we can call the 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:57.439

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:01.460
 very big way 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.200
 leave our point of view on the air I'll 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.840
 to leave this video a little short of 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.490
 as much as usual and I retire 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.890
 I honestly do not have much to say 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.450
 nothing else was the question and I started class 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.450
