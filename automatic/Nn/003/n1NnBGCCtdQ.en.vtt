00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:08.800
 hello friends we will teach how 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.660
 how to put a car stage at home 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.570
 for this we need a source of 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.520
 12 volt power 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.140
 what the green wire with the black that 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.689
 is what the current gives 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.150
 and then catch the yellow wires and 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.700
 black where each one in my case to 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.520
 each massage 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:36.190
 that yellow goes to the guards 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.190
 positive and the black goes earth 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:45.090
 and I have it done to take a cablecito 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.090
 and make a bridge 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.450
 and then but we still carry the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.450
 yellow the device 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.490
 in the black in the negative or earth 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.440
 then I'm going to plug in the followed by 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.440
 the speakers 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.299
 yes 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.700
 it's positive let's bridge to or to your 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.780
 subwoofer 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.760
 for which we must promote 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.760
 positive a channel 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.140
 to negative for another channel 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.470
 now we will connect sa 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.520
 that I have not done fado to a laptop 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.520
 stop the music 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.900
 and I put the right cable 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.290
 we ensure that the road or nest 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.180
 but we give your mind 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.870
 as we see the pilot his feels 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.870
 I love music 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.980
 we take the cable to the computer 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.980
