00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the third one is the k7 which is an SMG

the third one is the k7 which is an SMG
in<00:01:58.710> call<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.280> duty<00:01:59.399> ghosts<00:01:59.759> so<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.030> have<00:02:00.119> three

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
in call of duty ghosts so we have three

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.179 
in call of duty ghosts so we have three
different<00:02:00.420> categories<00:02:00.869> where<00:02:01.860> there<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
different categories where there is a

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.649 
different categories where there is a
weapon<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.610> already<00:02:02.909> has<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> silencer<00:02:03.570> and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
weapon that already has a silencer and

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.260 
weapon that already has a silencer and
that's<00:02:03.869> cool<00:02:04.140> okay<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.460> here's<00:02:05.790> where<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
that's cool okay but here's where the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.540 
that's cool okay but here's where the
issue<00:02:06.540> comes<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.710> me<00:02:07.890> now<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.520> a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
issue comes in for me now we know a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.820 
issue comes in for me now we know a
silencer<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.780> reduce<00:02:09.929> range<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
silencer is going to reduce range and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.340 
silencer is going to reduce range and
it's<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.670> reduce<00:02:11.849> damage<00:02:12.450> we

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
it's going to reduce damage we

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.810 
it's going to reduce damage we
don't<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:13.560> how<00:02:13.740> much<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.250> depends<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
don't know how much it depends on the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.270 
don't know how much it depends on the
attributes<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.540> these<00:02:15.720> guns<00:02:15.990> but<00:02:16.410> there's<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
attributes of these guns but there's a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.040 
attributes of these guns but there's a
perk<00:02:17.610> out<00:02:17.880> there<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.270> it's<00:02:18.390> not<00:02:18.570> confirmed

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
perk out there and it's not confirmed

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.080 
perk out there and it's not confirmed
and<00:02:19.470> I'm<00:02:19.770> not<00:02:19.950> for<00:02:20.160> sure<00:02:20.190> what<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.700> name<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:20.880> it

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
and I'm not for sure what the name of it

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.970 
and I'm not for sure what the name of it
is<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:21.390> it's<00:02:21.510> got<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> gun<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.620> has

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
is but it's got a gun on it and it has

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.090 
is but it's got a gun on it and it has
like<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.220> scope<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.790> top<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.210> gun<00:02:24.420> and

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
like a scope on top of the gun and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.380 
like a scope on top of the gun and
supposedly<00:02:26.100> this<00:02:26.400> perk<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.030> fourth

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
supposedly this perk is a fourth

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.630 
supposedly this perk is a fourth
attachment<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.130> get<00:02:29.280> three

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640

silencer already on it you had three
more<00:03:05.670> attachments<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.420> then<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.660> add<00:03:06.780> this

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
more attachments and then you add this

part<00:03:07.290> do<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.530> get<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.770> fourth<00:03:08.130> which<00:03:08.370> is

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
part do you get a fourth which is

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.610 
part do you get a fourth which is
actually<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.880> fifth<00:03:09.240> because<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.050> silencer<00:03:10.560> is

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
actually a fifth because the silencer is

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.740 
actually a fifth because the silencer is
not<00:03:10.920> counted<00:03:11.430> or<00:03:11.820> do<00:03:12.090> they<00:03:12.210> have<00:03:12.390> something

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
not counted or do they have something

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.390 
not counted or do they have something
