the subject as a video you saw the stats

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.000 
the subject as a video you saw the stats
a<00:00:49.950> couple<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.489> seconds<00:00:50.850> ago<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:52.260> attributes

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
a couple of seconds ago the attributes

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.860 
a couple of seconds ago the attributes
of<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> twenty<00:00:54.329> percent<00:00:54.600> damage

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
of this you get a twenty percent damage

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.760 
of this you get a twenty percent damage
bonus<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> axe<00:00:56.039> itself<00:00:56.850> which<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.109> pretty

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
bonus on the axe itself which is pretty

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.680 
bonus on the axe itself which is pretty
good<00:00:59.070> honestly<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.850> mean<00:00:59.940> having<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.480> bit<00:01:00.660> of

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
good honestly I mean having a bit of

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.750 
good honestly I mean having a bit of
extra<00:01:01.050> damage<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> melee<00:01:01.949> weapon<00:01:01.980> certainly

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
extra damage on a melee weapon certainly

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.789 
extra damage on a melee weapon certainly
isn't<00:01:02.940> bad<00:01:03.359> depending<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> risk<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
isn't bad depending on the risk that

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.320 
isn't bad depending on the risk that
you're<00:01:05.040> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.369> take<00:01:05.549> when<00:01:05.790> equipping<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you're going to take when equipping it

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.370 
you're going to take when equipping it
and<00:01:06.979> that<00:01:07.979> risk<00:01:08.340> being<00:01:08.909> with<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.420> weapon<00:01:09.689> you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and that risk being with this weapon you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.969 
and that risk being with this weapon you
move<00:01:10.619> fifteen<00:01:11.340> percent<00:01:11.820> slower<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.439> basically

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
move fifteen percent slower so basically

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.130 
move fifteen percent slower so basically
you<00:01:14.189> move<00:01:14.400> at<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> speed<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.420> soldier<00:01:15.930> or

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
you move at the speed of a soldier or

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.490 
you move at the speed of a soldier or
maybe<00:01:16.530> even<00:01:16.619> less<00:01:17.130> at<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:18.020> now<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.080> problems

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
maybe even less at that now the problems

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.859 
maybe even less at that now the problems
arise<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> good<00:01:20.850> example<00:01:21.299> right<00:01:21.330> here<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
arise with a good example right here you

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.920 
arise with a good example right here you
see<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.680> lit<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:22.979> fire<00:01:23.299> now<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.570> probably

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
see I get lit on fire now I probably

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.450 
see I get lit on fire now I probably
wouldn't<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.560> been<00:01:25.619> able<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.979> make<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
wouldn't have been able to make it to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.910 
wouldn't have been able to make it to
that<00:01:26.549> dispenser<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.270> time<00:01:27.509> had<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.560> medic

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that dispenser in time had that medic

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.730 
that dispenser in time had that medic
not<00:01:29.280> been<00:01:29.520> there<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.970> save<00:01:30.180> my<00:01:30.420> life<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.990> this

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
not been there to save my life and this

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.350 
not been there to save my life and this
is<00:01:31.799> pretty<00:01:32.159> much<00:01:32.250> where<00:01:32.610> things<00:01:32.909> start<00:01:33.210> going

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
is pretty much where things start going

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.660 
is pretty much where things start going
downhill<00:01:33.750> The<00:01:34.259> Scotsman<00:01:34.530> skull<00:01:35.100> cutter<00:01:35.369> it's

downhill The Scotsman skull cutter it's

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.940 
downhill The Scotsman skull cutter it's
not<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> weapon<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.110> recommend<00:01:37.560> for

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
not a weapon that I recommend for

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
not a weapon that I recommend for
offense<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.579> haven't<00:01:38.880> personally<00:01:39.150> tried<00:01:39.720> it

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
offense I haven't personally tried it

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.899 
offense I haven't personally tried it
out<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.259> offense<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.340> seeing<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.729> how

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
out for offense but seeing as how

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
out for offense but seeing as how
playing<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:42.450> defensive<00:01:43.110> measures<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
playing with defensive measures that you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.999 
playing with defensive measures that you
get<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.189> fall<00:01:44.970> back<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> bit<00:01:45.570> more<00:01:45.780> often<00:01:46.229> that's

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
get to fall back a bit more often that's

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
get to fall back a bit more often that's
probably<00:01:47.490> why<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> prefer<00:01:48.240> using<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.930> on

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
probably why I prefer using it on

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.990 
probably why I prefer using it on
defense<00:01:49.500> more<00:01:49.740> than<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.130> offense<00:01:50.759> because

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
defense more than I do offense because

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.319 
defense more than I do offense because
the<00:01:51.270> slower<00:01:51.509> movement<00:01:51.990> speed<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:53.270> not<00:01:54.270> very

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the slower movement speed it's not very

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.450 
the slower movement speed it's not very
that<00:01:55.049> good<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.619> also<00:01:55.799> one<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> reasons

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
that good it's also one of the reasons

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.980 
that good it's also one of the reasons
why<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> don't<00:01:56.880> really<00:01:57.000> play<00:01:57.270> heavy<00:01:57.509> die<00:01:57.750> often

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
why I don't really play heavy die often

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.440 
why I don't really play heavy die often
I<00:01:58.380> play<00:01:58.770> soldier<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> lot<00:01:59.490> more<00:01:59.700> because<00:01:59.880> i<00:02:00.210> get

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
I play soldier a lot more because i get

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.999 
I play soldier a lot more because i get
to<00:02:00.479> rocket<00:02:00.960> jump<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.380> lot<00:02:01.619> more<00:02:01.829> often

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
to rocket jump a lot more often

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.520 
to rocket jump a lot more often
throughout<00:02:02.759> jumping<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.509> increases<00:02:04.409> your

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
throughout jumping it increases your

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.190 
throughout jumping it increases your
mobility<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.430> much<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> Demoman

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
mobility so much but with the Demoman

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.529 
mobility so much but with the Demoman
the<00:02:08.099> only<00:02:08.310> mobility<00:02:08.819> you're<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.330> really

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
the only mobility you're going to really

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.990 
the only mobility you're going to really
get<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:10.050> sticky<00:02:10.410> jumping<00:02:10.890> there<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.430> pipe<00:02:11.760> bomb

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
get is sticky jumping there is pipe bomb

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.220 
get is sticky jumping there is pipe bomb
jumping<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:12.660> that's

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
jumping but that's

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.740 
jumping but that's
we<00:02:13.260> used<00:02:13.769> for<00:02:14.069> trick<00:02:14.370> jumps<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.000> getting<00:02:15.629> up

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
we used for trick jumps and getting up

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.860 
we used for trick jumps and getting up
into<00:02:15.900> sneaky<00:02:16.470> plies<00:02:17.000> places<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.239> tried<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.690> save

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
into sneaky plies places I tried to save

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.930 
into sneaky plies places I tried to save
places<00:02:19.319> at<00:02:19.470> spots<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.099> same<00:02:20.340> time<00:02:20.549> but<00:02:20.819> it

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
places at spots the same time but it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.160 
places at spots the same time but it
didn't<00:02:21.239> work<00:02:23.150> that's<00:02:24.150> pretty<00:02:24.480> much<00:02:24.599> all<00:02:24.810> that

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
didn't work that's pretty much all that

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.750 
didn't work that's pretty much all that
really<00:02:25.560> needs<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.950> be<00:02:26.069> said<00:02:26.370> about<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
really needs to be said about the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.399 
really needs to be said about the
Scotsman<00:02:27.209> skull<00:02:27.450> cutter<00:02:27.690> if<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.930> have<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.290> be

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
Scotsman skull cutter if I have to be

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.259 
Scotsman skull cutter if I have to be
honest<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.340> obviously<00:02:29.910> why<00:02:30.209> this

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
honest and it's obviously why this

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.960 
honest and it's obviously why this
weapon<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.959> not<00:02:31.290> really<00:02:31.650> used<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.190> often<00:02:32.610> I

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
weapon is not really used that often I

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.110 
weapon is not really used that often I
mean<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.840> suppose<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.769> could<00:02:34.799> talk<00:02:35.280> about<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.700> bit

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
mean I suppose I could talk about a bit

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.440 
mean I suppose I could talk about a bit
I<00:02:36.450> could<00:02:37.290> talk<00:02:37.530> about<00:02:37.849> some<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.000> loadouts

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
I could talk about some of the loadouts

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.699 
I could talk about some of the loadouts
that<00:02:39.690> can<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:39.930> used<00:02:40.110> with<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:40.470> thing

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
that can be used with this thing

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.039 
that can be used with this thing
generally<00:02:41.549> when<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.760> play<00:02:42.060> demo<00:02:42.329> man<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.750> much

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
generally when I play demo man I much

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.380 
generally when I play demo man I much
prefer<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.500> play<00:02:43.650> as<00:02:43.769> half<00:02:43.980> demo<00:02:44.370> night<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.209> as

night<00:03:34.230> half<00:03:34.859> demo<00:03:35.160> night<00:03:35.400> yes<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:36.530> finally

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
night half demo night yes and finally

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.860 
night half demo night yes and finally
the<00:03:38.040> last<00:03:38.069> load<00:03:38.730> out<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.569> can<00:03:39.720> really

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
the last load out that you can really

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.110 
the last load out that you can really
use<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.319> skull<00:03:40.530> cutter<00:03:40.739> on<00:03:40.829> would<00:03:41.639> have<00:03:41.819> to<00:03:41.970> be

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
use the skull cutter on would have to be

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.270 
use the skull cutter on would have to be
just<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.780> standard<00:03:43.200> default<00:03:43.500> Demoman

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
just the standard default Demoman

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.449 
just the standard default Demoman
loadout<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.230> haven't<00:03:46.950> really<00:03:47.160> tested

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
loadout and that I haven't really tested

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.120 
loadout and that I haven't really tested
again<00:03:48.030> i<00:03:48.319> just<00:03:49.319> don't<00:03:49.440> really<00:03:49.530> see<00:03:49.829> it<00:03:49.919> working

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
again i just don't really see it working

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.979 
again i just don't really see it working
as<00:03:50.400> well<00:03:50.579> because<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.090> double<00:03:51.389> man<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.720> made

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
as well because the double man is made

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.809 
as well because the double man is made
to<00:03:52.019> be<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.290> lot<00:03:52.530> more<00:03:52.560> mobile<00:03:53.099> than<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.370> soldier

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
to be a lot more mobile than a soldier

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.330 
to be a lot more mobile than a soldier
and<00:03:54.000> because<00:03:54.989> he<00:03:55.019> has<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.500> lot<00:03:55.739> more<00:03:55.889> in<00:03:56.129> terms

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
and because he has a lot more in terms

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.990 
and because he has a lot more in terms
of<00:03:56.609> medium<00:03:57.090> range<00:03:57.680> chances<00:03:58.680> are<00:03:58.919> that<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.970> are

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
of medium range chances are that you are

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.759 
of medium range chances are that you are
going<00:04:00.359> to<00:04:00.540> be<00:04:00.840> named<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.230> protect<00:04:01.620> yourself

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
going to be named to protect yourself

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.339 
going to be named to protect yourself
which<00:04:02.700> is<00:04:02.849> what<00:04:03.180> makes<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.690> Scotsman's<00:04:04.139> goal

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
which is what makes the Scotsman's goal

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.920 
which is what makes the Scotsman's goal
counter<00:04:04.650> somewhat<00:04:05.280> good<00:04:05.519> but<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.389> also<00:04:06.569> seems

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
counter somewhat good but it also seems

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.839 
counter somewhat good but it also seems
somewhat<00:04:07.319> contradictory<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:08.370> equip<00:04:08.700> it

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
somewhat contradictory to equip it

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.250 
somewhat contradictory to equip it
seeing<00:04:09.090> as<00:04:09.239> how<00:04:09.389> you're<00:04:09.599> going<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.930> be<00:04:10.049> moving

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
seeing as how you're going to be moving

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.009 
seeing as how you're going to be moving
at<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.680> speed<00:04:10.799> of<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.099> soldier<00:04:11.639> and<00:04:12.019> chances

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
at the speed of the soldier and chances

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.420 
at the speed of the soldier and chances
are<00:04:13.199> if<00:04:13.410> you're<00:04:13.530> going<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.769> get<00:04:13.889> a<00:04:13.949> melee

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
are if you're going to get a melee

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.539 
are if you're going to get a melee
battle<00:04:14.819> into<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.359> melee<00:04:15.810> battle<00:04:16.229> such<00:04:17.070> as<00:04:17.310> at

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
battle into a melee battle such as at

battle into a melee battle such as at
the<00:04:18.209> speed<00:04:18.449> of<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.750> soldier<00:04:19.169> then<00:04:19.859> you're<00:04:20.190> not

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
the speed of a soldier then you're not

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.660 
the speed of a soldier then you're not
really<00:04:20.549> going<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:21.000> have<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.630> much<00:04:22.079> luck

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
really going to have that much luck

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.320 
really going to have that much luck
honestly<00:04:24.040> that's<00:04:25.040> really<00:04:25.430> all<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:25.640> needs<00:04:26.180> to

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
honestly that's really all that needs to

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.360 
honestly that's really all that needs to
be<00:04:26.480> said<00:04:26.690> about<00:04:26.750> them<00:04:27.170> man<00:04:27.440> loadouts<00:04:27.920> using

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
be said about them man loadouts using

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.640 
be said about them man loadouts using
the<00:04:28.490> skull<00:04:28.700> cutter<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.570> gameplay<00:04:30.020> is<00:04:30.230> coming

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
the skull cutter the gameplay is coming

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.830 
the skull cutter the gameplay is coming
down<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:30.980> close<00:04:31.370> I<00:04:31.640> get<00:04:31.820> second<00:04:32.360> place<00:04:32.390> on

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
down to a close I get second place on

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.320 
down to a close I get second place on
the<00:04:33.140> scoreboard<00:04:33.770> probably<00:04:34.640> because<00:04:34.940> I<00:04:34.970> stood

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
the scoreboard probably because I stood

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.060 
the scoreboard probably because I stood
