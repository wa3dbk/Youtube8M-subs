00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.450
 for candles these mercilessly of course survived 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.570
 the collapse of the Soviet Union and 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:17.420

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.240
 the fire did not give as the guy turned around on 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.700
 my motorcycle and turned around again and 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.070

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.600
 automatically disarmed 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.220
 thanks to alarm pandora which 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.950
 I still haven't paid a penny 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.590
 for such praise in the form we can 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.069
 You can as I speak and take off 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.310
 this guy is the same 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:51.110
 broken suzuki endless already 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:54.020
 the second year he bought him actually 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.539
 bought a radiator pasha radiator became 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.479
 oozing out of it is just losing the butter 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.660
 when this season wanted to 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.750
 go became butter here this season and 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.830
 here I needed a radiator where to get it 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:15.200
 began to look and it turned out that stuffy 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.090
 worth how much 10 10 thousand worth stuffy 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.390
 the radiator is not very good at all 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.360
 seen in this dumb suzuki he 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.819
 wrote dude november like dude if u 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.519

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.580
 nothing but something there answered everything to 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:35.300

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.120

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.170

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.040
 delivery to him in just 7 days all 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.780
 flew and we drove the master about this already 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.730
 Chinese radiator looks right 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.440
 very similar and the master said I set 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.810

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.030

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.280
 here we go and hope that 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.239
 finally it was the last fix 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.690
 this suzuki 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:09.650

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.660

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.640
 still you will be on the wheel and bullshit and 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.370
 not even a hidden alarm 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.490
 I'll tell you what it would be like 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.420
 squealing about some will not hurt anyone 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.730

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.600
 put what record on tape recorder 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.830

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.870

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:49.590

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.970
