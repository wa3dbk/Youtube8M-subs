00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.400 
concerned yes I was at that time we were
looking<00:03:59.400> at<00:03:59.519> prohibition<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.870> hauling<00:04:01.200> fuel

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410

that<00:04:01.650> didn't<00:04:02.220> really<00:04:02.310> make<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.519> lot<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:02.730> sense

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.720 
that didn't really make a lot of sense
to<00:04:03.180> us<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:04.200> logic<00:04:04.410> behind<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:04.950> very<00:04:05.190> sound<00:04:05.519> but

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
to us the logic behind is very sound but

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.580

in<00:04:05.850> this<00:04:05.970> case<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.570> needed<00:04:07.049> to<00:04:07.079> be<00:04:07.140> lifted<00:04:07.500> and

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
in this case it needed to be lifted and

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.490 
in this case it needed to be lifted and
and<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.280> was<00:04:08.570> it<00:04:09.570> is<00:04:09.720> amazing<00:04:10.230> what<00:04:10.350> people
