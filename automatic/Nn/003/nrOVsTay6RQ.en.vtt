 Hydroculture is a cultivation method that involves growing a plant without using soil 

00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:26.608
 To practice this type of cultivation it is necessary to have a clean and disinfected plastic container 

00:00:34.677 --> 00:00:39.677
 better if of the double bottom type with float, suitable for hydroculture 

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:46.434
 Inert substrates are used instead of soil as a growing medium 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 such as expanded clay or perlite, or materials that can retain moisture by transporting it by capillarity 

00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:59.585
 Proceed by choosing a plant, which must be extracted from the substrate in which it is grown 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:08.220
 with the help of first the hands and then of a delicate jet of water the roots of the plant are freed completely from any residue of soil 

00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:17.011
 this phase is very important because subsequently small residues of soil in hydroculture could lead to the subsequent development of mold or rot 

00:01:35.463 --> 00:01:39.463
 Then the hydroculture vessel is filled with the expanded clay, up to about halfway 

00:01:53.045 --> 00:02:04.040
 in the material the roots of the plant are arranged, well spread; finally fill the container up to a couple of centimeters from the edge 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:27.310
 Now proceed by watering the substrate, filling the container with water for a couple of centimeters; in the following days the water, by capillarity, will reach the roots 

00:02:33.202 --> 00:02:41.200
 Since the substrate is inert, it does not contain the mineral salts necessary for the development of the plant, it is therefore essential to add water fertilizer to every watering 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:53.920
 specific fertilizer is used for hydroculture, or even a normal universal fertilizer, but in quantities of about one tenth of that suggested on the package
