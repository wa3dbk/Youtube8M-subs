00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
goes it's that piece right there because

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.030 
goes it's that piece right there because
that<00:03:15.000> goes<00:03:15.150> up<00:03:15.330> beats<00:03:15.960> there<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.800> they<00:03:16.890> need

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
that goes up beats there and they need

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.760 
that goes up beats there and they need
to<00:03:17.160> do<00:03:17.310> two<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.060> these<00:03:18.210> on<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:19.170> other<00:03:19.200> side

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
to do two of these on the other side

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.060 
to do two of these on the other side
there<00:03:20.360> so<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.390> only<00:03:21.570> have<00:03:21.720> one<00:03:21.750> more<00:03:22.020> cut<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.470> do

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
there so I only have one more cut to do

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.840 
there so I only have one more cut to do
so<00:03:23.910> hopefully<00:03:24.060> won't<00:03:24.360> kill<00:03:24.540> myself<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.850> yep
