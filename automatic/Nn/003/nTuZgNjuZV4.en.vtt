00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
okay guys have taken the axial screws

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.670 
okay guys have taken the axial screws
out<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.270> we'll<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> look<00:00:18.930> inside<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.590> see

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
out and we'll have a look inside and see

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.220 
out and we'll have a look inside and see
we've<00:00:19.830> got<00:00:24.439> okay<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:27.990> there's

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
we've got okay so we can see there's

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.810 
we've got okay so we can see there's
there's<00:00:28.769> been<00:00:28.920> an<00:00:29.039> attempt<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.429> put<00:00:29.699> some

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
there's been an attempt to put some

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.770 
there's been an attempt to put some
grease<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.179> there<00:00:30.380> another<00:00:31.380> too<00:00:31.679> bad<00:00:32.570> nice<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
grease in there another too bad nice to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.670 
grease in there another too bad nice to
see<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.770> full<00:00:35.010> set<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.280> bearings<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.680> it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
see that the full set of bearings and it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.119 
see that the full set of bearings and it
looks<00:00:37.920> pretty<00:00:38.879> much<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:40.320> you'd<00:00:40.530> expect

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
looks pretty much as as you'd expect

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.119 
looks pretty much as as you'd expect
I'll<00:00:41.730> check<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> security<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.920> diff

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
I'll check the security of that the diff

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.529 
I'll check the security of that the diff
screws<00:00:44.399> make<00:00:44.670> sure<00:00:44.820> they're<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.000> tight<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
screws make sure they're in tight and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.600 
screws make sure they're in tight and
then<00:00:46.230> I'll<00:00:46.350> grease<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.800> rest<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.250> axle

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
then I'll grease up the rest of the axle

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.200 
then I'll grease up the rest of the axle
and<00:00:48.289> be<00:00:49.289> back<00:00:49.469> innocent

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
right okay there is a nice bit more

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.670 
right okay there is a nice bit more
grease<00:00:55.880> in<00:00:56.060> there<00:00:56.240> now<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:56.600> I'll<00:00:57.170> reassemble

look<00:01:33.830> at<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.100> training<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.880> motor<00:01:35.860> and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
look at the training and the motor and

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.050 
look at the training and the motor and
then<00:01:37.009> I'll<00:01:37.130> tear<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.340> down<00:01:37.610> show<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:37.940> what

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
then I'll tear that down show you what

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.609 
then I'll tear that down show you what
it<00:01:38.149> looks<00:01:38.270> like<00:01:38.390> inside<00:01:38.810> it's<00:01:39.050> a<00:01:39.140> planetary

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
it looks like inside it's a planetary

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.639 
it looks like inside it's a planetary
gearbox<00:01:39.979> from<00:01:40.160> what<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:40.310> understand<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.649> so

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
gearbox from what I understand and so

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.520 
gearbox from what I understand and so
we'll<00:01:43.130> see<00:01:43.280> what<00:01:43.399> that's<00:01:43.550> like<00:01:44.290> I've<00:01:45.290> got<00:01:45.500> a

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
we'll see what that's like I've got a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.100 
we'll see what that's like I've got a
planetary<00:01:46.070> gearbox<00:01:46.610> in<00:01:46.790> mind<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.240> lender<00:01:47.570> but

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
planetary gearbox in mind to lender but

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.690 
planetary gearbox in mind to lender but
I'll<00:01:48.380> find<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.740> bit<00:01:48.920> slow<00:01:49.160> so<00:01:49.190> we'll<00:01:49.550> see

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
I'll find that bit slow so we'll see

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.620 
I'll find that bit slow so we'll see
what<00:01:49.820> this<00:01:49.910> is<00:01:50.000> like<00:01:50.149> when<00:01:50.300> we<00:01:50.360> finish

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
what this is like when we finish

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.020 
what this is like when we finish
building

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.190 

okay<00:01:57.030> I've<00:01:57.090> got<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.300> first<00:01:57.510> cover<00:01:57.810> off<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
okay I've got the first cover off the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.050 
okay I've got the first cover off the
transmission<00:01:58.830> so<00:01:59.220> I'll<00:01:59.400> show<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.730> what<00:01:59.910> was

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
transmission so I'll show you what was

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.640 
transmission so I'll show you what was
underneath<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.890> got<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> planetary<00:02:02.430> gearbox

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
underneath and got a planetary gearbox

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.460 
underneath and got a planetary gearbox
this<00:02:04.650> rotates<00:02:05.430> within<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.630> outer<00:02:07.020> gear

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
this rotates within the outer gear

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.710 
this rotates within the outer gear
casing<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:09.810> gives<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.140> very<00:02:11.360> high<00:02:12.360> gear

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
casing it gives you very high gear

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.410 
casing it gives you very high gear
reduction<00:02:13.970> low<00:02:14.970> gear<00:02:15.240> running<00:02:17.240> my<00:02:18.240> only

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
reduction low gear running my only

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.870 
reduction low gear running my only
concern<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.780> with<00:02:19.140> 45<00:02:19.650> turn<00:02:19.890> motor<00:02:20.130> maybe

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
concern is with 45 turn motor maybe

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.199 
concern is with 45 turn motor maybe
really<00:02:21.510> really<00:02:21.780> slow<00:02:22.850> I'm<00:02:23.850> just<00:02:24.060> going<00:02:24.180> to

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
really really slow I'm just going to

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.180 
really really slow I'm just going to
hook<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.780> 3<00:02:24.959> volt<00:02:25.140> power<00:02:25.440> supply<00:02:25.860> so

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
hook it up to a 3 volt power supply so

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.729 
hook it up to a 3 volt power supply so
you<00:02:26.220> can<00:02:26.370> see<00:02:27.020> what<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.110> looks<00:02:28.290> like<00:02:28.440> when<00:02:28.620> it's

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
you can see what it looks like when it's

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:42.300 
you can see what it looks like when it's
running<00:02:29.690> these<00:02:30.690> are<00:02:30.900> like

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.679 

okay<00:02:43.310> seems<00:02:43.579> quite<00:02:43.849> enough<00:02:44.060> I'll<00:02:44.359> carry<00:02:44.599> on

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
okay seems quite enough I'll carry on

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.780 
okay seems quite enough I'll carry on
tearing<00:02:45.049> down<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.290> rest<00:02:45.469> of<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.950> grease

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
tearing down the rest of it and grease

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.780 
tearing down the rest of it and grease
it<00:02:46.939> all<00:02:46.999> up

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
it all up

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.009 
it all up
okay<00:02:49.790> guys<00:02:49.969> while<00:02:50.239> I<00:02:50.269> was<00:02:50.420> tearing<00:02:50.780> down<00:02:50.870> the

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
okay guys while I was tearing down the

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.339 
okay guys while I was tearing down the
gearbox<00:02:51.379> I<00:02:51.530> noticed<00:02:51.889> there<00:02:52.069> are<00:02:52.099> two<00:02:53.349> nuts

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
gearbox I noticed there are two nuts

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.179 
gearbox I noticed there are two nuts
that<00:02:54.590> are<00:02:54.709> secured<00:02:55.219> inside<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:56.090> gearbox<00:02:56.299> now

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
that are secured inside the gearbox now

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.589 
that are secured inside the gearbox now
as<00:02:58.189> I<00:02:58.310> was<00:02:58.400> undoing<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.969> these<00:02:59.150> fell<00:02:59.450> off

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
as I was undoing it these fell off

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.449 
as I was undoing it these fell off
inside<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.379> gearbox<00:03:00.590> come<00:03:01.069> on<00:03:01.189> focus

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
inside the gearbox come on focus

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.440 
inside the gearbox come on focus
so<00:03:04.459> what<00:03:04.639> I've<00:03:04.760> done<00:03:04.969> just<00:03:05.530> for<00:03:06.530> safety<00:03:07.450> it's

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
so what I've done just for safety it's

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.149 
so what I've done just for safety it's
glued<00:03:09.139> them<00:03:09.260> back<00:03:09.290> in<00:03:09.590> with<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.769> little<00:03:10.010> bit<00:03:10.129> of

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
glued them back in with a little bit of

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.770 
glued them back in with a little bit of
superglue<00:03:10.579> so<00:03:10.879> that<00:03:11.030> in<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.269> event<00:03:11.359> that<00:03:11.599> the

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
superglue so that in the event that the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.449 
superglue so that in the event that the
screws<00:03:12.049> come<00:03:12.319> loose<00:03:12.499> from<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.829> outside<00:03:13.219> I

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
screws come loose from the outside I

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.599 
screws come loose from the outside I
don't<00:03:14.000> drop<00:03:14.379> two<00:03:15.379> metal<00:03:15.889> nuts<00:03:16.099> into<00:03:16.370> my

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
don't drop two metal nuts into my

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:24.099 
don't drop two metal nuts into my
gearbox<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.750> shred<00:03:18.049> everything<00:03:22.989> see<00:03:23.989> the

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
gearbox and shred everything see the

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.369

greased up and ready to go I also made
some<00:03:31.159> progress<00:03:31.459> on<00:03:31.790> building<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.299> shocks

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
some progress on building the shocks

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.379 
some progress on building the shocks
they're<00:03:33.230> all<00:03:33.379> done<00:03:33.969> now<00:03:34.969> we're<00:03:35.150> ready<00:03:35.299> to

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.629 
they're all done now we're ready to
start<00:03:35.659> building<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.530> suspension<00:03:37.189> and<00:03:37.519> the

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
start building the suspension and the

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.890 
start building the suspension and the
springs<00:03:40.209> okay<00:03:41.209> make<00:03:41.419> a<00:03:41.449> little<00:03:41.599> bit<00:03:41.750> more

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
springs okay make a little bit more

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.449 
springs okay make a little bit more
progress<00:03:42.260> one<00:03:42.680> thing<00:03:42.859> I've<00:03:42.949> noticed<00:03:43.099> with

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
progress one thing I've noticed with

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.780 
progress one thing I've noticed with
this<00:03:43.609> build<00:03:43.879> is<00:03:44.060> eight<00:03:44.569> wheels<00:03:45.220> four<00:03:46.220> axles

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
this build is eight wheels four axles

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.439 
this build is eight wheels four axles
eight<00:03:47.720> shock<00:03:48.229> absorbers<00:03:48.739> eight<00:03:49.040> springs<00:03:49.609> so

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:50.449 
eight shock absorbers eight springs so

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.890 
eight shock absorbers eight springs so
many<00:03:50.659> things<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.079> make<00:03:51.259> so<00:03:51.979> many<00:03:52.220> times

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
many things to make so many times

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.069 
many things to make so many times
there's<00:03:53.900> only<00:03:54.699> so<00:03:55.699> many<00:03:55.819> screws<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.299> a<00:03:56.359> bag<00:03:56.599> and

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
there's only so many screws in a bag and

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.749 
there's only so many screws in a bag and
he's<00:03:57.470> so<00:03:57.680> many<00:03:57.829> times<00:03:58.069> you<00:03:58.250> can<00:03:58.370> make<00:03:58.400> one<00:03:58.669> of

00:03:58.749 --> 00:03:58.759 
he's so many times you can make one of

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:02.379 
he's so many times you can make one of
these<00:03:58.930> gets<00:03:59.930> very<00:04:00.169> tedious<00:04:00.729> but<00:04:01.729> these<00:04:02.209> eight

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
these gets very tedious but these eight

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.449 
these gets very tedious but these eight
are<00:04:02.569> done<00:04:02.689> the<00:04:03.530> metal<00:04:03.769> spring<00:04:04.009> hangers<00:04:04.310> at<00:04:04.430> the

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
are done the metal spring hangers at the

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.520 
are done the metal spring hangers at the
top<00:04:04.699> will<00:04:04.909> be<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.269> huge<00:04:05.629> improvement<00:04:05.959> over<00:04:06.409> the

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
top will be a huge improvement over the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.300 
top will be a huge improvement over the
stock<00:04:06.859> plastic<00:04:07.519> ones<00:04:09.040> these<00:04:10.040> are<00:04:10.099> the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
stock plastic ones these are the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.089 
stock plastic ones these are the
replacements<00:04:11.000> at<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.209> top<00:04:11.419> here<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.930> ones<00:04:12.919> in

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
replacements at the top here the ones in

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.610 
replacements at the top here the ones in
the<00:04:13.189> kit<00:04:13.400> are<00:04:13.430> actually<00:04:13.879> plastic<00:04:14.419> and<00:04:15.139> you<00:04:15.470> can

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
the kit are actually plastic and you can

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.899 
the kit are actually plastic and you can
see<00:04:15.799> these<00:04:15.979> are<00:04:16.159> where<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.370> shocks<00:04:16.609> are<00:04:16.759> held

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:16.909 
see these are where the shocks are held

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.430 
see these are where the shocks are held
on<00:04:17.060> so<00:04:17.389> this<00:04:17.509> will<00:04:17.690> be<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.840> massive<00:04:18.289> improvement

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
on so this will be a massive improvement

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
on so this will be a massive improvement
