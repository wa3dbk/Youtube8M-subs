00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.220 

okay<00:00:00.989> so<00:00:01.620> here<00:00:02.129> we're<00:00:02.490> looking<00:00:02.520> at<00:00:03.230> these

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
okay so here we're looking at these

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:13.509 
okay so here we're looking at these
synapse<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:06.049> where<00:00:07.049> we<00:00:07.140> can<00:00:07.259> set<00:00:07.470> macros<00:00:07.799> so<00:00:10.429> I

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.310 

have<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.580> macro<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.179> called<00:00:15.450> hide<00:00:15.780> other<00:00:16.020> apps

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
have a macro here called hide other apps

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:26.359 
have a macro here called hide other apps
and<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.460> performs<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.180> keyboard<00:00:22.100> sequence<00:00:25.369> for

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
and it performs a keyboard sequence for

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.120 
and it performs a keyboard sequence for
a<00:00:26.400> shortcut<00:00:27.050> that<00:00:28.050> cycles<00:00:28.650> through<00:00:28.740> Windows

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
a shortcut that cycles through Windows

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.229 
a shortcut that cycles through Windows
so<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:34.160> signed<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.790> my<00:00:35.910> middle<00:00:36.210> mouse

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so I signed that to my middle mouse

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.270 
so I signed that to my middle mouse
wheel<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.530> when<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:41.070> over<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:43.280> I

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
wheel so when I go over here and I

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.130 
wheel so when I go over here and I
clicked<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.879> middle<00:00:45.420> mouse<00:00:45.570> wheel

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.029 

you<00:00:52.740> know<00:00:52.830> change<00:00:53.220> Windows<00:00:54.230> cycle

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:08.570 

now<00:01:00.609> there's<00:01:00.879> also<00:01:01.089> a<00:01:03.000> neat<00:01:04.860> mouth<00:01:05.860> function

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.740 

called<00:01:11.399> on-the-fly<00:01:12.399> sensitivity<00:01:13.210> where<00:01:15.750> you

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
called on-the-fly sensitivity where you

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:26.340 
called on-the-fly sensitivity where you
can<00:01:16.899> hold<00:01:17.080> this<00:01:17.229> button<00:01:17.470> down<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:26.110> will

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
can hold this button down and it will

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:35.649 
can hold this button down and it will
change<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:26.979> sensitivity

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.149 

as<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:36.469> scroll<00:01:38.289> so<00:01:39.289> let<00:01:39.499> me<00:01:39.619> show<00:01:39.799> you<00:01:39.829> on<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
as you scroll so let me show you on the

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.550 
as you scroll so let me show you on the
screen<00:01:40.340> I<00:01:40.759> will<00:01:41.569> press<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:43.009> mouse<00:01:43.159> button<00:01:44.560> and

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
screen I will press the mouse button and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.069 
screen I will press the mouse button and
then<00:01:46.159> I<00:01:46.280> can<00:01:46.460> scroll<00:01:46.819> and<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:48.709> increases

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
then I can scroll and it increases

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:58.599 
then I can scroll and it increases
sensitivity<00:01:56.319> so<00:01:57.319> that's<00:01:58.159> a<00:01:58.250> pretty<00:01:58.429> cool

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
sensitivity so that's a pretty cool

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:04.690 
sensitivity so that's a pretty cool
thing<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:59.709> like<00:02:00.709> using<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.429> clutch<00:02:02.469> or<00:02:03.700> stages

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
thing I like using the clutch or stages

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:16.770 
thing I like using the clutch or stages
where<00:02:04.969> I<00:02:06.969> create<00:02:07.969> predetermined<00:02:13.840> sensitivity

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
where I create predetermined sensitivity

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.860 
where I create predetermined sensitivity
stages<00:02:18.849> so<00:02:19.849> if<00:02:20.120> we<00:02:20.269> do<00:02:20.420> cycle<00:02:20.959> up<00:02:21.200> sensitivity

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
stages so if we do cycle up sensitivity

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.180 
stages so if we do cycle up sensitivity
okay

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
okay

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.819 
okay
now<00:02:25.190> every<00:02:25.700> time<00:02:28.329> every<00:02:29.329> time<00:02:29.359> I<00:02:29.900> hit<00:02:30.650> that

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
now every time every time I hit that

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.949 
now every time every time I hit that
button<00:02:31.160> it'll<00:02:31.760> go<00:02:32.060> through<00:02:32.329> and<00:02:32.540> cycle

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
button it'll go through and cycle

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.339 
button it'll go through and cycle
through<00:02:32.989> my<00:02:33.290> different<00:02:33.500> stages<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.459> are

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
through my different stages that are

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.309 
through my different stages that are
predetermined<00:02:36.349> I<00:02:37.540> have<00:02:38.540> my<00:02:38.660> first<00:02:38.959> one<00:02:39.170> at

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
predetermined I have my first one at

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.860 
predetermined I have my first one at
really<00:02:39.620> low<00:02:39.889> you're<00:02:40.760> doing<00:02:40.970> Photoshop<00:02:41.510> stuff

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
really low you're doing Photoshop stuff

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.240 
really low you're doing Photoshop stuff
and<00:02:42.620> then<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.609> is<00:02:43.910> middle<00:02:44.540> road<00:02:44.980> 3<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.040> pretty

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
and then to is middle road 3 is pretty

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.759 
and then to is middle road 3 is pretty
sensitive<00:02:47.319> for<00:02:48.319> games

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.570 

so<00:02:53.769> I'll<00:02:54.040> show<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.340> know<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.790> looks<00:02:56.580> like

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
so I'll show you know that looks like

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.259 
so I'll show you know that looks like
click<00:02:59.129> click<00:03:00.129> click<00:03:01.030> click

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
click click click click

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.789 
click click click click
those<00:03:04.269> are<00:03:04.510> my<00:03:04.629> three<00:03:04.900> stages<00:03:05.349> and<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:08.650> can

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
those are my three stages and you can

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.740 
those are my three stages and you can
see<00:03:10.080> in<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.200> program<00:03:11.910> as<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.060> do<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.299> same<00:03:13.510> it

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
see in the program as I do the same it

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:24.180 
see in the program as I do the same it
jumps<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:16.090> each<00:03:16.150> stage

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.480 

so<00:03:24.820> there's<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.750> new<00:03:25.900> house<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.920> glows<00:03:27.190> on

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
so there's the new house and it glows on

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:39.540 
so there's the new house and it glows on
and<00:03:30.490> off<00:03:37.230> which<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.350> nice<00:03:38.590> it's<00:03:38.980> right-handed

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
and off which is nice it's right-handed

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.280 
and off which is nice it's right-handed
it's<00:03:39.730> already<00:03:39.940> sweaty<00:03:40.300> you<00:03:40.660> see<00:03:40.810> some<00:03:40.990> sweat

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
it's already sweaty you see some sweat

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.420 
it's already sweaty you see some sweat
marks<00:03:41.470> on<00:03:41.740> it<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:44.620> we'll<00:03:44.890> see<00:03:45.100> how<00:03:45.250> much<00:03:45.370> of

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
marks on it so we'll see how much of

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:53.760 
marks on it so we'll see how much of
gunk<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:48.190> accumulates<00:03:48.850> over<00:03:49.210> time<00:03:52.650> in<00:03:53.650> these

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
gunk it accumulates over time in these

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.100 
gunk it accumulates over time in these
two<00:03:53.980> buttons<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.640> have<00:03:54.820> I<00:03:55.150> wish<00:03:55.900> there<00:03:56.050> were

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
two buttons I have I wish there were

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.560 
two buttons I have I wish there were
more<00:03:56.140> buttons<00:03:56.680> these<00:03:57.430> two<00:03:57.670> are<00:03:57.820> set<00:03:58.120> for<00:03:58.390> back

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
more buttons these two are set for back

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.590 
more buttons these two are set for back
and<00:03:58.600> forward<00:03:59.140> I<00:03:59.820> use<00:04:00.820> a<00:04:00.850> lot<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.120> web<00:04:01.330> browsing

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
and forward I use a lot of web browsing

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.300 
and forward I use a lot of web browsing
and<00:04:02.070> often<00:04:03.070> use<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.910> back<00:04:04.150> button<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:08.310> could

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
and often use the back button I could

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.100 
and often use the back button I could
probably<00:04:09.520> use<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.940> forward<00:04:10.510> button<00:04:10.810> for

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
probably use the forward button for

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.830 
probably use the forward button for
something<00:04:11.470> else<00:04:11.650> but<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.040> back<00:04:12.250> button<00:04:12.640> is

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
something else but the back button is

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.229 
something else but the back button is
almost<00:04:13.840> necessary<00:04:14.610> for<00:04:15.610> my<00:04:15.760> online<00:04:16.270> business

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
almost necessary for my online business

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.270 
almost necessary for my online business
anyway<00:04:19.239> there's<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.660> business<00:04:19.810> expense<00:04:20.350> well

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
anyway there's the business expense well

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.730 
anyway there's the business expense well
worth<00:04:21.489> it
