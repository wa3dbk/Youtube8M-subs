00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
the next level in terms of if a guy is

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.460 
the next level in terms of if a guy is
hot<00:02:06.939> and<00:02:07.210> has<00:02:07.479> been<00:02:07.689> playing<00:02:07.929> that<00:02:08.020> way<00:02:08.200> for<00:02:08.440> a

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
hot and has been playing that way for a

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.710 
hot and has been playing that way for a
while<00:02:08.530> it's<00:02:09.399> not<00:02:09.670> going<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:09.940> just<00:02:10.090> be<00:02:10.240> reliant

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
while it's not going to just be reliant

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.100 
while it's not going to just be reliant
on<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.990> insider<00:02:11.350> it's<00:02:11.650> also

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
on the insider it's also

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.370 
on the insider it's also
relying<00:02:12.470> on<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:13.070> formula<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.270> so<00:02:14.930> we<00:02:15.260> can

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
relying on a formula and so we can

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.870 
relying on a formula and so we can
really<00:02:15.680> measure<00:02:15.980> whether<00:02:16.310> somebody<00:02:16.820> is

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
really measure whether somebody is

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.280 
really measure whether somebody is
playing<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> maximum<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:18.080> their

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
playing to the maximum of their

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.320 
playing to the maximum of their
capabilities<00:02:18.890> it's<00:02:19.340> more<00:02:19.580> about<00:02:19.670> giving<00:02:20.150> a

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
capabilities it's more about giving a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.540 
capabilities it's more about giving a
rating<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:21.050> range<00:02:21.350> as<00:02:21.680> opposed<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.220> that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
rating a range as opposed to just that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.430 
rating a range as opposed to just that
one<00:02:22.880> number<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.480> know<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.600> mean<00:02:23.810> absolutely

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
one number you know I mean absolutely

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.010 
one number you know I mean absolutely
and<00:02:24.740> of<00:02:24.920> course<00:02:25.130> powered<00:02:25.430> by<00:02:25.550> static<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.360> we're

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
and of course powered by static so we're

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.990 
and of course powered by static so we're
going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.200> be<00:02:27.290> able<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.650> take<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.610> take<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
going to be able to take the take the

able to pull in this year is going to

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.180 
able to pull in this year is going to
really<00:02:34.730> just<00:02:35.440> make<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.590> game<00:02:36.740> feel<00:02:36.980> more

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
really just make the game feel more

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.430 
really just make the game feel more
alive<00:02:37.460> than<00:02:37.520> ever<00:02:37.850> before<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.540> I'm<00:02:38.990> talking<00:02:39.350> it

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
alive than ever before so I'm talking it

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.680 
alive than ever before so I'm talking it
always<00:02:39.709> telling<00:02:40.010> me<00:02:40.070> that<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.420> game<00:02:41.420> is

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
always telling me that the game is

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.600 
always telling me that the game is
always<00:02:42.500> taken<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.860> another<00:02:43.010> level<00:02:43.130> every

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
always taken to another level every

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.220 
always taken to another level every
single<00:02:43.910> year<00:02:44.000> what<00:02:44.750> do<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:44.840> think<00:02:44.930> about<00:02:45.080> this

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
single year what do you think about this

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.050 
single year what do you think about this
absolutely<00:02:45.980> well<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.160> think<00:02:46.520> this<00:02:46.610> brings

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
absolutely well I think this brings

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.670 
absolutely well I think this brings
another<00:02:47.300> dynamic<00:02:47.570> into<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.230> game<00:02:48.350> definitely

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
another dynamic into the game definitely

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.610 
another dynamic into the game definitely
like<00:02:49.490> stats<00:02:49.820> are<00:02:50.030> going<00:02:50.239> to<00:02:50.390> be<00:02:50.540> updated<00:02:51.440> I

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
like stats are going to be updated I

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.170 
like stats are going to be updated I
guess<00:02:51.770> more<00:02:51.950> often<00:02:52.340> yeah<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.850> that's<00:02:53.060> gonna

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
guess more often yeah and that's gonna

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.520 
guess more often yeah and that's gonna
be<00:02:53.330> really<00:02:53.450> great<00:02:53.720> because<00:02:53.959> then<00:02:54.140> you're

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
be really great because then you're

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.810 
be really great because then you're
watching<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:55.040> game<00:02:55.190> you're<00:02:55.430> seeing<00:02:55.730> your

you said he may be on a hot streak maybe

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.180 
you said he may be on a hot streak maybe
not<00:02:59.390> so<00:02:59.570> much<00:02:59.750> but<00:02:59.989> you're<00:03:00.410> gonna<00:03:00.620> see<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:00.980> as

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
not so much but you're gonna see that as

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.070 
not so much but you're gonna see that as
well<00:03:01.370> in<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.730> game<00:03:01.880> yeah<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:02.600> that's<00:03:02.840> gonna<00:03:02.989> be

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
well in the game yeah so that's gonna be

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.479 
well in the game yeah so that's gonna be
interesting<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.709> see<00:03:03.800> how<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:04.160> plays<00:03:04.250> out

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
interesting to see how that plays out

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.850 
interesting to see how that plays out
and<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.209> is<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.660> colluded<00:03:06.080> to<00:03:06.110> it's<00:03:06.440> not<00:03:06.590> just

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
and and is a colluded to it's not just

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.890 
and and is a colluded to it's not just
gonna<00:03:06.950> be<00:03:07.070> for<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.790> big<00:03:07.970> market<00:03:08.330> teams<00:03:08.570> which

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
gonna be for the big market teams which

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.600 
gonna be for the big market teams which
I<00:03:09.020> think<00:03:09.230> sometimes<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.770> perception<00:03:10.160> and

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
I think sometimes is a perception and
