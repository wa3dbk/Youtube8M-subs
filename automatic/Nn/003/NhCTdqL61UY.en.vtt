00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.920
 d 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.310

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.939
 that you guys enjoy a lot in the evenings on tv globe the indian because it is impunity 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.960
 now tries to establish compensation will be a dubbing studio of the 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.730
 series that I'm going to find out said 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.150
 who are these voices from beyond and what is the method used to incorporate 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.650
 demons and vampires goes well in the voice of the original owner goes well in the voice of 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.010
 character will you 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.990
 try to be smart the person talks 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.949
 messed up talking to somebody 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.829
 with the team that you looked for this is the guy 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.589
 has a louder voice suddenly you boot very serious voice does not get cool 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.910
 however come from the character besides a good our donors in the vision 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.500
 he left with that line with his feet that name 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.660
 nothing has to do with supernatural powers 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.320
 which is good to always stress 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.200
 that we were all piauienses actors suddenly people handle the dubbing 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.470

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.030
 after winning the two basic prerequisites of dubbing 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.760
 Here comes the Brazilian way to translate it sometimes it comes a lot 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.350
 so it came in very hard, right. 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.280
 so we're going to leave something more quiet, but it's understandable more 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.030
 colloquial 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.470
