00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.310
 in the city 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.450
 It should be noted that the whole variety 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.720
 quality and all the prices that have been 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.700
 on behalf of the subway tradition have 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.700
 arrived in the city ​​of Arequipa 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.820
 as you can appreciate the opening has 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.580
 a good one a good one 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.190
 good expectation we will be 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.409
 dialoguing the general manager of 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.729
 cencosud perú mario campodonico with 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.860
 some media 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.509
 function to the opening of metro in the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.930
 city of arequipa let's listen to your 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.240
 declarations of provinces and regions 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.190
 actually then we are always 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.930
 seeing where there are needs where 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.030
 we see that there is something to contribute from 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.619
 our where there are needs of the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.500
 consumers there we are going to be us 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.240
 this year that other cities have thought 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.179
 day by day we have several projects in 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.490
 folder and you the press are going to go 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.990
 gradually learning what is wrong 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.970
 all projects are necessarily 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.759
 they finish concreting by different 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.610
 circumstances that are sometimes unrelated to 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.739
 our own company then I prefer 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.120
 no no no yes you comment on what I can 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.860
 to say is that there are many things that 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.239
 are evaluating many options and 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.890
 you are going to be informed of that 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.480
 same this year from more or less in 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.450
 How much are we about sales of 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.190
 investments is permanently reviewed 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.319
 already today we are thinking of 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.810
 investments towards 2015 we are 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:37.060
 working on that plan now and how much 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.950
 more now I prefer not to delve into the subject 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.390
 because finally I can give you one 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.390
 figure but that figure may be higher 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.640
 can be valid will depend on how 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.640
 that so many projects are finished 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.830
 specify but the main idea is that 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.630
 Cencosud continues to advance with its 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.810
 meters formats will continue to grow on 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.510
 Peru is still betting on Peru and we are going 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.850
 to move forward a lot we will continue 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.730
 generating work to many people 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.070
 bring modernity to the people quality 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.020
 service a good assortment a good 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.050
 attention that's basically what more 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.490
 we care about the market for 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.350
 Shopping centers in Arequipa and 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.910
 concrete supermarkets is growing 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.350
 obviously there is more competition 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.630
 what is the differential offered by the 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.230
 let's say in this metro is a brand 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.330
 that has a very strong roots 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.550
 Peruvians have a perception of 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.080
 our brand is tremendously positive 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:37.630
 evokes many positive things on issues of 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.630
 quality of service prices 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.590
 but it's a set of things that make 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.510
 the brand very special method and that makes 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.940
 that is effectively maintained as a 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.440
 leader in your field knowing this 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.030
 market market market commitment 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.130
 special why they have opened a store 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.510
 that in equipping and that they will offer 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.510
 also special 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.430
 I believe that there is one you can see 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.370
 now the stores and promotions 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.319
 on time we set a pattern in 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.390
 price but I think that while the price 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.829
 it's important there are other variables that 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.230
 they are much more important than you have 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.780
 a nice place to come and buy 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.010
 Where do you have an adequate assortment that 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.919
 people find me what 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.530
 is effectively looking to give 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.260
 work to more people is not true 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.240
 give it a space of modernity I think 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.900
 that is the sum of things there is not a single 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.910
 variable the average that all these things 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.650
 work well are well integrated I 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.580
 I think in the end the client is the one 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.350
 decide 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.360
 in statements that the general manager 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.370
 of cencosud is Peru is the camera can 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.440
 help to see in the amount of 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.630
 expectations that he has handled in the 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.070
 opening of meters in the district of 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.440
 hunter with these table images we 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.880
 we are going to studies has opened meters in 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.180
 the leaving district already has a new 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.280
 alternative to do the shopping on 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.720
 today at least this end of 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.669
 week and the whole alternative that goes to 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.409
 present in all activities that 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.939
 start meters in 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.929
 the city of arequipa the information of 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.929
 the studies
