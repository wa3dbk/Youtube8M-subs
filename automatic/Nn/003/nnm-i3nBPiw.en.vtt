work every day we do the science we do
our<00:03:54.810> homework<00:03:55.050> we<00:03:55.590> design<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:57.360> effective<00:03:58.320> and

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
our homework we design the effective and

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.360 
our homework we design the effective and
right<00:04:00.060> experiments<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.350> we<00:04:01.590> can<00:04:01.799> get<00:04:02.010> test

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
right experiments so we can get test

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.390 
right experiments so we can get test
compounds<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.299> drugs<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.680> clinics<00:04:05.160> and
