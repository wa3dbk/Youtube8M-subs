00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.980 
a neat board and some other life jackets
that<00:04:04.010> will<00:04:04.160> come<00:04:04.310> with<00:04:04.459> it

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.010 

pretty<00:04:07.650> much<00:04:07.770> that's<00:04:08.370> it<00:04:08.750> these<00:04:09.750> are<00:04:09.900> the

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
pretty much that's it these are the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.400 
pretty much that's it these are the
tires<00:04:10.470> that<00:04:10.890> are<00:04:10.920> on<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.990> there's<00:04:12.990> not<00:04:13.170> much

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
tires that are on it there's not much

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.870 
tires that are on it there's not much
clearance<00:04:13.770> here<00:04:14.070> so<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.280> don't<00:04:14.340> think<00:04:14.550> we<00:04:14.730> can

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
clearance here so I don't think we can

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.210 
clearance here so I don't think we can
fit<00:04:15.060> any<00:04:15.240> other<00:04:15.450> bigger<00:04:15.720> tire<00:04:16.020> on<00:04:16.260> here<00:04:16.530> just

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
fit any other bigger tire on here just

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.220 
fit any other bigger tire on here just

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
need to get heavy-duty they have a CE

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.690 
need to get heavy-duty they have a CE
rating<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.709> these<00:04:19.920> tires<00:04:21.020> might<00:04:22.020> need<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.290> get

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
rating of these tires might need to get

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.200 
rating of these tires might need to get
one<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.820> those<00:04:23.910> I<00:04:24.860> have<00:04:25.860> one<00:04:26.160> extra<00:04:26.370> as<00:04:26.970> it

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
one of those I have one extra as it

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.790 
one of those I have one extra as it
stands<00:04:29.420> but<00:04:30.420> they<00:04:30.540> have<00:04:30.690> heavy-duty<00:04:31.170> ones<00:04:31.560> as

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
stands but they have heavy-duty ones as

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.020 
stands but they have heavy-duty ones as
well<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:33.150> here's<00:04:34.140> the<00:04:34.470> only<00:04:34.920> lens<00:04:35.130> cover<00:04:35.460> it's

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
well and here's the only lens cover it's

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.580 
well and here's the only lens cover it's
missing<00:04:36.420> but<00:04:36.600> I<00:04:36.660> think<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:36.990> have<00:04:37.140> another<00:04:37.350> light

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
missing but I think I have another light

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.200 
missing but I think I have another light
I<00:04:37.620> might<00:04:37.950> be<00:04:38.310> able<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.490> throw<00:04:38.730> that<00:04:38.880> on<00:04:38.940> real

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
I might be able to throw that on real

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.370 
I might be able to throw that on real
quick<00:04:39.480> I<00:04:44.150> mean<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.240> trailer<00:04:45.600> itself<00:04:46.020> is<00:04:46.260> in

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
quick I mean the trailer itself is in

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.260 
quick I mean the trailer itself is in
good<00:04:46.500> shape<00:04:46.560> it's<00:04:46.950> just<00:04:47.100> tiny<00:04:47.400> bit<00:04:47.700> small<00:04:48.000> for

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
good shape it's just tiny bit small for

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.940 
good shape it's just tiny bit small for
the<00:04:48.330> boat<00:04:48.600> I<00:04:48.810> think<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.560> then<00:04:50.250> it<00:04:50.370> takes<00:04:50.550> a

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
the boat I think and then it takes a

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.750 
the boat I think and then it takes a
round<00:04:52.950> plug<00:04:53.340> not<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:53.610> flat<00:04:54.890> so<00:04:55.890> there<00:04:56.640> you<00:04:56.700> have

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
round plug not a flat so there you have

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.190 
round plug not a flat so there you have
it

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.330 

we<00:05:02.200> call<00:05:02.470> her<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.490> Eliminator<00:05:05.040> so<00:05:06.040> there<00:05:06.220> you

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
we call her the Eliminator so there you

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.490 
we call her the Eliminator so there you
go
