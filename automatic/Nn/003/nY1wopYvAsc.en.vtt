00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.400
 food 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.070

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.110

 exceptionally good brain he can 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.549
 complicated mathematical formulas so 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.250
 apply a head 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.979
 his memory seems to be infinite

 he can also learn any language extremely quickly 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.250
 as he taught in the Icelandic language 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.799
 bad 7 days 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.070
 then to think that after six years I am French 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.880
 does not get beyond the mood mark 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.250

 he even has a car for it 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.530
 pulled out 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.970
 that was stuck with a metal plate on it 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.950
 his belly 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.320
 what is extra remarkable is that being 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.130
 children also have the gift 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.340
 it's probably hereditary but number 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.300

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.050

 world records 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.840
 including the record for so long 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.640
 possibly in a container with ice water 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.810
 He saw him through his 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.270
 breathing his own 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.040
 body temperature 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.380
 he also teaches his techniques to others 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.150
 people though, I doubt if you will do anything 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.150
 because the earth is getting warmer 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.989

 since 1973 he did not come to sleep 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.280
 and never feels sleepy either 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.510
 he has been examined several times and 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.400
 declared healthy 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.340
 while ordinary people suffer after two days 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.280
 getting mood swings 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:17.230
 memory loss and hallucinations 7 days 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.900
 not sleeping is like deadly number 3 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.420
 daniel brownings with denyo brownings with 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.950
 is the most flexible man in the world and 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.660
 he can put himself in every possible 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.160

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.510
 I can do even more a headline myself 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.530
 but he can get himself through one 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.530
 move a tennis racket 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.480
 number two 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.850

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.800
 reflexes in the world with its katana can 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.420
 he even split the fired bullet in two 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.130
 beating normal people 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.230
 we would long ball long they are 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.240
 flown before they even got a response 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.850
 can give 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.709
 number 1 tim crippler 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.000

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.130
 no gain 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.050
 but then tim is really a problem because 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.120
 by a deviation in his nerves 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.980
 he doesn't feel pain he has an app 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.080
 with which you can get all kinds of screwdrivers and 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.490
 barbecues skewers so a poor one or 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.350
 face stealth 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.600
 I have to shiver at the thought 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.910
 but he does it without problems 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.540
 these were already the 10 people with real ones 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.580
