cameras<00:00:48.150> backwards<00:00:48.630> sorry

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.600 

mrm<00:00:52.310> all-natural<00:00:52.910> egg<00:00:53.390> white<00:00:53.870> protein<00:00:53.900> and<00:00:54.829> it

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
mrm all-natural egg white protein and it

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.710 
mrm all-natural egg white protein and it
has<00:00:56.290> 100<00:00:57.290> calories<00:00:57.430> in<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.610> scoop<00:00:58.970> and<00:01:01.480> 23<00:01:02.480> grams

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
has 100 calories in a scoop and 23 grams

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.890 
has 100 calories in a scoop and 23 grams
of<00:01:02.960> protein<00:01:04.239> has<00:01:05.239> zero<00:01:05.570> fat<00:01:06.100> zero<00:01:07.100> sugars<00:01:07.550> and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
of protein has zero fat zero sugars and

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.050 
of protein has zero fat zero sugars and
1.5<00:01:08.900> carbs<00:01:10.630> so<00:01:11.630> i<00:01:11.990> think<00:01:12.670> i'm<00:01:13.670> going<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.940> give

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
1.5 carbs so i think i'm going to give

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.300 
1.5 carbs so i think i'm going to give
that<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:14.240> try<00:01:14.360> as<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.690> good<00:01:14.930> substitute<00:01:15.200> we<00:01:16.160> had

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
that a try as a good substitute we had

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.590 
that a try as a good substitute we had
there's<00:01:16.550> another<00:01:16.820> type<00:01:17.270> Roy<00:01:19.420> I've<00:01:20.420> heard

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
there's another type Roy I've heard

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.280 
there's another type Roy I've heard
people<00:01:20.750> talk<00:01:21.080> about<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.470> on<00:01:21.590> here<00:01:21.770> before

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.760 

Rob<00:01:25.130> Bray<00:01:25.610> or<00:01:25.940> something<00:01:26.240> like<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:26.770> another

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
Rob Bray or something like that another

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.710 
Rob Bray or something like that another
brand<00:01:28.130> which<00:01:28.520> had<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.090> egg<00:01:29.240> white<00:01:29.420> which<00:01:29.570> is

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
brand which had the egg white which is

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.900 
brand which had the egg white which is
similar<00:01:29.990> but<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:30.440> had<00:01:30.650> sugar<00:01:31.070> alcohols<00:01:31.610> in<00:01:31.760> it

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
similar but it had sugar alcohols in it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.720 
similar but it had sugar alcohols in it
and<00:01:32.210> more<00:01:32.600> carbs<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.260> I<00:01:33.650> think<00:01:33.950> gram<00:01:34.550> and<00:01:34.700> a

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
and more carbs and I think gram and a

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.970 
and more carbs and I think gram and a
half<00:01:34.850> of<00:01:35.000> fat<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:35.240> I<00:01:35.720> went<00:01:36.200> with<00:01:36.320> this<00:01:36.500> instead

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
half of fat so I went with this instead

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.260 
half of fat so I went with this instead
I'll<00:01:37.340> probably<00:01:37.520> try<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:39.100> use<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.340> powder<00:01:40.520> for

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
I'll probably try and use the powder for

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.740 
I'll probably try and use the powder for
a<00:01:41.300> protein<00:01:41.690> once<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.590> day<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.060> either<00:01:44.060> do<00:01:44.390> an

a protein once a day and either do an

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.550 
a protein once a day and either do an
egg<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:45.110> egg<00:01:45.200> whites<00:01:46.030> later<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.990> know<00:01:48.110> for<00:01:48.470> my

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
egg and egg whites later you know for my

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.350 
egg and egg whites later you know for my
second<00:01:48.950> meal<00:01:49.100> but<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:49.340> don't<00:01:49.790> know<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.330> know

second meal but I don't know you know
you<00:01:50.510> know<00:01:50.570> supposed<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.930> have<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.110> same

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
you know supposed to have the same

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.020 
you know supposed to have the same
protein<00:01:51.740> twice<00:01:52.010> in<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.280> day<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:52.700> don't<00:01:52.910> know

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
protein twice in the day so I don't know

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.330 
protein twice in the day so I don't know
if<00:01:53.060> egg<00:01:53.810> white<00:01:54.020> powder<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.560> having<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.190> eggs

if egg white powder and having the eggs

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.620 
if egg white powder and having the eggs
counts<00:01:55.910> is<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.090> same<00:01:56.390> thing<00:01:56.860> so<00:01:57.860> I<00:01:58.540> can't<00:01:59.540> do

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
counts is the same thing so I can't do

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.210 
counts is the same thing so I can't do
cottage<00:01:59.960> cheese<00:02:00.259> because<00:02:00.619> that's<00:02:00.800> one<00:02:01.040> of<00:02:01.130> my

trigger<00:02:01.460> foods<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:03.350> know<00:02:03.440> if<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:03.880> started

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
trigger foods and I know if I started

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.460 
trigger foods and I know if I started
office<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.330> eat<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.570> whole<00:02:05.690> tub<00:02:05.960> so

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.680 

I<00:02:08.560> don't<00:02:09.130> know<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:09.430> might<00:02:09.670> try<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.060> do<00:02:10.450> some

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
I don't know I might try and do some

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.510 
I don't know I might try and do some
tilapia

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
tilapia

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.820 
tilapia
or<00:02:13.090> maybe<00:02:13.330> some<00:02:13.630> shrimp<00:02:13.960> I<00:02:14.110> might<00:02:14.410> be<00:02:14.620> able<00:02:14.680> to

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
or maybe some shrimp I might be able to

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.510 
or maybe some shrimp I might be able to
get<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.130> down<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:16.800> even<00:02:17.800> trying<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.250> find<00:02:18.430> a

simians protocol it says as far as
artificial<00:02:39.190> sweeteners<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.790> can<00:02:39.940> use<00:02:40.180> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
artificial sweeteners you can use the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.260 
artificial sweeteners you can use the
stevia<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.960> saccharine<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.430> what<00:02:43.180> I'm

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
stevia and saccharine and what I'm

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.050 
stevia and saccharine and what I'm
wondering<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:44.160> he<00:02:45.160> developed<00:02:45.520> this<00:02:45.580> protocol

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
wondering is he developed this protocol

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.360 
wondering is he developed this protocol
so<00:02:46.300> long<00:02:46.570> ago<00:02:46.870> when<00:02:47.320> he<00:02:47.440> developed<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:48.010> was

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
so long ago when he developed it was

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.310 
so long ago when he developed it was
there<00:02:48.550> any<00:02:48.790> other<00:02:49.210> artificial<00:02:49.690> sweetener

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
there any other artificial sweetener

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.750 
there any other artificial sweetener
available<00:02:50.770> other<00:02:50.950> than<00:02:51.010> stevia<00:02:51.700> and

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
available other than stevia and

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.750 
available other than stevia and
saccharine<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:53.200> I'm<00:02:53.290> wondering<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:54.100> don't<00:02:54.700> know

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
saccharine so I'm wondering I don't know

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.810 
saccharine so I'm wondering I don't know
if<00:02:54.820> he's<00:02:54.940> dead<00:02:55.120> or<00:02:55.180> alive<00:02:55.450> but<00:02:56.550> our<00:02:57.550> other

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
if he's dead or alive but our other

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.060 
if he's dead or alive but our other
artificial<00:02:58.360> sweeteners<00:02:58.930> may<00:02:59.110> be<00:02:59.170> okay<00:02:59.620> maybe

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
artificial sweeteners may be okay maybe

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.650 
artificial sweeteners may be okay maybe
they<00:03:00.310> aren't<00:03:00.460> on<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.700> protocol<00:03:01.150> just<00:03:01.360> because

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
they aren't on the protocol just because

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.600 
they aren't on the protocol just because
they<00:03:01.870> hadn't<00:03:02.590> been<00:03:02.740> developed<00:03:03.190> when<00:03:03.460> the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
they hadn't been developed when the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.140 
they hadn't been developed when the
protocol<00:03:04.290> was<00:03:05.290> put<00:03:05.560> into<00:03:05.710> place<00:03:06.010> so<00:03:06.460> I<00:03:06.730> don't

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
protocol was put into place so I don't

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.730 
protocol was put into place so I don't
know<00:03:07.240> if<00:03:07.270> anyone<00:03:07.510> else<00:03:07.810> has<00:03:08.050> tried<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.500> but<00:03:08.680> I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
know if anyone else has tried that but I

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.250 
know if anyone else has tried that but I
would<00:03:08.860> be<00:03:09.070> curious<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.490> know

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
would be curious to know

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.929 
would be curious to know
if<00:03:11.860> some<00:03:12.189> of<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.310> other<00:03:12.549> artificial

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
if some of the other artificial

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:18.179 
if some of the other artificial
sweeteners<00:03:13.480> are<00:03:13.750> okay<00:03:14.409> like<00:03:16.890> for<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:18.010> day<00:03:18.159> I

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
sweeteners are okay like for the day I

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.729 
sweeteners are okay like for the day I
know<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.879> like<00:03:19.150> aspartame<00:03:19.599> was<00:03:19.989> bad<00:03:20.349> for<00:03:20.379> you

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739

artificial sweetener options but I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.550
