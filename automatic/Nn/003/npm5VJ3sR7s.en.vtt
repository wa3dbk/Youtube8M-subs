and you can extend it to different
lengths<00:00:55.920> as<00:00:56.039> well<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.670> cable<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.300> it's

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
lengths as well the cable here it's

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.479 
lengths as well the cable here it's
plugs<00:00:57.719> into<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> into<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.410> wall<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:59.160> can

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
plugs into the into the wall it can

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.729 
plugs into the into the wall it can
simply<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.690> clip<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.020> there<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.440> so

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
simply just clip in there like that so

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.200 
simply just clip in there like that so
you<00:01:01.829> kind<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.160> use<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> would<00:01:02.760> your
