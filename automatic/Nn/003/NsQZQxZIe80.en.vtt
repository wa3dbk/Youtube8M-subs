every<00:00:06.120> day<00:00:06.300> many<00:00:06.630> people<00:00:06.990> travel<00:00:07.500> on<00:00:07.590> these

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
every day many people travel on these

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.330 
every day many people travel on these
roads<00:00:08.040> driving<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.360> work<00:00:09.540> or<00:00:09.840> home<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
roads driving to work or home and the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.700 
roads driving to work or home and the
drivers<00:00:11.760> just<00:00:12.000> rely<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.080> roads<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.590> be

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
drivers just rely on the roads to be

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.670 
drivers just rely on the roads to be
safe<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.730> during<00:00:15.300> winter<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.870> means<00:00:16.139> it

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
safe so during winter that means it

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.070 
safe so during winter that means it
should<00:00:16.710> be<00:00:16.980> free<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.430> snow<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.090> ice<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
should be free of snow and ice and the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.510 
should be free of snow and ice and the
road<00:00:19.110> should<00:00:19.380> be<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.619> good<00:00:19.740> condition

them<00:00:36.770> what<00:00:37.100> we<00:00:37.220> could<00:00:37.400> do<00:00:37.520> more<00:00:37.850> than<00:00:38.060> just

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
them what we could do more than just

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.690 
them what we could do more than just
supplying<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.050> road<00:00:39.260> so<00:00:39.470> they<00:00:40.280> were<00:00:40.340> telling

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
supplying the road so they were telling
