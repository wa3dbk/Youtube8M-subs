00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
committed they had to be to learning and

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.900 
committed they had to be to learning and
they<00:02:31.260> would<00:02:31.440> spend<00:02:31.709> long<00:02:32.250> period<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.670> time

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
they would spend long period of time

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.490 
they would spend long period of time
sticking<00:02:33.300> their<00:02:33.569> fingers<00:02:33.599> down<00:02:33.989> their<00:02:34.230> throat

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
sticking their fingers down their throat

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.910
