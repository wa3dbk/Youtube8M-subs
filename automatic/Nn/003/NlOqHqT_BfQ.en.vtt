00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.549
 a beautiful first of september 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.960
 I wish you and I get up here 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.860
 Yes, I am on an iceberg 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.960
 very high in the north and bring this time 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.510
 I'll give you a little video to jÃ¶rg dehm 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.939
 Ice Dragon is wonderful in here 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.830
 action and all graphic splendor can see 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.660
 I was just a little bit far now 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.939
 in front and we have just now 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.279
 a longer time tries to kill them 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.960
 get what is successful if god 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.960
 Thank you 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.000
 this is the first phase starts in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.469
 principle so that he lands then comes 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.550
 This ice was there you can do a bit 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.530
 hurt it 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.480
 but one should not be too far 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.579
 Going forward is served all the time 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.100
 and then he makes ice waves the man 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.600
 but can dodge the wave 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.090
 Takes you over too far in front 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.670
 stands 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.219
 then elementary spawn the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.320
 veterans plus smaller the veteran 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.539
 the little ones spawn accordingly 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.670
 Quickly try to pump everything away 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.040
 here you can look at this how to get in 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.850
 my action bar looks at jessicas 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.450
 resort to grenades and kids 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.860
 you can do a lot of harm 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.490
 and the safe range 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.900
 You can fight before you get back to it 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.909
 that ice because come on or 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.680
 the dragon itself one must only times 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:29.369
 get rid of these elementals, too 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.710
 take some time and as you can see 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.869
 the incoming sometimes not careful 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.979
 is a bit high in general 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.670
 Complete fight is all about 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.509
 revive revive 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.360
 revive 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.659
 the whole time we were at the end 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.100
 we 60 maybe one at this one 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.810
 dragon what lie to me but the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.579
 were also badly needed because we had 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.920
 short-term really the problem that way 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.380
 many people were dead 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.020
 the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.049
 we are practically only on the back and forth 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.759
 run between the waypoint and the 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.720
 kites were the waypoints is by the way 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.240
 relatively close 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.260
 It may be just under 30 seconds 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.370
 footpath but that costs just on duration 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.720
 or 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.180
 makes the armor good in the long run 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.620
 as you see, they go as elemental 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.620
 slowly but surely thumb 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:33.190
 once the attack itself 234 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.849
 Sinn Rocket Liebs 5 is a hit target 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:42.239
 prevents harm briefly bit 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:45.580
 problem is it relatively entertaining and 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.430
 the main thing an attack can do the rest 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.840
 you have to roll with the mechanics 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.880
 Incidentally, always be revived because 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.940
 they shoot at the barricade 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.170
 with and you see barricade is last 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.299
 gone I'm here just one more 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.549
 mystery 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.940
 as soon as the brutal down goes york 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.980
 confessed that is the only time 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.430
 which effectively really hurt in phase 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:14.709
 One thing you can do is try too much 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.389
 to press as it gets and then 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.130
 he starts again to view 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.889
 berappeln and goes in the air 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.200
 on the small round flight 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:25.359
 then you have to go back 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.799
 bring her another 50 percent then slammed 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.100
 once against a rock wall 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:33.190
 landeversuch and is then in phase 2 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.190
 Here we see the phase 2 is 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.690
 Well, I'm a lot harder than that 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.630
 first phase I say 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.829
 you see, ice cream is here all the time 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.230
 choose and pillar those ice and the goal 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.209
 this phase 2 is practically this ice 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.489
 should the bombs golems the whole 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.260
 time from the top down the ice 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.840
 be cleared out of the way so that the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.579
 bombing golems can be effectively done 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.860
 should not be so far in advance 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.170
 Go as you see here 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.210
 if I am the same accordingly 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.530
 be grilled 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:12.640
 here is a successful test to the 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.290
 with shield identification iron golems kpc 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.260
 meanwhile a flamer of the very 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.010
 good against the be it is me 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.350
 just a bit behind 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.890
 the golems come through if enough 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.600
 golems got through then he becomes 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.280
 confessed and then you can finally 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.430
 at least make a short-term harm 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:40.540
 Put here again without changing so 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:46.540
 theis are said to have been confessed and 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.890
 now as quickly as possible toward all 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.870
 cut out damage because somehow goes 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.970
 By the way, the flamethrower does a lot 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:58.120
 well hurt him and the whole game 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.830
 in phase one were hurt make away 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.200
 run then do not hurt running 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.700
 and as soon as he starts moving again 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.620
 he would lead to again and then should 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:13.800
 you also go away again because of the 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:16.419
 chill around him is really hard and 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.930
 lang could not fight back 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:23.140
 Here now come to the last to 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.270
 Last tempo we also down to them 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.010
 luck 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.950
 All in all a very nice one 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.220
 By the way, fight really epic us 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:38.080
 have fought with him for 40 minutes 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:40.000
 it was very funny so fun 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.500
 So far, I did not know about that of 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.490
 the huge kite here comes the same 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.260
 He makes his ice even more of a golden one 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.920
 beam again that makes a lot 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.450
 of the people and here comes the golem 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.800
 I'll do that again soon 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.070
 thumbs go because I was a bit too 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.720
 far ahead or am parting too late 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.630
 this ice scale will make a stop 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.980
 a lot of damage on the ground 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.980
 you should just go out as possible 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:19.540
 and then he is already dead yes that 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.210
 was like the ice dragon 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.850
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.620
 this little video and if that's it 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.480
 absolutely try it yourself 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.320
 just go to the north in the 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.710
 zither summit 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.280
 there you can see him so until the 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.850
 next time 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.850
 take care
