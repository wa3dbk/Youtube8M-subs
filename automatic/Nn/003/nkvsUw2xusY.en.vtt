00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.540
 Hey, folks here is Fernando and well. 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.400
 came to another button video was from 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.099
 4 personal this time I will make a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.520
 quick review of game views all 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.690
 the media 1 x 1 we go to m4 16 because it was 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.750
 one of the weapons in Libya in all 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.199
 media and I will mainly compare 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.750
 the field of view on the screen and for me is the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.109
 most important film of all 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.540
 I will follow the reddot rds sites and the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.270
 that are perhaps the most used 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.680
 all these in the field vote and I will show 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.840
 for you the transition from a crosshair to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.420
 another and you will perfectly 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.730
 how much it occupies on the face screen in 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.399
 battlefield 3 we had only two 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.230
 sights of each because they had no china and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.180
 now with one more country to choose fair 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.160
 that we have a third type of look 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.510
 I'll start with the snake that maybe a 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.309
 of the ways most used in all 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.050
 battlefield 3 and sure to be 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.579
 also newbie was 4 and you are 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.670
 seeing that it does not occupy very 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.660
 the iron screen of the body 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.119
 equipment 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.680
 it steals very little screen space has 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.290
 these 3-1 leave 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.060
 the technician always claims to have enjoyed it and she 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.189
 It has virtually no law to enter and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.330
 get off the bus a very important stop 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.890
 when you have a way that has a 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.960
 a larger zoom 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.630
 she has this uncle does not have to law 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.909
 also to change the aim and the comparison 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.259
 the site you see the defendant as 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.540
 occupy the screen seems to get into a 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.729
 car that looks whole and with 30 black 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.540
 inside is one of the most used game 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.030
 also 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.070
 she has optimum accuracy releases 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.439
 quickie anyone with 10 kills 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.939
 but this space that occupies the screen for 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.939
 Me is a big disadvantage. 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.710
 The new aim of the game now is to coyote km 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.910
 chinese rbs 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.160
 a lot of people are using it because 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.260
 has a very good space on the screen between 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.420
 get out of the mine quickly, you do not have to either. 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.780
 law and also has no law in the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.369
 drive is perhaps the top dog of the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.520
 battlefield I think the friend who 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.740
 everybody will want to use and and maybe 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.820
 take this place and the snake and the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.740
 site as the best aim of the game but this is 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.260
 totally a personal matter to a 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.510
 it was the first time 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.370
 I used to enjoy it too wore bf3 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.570
 because he found it easier to hit with 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.920
 this little circle 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.590
 but you have seen it as a space 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.470
 gigantic on the screen may be mine 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.200
 more disrupts the player's visualization 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.790
 some space it takes one 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.220
 little more focused than the red hot 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:40.340
 site and work, but it's not as 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.220
 delayed with a crosshair say it 8x to 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.290
 Chinese holography came astonishing 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.600
 much because it does not occupy a 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.540
 space so big on the screen against the russian 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.450
 and American and if you prefer in case the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.640
 circle and the ball to visualize 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.890
 better your target maybe this is the 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.010
 choose wiser now in lipstick o 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.480
 son of 41 and also has the aim that 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.190
 nobody uses face that is the miracle 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.230
 holographic and russia because it is ugly 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.090
 too much it takes the angle of view to 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.769
 leave the strange things 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.329
 it's all very circular where you are 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.910
 taking the right view of the enemy is 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.459
 rushing but in matters of law she 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.650
 It's also fast, do not delay to leave. 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.930
 also does not delay the movement but 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.660
 still in Karachi the worst option of the 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.260
 three holographic sights of the game and 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.320
 I would also like to emphasize that the 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.170
 choosing the scope is a personal choice you 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.209
 play the way you feel best 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.640
 You play with the friend you play. 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.250
 the better you are used to 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.000
 and this is just a matter of game I indicate 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.500
 everybody tests the media 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.300
 remembering that the sock that occupies a place 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.020
 the screen is not the best way to 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.580
 game that you will see over time but it is 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.160
 I like to play well 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.830
 wonderfully well destroys everyone with 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.960
 a look 20 xa cloud big guy who 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.340
 It's me to say the opposite and that's it. 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.470
 then thank the staff who attended 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.360
 the whole video does not forget that joinha 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.730
 who sign up for the Pope's 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.370
 child for further analysis aims to discuss 24 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.370
 This is it people said it
