00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.500
 I'm with a camera that I do not know if I'm going 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.050
 to be able to film in force that I am the 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.980

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.850
 campaign 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.690
 There you keep your legs stretched out. 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.660
 you give security 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.900
 try something so you can mount the 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.900
 proof 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.009

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.000

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:21.540
 It's very common for us to see the sun. 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.670

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.970
 more moral then after finishing 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.970
 proof 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.580
 until now we get adrenaline still 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.980
 did not pass 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.150
 but the minister believes that I am 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.800
 crazy but this adrenaline green go go 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.800

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.870
 seen it not for that goes around but 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.150
 Followed that I was with him. 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.750
 minutes ago I was in the car reading 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.750
 I believe it will speak with a button at 0 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.170
 so here is eating dust now gives a 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.800
 peek looking who's that avoids 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.780
 that the terror of the highway 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.520
 sad because you 're sad, you had a 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.830
 oil leak in my car was in the 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.930
 tires and went straight for 150 kilometers 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.540
 But I'm fine, thank God. 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.730
 I lived the whole life in an irreverent tone 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.280
 The shea zhu vector is that it is not so 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.520
 so tozzo expensive and tender with the 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.060
 scars of work as well as 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.130
 I right so I just went to this little walk has 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.220
 It made me want to continue 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.620
 you imagine that there is the guy steering wheel 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.230
 it's an emotion it's indescribable it does not have 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.200
 as we try to describe but it's good 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.560
 too much and go there and thrill to walk with me 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.730
 I do not know how to fly the mother knows how to fly easy 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.730
 - I want to see 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.430
 the first time the emotion quite knows 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.430
 but who expected there are creative ideas
