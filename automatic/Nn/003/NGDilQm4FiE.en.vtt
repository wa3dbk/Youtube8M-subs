00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 girls all huge hello i am very 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.850
 glad to see you on my channel today 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.710
 show you my favorite and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.630
 extremely simple hairstyle which 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.849
 done in exactly five minutes to 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.520
 I give a bit a relief 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.500
 Curled hair on boomerangs diameter from them 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.400
 by the way with 22 millimeter on also us 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.140
 you will need a gum stealth and studs 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.710
 separate the little order from the parting and 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.500
 we divide it into three parts and now we take that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.430
 strand that closer to the face and start it 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 spin 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.340
 towards the face and cross over 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.350
 hide and seek now the second pro it seemed 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.149
 close to the face and to not add part 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.370
 hair from the bulk and again 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.170
 we twist it towards the face and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.390
 again we cross again add 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.600
 part of facial hair 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.610
 we twist to the face and re-cross over 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.610
 actually that's all wise 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.610
 and 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.110
 also you can safely pull out a little 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.940
 strands of the oppressed harnesses thereby 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.940
 adding volume of weaving 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.170
 thus we twist the whole head harness 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.750
 he is gradually capturing small strands 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.000
 This hairstyle looks great with everyday 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.710
 weaving from ear to ear, that is, no 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.020
 then weave from parting 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.060
 looks especially cool on wavy 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.929
 hair grab the last part 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.509
 hair and dovelet our flagellum to the end well 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.390
 and that the beam was more voluminous 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.289
 be sure to remember to hide hide and seek 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.289
 and plexus 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.540
 but 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.609
 but it remains to form a bundle and 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.609
 secure it with studs and stealth 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.210
 add a few final touches 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.210
 and everything is ready 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.890
 try with you everything will work out 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.210

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.210
 video bye bye
