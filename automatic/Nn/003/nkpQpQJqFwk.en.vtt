he gone when not to say FX is not at the
end<00:00:55.879> of<00:00:56.059> its<00:00:56.270> life<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.199> pretty<00:00:57.440> much<00:00:57.500> there's

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
end of its life so pretty much there's

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.520 
end of its life so pretty much there's
the<00:00:58.460> confirmation<00:00:58.940> right<00:00:59.059> there<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.570> the<00:01:00.050> FX

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
the confirmation right there and the FX

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.310 
the confirmation right there and the FX
the<00:01:00.829> series<00:01:01.430> is<00:01:01.609> not<00:01:01.850> dead<00:01:02.149> it<00:01:02.449> will<00:01:02.809> continue

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
the series is not dead it will continue

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
releasing it CPUs adjust that they don't

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.800 
releasing it CPUs adjust that they don't
they<00:01:19.160> don't<00:01:19.190> see<00:01:19.789> the<00:01:19.970> need<00:01:20.090> of<00:01:20.149> a<00:01:20.330> refresh
