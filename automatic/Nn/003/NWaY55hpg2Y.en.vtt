00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
were able again to put the hybrid

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.040 
were able again to put the hybrid
packaging<00:00:37.829> into<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.309> very<00:00:38.610> efficiently<00:00:39.180> we

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
packaging into this very efficiently we

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.959 
packaging into this very efficiently we
put<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> electric<00:00:40.649> motor<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.160> between<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
put the electric motor in between the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.810 
put the electric motor in between the
lineartronic<00:00:42.660> CVT<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.010> boxer<00:00:44.340> engine<00:00:44.670> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
lineartronic CVT and the boxer engine so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.360 
lineartronic CVT and the boxer engine so
it's<00:00:44.940> sandwich<00:00:45.300> right<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.170> center

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
it's sandwich right there in the center

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.160 
it's sandwich right there in the center
it's<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.430> really<00:00:47.640> very<00:00:48.030> little<00:00:48.120> loss<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:49.020> any

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
it's a really very little loss of any

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930 
it's a really very little loss of any
cargo<00:00:49.469> area<00:00:49.980> which<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.399> sometimes<00:00:50.640> what

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
cargo area which is sometimes what

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.729 
cargo area which is sometimes what
happens<00:00:50.969> when<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.629> put<00:00:51.809> hybrid<00:00:52.260> packaging

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
happens when you put hybrid packaging

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.680 
happens when you put hybrid packaging
into<00:00:52.980> existing<00:00:53.460> vehicles<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.300> again<00:00:54.539> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
into existing vehicles so again it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.630 
into existing vehicles so again it
maintains<00:00:55.079> eight<00:00:55.559> point<00:00:55.860> seven<00:00:56.129> inches<00:00:56.489> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
maintains eight point seven inches of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.450 
maintains eight point seven inches of
ground<00:00:56.789> clearance<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:58.079> hybrid<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.039> still

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
ground clearance so a hybrid that still

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.310 
ground clearance so a hybrid that still
has<00:00:59.699> off-road<00:01:00.210> capability<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:00.989> take<00:01:01.140> you

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
has off-road capability and can take you

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.900 
has off-road capability and can take you
where<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.649> want<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> go<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.309> your<00:01:02.579> active
