00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.000
 several models or variants as 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.230
 you want to say anyway I 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.240

 I'll be leaving you in the information 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.770
 regarding the models that is compatible 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.270
 the rodeo also this works without 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.130
 import the android version that you have 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.289
 your naut 4 is to say it works so much in 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.180
 Android kitkat combining lollipop as 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.340
 you can see me in this case I'm going to 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.900
 do in android lollipop finally not 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.250
 I'm responsible for nothing since I 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.349
 I'm just showing you how to do it and it's 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.700
 your decision if you decide to do it not 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.700
 saying all that we started 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.060
 The first thing you will do is download the 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.170
 following files as always me here 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.730
 down in the video description 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.380
 I would be leaving the download link of 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.290
 the following that would come being 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.850
 first the audouin program 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.590
 followed by what the drivers are for 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.930
 your device if this you already had 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.580
 previously installed on your computer or 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.739
 you do not need that the 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.210
 download otherwise the downloads 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.120
 finally after downloading a file 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.370
 called cs autoroute this file is that 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.410
 we will use to surround our 94 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.510
 but you must download the one 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.759
 your variant corresponds specifically 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.290
 or that is to say your model in my case is the 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.030
 of 1910 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.920
 This file will be downloaded from the 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.180
 next page as always it fills the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.070
 description of the video together with the 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.590
 download links will be letting the 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.390
 url of this page that would autoroute 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.670
 points in fighter point 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.680
 once you are on this page you are going to 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.020
 move is the option where it says a 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.540
 log bootloader and once you're here 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.180
 you are going to locate the model or variant of 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.790
 you 94 in my case as you will remember you 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.550
 I said it 's enee 910 huh 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.350

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.490
 you locate your variant and good people 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.140
 that you have located 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.720
 you are going to click on the download option 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.520
 will open you to another page once 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.590
 we are here we move down 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.630
 and in the section where it says download 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.820
 let's click on the cf file 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.430
 autoroute that corresponds to your 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.229
 variant to your model of your 94 and a 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.540
 Once we click, the process will start 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.860
 of download in this case I already have it 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.320
 downloaded once you have 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.990
 downloaded you will move it to the desktop 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.700
 since we have these three files we're going 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.209
 to proceed to extract the content 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.760
 first of the file sf autoroute him 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.520
 we double click and we will extract only 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.410
 the file with md5 termination to 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.930
 desk for it we selected it and 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.440
 we release it to the desk as you can 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.510
 see here includes us previously in 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.900
 this folder what is audi but in this 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.500
 case version 3.0 7 and I'm leaving 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.300
 in the description of the video the version 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.830
 3.0 9 I recommend using this 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.100
 what we are going to do is the same 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.780
 let's double click on the folder 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.880
 and we are going to extract the two files that 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.250
 they are in the same way to the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.280
 desk selecting it and dropping 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.260
 the once we did this we're going to 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.000
 install the drivers for that we're going 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.130
 to select we are going to click 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.540

 asks for User Account Control to 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.050
 which will open the assistant 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.930
 installation we are going to click on 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.700
 next select this language and country 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.910
 or region in this case I leave them like this 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.460
 as they are in Spanish I give in next and 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.350
 in installing and will start the process of 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.040
 installation let's wait for them to finish 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.040
 to settle 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.170
 once they have been installed we give 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.300
 click on finalize now let's 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.860
 select the program now you 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.660
 we will give right click and equal 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.100
 run as administrator if you ask 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.760
 control of user accounts we give that 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.439
 yes 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.689
 once you open the program we are going to 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:38.060
 ensure that auto rebut and the option to 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:41.030
 efe rz are selected are 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.700
 palomeadas and here we saw that we click 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.400
 in the ape section and we proceed to 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.760
 locate the file with md5 termination 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.280
 that we extracted to the desktop 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.540
 selected we open and wait 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.489
 to check it once already 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.310
 finished checking it where it says ate 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.109
 On one side, the route of the 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.079
 location of the file and where it says 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.579
 binari size the size of the file a 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.060
 Once we did this, we're going to move on to 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.849
 device once here we're going to pay it 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.239
 to enter done done loading mode 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.239
 quickly turn it off 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.520
 once it's off you 're going to press 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.700
 the next combination of buttons 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.530
 volume down home and power features a 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.690
 keep pressed until a 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.240
 alert window once this one comes out 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.210
 window press volume up to 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.740
 enter what is download mode and how 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.170
 you can see you can not see my 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.810
 device has never been rooted in 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.600
 that has had root access there where it says 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.700
 knox guaranty is not enough to see comes 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.800
 at 0 has not yet been activated yet 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.050
 one appears so as I say 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.850
 this device has never had access 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.980
 root and we will do it for the first time 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.740
 well then once we are in this 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.840
 in this window on the device we're going 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.440
 to proceed to connect it to the PC with the 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.440
 USB Cable 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:06.869
 and once we connect it to the pc it 

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:08.969
 will begin to install drivers and there 

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:11.159
 it's like I was saying you are starting to 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:13.049
 install the drivers let's make sure 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.389
 that none of error if someone reaches you 

00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:18.539
 to give error I recommend you to try in 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.489
 another usb port or check the drivers or 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.079
 try on another computer since what 

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:23.669
 otherwise I do not recommend continuing 

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:25.829
 but hopefully not your case and good 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.959
 since we verify that the drivers 

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:30.059
 they were installed correctly we click 

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:32.729
 in closing let's make sure that in 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:35.519
 where it says com down this blue 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.439
 and we see a com with a number in 

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:39.869
 this case seems like 5 to you can you 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:42.449
 appear with 7 with 9 etc. it does not matter 

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:44.610
 here the important thing is that it appears 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.229
 blue color that says a com with a number 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.969
 well then since we saw this what 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.249
 we have to do is click on start and 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:52.139
 start the routing process once you 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:55.639
 finish the device restart only 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.639
 I'm going to click on this one 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.470
 as you can see there the device 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.150
 restart only you will not disconnect 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.580
 until the blue box where 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.580
 it says reset the color green and peace 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.680
 here the color box was already put 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.930
 Green already says peace as I told you 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.479
 we click on exit and now if we can 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.479
 disconnect the device from the pc 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.809
 well here on the device 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:35.599
 I proceed to unlock it and I will go to 

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:37.129
 what is the application drawer and here 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.620
 you can see that I already have the 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:41.419
 super zoom application I'm going to give you 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.860
 click on no thanks and good here already 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.620
 we have the application interface of 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.689
 super psu in this case with the design of 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.659
 material design I here I have the 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:53.240
 root explorer application I will give you 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:54.949
 click on mount rw to ask me 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.809
 permission and there you can see what message the 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:59.569
 message to allow permissions should 

00:06:56.809 --> 00:07:01.219
 allow and that would be all you can see 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.439
 as the rut is working without 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:06.289
 problem any quick I'm going to turn off the 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:07.999
 device to show you that the nox is 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.759
 has activated party pressed volume 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:13.339
 down home and power at the same time 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:16.069
 pressure in volume up and see if it 

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:19.069
 can see but where they say ox 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:21.100
 guaranty I already see a 1 instead of the 0 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:23.200
 wherefore this one 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.720
 this device has lost its warranty 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.250
 and well, in general, this would be all 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.170
 I hope you liked it and more that has 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.170
 worked and until next time
