00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
of walking on his feet he started

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.770 
of walking on his feet he started
walking<00:00:55.100> on<00:00:55.399> his<00:00:55.489> knees<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.149> because<00:00:56.510> of<00:00:56.660> that

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780

walking on his knees and because of that
his<00:00:57.079> tendons<00:00:57.530> actually<00:00:57.860> contracted<00:00:58.219> which<00:00:58.610> is

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
his tendons actually contracted which is

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.910 
his tendons actually contracted which is
why<00:00:58.910> once<00:00:59.360> he<00:00:59.570> was<00:00:59.750> you<00:01:00.170> know<00:01:00.289> getting<00:01:00.410> older

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
why once he was you know getting older

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.590 
why once he was you know getting older
his<00:01:01.340> legs<00:01:01.610> just<00:01:01.730> wouldn't<00:01:02.210> straighten<00:01:02.510> up

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
his legs just wouldn't straighten up

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.559 
his legs just wouldn't straighten up
anymore<00:01:03.009> so<00:01:04.009> we<00:01:04.609> went<00:01:04.999> through<00:01:05.059> a<00:01:05.209> lot<00:01:05.539> of

00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:05.569 
anymore so we went through a lot of

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:07.870 
anymore so we went through a lot of
different<00:01:06.079> options<00:01:06.950> we<00:01:07.100> made<00:01:07.340> lots<00:01:07.549> of<00:01:07.670> phone

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
different options we made lots of phone

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.849 
different options we made lots of phone
calls<00:01:08.149> and<00:01:08.479> talk<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.959> orthopedic<00:01:09.469> surgeons

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
calls and talk to orthopedic surgeons

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:13.389 
calls and talk to orthopedic surgeons
and<00:01:10.100> they<00:01:11.090> wanted<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.600> try<00:01:11.869> just<00:01:12.799> cutting<00:01:13.189> two

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
and they wanted to try just cutting two

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.889 
and they wanted to try just cutting two
of<00:01:13.549> the<00:01:13.670> tendons<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.270> see<00:01:14.420> if<00:01:14.659> we<00:01:14.779> could

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
of the tendons and see if we could

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:16.269 
of the tendons and see if we could
straighten<00:01:15.109> out<00:01:15.289> the<00:01:15.409> legs<00:01:15.590> that<00:01:15.799> way<00:01:16.009> and

00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:16.279 
straighten out the legs that way and

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:18.669 
straighten out the legs that way and
then<00:01:16.819> put<00:01:16.999> braces<00:01:17.209> on<00:01:17.450> Patrick's<00:01:17.840> legs<00:01:18.079> do<00:01:18.649> a

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
then put braces on Patrick's legs do a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.589 
then put braces on Patrick's legs do a
lot<00:01:18.829> of<00:01:18.859> physical<00:01:19.249> therapy<00:01:19.420> put<00:01:20.420> him<00:01:20.509> on

00:01:20.589 --> 00:01:20.599 
lot of physical therapy put him on

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.899 
lot of physical therapy put him on
antibiotics<00:01:20.829> get<00:01:21.829> him<00:01:21.950> on<00:01:22.069> pain<00:01:22.340> medications

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
antibiotics get him on pain medications

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.730 
antibiotics get him on pain medications
and<00:01:23.090> really<00:01:23.479> see<00:01:23.689> if<00:01:23.929> that<00:01:24.229> would<00:01:24.349> be<00:01:24.469> enough

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
and really see if that would be enough

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.780 
and really see if that would be enough
to<00:01:25.009> allow<00:01:25.520> Patrick<00:01:25.909> to<00:01:26.029> walk<00:01:26.179> comfortably

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790
