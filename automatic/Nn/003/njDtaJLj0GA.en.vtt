hmm well when we set out to design the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.019 
hmm well when we set out to design the

passport we wanted to create something

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.600

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
icon for blackberry and our insights

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.420 
icon for blackberry and our insights
told<00:00:35.640> us<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.450> users<00:00:37.200> wanted<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.100> large

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
told us that that users wanted a large

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.420 
told us that that users wanted a large
display<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:40.050> they<00:00:40.200> could<00:00:40.500> optimize<00:00:40.890> viewing

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
display that they could optimize viewing

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.280 
display that they could optimize viewing
and<00:00:41.610> editing<00:00:41.670> content<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.420> they<00:00:42.750> also<00:00:42.899> want<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and editing content and they also want a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.850 
and editing content and they also want a
capable<00:00:43.649> input<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.489> we<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.660> looked<00:00:45.930> at<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
capable input so we we looked at a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.549 
capable input so we we looked at a
variety<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.789> different<00:00:48.030> display<00:00:48.870> sizes<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
variety of different display sizes and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.670 
variety of different display sizes and
we<00:00:50.370> were<00:00:51.149> known<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.690> our<00:00:51.780> one-to-one<00:00:52.140> aspect

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
we were known for our one-to-one aspect

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.000 
we were known for our one-to-one aspect
ratios<00:00:53.010> r-squared<00:00:53.879> ratios<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.590> really

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
ratios r-squared ratios and we we really

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.090 
ratios r-squared ratios and we we really
looked<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.520> familiar<00:00:57.149> symbol<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:58.100> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
looked at a familiar symbol of the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.799 
looked at a familiar symbol of the
passport<00:00:59.340> the<00:01:00.000> universal<00:01:00.510> symbol<00:01:00.780> of

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
passport the universal symbol of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.560

mobility<00:01:01.370> one<00:01:02.370> that's<00:01:02.579> pocketable<00:01:03.000> that's

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
mobility one that's pocketable that's

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.030 
mobility one that's pocketable that's
easy<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.930> travel<00:01:04.170> light<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.710> everyone

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
easy to travel light that everyone

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.950 
easy to travel light that everyone
around<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.369> world<00:01:05.400> recognizes<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.750> use

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
around the world recognizes and we use

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.929 
around the world recognizes and we use
that<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> form<00:01:07.770> factor<00:01:07.920> inspiration<00:01:08.760> so

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that as the form factor inspiration so

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.640 
that as the form factor inspiration so
we<00:01:09.030> took<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> two<00:01:09.510> elements<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
we took the two elements the the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.350 
we took the two elements the the
keyboard<00:01:11.130> which<00:01:11.490> has<00:01:11.670> some<00:01:11.820> new<00:01:11.909> innovation

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
keyboard which has some new innovation

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.469 
keyboard which has some new innovation
around<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.400> large<00:01:14.670> square<00:01:15.030> display

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
around it and the large square display

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.109 
around it and the large square display
and<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.259> used<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.740> form<00:01:17.130> factor<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and we used that form factor as the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.170 
and we used that form factor as the
inspiration<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.490> had<00:01:20.939> another

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
inspiration and then we had another

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.399 
inspiration and then we had another
inspiration<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> came<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
inspiration when it came to the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.170 
inspiration when it came to the
construction<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> product<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:23.939> looked

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
construction of the product so we looked

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.109 
construction of the product so we looked
at<00:01:24.450> modernist<00:01:25.439> architecture<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.820> beams

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
at modernist architecture and I beams

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.580 
at modernist architecture and I beams
that<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.570> used<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> construction

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that are used in the construction

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.880 
that are used in the construction
methods<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.130> are<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.759> used<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.890> structure

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
methods that are are used for structure

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.240 
methods that are are used for structure
and<00:01:32.610> also<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.509> visual<00:01:34.079> lightness<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.130> we

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
and also for visual lightness and so we

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.850 
and also for visual lightness and so we
literally<00:01:35.689> were<00:01:36.689> inspired<00:01:37.140> by<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> ibrehem

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
literally were inspired by the ibrehem

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.920 
literally were inspired by the ibrehem
and<00:01:38.040> created<00:01:38.640> took<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> inner<00:01:39.240> structure<00:01:39.659> of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
and created took the inner structure of

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.719 
and created took the inner structure of
the<00:01:40.049> device<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:40.979> pulled<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> eggs

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the device and we pulled it to the eggs

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.789 
the device and we pulled it to the eggs
outside<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> device<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.960> exposed<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
outside of the device and exposed it and

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.700 
outside of the device and exposed it and
this<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.659> main<00:01:45.869> structural

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
this is the the main structural

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.170 
this is the the main structural
component<00:01:47.220> which<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.579> made<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.970> stainless

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
component which is made of stainless

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.569 
component which is made of stainless
steel<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:49.049> picked<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.710> its<00:01:50.070> strength<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
steel we picked it for its strength and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.700 
steel we picked it for its strength and
beauty<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:51.540> further<00:01:52.020> strengthened<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
beauty we further strengthened the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.620 
beauty we further strengthened the
material<00:01:53.220> through<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.549> forging<00:01:53.939> process<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
material through a forging process and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.010 
material through a forging process and
we<00:01:55.140> actually<00:01:55.350> created<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:56.070> full<00:01:56.340> metal

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
we actually created a full metal

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.569 
we actually created a full metal
stainless<00:01:58.020> steel<00:01:58.290> frame<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.829> acts<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.280> part

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
stainless steel frame that acts as part

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.469 
stainless steel frame that acts as part
of<00:01:59.700> our<00:01:59.820> antenna<00:02:00.409> design

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
of our antenna design

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.060 
of our antenna design
the<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.990> keyboard<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.409> very<00:02:03.439> interesting<00:02:03.979> I

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
the the keyboard is very interesting I

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.200 
the the keyboard is very interesting I
think<00:02:04.250> it'll<00:02:04.580> take<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.759> little<00:02:04.820> bit<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.090> getting

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
think it'll take a little bit of getting

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.580 
think it'll take a little bit of getting
used<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.479> for<00:02:05.659> folks<00:02:05.869> used<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.170> kind<00:02:06.560> of

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
used to for folks used to kind of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.919 
used to for folks used to kind of
standard<00:02:07.040> four<00:02:07.340> row<00:02:07.610> keyboards<00:02:08.149> what<00:02:08.780> can<00:02:08.869> you

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
standard four row keyboards what can you

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.389 
standard four row keyboards what can you
tell<00:02:09.020> us<00:02:09.080> about<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.709> decision<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.099> go<00:02:10.220> that

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
tell us about the decision to go that

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.500 
tell us about the decision to go that
route<00:02:10.550> well<00:02:11.360> we<00:02:11.660> we<00:02:12.380> believe<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:13.209> it's<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.390> new

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
route well we we believe it's it's a new

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.540 
route well we we believe it's it's a new
it's<00:02:14.810> obviously<00:02:15.319> new<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.680> innovative<00:02:15.830> we

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
it's obviously new and innovative we

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.100 
it's obviously new and innovative we
look<00:02:16.790> at<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:16.970> as<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.120> four<00:02:17.360> row<00:02:17.510> keyboard<00:02:17.959> just

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
look at it as a four row keyboard just

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.920 
look at it as a four row keyboard just
one<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.560> keys<00:02:18.770> are<00:02:18.800> virtual<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.090> we<00:02:20.720> did

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
one of the keys are virtual and we did

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.840 
one of the keys are virtual and we did
that<00:02:21.080> because<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:21.410> wanted<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:22.190> ensure<00:02:22.819> that

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
that because we wanted to ensure that

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.410 
that because we wanted to ensure that
we're<00:02:23.150> maximizing<00:02:23.630> our<00:02:24.230> screen<00:02:24.950> space<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.489> we

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
we're maximizing our screen space and we

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.050 
we're maximizing our screen space and we
we<00:02:26.780> created<00:02:26.989> this<00:02:27.350> very<00:02:27.890> cool<00:02:28.250> touch<00:02:28.819> enabled

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
we created this very cool touch enabled

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.790 
we created this very cool touch enabled
keyboard<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:29.810> there's<00:02:29.959> a<00:02:30.019> capacitive<00:02:30.620> layer

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
keyboard so there's a capacitive layer

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.100 
keyboard so there's a capacitive layer
underneath<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.880> physical<00:02:32.300> keyboard<00:02:32.480> that

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
underneath the physical keyboard that

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.860 
underneath the physical keyboard that
enables<00:02:33.650> swiping<00:02:34.640> gestures<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.330> like<00:02:35.840> a

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
enables swiping gestures and like a

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.170 
enables swiping gestures and like a
reinventing<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.739> trackpad<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.760> can<00:02:38.000> have

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
reinventing the trackpad so you can have

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.509 
reinventing the trackpad so you can have
physical<00:02:38.769> capable<00:02:39.769> input<00:02:40.069> but<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.280> can<00:02:40.400> also

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
physical capable input but you can also

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.949 
physical capable input but you can also
do<00:02:40.700> all<00:02:40.819> these<00:02:40.940> really<00:02:41.120> these<00:02:41.480> other<00:02:41.690> cool

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
do all these really these other cool

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.050 
do all these really these other cool
things<00:02:42.200> with<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.650> with<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.640> touch<00:02:43.819> enabled

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
things with the with the touch enabled

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.140 
things with the with the touch enabled
features<00:02:45.019> that<00:02:45.560> come<00:02:45.739> with<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.150> keyboard
