00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.860
 hello and welcome my name 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.080
 is hectic today I show you as you 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.180
 on the new web origins the fire city 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.189
 builds and yes you need it first 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.960
 the record could be here so it 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.970
 There are four spots the first spot here 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.619
 She could be lying next to the tank 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.630
 yes the parts are marked orange 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.960
 some say well I just say orange 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.600
 the second spot is generator 6 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.790
 on this box is the third spot 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.820
 down in the ice behind the church 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.860
 at generator 6 and the fourth and 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.500
 last spot is up in the church 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.989
 the benches and there she is now 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.519
 that's the orange record the more 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.290
 looks red but sees the parts 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.750
 orange off in any case yes the first 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.100
 you get part by your generator 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.540
 I fill up six but I think you have to 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.530
 the other generators in front of it too 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.890
 I have not filled up 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.839
 for sure 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.070
 try it simply but you do so 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.530
 eh all I guess 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.780
 yes, here is the first part for the fire 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.090
 died the second part you get if 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.970
 her plane marked orange 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.340
 from ballert then the part falls down 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.869
 and you can collect it it is 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.490
 only one plane that you can easily 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.539
 recognize 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.420
 I do not think that's her 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.829
 could overlook and the last part for 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.750
 The celebration you get by her 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.759
 the first split little robot 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.929
 Kill that leaves it dry here 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.840
 you can not see that is out of now 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.729
 cinema mode because my colleague dennis that 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.710
 simply collected too fast yes 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.619
 then you have the celebration at the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.450
 mine the fire department down here is the 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.539
 next to the first room you have to do yours 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.280
 put down a gramophone and a portal in 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.770
 to open the crazy place 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.659
 and yes I just always find it 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.939
 always cool to see that again 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.689
 's really a really cool idea that 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.219
 drake or has come up with 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.530
 purely in the crazy place in her port 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.869
 and then to the runen or 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.990
 or orange pillar go and 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.789
 get the part that the stone of the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.740
 Stacking names is family 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.770
 finished now has the portal back 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.330
 open and now you can die yours 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.730
 down in this secret templar room 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.140
 Of course , you have to build it for that 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.540
 on 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.490
 go your color and just build it that way 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.870
 as you do with every component and 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.680
 the bar is ready, I hope so 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.520
 could help you 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.050
