situation though all they have to do is

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.950 
situation though all they have to do is
just<00:04:26.110> sit<00:04:26.380> here<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.800> wait<00:04:27.010> for<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.600> BP<00:04:28.600> super

minutes<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.380> walk<00:04:29.560> into<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.890> base<00:04:30.630> there's<00:04:31.630> an

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
minutes to walk into the base there's an

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.380 
minutes to walk into the base there's an
ulti<00:04:32.080> on<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.250> hunt<00:04:33.490> as<00:04:33.700> they

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
ulti on the hunt as they

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.120 
ulti on the hunt as they
the<00:04:34.510> team<00:04:34.750> liquid<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.260> going<00:04:35.500> to<00:04:35.590> engage<00:04:35.740> on

the<00:04:36.190> fight<00:04:36.400> they<00:04:36.610> saw<00:04:36.880> that<00:04:37.290> cos<00:04:38.290> was<00:04:38.560> coming

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
the fight they saw that cos was coming

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.080 
the fight they saw that cos was coming
in<00:04:38.980> and<00:04:39.010> figured<00:04:39.400> something<00:04:39.610> might<00:04:39.880> happen

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
in and figured something might happen

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.390 
in and figured something might happen
and<00:04:40.810> now<00:04:41.260> gravity<00:04:41.740> is<00:04:41.800> actually<00:04:41.920> gonna<00:04:42.130> go<00:04:42.280> in

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
and now gravity is actually gonna go in

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.680 
and now gravity is actually gonna go in
without<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.640> ultimate<00:04:43.030> on<00:04:43.120> their<00:04:43.270> side<00:04:43.540> the

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
without the ultimate on their side the

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.480 
without the ultimate on their side the
inhibitor<00:04:44.080> turret<00:04:44.230> actually<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:44.830> does<00:04:45.130> just

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
inhibitor turret actually it does just

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.400 
inhibitor turret actually it does just
go<00:04:45.670> down<00:04:45.940> there<00:04:46.420> able<00:04:46.600> to<00:04:46.690> fight<00:04:46.930> under<00:04:47.170> it<00:04:47.290> now

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
go down there able to fight under it now

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.230 
go down there able to fight under it now
and<00:04:47.680> that's<00:04:47.980> going<00:04:48.130> to<00:04:48.190> be<00:04:48.280> dominate<00:04:48.760> falling

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
and that's going to be dominate falling

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.300 
and that's going to be dominate falling
