FC to see what the quadcopter will do
with<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.520> I<00:00:14.790> got<00:00:15.510> some<00:00:15.780> interesting<00:00:16.490> points<00:00:17.490> I

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
found you got LDC warning at 15 minute

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.749 
found you got LDC warning at 15 minute
40<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:24.810> quadcopter<00:00:25.410> will<00:00:25.560> drop<00:00:25.829> at<00:00:26.099> 16

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
40 and the quadcopter will drop at 16

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.989 
40 and the quadcopter will drop at 16
minutes<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.509> you<00:00:27.570> got<00:00:27.919> 20<00:00:28.919> seconds<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.699> spare

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:29.999 
minutes so you got 20 seconds to spare

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.960 
minutes so you got 20 seconds to spare
time<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.509> get<00:00:30.689> quadcopter<00:00:31.439> back<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.310> you<00:00:32.730> can

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
time to get quadcopter back and you can

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.830 
time to get quadcopter back and you can
turn<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.080> LEDs<00:00:34.530> off<00:00:34.830> which<00:00:35.760> means<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.630> get

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
turn on the LEDs off which means you get

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.340 
turn on the LEDs off which means you get
around<00:00:37.650> 20<00:00:38.580> seconds<00:00:39.060> extra<00:00:39.630> fighter<00:00:39.990> flight

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
a great point quite quadcopter now I

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.840 
a great point quite quadcopter now I
really<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.140> go<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> see<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:05.429> I'm<00:01:05.579> using

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850

really like to go I see that I'm using
that<00:01:06.359> same<00:01:06.929> controller<00:01:10.520> first<00:01:11.520> I'm<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:11.850> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
that same controller first I'm going to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:24.169 
that same controller first I'm going to
bind<00:01:12.179> it<00:01:20.719> quadcopter<00:01:21.719> is<00:01:21.810> bound<00:01:22.109> now<00:01:22.759> first<00:01:23.759> I

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
bind it quadcopter is bound now first I

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:31.020 
bind it quadcopter is bound now first I
will<00:01:24.600> start<00:01:24.899> in<00:01:25.140> low<00:01:25.770> weights

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.160 

I<00:01:31.060> can<00:01:31.840> see<00:01:32.110> I'm<00:01:32.710> flying<00:01:33.370> with<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:34.690> Epson

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
I can see I'm flying with the Epson

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.570 
I can see I'm flying with the Epson
controller<00:01:37.830> and<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.960> is<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.920> all<00:01:42.070> right<00:01:42.370> now

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
controller and this is the all right now

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.100 
controller and this is the all right now
of<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.090> quadcopter<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.930> lot<00:01:44.170> better<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.750> it's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
of the quadcopter a lot better and it's

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.940 
of the quadcopter a lot better and it's
in<00:01:47.290> low<00:01:47.470> rates<00:01:47.800> so<00:01:48.460> in<00:01:48.880> irate<00:01:49.300> sets<00:01:49.630> even

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
in low rates so in irate sets even

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:59.690 
in low rates so in irate sets even
faster<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:54.360> will<00:01:55.360> show<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:55.630> in<00:01:55.900> high<00:01:56.050> rates

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.910 

pretty<00:02:00.700> sick<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:05.290> it's<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:05.590> lot<00:02:05.770> better

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
pretty sick I think it's a lot better

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.139 
pretty sick I think it's a lot better
now<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.550> of<00:02:07.510> course<00:02:07.540> you<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:09.280> turn<00:02:09.880> their

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
now and of course you can turn their

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.920 
now and of course you can turn their
degrees<00:02:10.540> off

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.990 

let's<00:02:13.930> forget<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.680> some<00:02:14.980> extra<00:02:15.310> seconds<00:02:15.880> of

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
let's forget you some extra seconds of

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.780 
let's forget you some extra seconds of
flight<00:02:16.150> time<00:02:16.950> nothing<00:02:17.950> special<00:02:18.870> but<00:02:19.870> I

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.160 
flight time nothing special but I
thanked<00:02:21.790> us<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:23.190> controller<00:02:24.190> will<00:02:24.550> also<00:02:24.940> give

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
thanked us and controller will also give

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.440 
thanked us and controller will also give
better<00:02:26.170> range
