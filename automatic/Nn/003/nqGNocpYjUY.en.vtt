going for the landing on this fence
there's<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.140> few<00:01:11.440> faults<00:01:11.710> on<00:01:12.009> my<00:01:12.250> part<00:01:12.580> for<00:01:12.820> the

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
first one my back does round so I could

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.840 
first one my back does round so I could
work<00:01:18.310> on<00:01:18.580> that<00:01:19.320> also<00:01:20.320> my<00:01:20.800> legs<00:01:21.070> do<00:01:21.399> slip<00:01:21.640> in

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
work on that also my legs do slip in

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.180 
work on that also my legs do slip in
front<00:01:22.360> of<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.899> girth<00:01:23.110> causing<00:01:23.770> my<00:01:23.890> seat<00:01:24.159> to

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
fall back into the saddle meaning that i

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.740 
fall back into the saddle meaning that i
should<00:01:27.130> stay<00:01:27.460> in<00:01:27.580> my<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.729> point<00:01:28.179> a<00:01:28.360> bit<00:01:28.509> longer

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
should stay in my to point a bit longer

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.589 
should stay in my to point a bit longer
than<00:01:28.989> i<00:01:29.080> did<00:01:29.140> in<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:30.610> phones<00:01:30.910> while<00:01:31.209> anna<00:01:31.390> was

and resulted in me catching her in the
mouth<00:01:37.569> lately<00:01:37.899> i<00:01:38.170> could<00:01:38.739> fix<00:01:38.890> this<00:01:39.069> by<00:01:39.280> holding

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
mouth lately i could fix this by holding

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.729 
mouth lately i could fix this by holding
my<00:01:39.910> release<00:01:40.479> and<00:01:40.750> staying<00:01:41.080> in<00:01:41.229> two<00:01:41.410> points

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:41.739 
my release and staying in two points

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:43.859 
my release and staying in two points
slightly<00:01:41.800> longer<00:01:42.509> another<00:01:43.509> way<00:01:43.660> i<00:01:43.690> could

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
slightly longer another way i could

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.249 
slightly longer another way i could
improve<00:01:44.110> on<00:01:44.319> this<00:01:44.500> fence<00:01:44.739> is<00:01:45.330> not<00:01:46.330> to<00:01:46.599> hunch<00:01:46.840> my

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
improve on this fence is not to hunch my

improve on this fence is not to hunch my
shoulders<00:01:47.709> in<00:01:48.099> this<00:01:48.940> clip<00:01:49.209> my<00:01:49.509> eyes<00:01:49.660> are<00:01:49.869> up

shoulders in this clip my eyes are up
and<00:01:50.140> looking<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.590> direction<00:01:51.009> we<00:01:51.310> are<00:01:51.340> going

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
and looking the direction we are going

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.570 
and looking the direction we are going
at<00:01:51.789> all<00:01:51.940> times<00:01:52.239> as<00:01:52.630> well<00:01:53.379> I<00:01:53.649> found<00:01:54.039> I<00:01:54.220> jumped

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
at all times as well I found I jumped

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.969 
at all times as well I found I jumped
with<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:55.000> motion<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.569> also<00:01:56.200> love<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:56.890> a

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
with the motion I also love and a

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.369 
with the motion I also love and a
suspension<00:01:57.550> towards<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.509> jump<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:58.989> her

00:01:59.369 --> 00:01:59.379 
suspension towards the jump and her

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.400 
suspension towards the jump and her
knees<00:01:59.590> over<00:02:00.069> the<00:02:00.190> fence<00:02:00.399> in<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.810> first<00:02:02.110> flat

knees over the fence in this first flat
clip<00:02:02.679> of<00:02:02.860> me<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.190> Tamara<00:02:03.489> I<00:02:03.759> really<00:02:04.209> like<00:02:04.500> how

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
clip of me and Tamara I really like how

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.630 
clip of me and Tamara I really like how
she<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:06.879> tracking<00:02:07.509> up<00:02:07.690> she<00:02:08.289> is<00:02:08.590> at<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:08.890> fairly

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
she is tracking up she is at a fairly

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.630 
she is tracking up she is at a fairly
good<00:02:10.090> pace<00:02:10.450> but<00:02:10.989> we<00:02:11.590> could<00:02:11.920> improve<00:02:12.280> on

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
good pace but we could improve on

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.490 
good pace but we could improve on
slowing<00:02:13.360> down<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:15.090> addition<00:02:16.090> in<00:02:16.660> some<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.349> the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
slowing down in addition in some of the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.580 
slowing down in addition in some of the
corners<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.250> circles<00:02:18.790> she<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.629> over<00:02:20.140> bend<00:02:20.349> in

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
corners and circles she is over bend in

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.009 
corners and circles she is over bend in
her<00:02:20.830> neck<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.310> therefore<00:02:21.940> loses<00:02:22.330> her<00:02:22.510> frame

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
her neck and therefore loses her frame

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.059 
her neck and therefore loses her frame
and<00:02:23.230> loses<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.830> fluidity<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.510> pace<00:02:26.069> but

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
and loses the fluidity of the pace but

following the motion coming towards the

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.009 
following the motion coming towards the
fence<00:03:05.620> now<00:03:06.069> for<00:03:06.519> three<00:03:07.000> things<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.750> did<00:03:07.989> wrong

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
fence now for three things I did wrong

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.589 
fence now for three things I did wrong
for<00:03:08.799> one<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.220> just<00:03:09.250> let<00:03:09.670> her<00:03:09.849> go<00:03:09.879> and<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.299> didn't

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
for one I just let her go and I didn't

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.410 
for one I just let her go and I didn't
find<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:11.109> distance<00:03:11.859> I<00:03:12.190> left<00:03:12.609> her<00:03:12.849> alone<00:03:13.090> and

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
find a distance I left her alone and

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.979 
find a distance I left her alone and
obviously<00:03:14.349> that<00:03:14.409> turned<00:03:14.799> out<00:03:15.040> bad<00:03:15.909> I<00:03:16.239> didn't

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
obviously that turned out bad I didn't

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.710 
obviously that turned out bad I didn't
set<00:03:17.560> her<00:03:17.829> up<00:03:18.040> right<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:18.790> let<00:03:18.970> her<00:03:19.150> lengthen

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
set her up right and I let her lengthen

set her up right and I let her lengthen
her<00:03:19.870> stride<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.470> didn't<00:03:20.769> collect<00:03:21.069> her<00:03:21.489> before

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
her stride and didn't collect her before

the<00:03:22.120> John<00:03:22.359> so<00:03:23.319> she<00:03:23.379> just<00:03:23.709> kind<00:03:24.069> of<00:03:24.159> went<00:03:24.340> on

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
the John so she just kind of went on

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.940 
the John so she just kind of went on
realized<00:03:25.599> she<00:03:26.019> had<00:03:26.109> run<00:03:26.230> in<00:03:26.409> a<00:03:26.500> room<00:03:26.709> and

realized she had run in a room and

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.660 
realized she had run in a room and
stepped<00:03:27.579> over<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:28.060> in<00:03:28.659> addition<00:03:29.019> I<00:03:29.590> tipped<00:03:30.459> my

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
stepped over it in addition I tipped my

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.420 
stepped over it in addition I tipped my
shoulders<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.150> dropped<00:03:32.079> my<00:03:32.560> hands<00:03:33.069> which

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430
