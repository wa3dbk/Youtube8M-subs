actually I think a couple days ago or
yesterday<00:01:52.880> they<00:01:53.880> came<00:01:54.540> out<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.990> said<00:01:55.140> an

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
worried about how their sales we're

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.410 
worried about how their sales we're
going<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> do<00:01:58.680> against<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> ps4<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
xbox 720 and it would really make sense

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.370 
xbox 720 and it would really make sense

see it some people are like well hell
yeah<00:02:19.459> I<00:02:19.489> don't<00:02:19.939> know<00:02:20.090> why<00:02:20.180> people<00:02:20.209> say<00:02:20.599> they

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
yeah I don't know why people say they

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.500 
yeah I don't know why people say they
hate<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.230> because<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.980> love<00:02:22.220> them<00:02:22.370> w<00:02:22.700> series<00:02:22.909> so

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
hate it because I love them w series so

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.270 
hate it because I love them w series so
it's<00:02:23.689> kind<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.900> like<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.079> mixed<00:02:24.439> reaction<00:02:24.560> but

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
it's kind of like a mixed reaction but

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.179 
it's kind of like a mixed reaction but
it<00:02:25.370> would<00:02:25.579> make<00:02:25.760> sense<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:26.180> Activision<00:02:26.810> and

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
it would make sense of Activision and

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.500 
it would make sense of Activision and
infinity<00:02:28.189> ward<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.790> whoever<00:02:29.180> is<00:02:29.209> going<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.420> be

infinity ward and whoever is going to be
working<00:02:29.629> on<00:02:29.870> him<00:02:29.989> do<00:02:30.079> before<00:02:30.200> would<00:02:30.860> be

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
working on him do before would be

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.470 
working on him do before would be
continuing<00:02:31.519> on<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.730> but<00:02:31.879> one<00:02:32.030> thing<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.299> note

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
continuing on it but one thing to note

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.479 
continuing on it but one thing to note
is<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.659> neversoft<00:02:33.409> is<00:02:33.590> working<00:02:34.099> on<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.340> next

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
is that neversoft is working on the next

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.280 
is that neversoft is working on the next
con<00:02:34.760> title<00:02:35.090> will<00:02:35.180> not<00:02:35.209> next<00:02:35.599> cut<00:02:35.780> out<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:36.049> it<00:02:36.170> is

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
looking like neversoft may have a part

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.470 
looking like neversoft may have a part
in<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.989> for<00:02:39.890> battlefield<00:02:40.280> 4<00:02:40.549> there's<00:02:41.030> nothing

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
in I for battlefield 4 there's nothing

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.179 
in I for battlefield 4 there's nothing
really<00:02:41.629> saying<00:02:42.019> anything<00:02:42.140> yet<00:02:42.650> for<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:43.010> but

really saying anything yet for it but

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.740 
really saying anything yet for it but
all<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.340> know<00:02:43.489> is<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:44.030> actually<00:02:44.239> did<00:02:44.599> make

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
all I know is that it actually did make

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.569 
all I know is that it actually did make
a<00:02:44.810> there's<00:02:45.530> been<00:02:45.709> quite<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.010> few<00:02:46.099> reports

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
a there's been quite a few reports

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.099 
a there's been quite a few reports
saying<00:02:46.730> battlefield<00:02:47.209> 4<00:02:47.450> will<00:02:47.629> be<00:02:47.750> coming<00:02:47.930> out

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
saying battlefield 4 will be coming out

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.920 
saying battlefield 4 will be coming out
in<00:02:48.140> 2013<00:02:49.239> obviously<00:02:50.239> I<00:02:50.269> would<00:02:50.659> think<00:02:50.810> that

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
in 2013 obviously I would think that

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.080 
in 2013 obviously I would think that
battlefield<00:02:51.349> 3<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:51.739> kind<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.129> over<00:02:52.519> you<00:02:53.000> know

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
battlefield 3 is kind of over you know

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.059 
battlefield 3 is kind of over you know
they've<00:02:53.359> released<00:02:53.599> all<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:53.989> DLCs<00:02:54.560> they<00:02:54.769> can

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
they've released all the DLCs they can

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.740 
they've released all the DLCs they can
and<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.849> think<00:02:56.060> they're<00:02:56.180> getting<00:02:56.389> ready<00:02:56.540> for

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
and I think they're getting ready for

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.569 
and I think they're getting ready for
their<00:02:56.840> next<00:02:57.019> big<00:02:57.319> release<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.950> obviously

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
their next big release and obviously

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.210 
their next big release and obviously
motto<00:02:58.849> if<00:02:59.150> you'd<00:02:59.299> always<00:02:59.450> don't<00:02:59.750> know<00:02:59.930> their

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
motto if you'd always don't know their

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.800 
motto if you'd always don't know their
medal<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.250> honor<00:03:01.519> warfighter<00:03:01.639> was<00:03:02.389> really

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
medal of honor warfighter was really

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.930 
medal of honor warfighter was really
just<00:03:02.959> off<00:03:03.109> they<00:03:03.590> didn't<00:03:03.829> get<00:03:04.010> as<00:03:04.220> good<00:03:04.549> as<00:03:04.790> what

they<00:03:05.060> expected<00:03:05.599> and<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:07.310> would<00:03:07.639> make<00:03:07.790> sense<00:03:07.819> a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
they expected and it would make sense a

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.490 
they expected and it would make sense a
