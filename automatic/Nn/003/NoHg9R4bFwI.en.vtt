00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
that so I'm just using a taraskin paper

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.220 
that so I'm just using a taraskin paper
right<00:00:44.370> now<00:00:44.400> because<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.300> didn't<00:00:46.019> have<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
right now because I didn't have to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.640 
right now because I didn't have to
prepare<00:00:46.589> it<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:46.949> it's<00:00:47.519> a<00:00:47.699> plastic<00:00:47.970> paper

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
prepare it at all it's a plastic paper

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.200 
prepare it at all it's a plastic paper
with<00:00:50.180> limestone<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.629> top<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.610> accepts<00:00:53.940> all

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
with limestone on top and it accepts all

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.570 
with limestone on top and it accepts all
the<00:00:54.479> media<00:00:57.320> without<00:00:58.320> warping<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.460> also

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
the media without warping you can also

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.410 
the media without warping you can also
roll<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.540> it<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:01.699> flatten<00:01:02.699> back<00:01:02.879> again<00:01:03.239> so

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
roll it and it all flatten back again so

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.539 
roll it and it all flatten back again so
it's<00:01:03.540> pretty<00:01:03.659> awesome<00:01:03.949> I'm<00:01:04.949> using<00:01:05.190> fluid

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
it's pretty awesome I'm using fluid

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.180 
it's pretty awesome I'm using fluid
acrylics<00:01:07.460> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.580> use<00:01:08.729> watercolor<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.510> well

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.410 

because<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.370> tools<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.330> oiler<00:01:15.659> boiler<00:01:16.079> and

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
because the tools the oiler boiler and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.029 
because the tools the oiler boiler and
in<00:01:18.420> spray<00:01:18.719> bottles<00:01:19.049> obviously<00:01:19.500> will<00:01:19.619> work<00:01:19.799> for

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
in spray bottles obviously will work for

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:27.819 
in spray bottles obviously will work for
both<00:01:23.450> okay<00:01:24.530> now<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.710> love<00:01:25.979> about<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.549> is

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
both okay now what I love about this is

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.990 
both okay now what I love about this is
you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:28.979> spray<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:31.530> move<00:01:32.490> through

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
you can spray this and and move through

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.800 
you can spray this and and move through
the<00:01:33.240> paint<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.460> allow<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.450> flow

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the paint so you can allow it to flow

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.330 
the paint so you can allow it to flow
I've<00:01:37.289> got<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.799> too<00:01:37.829> much<00:01:38.100> water<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:40.340> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
I've got way too much water on here and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.789 
I've got way too much water on here and
it's<00:01:41.850> tilted<00:01:42.359> so<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.810> spreading<00:01:43.619> all<00:01:43.770> over

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
it's tilted so it's spreading all over

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.730 
it's tilted so it's spreading all over
the<00:01:44.189> place

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
the place

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.160 
the place
so<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.420> sorry<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.539> terrorists<00:01:48.840> skin<00:01:49.020> is

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
so the you sorry the terrorists skin is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.700 
so the you sorry the terrorists skin is
very<00:01:49.679> non<00:01:50.130> absorbent<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.140> get<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> very

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
very non absorbent so you get a very

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.669 
very non absorbent so you get a very
different<00:01:52.799> effect<00:01:53.219> on<00:01:53.640> watercolor<00:01:57.380> which<00:01:58.380> I'm

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
different effect on watercolor which I'm

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
and I can use this again so so this is a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.510 
and I can use this again so so this is a
hundred<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.560> forty<00:02:31.830> pound<00:02:32.040> cold<00:02:32.310> press

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
absorbent to show you how the Euler

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:21.550 
absorbent to show you how the Euler
boilers<00:02:55.910> work

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.090

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
okay so as the as the paint works out

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.630 
okay so as the as the paint works out
you<00:03:26.370> can<00:03:26.840> clear<00:03:27.840> out<00:03:28.080> areas<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.890> actually

you can clear out areas and actually

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.290 
you can clear out areas and actually
have<00:03:33.090> flows<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:35.000> use<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.270> water<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:38.120> help<00:03:39.120> you

create your design okay I'm a big fan of
oiler<00:03:46.290> boilers<00:03:46.590> because<00:03:46.800> they<00:03:46.920> can<00:03:47.190> move<00:03:47.490> the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
oiler boilers because they can move the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.200 
oiler boilers because they can move the
paint<00:03:48.660> around<00:03:49.370> they<00:03:50.370> get<00:03:50.490> it<00:03:50.640> out<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.760> your<00:03:51.000> way

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
paint around they get it out of your way

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.920 
paint around they get it out of your way
and<00:03:51.540> they<00:03:51.990> can<00:03:52.230> create<00:03:52.410> lots<00:03:52.770> of<00:03:52.950> plumes<00:03:53.340> and

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
and they can create lots of plumes and

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.400 
and they can create lots of plumes and
they<00:03:54.930> help<00:03:55.230> in<00:03:55.440> these<00:03:55.590> kind<00:03:55.920> of

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
they help in these kind of

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.120 
they help in these kind of
uncontrollable<00:03:58.410> washes<00:03:59.240> too<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:01.260> make<00:04:01.800> way

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
uncontrollable washes too to make way

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.120 
uncontrollable washes too to make way
for<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.580> new<00:04:02.640> color<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.420> come<00:04:04.140> in<00:04:04.320> so<00:04:04.830> they<00:04:04.860> can

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
for a new color to come in so they can

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.980 
for a new color to come in so they can
really<00:04:05.310> help<00:04:05.520> you<00:04:05.730> direct<00:04:06.180> what<00:04:06.480> you're<00:04:06.630> doing

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
really help you direct what you're doing

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.170 
really help you direct what you're doing
and<00:04:07.140> without<00:04:08.070> putting<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.550> brushstrokes

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
and without putting in brushstrokes

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.420 
and without putting in brushstrokes
which<00:04:11.180> tend<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.330> make<00:04:13.320> marks<00:04:13.800> on<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.250> paper

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
which tend to make marks on the paper

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.580 
which tend to make marks on the paper
instead<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.090> these<00:04:15.270> pleasant<00:04:16.260> plumes<00:04:16.820> now

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
instead of these pleasant plumes now

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.460 
instead of these pleasant plumes now
when<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.680> add<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.670> spray<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.470> actually

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
when you add the spray you actually

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.190 
when you add the spray you actually
start<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.860> disturb<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.580> pigments<00:04:24.200> underneath

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
start to disturb the pigments underneath

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.860 
start to disturb the pigments underneath
and<00:04:25.530> that<00:04:26.190> was<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.370> half<00:04:26.640> spray<00:04:27.030> like<00:04:27.300> on<00:04:27.600> these

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
and that was a half spray like on these

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.650 
and that was a half spray like on these
bottles<00:04:28.380> there's<00:04:29.130> a<00:04:29.220> half<00:04:29.580> spray<00:04:30.060> portion

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
bottles there's a half spray portion

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.580 
bottles there's a half spray portion
that<00:04:30.840> sends<00:04:31.440> out<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:31.590> coarse<00:04:33.230> speckled<00:04:34.230> spray

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
that sends out a coarse speckled spray

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.050 
that sends out a coarse speckled spray
which<00:04:34.830> really<00:04:35.160> helps<00:04:35.490> if<00:04:35.640> you<00:04:35.730> want<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:35.970> do

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
which really helps if you want to do

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.880 
which really helps if you want to do
spattering<00:04:36.690> or<00:04:36.870> any<00:04:37.380> kind<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.680> really

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
spattering or any kind of really

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.710 
spattering or any kind of really
texturized<00:04:40.640> texturized<00:04:41.640> work<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.419> can<00:04:42.570> also

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
texturized texturized work you can also

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.400 
texturized texturized work you can also
spray<00:04:43.169> edges<00:04:44.090> so<00:04:45.090> it'll<00:04:45.450> start<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.810> plume<00:04:46.230> out

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
spray edges so it'll start to plume out

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.100 
spray edges so it'll start to plume out
and<00:04:46.620> follow<00:04:46.890> these<00:04:47.190> coarse<00:04:47.669> sprays<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.780> it

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
and follow these coarse sprays and it

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.340 
and follow these coarse sprays and it
won't<00:04:49.320> come<00:04:49.500> out<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:49.919> full<00:04:50.660> wash<00:04:51.660> like<00:04:52.169> it's

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
won't come out and a full wash like it's

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.150 
won't come out and a full wash like it's
doing<00:04:52.680> here<00:04:52.710> it<00:04:53.100> comes<00:04:53.400> out<00:04:53.660> speckled<00:04:54.660> and

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
doing here it comes out speckled and

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.780 
doing here it comes out speckled and
course<00:04:56.419> you<00:04:57.419> can<00:04:57.570> also<00:04:57.840> go<00:04:58.200> in<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:59.040> this<00:04:59.640> is

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
course you can also go in and this is

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.760 
course you can also go in and this is
acrylic<00:05:00.120> so<00:05:00.480> and<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:00.870> like<00:05:01.230> it's<00:05:01.410> working

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
acrylic so and you like it's working

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.670 
acrylic so and you like it's working
exactly<00:05:02.100> like<00:05:02.430> watercolor<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:04.020> can<00:05:04.350> do<00:05:04.500> this

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
exactly like watercolor you can do this

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.980 
exactly like watercolor you can do this
on<00:05:04.890> a<00:05:04.919> canvas<00:05:05.550> with<00:05:05.850> an<00:05:06.120> absorbent<00:05:06.720> ground

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
on a canvas with an absorbent ground

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.650 
on a canvas with an absorbent ground
golden<00:05:07.800> has<00:05:08.010> an<00:05:08.160> absorbent<00:05:08.700> ground<00:05:08.970> which

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
golden has an absorbent ground which

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.030 
golden has an absorbent ground which
allows<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.140> canvas<00:05:10.470> to<00:05:10.590> become<00:05:10.860> more

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
allows the canvas to become more

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.250 
allows the canvas to become more
absorbent<00:05:11.810> that's<00:05:12.810> why<00:05:12.930> it's<00:05:13.080> called

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
absorbent that's why it's called

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.180 
absorbent that's why it's called
absorbing<00:05:13.740> ground<00:05:15.590> but<00:05:16.590> you<00:05:16.650> can<00:05:16.800> see<00:05:17.010> what's

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
absorbing ground but you can see what's

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.710 
absorbing ground but you can see what's
happening<00:05:17.610> here<00:05:17.880> it's<00:05:17.970> starting<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.450> get<00:05:18.600> all

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
happening here it's starting to get all

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.310 
happening here it's starting to get all
textured<00:05:19.290> as<00:05:19.500> this<00:05:20.250> dries<00:05:20.840> just<00:05:21.840> before<00:05:22.229> it

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
textured as this dries just before it

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.000 
textured as this dries just before it
dries<00:05:22.590> permanently<00:05:23.510> I'm<00:05:24.510> going<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.440> come<00:05:25.830> in

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
dries permanently I'm going to come in

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.500 
dries permanently I'm going to come in
and<00:05:26.370> do<00:05:26.640> a<00:05:26.669> coarse<00:05:27.270> spray<00:05:27.720> over<00:05:28.050> top<00:05:28.550> and<00:05:29.550> it's

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
and do a coarse spray over top and it's

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.060 
and do a coarse spray over top and it's
going<00:05:30.690> to<00:05:30.750> disturb<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.320> pigment<00:05:31.710> so<00:05:31.890> it's

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
going to disturb the pigment so it's

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.770 
going to disturb the pigment so it's
going<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.340> end<00:05:32.490> up<00:05:32.700> being<00:05:33.000> kind<00:05:33.570> of<00:05:33.690> speckled

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
going to end up being kind of speckled

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:45.420 
going to end up being kind of speckled
okay<00:05:42.510> okay<00:05:43.510> I<00:05:43.540> just<00:05:43.780> drew<00:05:44.170> a<00:05:44.200> line<00:05:44.320> in<00:05:45.280> it

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
okay okay I just drew a line in it

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.700 
okay okay I just drew a line in it
that's<00:05:45.610> gonna<00:05:45.760> allow<00:05:45.940> this<00:05:46.330> to<00:05:46.540> flow<00:05:46.840> more<00:05:47.110> so

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
that's gonna allow this to flow more so

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.440 
that's gonna allow this to flow more so
you<00:05:47.800> have<00:05:47.890> to<00:05:48.010> experiment<00:05:48.430> of<00:05:48.910> course<00:05:49.210> with

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
you have to experiment of course with

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.420 
you have to experiment of course with
drawing<00:05:49.810> times<00:05:50.200> and<00:05:50.470> that<00:05:50.560> kind<00:05:50.860> of<00:05:50.920> stuff<00:05:51.160> but

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
drawing times and that kind of stuff but

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.350 
drawing times and that kind of stuff but
these<00:05:52.120> two<00:05:52.480> together<00:05:52.810> are<00:05:54.180> two<00:05:55.180> of<00:05:55.330> my
