00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.950 

hello<00:00:07.630> YouTube<00:00:08.850> so<00:00:09.850> for<00:00:10.180> today's<00:00:10.420> video<00:00:10.690> I'm

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
hello YouTube so for today's video I'm

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.720 
hello YouTube so for today's video I'm
going<00:00:11.140> to<00:00:11.290> be<00:00:11.380> showing<00:00:11.590> off<00:00:11.830> something<00:00:12.580> that

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
going to be showing off something that

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.800 
going to be showing off something that
I've<00:00:12.820> created<00:00:13.150> it<00:00:14.110> is<00:00:14.410> a<00:00:14.440> long<00:00:15.130> time<00:00:16.000> er<00:00:16.030> now

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
I've created it is a long time er now

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.390 
I've created it is a long time er now
I'm<00:00:17.020> not<00:00:17.200> the<00:00:17.320> first<00:00:17.500> to<00:00:17.680> create<00:00:18.039> this<00:00:18.160> type<00:00:18.220> of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
I'm not the first to create this type of

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.060 
I'm not the first to create this type of
design<00:00:18.789> so<00:00:19.150> I<00:00:19.180> can't<00:00:20.140> take<00:00:20.440> complete<00:00:20.860> credit

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
design so I can't take complete credit

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.670 
design so I can't take complete credit
for<00:00:21.460> it<00:00:21.550> but<00:00:22.150> I<00:00:22.420> got<00:00:22.630> the<00:00:22.750> idea<00:00:23.050> after<00:00:23.140> watching

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
for it but I got the idea after watching

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.510 
for it but I got the idea after watching
a<00:00:24.220> video<00:00:25.170> redstone<00:00:26.170> wars<00:00:26.410> between<00:00:26.680> sethbling

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
a video redstone wars between sethbling

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.720 
a video redstone wars between sethbling
and<00:00:27.789> generic<00:00:28.359> be<00:00:28.539> and<00:00:28.920> sethbling<00:00:29.920> made<00:00:30.130> a<00:00:30.310> hard

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
and generic be and sethbling made a hard

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.939 
and generic be and sethbling made a hard
drive<00:00:31.029> and<00:00:31.300> this<00:00:31.480> is<00:00:31.689> basically<00:00:32.229> what<00:00:32.649> he<00:00:32.800> made

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
drive and this is basically what he made

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.439 
drive and this is basically what he made
for<00:00:33.129> his<00:00:33.219> hard<00:00:33.399> drive<00:00:33.609> and<00:00:33.819> it<00:00:33.940> also<00:00:34.120> works

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
for his hard drive and it also works

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.649 
for his hard drive and it also works
great<00:00:34.600> for<00:00:34.960> a<00:00:35.170> timer<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.670> version<00:00:36.969> I<00:00:37.329> have

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:37.659 
great for a timer this version I have

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:40.770 
great for a timer this version I have
set<00:00:37.960> up<00:00:38.079> on<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.579> simple<00:00:39.579> clock<00:00:39.819> here<00:00:40.120> turned<00:00:40.539> off

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
set up on a simple clock here turned off

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.579 
set up on a simple clock here turned off
using<00:00:41.199> this<00:00:41.319> switch<00:00:42.010> there<00:00:42.309> and<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:44.260> takes

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
using this switch there and it takes

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.829 
using this switch there and it takes
roughly<00:00:44.859> about<00:00:45.219> 30<00:00:45.729> seconds<00:00:46.179> for<00:00:46.479> it<00:00:46.569> to<00:00:46.629> make

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
roughly about 30 seconds for it to make

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.869 
roughly about 30 seconds for it to make
a<00:00:47.049> loop<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.460> I'll<00:00:48.609> turn<00:00:48.819> that<00:00:48.969> on<00:00:50.819> it's<00:00:51.819> a

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
a loop so I'll turn that on it's a

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.279 
a loop so I'll turn that on it's a
little<00:00:52.149> bit<00:00:52.269> noisy<00:00:52.690> but<00:00:52.719> if<00:00:52.989> you're<00:00:53.109> far

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
little bit noisy but if you're far

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:58.619 
little bit noisy but if you're far
enough<00:00:53.350> away<00:00:55.019> it<00:00:56.019> doesn't<00:00:56.379> matter<00:00:57.479> so<00:00:58.479> that

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
enough away it doesn't matter so that

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.509 
enough away it doesn't matter so that
one<00:00:58.780> there<00:00:58.989> takes<00:00:59.260> about<00:00:59.440> 30<00:00:59.739> seconds<00:01:00.159> to<00:01:00.249> go

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
one there takes about 30 seconds to go

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.209 
one there takes about 30 seconds to go
through<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.179> way<00:01:01.269> I<00:01:01.299> have<00:01:01.629> this<00:01:01.780> set<00:01:02.049> up<00:01:02.219> each

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
through the way I have this set up each

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.430 
through the way I have this set up each
of<00:01:03.459> these<00:01:03.579> repeaters<00:01:04.030> is<00:01:04.420> set<00:01:04.660> to<00:01:04.840> full<00:01:05.050> delay

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
of these repeaters is set to full delay

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.750 
of these repeaters is set to full delay
and<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:07.780> I<00:01:07.810> have<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.530> pulse<00:01:08.860> generator<00:01:09.400> here

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
and then I have a pulse generator here

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.280 
and then I have a pulse generator here
now<00:01:09.970> this<00:01:10.150> pulse<00:01:10.390> generator<00:01:10.810> is<00:01:10.960> different

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
now this pulse generator is different

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.290 
now this pulse generator is different
than<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.470> pulse<00:01:11.800> generator<00:01:12.310> that<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:12.640> have<00:01:12.940> in

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
than the pulse generator that I have in

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.960 
than the pulse generator that I have in
one<00:01:14.140> of<00:01:14.170> my<00:01:14.320> other<00:01:14.350> videos<00:01:14.560> as<00:01:15.160> this<00:01:15.490> one<00:01:15.730> only

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
one of my other videos as this one only

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.720 
one of my other videos as this one only
pulses<00:01:16.540> when<00:01:16.690> it<00:01:16.840> is<00:01:16.960> turned<00:01:17.290> when<00:01:18.250> input<00:01:18.700> is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
pulses when it is turned when input is

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.240 
pulses when it is turned when input is
turned<00:01:19.060> on<00:01:19.240> not<00:01:19.630> when<00:01:20.080> it's<00:01:20.230> both<00:01:20.440> on<00:01:20.710> hand<00:01:21.070> off

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
turned on not when it's both on hand off

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.740 
turned on not when it's both on hand off
that's<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.790> difference<00:01:22.060> between<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.570> pulse

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
that's the difference between the pulse

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.270 
that's the difference between the pulse
generator<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.150> have<00:01:25.480> in<00:01:25.660> my<00:01:25.810> video<00:01:26.280> I'm

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
generator that I have in my video I'm

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.680 
generator that I have in my video I'm
sure<00:01:27.520> there's<00:01:27.700> other<00:01:27.760> designs<00:01:28.210> out<00:01:28.360> there<00:01:28.420> too

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
sure there's other designs out there too

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.960 
sure there's other designs out there too
now<00:01:29.470> let's<00:01:29.710> say<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:29.950> want<00:01:30.190> a<00:01:30.250> longer<00:01:30.520> than<00:01:30.820> 30

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
now let's say you want a longer than 30

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.250 
now let's say you want a longer than 30
second<00:01:31.420> timer<00:01:31.630> I<00:01:31.750> mean<00:01:31.900> this<00:01:32.020> can<00:01:32.200> obviously

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
second timer I mean this can obviously

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.900 
second timer I mean this can obviously
be<00:01:32.620> tuned<00:01:32.920> if<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:33.160> want<00:01:33.340> shorter<00:01:33.670> you<00:01:33.790> can

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
be tuned if you want shorter you can

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.390 
be tuned if you want shorter you can
just<00:01:34.060> add<00:01:34.210> more<00:01:34.390> wool<00:01:34.600> blocks<00:01:35.160> there's<00:01:36.160> this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
just add more wool blocks there's this

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.980 
just add more wool blocks there's this
one<00:01:36.640> here<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:38.350> row<00:01:38.890> here<00:01:38.920> is<00:01:39.400> 12<00:01:40.000> blocks<00:01:40.600> long

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
one here this row here is 12 blocks long

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.010 
one here this row here is 12 blocks long
and<00:01:41.320> then<00:01:42.220> each<00:01:42.430> one<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.700> these<00:01:42.850> is<00:01:43.180> 11<00:01:43.900> and

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
and then each one of these is 11 and

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.550 
and then each one of these is 11 and
this<00:01:44.860> one<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:45.430> times<00:01:45.730> is<00:01:46.210> close<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.140> minute

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
this one I times is close to a minute

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.230 
this one I times is close to a minute
which<00:01:47.920> makes<00:01:47.950> sense<00:01:48.400> considering<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:49.030> one

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
which makes sense considering this one

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.490 
which makes sense considering this one
is<00:01:50.280> 6555<00:01:51.480> so<00:01:52.480> it's<00:01:52.720> roughly<00:01:52.990> about<00:01:53.110> half<00:01:53.350> the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
is 6555 so it's roughly about half the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.490 
is 6555 so it's roughly about half the
size<00:01:53.530> of<00:01:53.860> this<00:01:53.950> one<00:01:54.010> and<00:01:54.480> this<00:01:55.480> one<00:01:55.540> I<00:01:55.750> have<00:01:56.200> set

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
size of this one and this one I have set

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.430 
size of this one and this one I have set
up<00:01:56.620> right<00:01:56.830> now<00:01:57.010> as<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:58.150> can<00:01:58.270> see<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.810> has<00:01:59.020> an

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
up right now as you can see it has an

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.670 
up right now as you can see it has an
auto<00:01:59.860> off<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.610> if<00:02:01.000> i<00:02:01.180> have<00:02:01.210> this<00:02:01.510> switch-up<00:02:01.840> it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
auto off so if i have this switch-up it

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.710 
auto off so if i have this switch-up it
will<00:02:03.510> keep<00:02:04.510> it<00:02:04.750> off<00:02:06.000> whereas<00:02:07.000> if<00:02:07.030> i<00:02:07.390> turn<00:02:07.450> that

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
will keep it off whereas if i turn that

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.800 
will keep it off whereas if i turn that
switch<00:02:07.870> down<00:02:08.229> they<00:02:08.560> will<00:02:08.739> keep<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.909> on<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.539> then

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
switch down they will keep it on so then

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.840 
switch down they will keep it on so then
if<00:02:10.929> i<00:02:11.109> do<00:02:11.859> that<00:02:11.889> now<00:02:12.760> what's<00:02:13.090> this

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
if i do that now what's this

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.480 
if i do that now what's this
block<00:02:14.180> wall<00:02:14.510> goes<00:02:14.870> all<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.080> way<00:02:15.230> around<00:02:15.490> it

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
block wall goes all the way around it

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.130 
block wall goes all the way around it
will<00:02:16.670> automatically<00:02:17.270> stop<00:02:17.600> right<00:02:17.810> there<00:02:17.990> and

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
will automatically stop right there and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.480 
will automatically stop right there and
that's<00:02:18.230> something<00:02:18.500> pretty<00:02:18.890> easy<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.250> set<00:02:19.460> up

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
that's something pretty easy to set up

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.870 
that's something pretty easy to set up
you<00:02:19.790> just<00:02:19.940> add<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.380> clock<00:02:21.880> actually

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
you just add that to the clock actually

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.720 
you just add that to the clock actually
I<00:02:22.910> need<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.150> fix<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:24.370> now<00:02:25.370> it'll<00:02:25.580> work

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
I need to fix that now it'll work

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.450 
I need to fix that now it'll work
properly<00:02:26.090> now<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.960> clock<00:02:27.680> itself<00:02:28.100> won't<00:02:28.280> be

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
properly now the clock itself won't be

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.220 
properly now the clock itself won't be
affecting<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.530> or<00:02:30.530> shouldn't<00:02:30.920> anyways<00:02:32.230> sorry

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
affecting it or shouldn't anyways sorry

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.650 
affecting it or shouldn't anyways sorry
about<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.800> frame<00:02:34.550> rates<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:35.330> don't<00:02:35.540> know

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
about the frame rates I don't know

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.880 
about the frame rates I don't know
what's<00:02:35.870> going<00:02:36.290> on<00:02:36.500> right<00:02:37.160> now<00:02:40.720> let<00:02:41.720> me<00:02:41.800> see<00:02:42.800> if

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
what's going on right now let me see if

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.050 
what's going on right now let me see if
I<00:02:42.920> can<00:02:43.070> fix<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:44.800> ok<00:02:45.800> that's<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.280> lot<00:02:46.460> better<00:02:46.670> so

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
I can fix that ok that's a lot better so

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.030 
I can fix that ok that's a lot better so
I<00:02:47.090> am<00:02:47.720> head<00:02:48.230> skype<00:02:48.590> running<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:48.980> the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
I am head skype running in the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.860 
I am head skype running in the
background<00:02:49.190> normally<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.820> don't<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.630> was

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
background normally I don't and that was

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.090 
background normally I don't and that was
causing<00:02:51.170> our<00:02:51.950> poor<00:02:52.250> frame<00:02:52.520> rate<00:02:53.410> ok<00:02:54.410> now<00:02:54.860> let's

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
causing our poor frame rate ok now let's

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.910 
causing our poor frame rate ok now let's
say<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.700> minute<00:02:56.180> isn't<00:02:56.600> long<00:02:57.440> enough<00:02:57.680> for

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
say that a minute isn't long enough for

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.350 
say that a minute isn't long enough for
you<00:02:58.040> still<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.460> want<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.700> longer<00:02:58.970> timer

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
you still and you want a longer timer

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.900 
you still and you want a longer timer
well<00:03:00.290> here's<00:03:00.920> something<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.490> you<00:03:01.580> can<00:03:01.730> do

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
well here's something that you can do

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.870 
well here's something that you can do
that<00:03:02.210> can<00:03:02.420> do<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.780> this<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:04.100> 30-second

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
that can do that this is the 30-second

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.480 
that can do that this is the 30-second
timer<00:03:05.230> hooked<00:03:06.230> up<00:03:06.410> with<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> pulse<00:03:06.890> generator

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
timer hooked up with a pulse generator

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.220 
timer hooked up with a pulse generator
to<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.630> minute-long<00:03:09.500> timer<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:11.050> when<00:03:12.050> you

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
to the minute-long timer so when you

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.290 
to the minute-long timer so when you
turn<00:03:12.680> this<00:03:12.860> on<00:03:13.100> we're<00:03:13.640> still<00:03:13.910> getting<00:03:14.000> poor

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
turn this on we're still getting poor

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.600 
turn this on we're still getting poor
frame<00:03:14.480> right<00:03:14.630> now<00:03:14.810> well<00:03:15.160> when<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.250> turn<00:03:16.460> this

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
frame right now well when you turn this

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.210 
frame right now well when you turn this
on<00:03:16.820> this<00:03:17.750> takes<00:03:18.110> 30<00:03:18.320> seconds<00:03:18.710> to<00:03:18.770> go<00:03:18.980> around

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
on this takes 30 seconds to go around

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.600 
on this takes 30 seconds to go around
and<00:03:19.550> every<00:03:19.760> 30<00:03:20.030> seconds<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.570> sends<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.900> pulse<00:03:21.610> to

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
and every 30 seconds it sends a pulse to

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.070 
and every 30 seconds it sends a pulse to
this<00:03:22.760> one<00:03:22.970> now<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:24.200> takes<00:03:24.950> roughly<00:03:25.810> based<00:03:26.810> on

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
this one now this takes roughly based on

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.780 
this one now this takes roughly based on
the<00:03:27.170> number<00:03:27.440> of<00:03:27.470> blocks<00:03:27.830> if<00:03:28.250> I'm<00:03:28.430> doing<00:03:28.670> my

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
the number of blocks if I'm doing my

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.380 
the number of blocks if I'm doing my
math<00:03:29.000> right<00:03:29.330> it<00:03:29.600> takes<00:03:29.780> around<00:03:30.200> 24<00:03:31.010> minutes<00:03:31.390> to

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
math right it takes around 24 minutes to

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.590 
math right it takes around 24 minutes to
go<00:03:32.750> through<00:03:33.050> a<00:03:33.080> loop<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.680> send<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.250> output<00:03:35.030> there

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
go through a loop to send a output there

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.290 
go through a loop to send a output there
so<00:03:36.200> obviously<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:37.370> can<00:03:37.520> add<00:03:37.670> more<00:03:37.910> blocks

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
so obviously you can add more blocks

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.050 
so obviously you can add more blocks
speed<00:03:38.840> things<00:03:39.110> up<00:03:39.350> change<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.580> delay<00:03:40.850> on

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
speed things up change the delay on

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.030 
speed things up change the delay on
timers<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:41.840> stuff<00:03:42.020> like<00:03:42.110> that<00:03:44.320> let's<00:03:45.320> say<00:03:45.500> 24

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
timers and stuff like that let's say 24

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.230 
timers and stuff like that let's say 24
minutes<00:03:46.250> isn't<00:03:46.580> long<00:03:47.270> enough<00:03:47.510> for<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:47.870> still

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
minutes isn't long enough for you still

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.560 
minutes isn't long enough for you still
well<00:03:50.240> there's<00:03:51.110> another<00:03:51.260> option<00:03:52.330> here<00:03:53.330> i<00:03:53.360> have

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
well there's another option here i have

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.100 
well there's another option here i have
3<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.740> the<00:03:54.890> 30<00:03:55.100> second<00:03:55.550> timers<00:03:55.910> hooked<00:03:56.540> up<00:03:56.750> to

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
3 of the 30 second timers hooked up to

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.920 
3 of the 30 second timers hooked up to
each<00:03:57.200> other<00:03:57.610> so<00:03:58.610> this<00:03:58.910> one<00:03:59.120> obviously<00:03:59.300> is<00:03:59.660> 30

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
each other so this one obviously is 30

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.110 
each other so this one obviously is 30
seconds<00:04:00.320> each<00:04:00.410> time<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.770> goes<00:04:00.920> around<00:04:01.120> the

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
seconds each time it goes around the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.880 
seconds each time it goes around the
next<00:04:02.510> one<00:04:02.750> i<00:04:03.470> think<00:04:04.220> is<00:04:04.520> around<00:04:05.350> let's<00:04:06.350> see<00:04:06.560> we

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
next one i think is around let's see we

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.680 
next one i think is around let's see we
got<00:04:08.020> 3<00:04:09.020> times<00:04:09.200> 5<00:04:09.560> 15<00:04:10.220> plus<00:04:10.670> 6<00:04:11.090> is<00:04:13.030> 21/2<00:04:14.030> because

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
got 3 times 5 15 plus 6 is 21/2 because

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.050 
got 3 times 5 15 plus 6 is 21/2 because
30<00:04:14.930> seconds<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:15.830> roughly<00:04:16.220> 10<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.030> half

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
30 seconds so roughly 10 and a half

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.340 
30 seconds so roughly 10 and a half
minutes<00:04:17.570> or<00:04:17.690> so<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:18.830> 10<00:04:19.430> times<00:04:20.060> 21<00:04:20.989> we're

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
minutes or so and so 10 times 21 we're

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.130 
minutes or so and so 10 times 21 we're
looking<00:04:21.590> at<00:04:21.680> about<00:04:21.799> two<00:04:22.490> hundred<00:04:22.700> and<00:04:23.150> fifteen

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
looking at about two hundred and fifteen

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.910 
looking at about two hundred and fifteen
minutes<00:04:24.500> or<00:04:24.650> so

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.420 

probably<00:04:27.920> i<00:04:29.380> don't<00:04:30.380> know<00:04:30.950> that<00:04:31.130> my<00:04:31.220> math<00:04:31.400> is

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
probably i don't know that my math is

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.790 
probably i don't know that my math is
right<00:04:31.580> there<00:04:31.970> but<00:04:32.150> anyways<00:04:32.480> so<00:04:33.350> you<00:04:33.440> could

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
right there but anyways so you could

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.870 
right there but anyways so you could
turn<00:04:33.980> this<00:04:34.160> on<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:35.980> every<00:04:36.980> 30<00:04:37.190> seconds<00:04:37.790> that

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
turn this on and every 30 seconds that

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.090 
turn this on and every 30 seconds that
will<00:04:38.180> pulse<00:04:38.450> that<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:39.140> then<00:04:39.290> every<00:04:39.650> 10

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
will pulse that and then every 10

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.820 
will pulse that and then every 10
minutes<00:04:40.340> that'll<00:04:40.760> go<00:04:41.510> through<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:42.820> roughly

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
minutes that'll go through that roughly

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.280 
minutes that'll go through that roughly
so<00:04:46.870> there's<00:04:47.870> some<00:04:48.140> options<00:04:48.590> there<00:04:50.290> that's

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
so there's some options there that's

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.050 
so there's some options there that's
basically<00:04:51.560> what<00:04:52.040> i<00:04:52.070> wanted<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.580> go<00:04:52.700> over<00:04:52.730> in

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
basically what i wanted to go over in

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.300 
basically what i wanted to go over in
this<00:04:53.090> video<00:04:53.480> just<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:53.930> quick<00:04:54.110> little<00:04:54.310> thing

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
this video just a quick little thing

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.030 
this video just a quick little thing
i've<00:04:55.970> seen<00:04:56.750> design<00:04:57.110> similar<00:04:57.470> to<00:04:57.710> this<00:04:57.830> on

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
i've seen design similar to this on

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.610 
i've seen design similar to this on
other<00:04:58.190> YouTube<00:04:58.610> videos<00:04:59.110> they<00:05:00.110> did<00:05:00.230> not<00:05:00.260> auto

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
other YouTube videos they did not auto

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:09.370 
other YouTube videos they did not auto
turn<00:05:00.860> off<00:05:01.040> the<00:05:01.190> way<00:05:01.280> it's<00:05:01.430> supposed<00:05:01.670> to<00:05:01.790> oh<00:05:08.380> I

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
turn off the way it's supposed to oh I

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.360 
turn off the way it's supposed to oh I
had<00:05:09.620> it<00:05:09.770> there<00:05:10.280> we<00:05:10.430> go<00:05:10.550> NAT<00:05:10.850> auto<00:05:11.090> turned<00:05:11.360> off

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
had it there we go NAT auto turned off

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.220 
had it there we go NAT auto turned off
but<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.850> other<00:05:14.000> designs<00:05:14.420> that<00:05:14.780> I've<00:05:14.960> seen

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
but the other designs that I've seen

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.290 
but the other designs that I've seen
they<00:05:15.470> had<00:05:15.710> use<00:05:16.010> different<00:05:16.430> clock<00:05:16.700> set<00:05:17.000> up<00:05:17.090> to

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
they had use different clock set up to

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.000 
they had use different clock set up to
run<00:05:17.450> it<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:17.900> different<00:05:18.440> things<00:05:18.470> like<00:05:18.620> that<00:05:18.830> so

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
run it and different things like that so

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.730 
run it and different things like that so
I<00:05:19.070> just<00:05:19.220> wanted<00:05:19.460> to<00:05:19.520> show<00:05:19.760> off<00:05:19.960> my<00:05:20.960> version<00:05:21.470> of

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
I just wanted to show off my version of

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.680 
I just wanted to show off my version of
this<00:05:22.220> long<00:05:22.550> timer<00:05:22.940> using<00:05:24.190> this<00:05:25.360> setup<00:05:26.360> using

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
this long timer using this setup using

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.570 
this long timer using this setup using
Glanton<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:27.350> fact<00:05:27.590> that<00:05:27.680> glass<00:05:27.980> blocks<00:05:28.310> don't

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
Glanton the fact that glass blocks don't

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.290 
Glanton the fact that glass blocks don't
transmit<00:05:28.970> and<00:05:29.360> other<00:05:30.170> blocks<00:05:30.560> do<00:05:30.890> and<00:05:31.550> one

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
transmit and other blocks do and one

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.960 
transmit and other blocks do and one
quick<00:05:32.540> little<00:05:32.810> thing<00:05:33.050> I<00:05:33.200> just<00:05:33.410> wanted<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:33.970> go

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
quick little thing I just wanted to go

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.780 
quick little thing I just wanted to go
to<00:05:35.030> is<00:05:35.450> while<00:05:36.260> I<00:05:36.290> was<00:05:36.500> making<00:05:36.680> this<00:05:37.040> I<00:05:37.280> noticed

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
to is while I was making this I noticed

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.270 
to is while I was making this I noticed
over<00:05:38.060> here<00:05:38.480> is<00:05:38.630> a<00:05:39.140> mushroom<00:05:39.680> now<00:05:39.860> I<00:05:39.890> did<00:05:40.130> not

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
over here is a mushroom now I did not

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.580 
over here is a mushroom now I did not
spawn<00:05:40.610> this<00:05:40.820> in<00:05:41.000> using<00:05:41.270> a<00:05:41.360> spawner<00:05:41.630> egg<00:05:41.840> so

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
spawn this in using a spawner egg so

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.980 
spawn this in using a spawner egg so
obviously<00:05:43.310> over<00:05:43.940> here<00:05:44.120> somewhere<00:05:44.420> is<00:05:44.960> a

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
obviously over here somewhere is a

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.960 
obviously over here somewhere is a
mushroom<00:05:45.620> biome<00:05:45.950> so<00:05:46.910> in<00:05:47.210> a<00:05:47.270> super<00:05:47.540> flat<00:05:47.750> world

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
mushroom biome so in a super flat world

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.790 
mushroom biome so in a super flat world
motion<00:05:49.970> Priam's<00:05:50.360> do<00:05:50.570> exist<00:05:51.070> that's<00:05:52.070> proof

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
motion Priam's do exist that's proof

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.620 
motion Priam's do exist that's proof
okay<00:05:54.800> well<00:05:55.040> that's<00:05:55.160> going<00:05:55.520> to<00:05:55.610> do<00:05:55.730> it<00:05:55.880> for<00:05:55.910> this

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
okay well that's going to do it for this

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.630 
okay well that's going to do it for this
video<00:05:56.870> and<00:05:57.080> I<00:05:57.710> just<00:05:57.890> want<00:05:58.070> to<00:05:58.130> say<00:05:58.310> thank<00:05:58.580> you
