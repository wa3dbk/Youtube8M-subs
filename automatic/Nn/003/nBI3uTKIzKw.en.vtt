00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
because this is their moneymaker this is

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.970 
because this is their moneymaker this is
where<00:04:58.420> they<00:04:58.540> get<00:04:58.720> their<00:04:58.960> money<00:04:58.990> look<00:04:59.800> at

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
where they get their money look at
