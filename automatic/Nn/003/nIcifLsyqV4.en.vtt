off then cut it you can pull it or cut
it<00:02:21.719> I<00:02:21.930> chose<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.560> pull<00:02:22.799> it<00:02:22.980> absolutely<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.900> I

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
it I chose to pull it absolutely so I

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.929 
it I chose to pull it absolutely so I
did<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.260> off-camera<00:02:25.560> but<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:26.670> wrapped

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
did that off-camera but I just wrapped

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.520 
did that off-camera but I just wrapped
it<00:02:27.120> up<00:02:27.239> in<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:28.430> it's<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.549> there<00:02:29.760> now<00:02:30.439> there's<00:02:31.439> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
it up in it it's in there now there's a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.750 
it up in it it's in there now there's a
little<00:02:31.709> hole<00:02:31.829> in<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.219> back<00:02:32.400> because<00:02:32.519> I

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
little hole in the back because I

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.119 
little hole in the back because I
decided<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.389> pull<00:02:33.629> it<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.620> would<00:02:35.010> also

recommend<00:02:35.280> cutting<00:02:35.939> it<00:02:36.209> rather<00:02:36.420> than<00:02:36.629> pulling

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
recommend cutting it rather than pulling

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.869 
recommend cutting it rather than pulling
it<00:02:37.409> and<00:02:37.590> ripping<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:39.260> ok<00:02:40.260> show<00:02:40.859> next<00:02:41.250> I'm
