picked up for cheap around 20 euro at a
local<00:01:30.930> shop<00:01:31.140> which<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.590> good<00:01:31.950> case<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
local shop which is a good case but and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.230 
local shop which is a good case but and
it's<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:33.840> good<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:35.210> now<00:01:36.210> I

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.859 
it's just not as good as this now I
presume<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.229> apply<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.520> would

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
presume you just apply this as you would

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.050 
presume you just apply this as you would
and<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.590> see<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:41.100> has<00:01:41.880> been

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and as you can see this has been

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.510 
and as you can see this has been
designed<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.530> watch<00:01:44.060> movies<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.329> your

designed so you can watch movies on your

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.810 
designed so you can watch movies on your
4.7<00:01:47.520> inch<00:01:48.200> screen<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.950> let's<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.310> learn<00:01:50.670> this

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
4.7 inch screen so let's just learn this

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.090 
4.7 inch screen so let's just learn this
up<00:01:50.970> correctly

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.800 

and<00:01:55.100> there<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.610> have<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:56.230> it's<00:01:57.230> in<00:01:57.470> my<00:01:57.650> way

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
and there you have it it's in my way

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.720 
and there you have it it's in my way
it's<00:01:59.810> in<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.050> wrong<00:02:00.260> way<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.650> is<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.760> let's<00:02:03.730> put

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
it's in the wrong way it is so let's put

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.480 
it's in the wrong way it is so let's put
it<00:02:04.880> on<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.000> right<00:02:05.240> way<00:02:05.710> ok<00:02:06.710> so<00:02:06.770> now<00:02:07.070> that's<00:02:07.250> in

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
it on the right way ok so now that's in

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.060 
it on the right way ok so now that's in
the<00:02:07.610> right<00:02:07.760> way<00:02:07.940> it<00:02:08.509> seems<00:02:08.810> pretty<00:02:09.590> nice<00:02:09.890> in

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
the right way it seems pretty nice in

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.540 
the right way it seems pretty nice in
hand<00:02:10.310> some<00:02:11.240> reason<00:02:11.540> it's<00:02:12.100> it's<00:02:13.100> going<00:02:13.400> off
