to be showing you how to get one of

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.590 
to be showing you how to get one of
these<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:29.670> graphics<00:00:29.970> card<00:00:30.180> to<00:00:30.480> make

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
these or for your graphics card to make

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.120 
these or for your graphics card to make
it<00:00:30.750> look<00:00:30.900> like<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:33.830> understand<00:00:34.830> pretty

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
it look like this I understand pretty

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
it look like this I understand pretty
much<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.610> these<00:00:36.240> bits<00:00:36.450> are<00:00:36.570> gonna<00:00:36.660> go<00:00:36.840> on

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
much that these bits are gonna go on

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.690 
much that these bits are gonna go on
there<00:00:37.490> correct

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
there correct

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.550 
there correct
okay<00:00:39.000> now<00:00:39.480> I'm<00:00:39.630> a<00:00:39.690> little<00:00:39.870> bit<00:00:40.110> cautious<00:00:40.260> of

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
okay now I'm a little bit cautious of

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.840 
okay now I'm a little bit cautious of
doing<00:00:40.740> this<00:00:40.829> because<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.130> is<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.460> stop<00:00:41.640> call

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
doing this because this is the stop call

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.280 
doing this because this is the stop call
that<00:00:42.060> comes<00:00:42.240> with<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.450> card<00:00:42.690> mm-hmm

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
that comes with a card mm-hmm

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.170 
that comes with a card mm-hmm
so<00:00:43.500> first<00:00:43.980> off<00:00:44.160> am<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.520> gonna<00:00:44.670> invalidate<00:00:45.150> my

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
so first off am I gonna invalidate my

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.940 
so first off am I gonna invalidate my
warranty<00:00:45.570> by<00:00:45.660> doing<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:45.930> yes

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
warranty by doing this yes

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.940 
warranty by doing this yes
all<00:00:47.460> righty<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.050> what<00:00:49.260> comment<00:00:49.650> do<00:00:49.740> I<00:00:49.770> have

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
all righty and so what comment do I have

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.130 
all righty and so what comment do I have
if<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.220> all<00:00:50.310> goes<00:00:50.430> horribly<00:00:50.760> wrong<00:00:51.050> well<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
if it all goes horribly wrong well the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.690 
if it all goes horribly wrong well the
thing<00:00:52.290> is<00:00:52.320> nothing<00:00:52.830> really<00:00:53.160> should<00:00:53.340> go<00:00:53.520> wrong

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
thing is nothing really should go wrong

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.330 
thing is nothing really should go wrong
right<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.540> you're<00:00:54.660> taking<00:00:55.020> any<00:00:55.650> cooler<00:00:56.160> off

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
right when you're taking any cooler off

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.730 
right when you're taking any cooler off
any<00:00:56.940> component<00:00:57.780> really<00:00:57.900> you<00:00:58.290> just<00:00:58.410> need<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
any component really you just need to

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.530 
any component really you just need to
take<00:00:58.890> time<00:00:59.190> take<00:01:00.180> care

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
take time take care

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.900 
take time take care
don't<00:01:01.260> rush<00:01:01.500> things<00:01:01.740> because<00:01:02.400> when<00:01:02.580> you<00:01:02.670> start

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
don't rush things because when you start

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.390 
don't rush things because when you start
rushing<00:01:03.210> things<00:01:03.979> that's<00:01:04.979> when<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.189> steps

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
rushing things that's when we steps

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.130 
rushing things that's when we steps
happen<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.299> feels<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:06.960> going

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
happen so if it feels like it's going

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.270 
happen so if it feels like it's going
wrong<00:01:07.439> stop

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
wrong stop

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.090 
wrong stop
reassess<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.210> another<00:01:09.810> look<00:01:10.200> absolutely<00:01:10.770> so

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
reassess and another look absolutely so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.380 
reassess and another look absolutely so
I<00:01:11.130> guess<00:01:11.310> electing<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.820> get<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.000> cool<00:01:12.210> off

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
I guess electing is to get this cool off

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.499 
I guess electing is to get this cool off
how<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:12.659> do<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.650> no<00:01:14.400> problem<00:01:14.430> first<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.390> all

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
how we do that no problem first of all

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.789 
how we do that no problem first of all
look<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> backside<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> roughest

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
look at the backside of the roughest

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.730 
look at the backside of the roughest
card<00:01:17.040> you'll<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.820> eight<00:01:17.970> large<00:01:18.210> screws<00:01:18.740> along

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
card you'll see eight large screws along

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.230 
card you'll see eight large screws along
with<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> two<00:01:20.189> at<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.399> end<00:01:20.549> here<00:01:20.759> they'd<00:01:21.060> all

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
with the two at the end here they'd all

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.690 
with the two at the end here they'd all
be<00:01:21.390> heatsink<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:21.960> place<00:01:22.280> there's<00:01:23.280> also<00:01:23.429> some

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
be heatsink in place there's also some

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.609 
be heatsink in place there's also some
tiny<00:01:23.999> screws<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.719> we'll<00:01:24.929> get<00:01:25.109> to<00:01:25.229> them<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
tiny screws there we'll get to them a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.929 
tiny screws there we'll get to them a
little<00:01:25.950> bit<00:01:26.070> later<00:01:26.219> when<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.520> took<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.789> main

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
little bit later when we took the main

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.489 
little bit later when we took the main
heatsink<00:01:27.390> off<00:01:27.539> okay<00:01:27.929> and<00:01:28.109> it's<00:01:28.350> worth

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499 
heatsink off okay and it's worth

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:29.899 
heatsink off okay and it's worth
mentioning<00:01:28.649> that<00:01:28.979> some<00:01:29.249> graphics<00:01:29.609> cards<00:01:29.820> it's

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
mentioning that some graphics cards it's

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.219 
mentioning that some graphics cards it's
might<00:01:30.090> be<00:01:30.119> slightly<00:01:30.450> different<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.020> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
might be slightly different but for a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.870 
might be slightly different but for a
reference<00:01:31.590> bought<00:01:31.859> from<00:01:32.159> either<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.700> vidura

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
reference bought from either and vidura

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.340 
reference bought from either and vidura
TI<00:01:33.240> they're<00:01:33.539> all<00:01:33.630> gonna<00:01:33.719> be<00:01:33.899> pretty<00:01:34.049> much<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
TI they're all gonna be pretty much the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.779 
TI they're all gonna be pretty much the
sun<00:01:34.499> they're<00:01:34.679> pretty<00:01:34.920> much<00:01:35.100> identical

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
sun they're pretty much identical

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.340 
sun they're pretty much identical
yeah<00:01:35.939> alright<00:01:36.450> let's<00:01:36.479> start<00:01:36.929> taking<00:01:37.140> this

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
yeah alright let's start taking this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.149 
yeah alright let's start taking this
thing<00:01:37.499> off

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.249 

okay<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:43.220> that's<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.520> last<00:01:43.700> four<00:01:44.000> removed<00:01:44.299> so

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
okay so that's the last four removed so

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.219 
okay so that's the last four removed so
this<00:01:45.799> should<00:01:45.979> be<00:01:46.009> I'll<00:01:46.220> just<00:01:46.460> full<00:01:46.790> of<00:01:47.229> no

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
this should be I'll just full of no

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.109 
this should be I'll just full of no
unfortunately<00:01:48.799> not<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:49.310> likewise<00:01:49.700> ease<00:01:49.939> is

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
unfortunately not is likewise ease is

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.080 
unfortunately not is likewise ease is
that<00:01:50.470> so<00:01:51.470> basically<00:01:51.770> we<00:01:52.100> need<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.280> prize<00:01:52.820> this

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
that so basically we need to prize this

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.700 
that so basically we need to prize this
heatsink<00:01:53.570> off<00:01:53.720> now<00:01:53.930> this<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.259> probably<00:01:54.530> one<00:01:54.680> of

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
heatsink off now this is probably one of

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.100 
heatsink off now this is probably one of
the<00:01:54.860> most<00:01:55.009> difficult<00:01:55.250> bits<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:56.450> just<00:01:56.659> need<00:01:56.930> to

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
the most difficult bits you just need to

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.020 
the most difficult bits you just need to
give<00:01:57.830> it<00:01:57.860> a<00:01:58.009> little<00:01:58.220> bit<00:01:58.399> of<00:01:58.490> pressure<00:01:58.700> and

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
give it a little bit of pressure and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.550 
give it a little bit of pressure and
then<00:01:59.180> you<00:01:59.270> know<00:01:59.330> you<00:01:59.600> should<00:01:59.630> start<00:02:00.259> feeling

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
then you know you should start feeling

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.649 
then you know you should start feeling
it<00:02:00.830> moving<00:02:01.250> your<00:02:01.399> hands<00:02:01.759> right<00:02:02.210> you're<00:02:02.450> on<00:02:02.570> the

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
it moving your hands right you're on the

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.950 
it moving your hands right you're on the
slide<00:02:02.990> yeah<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.520> then<00:02:04.670> eventually<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.659> will

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
slide yeah and then eventually it will

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.600 
slide yeah and then eventually it will
just<00:02:06.020> pop<00:02:06.439> off<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.860> it'll<00:02:07.039> come<00:02:07.220> off<00:02:07.310> with<00:02:07.490> a

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
just pop off and it'll come off with a

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.719 
just pop off and it'll come off with a
bit<00:02:07.759> of<00:02:07.789> force<00:02:08.500> like<00:02:09.500> that's<00:02:09.830> right<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.519> then

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
bit of force like that's right and then

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.520 
bit of force like that's right and then
away<00:02:11.090> it<00:02:11.150> goes<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.660> then<00:02:11.959> it's<00:02:12.140> just<00:02:12.349> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
away it goes and then it's just the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.729 
away it goes and then it's just the
matter<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:13.300> disconnecting<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.420> fan<00:02:14.709> no<00:02:15.709> I

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
matter of disconnecting the fan no I

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.320 
matter of disconnecting the fan no I
should<00:02:15.950> just<00:02:16.130> pop<00:02:16.819> off<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:19.430> but<00:02:19.610> don't<00:02:20.239> need

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
should just pop off this but don't need

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.449 
should just pop off this but don't need
that<00:02:20.480> anymore<00:02:20.660> okay<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:25.069> that's<00:02:25.250> our

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
that anymore okay and that's our

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.910 
that anymore okay and that's our
graphics<00:02:26.000> card<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:27.290> as<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:27.500> can<00:02:27.590> see<00:02:27.650> this

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
graphics card and as you can see this

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.370 
graphics card and as you can see this
thermal<00:02:28.280> paste<00:02:28.489> around<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.970> GPU<00:02:29.510> also

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
thermal paste around the GPU also

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.900 
thermal paste around the GPU also
there's<00:02:30.560> residue<00:02:30.830> on<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.519> RAM<00:02:31.700> heat

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
there's residue on the the RAM heat

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.850 
there's residue on the the RAM heat
sinks<00:02:32.269> and<00:02:32.420> also<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.810> Fe<00:02:33.080> T's<00:02:33.319> around<00:02:33.620> here<00:02:33.799> as

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
sinks and also the Fe T's around here as

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.530 
sinks and also the Fe T's around here as
well<00:02:34.040> as<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.760> ships<00:02:35.000> over<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.299> under

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
well as the the ships over the under

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.910 
well as the the ships over the under
okay<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:35.959> now<00:02:36.170> we've<00:02:36.319> got<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.500> clean<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:36.769> all

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
okay so now we've got to clean this all

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.140 
okay so now we've got to clean this all
up<00:02:36.950> before<00:02:37.310> we<00:02:37.400> can<00:02:37.459> start<00:02:37.670> putting<00:02:37.970> these

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
up before we can start putting these

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.180 
up before we can start putting these
bits<00:02:38.420> back<00:02:38.569> off<00:02:38.720> correct<00:02:39.290> yes<00:02:39.500> all<00:02:39.830> right<00:02:40.010> then

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
bits back off correct yes all right then

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.460 
bits back off correct yes all right then
so<00:02:40.489> first<00:02:41.330> steps<00:02:41.510> is<00:02:41.630> what<00:02:41.840> about<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.230> color

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
so first steps is what about this color

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.530 
so first steps is what about this color
here<00:02:42.709> is<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:43.010> well<00:02:43.850> that<00:02:44.000> actually<00:02:44.269> needs<00:02:44.480> to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
here is that well that actually needs to

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.360 
here is that well that actually needs to
come<00:02:44.750> off<00:02:44.870> now<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.380> doesn't<00:02:45.560> always<00:02:45.799> need<00:02:46.280> to

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
come off now that doesn't always need to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.640 
come off now that doesn't always need to
come<00:02:46.519> off<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:47.090> depends<00:02:47.600> on<00:02:47.660> what<00:02:47.840> VGA<00:02:48.230> cool<00:02:48.500> you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
come off it depends on what VGA cool you

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.530 
come off it depends on what VGA cool you
use<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.100> because<00:02:49.670> we're<00:02:50.060> using<00:02:50.299> this

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
use it because we're using this

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.259 
use it because we're using this
particular<00:02:50.840> one<00:02:51.200> we<00:02:52.190> need<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.489> remove<00:02:52.790> that<00:02:53.000> so

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
particular one we need to remove that so

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.080 
particular one we need to remove that so
we<00:02:53.390> can<00:02:53.510> fit<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.780> RAM<00:02:54.140> heat<00:02:54.980> sinks<00:02:55.579> around

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
we can fit the RAM heat sinks around

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.319 
we can fit the RAM heat sinks around
that<00:02:56.299> I<00:02:56.480> think<00:02:56.900> touch<00:02:57.230> okay<00:02:58.000> let's<00:02:59.000> get<00:02:59.209> that

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
that I think touch okay let's get that

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:00.520 
that I think touch okay let's get that
off<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.660> then<00:02:59.780> give<00:02:59.930> it<00:02:59.959> a<00:03:00.079> plea<00:03:00.230> like<00:03:00.260> this

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
off and then give it a plea like this

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.410 
off and then give it a plea like this
yeah<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.160> that's<00:03:01.310> what<00:03:01.519> those<00:03:01.670> eight<00:03:02.120> little

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
yeah and that's what those eight little

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.199 
yeah and that's what those eight little
screws<00:03:02.660> are<00:03:02.870> right<00:03:03.760> around<00:03:04.760> here<00:03:05.920> yes<00:03:07.180> okay<00:03:08.180> so

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
screws are right around here yes okay so

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.830 
screws are right around here yes okay so
once<00:03:08.510> you've<00:03:08.660> removed<00:03:08.810> those<00:03:10.540> put<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.630> card

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
once you've removed those put the card

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.199 
once you've removed those put the card
back<00:03:11.900> down<00:03:12.200> this<00:03:12.799> pledge<00:03:13.160> should<00:03:13.430> then<00:03:13.730> just

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
back down this pledge should then just

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.910 
back down this pledge should then just
come<00:03:14.840> away<00:03:14.959> should<00:03:15.320> be<00:03:15.410> able<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.590> just<00:03:15.769> lift

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
come away should be able to just lift

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.190 
come away should be able to just lift
that<00:03:16.010> up<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.880> that's<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.269> where<00:03:17.630> does<00:03:17.780> discard

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
that up and that's it where does discard

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.479 
that up and that's it where does discard
it<00:03:18.320> as<00:03:18.410> well<00:03:18.590> yeah<00:03:18.890> we<00:03:19.040> don't<00:03:19.160> need<00:03:19.310> that

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
it as well yeah we don't need that

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.910 
it as well yeah we don't need that
non-line<00:03:19.850> okay<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:20.989> Tom<00:03:21.260> clean<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.620> car<00:03:21.769> up

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
non-line okay so Tom clean the car up

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
non-line okay so Tom clean the car up
and<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.070> guess<00:03:22.220> it's<00:03:22.400> pretty<00:03:22.489> much<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.790> same

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
and I guess it's pretty much the same

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.910 
and I guess it's pretty much the same
sort<00:03:23.120> of<00:03:23.209> procedures<00:03:23.690> we<00:03:23.870> did<00:03:24.019> for<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.350> CPU

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
sort of procedures we did for the CPU

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.949 
sort of procedures we did for the CPU
very<00:03:25.430> much<00:03:25.609> so<00:03:25.819> yes<00:03:26.180> okay<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:26.810> that's

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
very much so yes okay so that's

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:27.970 
very much so yes okay so that's
everything<00:03:27.140> cleaned<00:03:27.380> up<00:03:27.500> just<00:03:27.530> like<00:03:27.769> we<00:03:27.859> did

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
everything cleaned up just like we did

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.380 
everything cleaned up just like we did
with<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.130> CPU<00:03:28.459> all<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.819> tips<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.090> nice<00:03:29.209> and

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
with the CPU all the tips a nice and

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.309 
with the CPU all the tips a nice and
clean<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:29.690> we're<00:03:29.810> ready<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.049> rock<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:30.200> roll

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
clean so we're ready to rock and roll

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.229 
clean so we're ready to rock and roll
yeah<00:03:30.650> just<00:03:31.040> one<00:03:31.160> more<00:03:31.190> thing<00:03:31.549> I<00:03:31.790> always<00:03:32.120> like

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
yeah just one more thing I always like

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.819 
yeah just one more thing I always like
to<00:03:32.269> do<00:03:32.480> if<00:03:32.600> it's<00:03:32.750> an<00:03:33.049> old<00:03:33.200> card<00:03:33.530> that<00:03:33.739> you're

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
to do if it's an old card that you're

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.099 
to do if it's an old card that you're
upgrading<00:03:34.060> what's<00:03:35.060> always<00:03:35.359> good<00:03:35.540> is<00:03:35.660> if<00:03:35.900> you

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
upgrading what's always good is if you

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.039
