00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.370
 what people called zero tv with one 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.860
 she still looked up to new video destiny 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.429
 has struck again because he has with 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.809
 lego stone the patience and time 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.670
 not only recreated in the game sees that 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.240
 quite exotic but also these 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.740
 version 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.449
 You really have to say that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.640
 met very well even if it was 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.680
 green in my opinion not quite 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.630
 fits but I really think the best 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.330
 made it out and I would feel that way 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.059
 like to put a display case or somehow 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.070
 so you have properly lit it 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.380
 already looks really cool from the very 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.690
 elaborate one must not forget them 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.730
 nomis has no construction manual here 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.890
 do not know how big like what in which 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.329
 the scale must be kept that wants 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.309
 I like to have a look at the work process 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.800
 be there because that's pretty much 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.930
 pretty exciting how creative you are here 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.870
 Also, for example, this must be above 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.250
 Netz had years out of this tree 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.199
 plates made so these leaves the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.120
 yes, in different lego set in it 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.100
 he has then assembled and 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.799
 then put it over with the one above or the other 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.330
 other network made incredibly well and 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.320
 you can see how stable that is 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.970
 whole is clear 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.760
 now they can not do it everywhere 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.320
 over the battlefield but completely 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.270
 honestly who runs with one 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.310
 lego patience and time through the area 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.439
 we cling to the city show what 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.090
 Of course , people do it 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.290
 not the thing is probably only 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.390
 good for the showcase 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.369
 then i would like a kit for 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.290
 do not care how expensive that is 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.390
 otherwise I will not get something like that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.850
 how do you want to get there and there you can 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.979
 I imagine the stones and alone 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.619
 then this concept with instructions 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.079
 that would be so blatantly expensive there are 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.640
 also from lego that you then yourself 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.869
 can design any things 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.479
 You can send it there 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.860
 and if there are enough woods then 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.119
 It would really be in stores 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.159
 sold that also gave them with the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.899
 minecraft sets and I believe too 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.710
 the simpsons was the same for me 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.570
 not quite sure 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.520
 In any case, there was something with minecraft 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.110
 And yes and there it has somehow 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.390
 worked with halo I think so too 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.670
 one or the other pity that there is no 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.390
 destinys braid would like something times 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.869
 start 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.310
 that we have some sets kicks data 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.020
 either or 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.000
 that we then went into lego and 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.450
 then everyone wanted us to 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.950
 take a look 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.840
 interesting so we could have one 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.000
 push a bit more and especially for 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.280
 all lego fans and all creative people 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.650
 you really would have kits of all here 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.810
 lego star wars what would you think? 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.830
 that's what you would be for 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.440
 you buy destiny kits in what 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.880
 your thoughts in the comments 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.910
 Of course you will find the original video 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.640
 in the description of the people if this 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.810
 Video here was interesting to read 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.980

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.080
