regurgitation to chronic historically
showed<00:01:58.590> me<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:59.040> rate<00:01:59.280> back<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.730> probably

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
showed me a rate back in probably

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.790 
showed me a rate back in probably
2000<00:02:00.780> 2001<00:02:01.730> that<00:02:02.730> is<00:02:03.110> you<00:02:04.110> take<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.500> strap

2000 2001 that is you take this strap

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.790 
2000 2001 that is you take this strap
thing<00:02:05.540> as<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.780> neck<00:02:06.960> fear<00:02:07.170> obviously<00:02:07.320> you

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
thing as the neck fear obviously you

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.350 
thing as the neck fear obviously you
take<00:02:07.980> it<00:02:08.540> you<00:02:09.540> see<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.810> put<00:02:09.990> it<00:02:10.110> right<00:02:10.140> here<00:02:11.360> I'm

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
take it you see I put it right here I'm

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.240 
take it you see I put it right here I'm
taking<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.750> other<00:02:12.870> one<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.320> moved<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.220> right

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
taking the other one I moved it right

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.230 
taking the other one I moved it right
here<00:02:14.900> now<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.140> does<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.730> moves<00:02:17.970> the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
here now what that does is it moves the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.180 
here now what that does is it moves the
center<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.570> gravity<00:02:19.020> center<00:02:19.410> gravity<00:02:19.650> would

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
center of gravity center gravity would

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.610 
center of gravity center gravity would
buy<00:02:20.370> stocks<00:02:20.870> trafficking<00:02:21.870> whether<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.500> way

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
buy stocks trafficking whether the way

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.860 
buy stocks trafficking whether the way
they<00:02:22.770> set<00:02:22.950> them<00:02:23.040> up<00:02:23.240> it's<00:02:24.240> somewhere<00:02:24.570> up<00:02:24.630> in

they set them up it's somewhere up in
here

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
here

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.990 
here
you<00:02:25.770> do<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.130> you're<00:02:26.340> moving<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.670> center<00:02:26.850> of

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
you do this you're moving the center of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.660 
you do this you're moving the center of
gravity<00:02:27.090> more<00:02:27.660> towards<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.980> core<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.310> the

as<00:03:03.049> you<00:03:03.260> see<00:03:03.439> it<00:03:03.560> doesn't<00:03:03.739> it<00:03:04.250> still<00:03:04.730> migrates

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
as you see it doesn't it still migrates

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.009 
as you see it doesn't it still migrates
but<00:03:07.129> it's<00:03:07.250> not<00:03:07.430> dropping<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.420> ground<00:03:08.510> like

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
but it's not dropping to the ground like

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.539 
but it's not dropping to the ground like
you<00:03:09.140> normally<00:03:09.349> would<00:03:09.530> it's<00:03:09.890> still<00:03:10.099> relatively

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
you normally would it's still relatively

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.119 
you normally would it's still relatively
comfortable<00:03:14.379> anywhere<00:03:15.379> on<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.650> face<00:03:15.799> to

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
perfect you're still down below the top

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.009 
perfect you're still down below the top
head<00:03:24.049> but<00:03:24.500> it's<00:03:24.590> not<00:03:24.769> anywhere<00:03:25.099> near<00:03:25.159> as<00:03:25.310> been

had it's screw the base up in any way I

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.899 
had it's screw the base up in any way I
don't<00:03:42.919> know<00:03:42.980> what<00:03:43.099> it<00:03:43.189> does<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.519> resale<00:03:43.849> value
