spatula I'm going to just coax the glaze
over<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> edge<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.950> can<00:00:46.950> turn<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.460> cake

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
over to the edge you can turn the cake

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.720

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.980 

see<00:01:00.560> it's<00:01:00.770> starting<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.190> just<00:01:01.720> drip<00:01:02.720> down<00:01:02.930> the

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
see it's starting to just drip down the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:12.580 
see it's starting to just drip down the
edges<00:01:08.830> okay<00:01:09.940> just<00:01:10.940> you<00:01:11.150> just<00:01:11.300> coax<00:01:11.780> it<00:01:11.990> over

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
edges okay just you just coax it over

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.370 
edges okay just you just coax it over
there<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.660> edge<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:16.479> just<00:01:17.479> lightly<00:01:19.210> and

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
there to the edge and just lightly and

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.260 
there to the edge and just lightly and
then<00:01:21.380> take<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.950> spatula<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.530> spread<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:25.270> if

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
then take the spatula and spread it if

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.530 
then take the spatula and spread it if
you<00:01:26.390> need<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.600> little<00:01:26.900> more<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.410> just<00:01:28.510> push<00:01:29.510> a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:46.740 
little bit more over the edge and gently
spread<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:35.350> around<00:01:40.000> get<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.060> beautiful<00:01:41.690> glossy

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
go just coax it around the edge coax it

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.249 
go just coax it around the edge coax it
around<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.550> edge<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.149> spread<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.850> gently

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
around the edge and spread it gently

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.240 
around the edge and spread it gently
don't<00:02:03.259> worry<00:02:03.500> if<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:03.710> gets<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.920> little<00:02:03.979> messy

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
don't worry if it gets a little messy

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.699 
don't worry if it gets a little messy
around<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.759> edge<00:02:04.880> we'll<00:02:05.240> we'll<00:02:06.200> wipe<00:02:06.440> down

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
around the edge we'll we'll wipe down

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:14.960 
around the edge we'll we'll wipe down
later

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.090 

turn<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.150> cake<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:18.040> push<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.150> over<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.660> edge

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
turn the cake just push it over the edge

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.430 
turn the cake just push it over the edge
and<00:02:21.180> spread<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.480> don't<00:02:22.660> want<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.870> push<00:02:23.080> too

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
and spread it you don't want to push too

and spread it you don't want to push too
much<00:02:23.470> over<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.160> edge

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
much over the edge

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.170 
much over the edge
or<00:02:25.920> he'll<00:02:26.920> end<00:02:27.010> up<00:02:27.190> with<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.370> big<00:02:27.550> puddle<00:02:27.850> on<00:02:28.120> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
or he'll end up with a big puddle on the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.820 
or he'll end up with a big puddle on the
plate<00:02:28.569> so<00:02:28.840> we're<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.230> very<00:02:29.950> gently<00:02:31.830> coaxing

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
plate so we're just very gently coaxing

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.210 
plate so we're just very gently coaxing
it<00:02:32.890> over<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.370> edge<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:34.500> then<00:02:35.500> spreading<00:02:35.980> what

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
it over the edge and then spreading what

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.140 
it over the edge and then spreading what
comes<00:02:36.490> down<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:38.830> is<00:02:39.070> how<00:02:39.310> we'll<00:02:39.550> coat<00:02:39.880> this

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
comes down this is how we'll coat this

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.949 
comes down this is how we'll coat this
