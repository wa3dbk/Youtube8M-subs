actually<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> very<00:00:08.010> big<00:00:08.400> update<00:00:08.929> i<00:00:09.929> think<00:00:11.540> so

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
actually a very big update i think so

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.330 
actually a very big update i think so
anyways<00:00:12.870> when<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.049> add<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.500> um<00:00:13.679> when<00:00:14.250> you

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
anyways when you add it in um when you

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.910 
anyways when you add it in um when you
add<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:15.690> get<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:16.020> null<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.529> contains

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
add it in you get a null that contains

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.490 
add it in you get a null that contains
an<00:00:17.250> OLE<00:00:17.910> object<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.630> contains<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.140> control

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
an OLE object that contains the control

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.290 
an OLE object that contains the control
panel<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> steve<00:00:20.369> berg<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.210> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
panel and the steve berg and this is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.939 
panel and the steve berg and this is
because<00:00:21.600> since<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.170> control<00:00:22.560> panel<00:00:22.859> is

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
because since the control panel is

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.790 
because since the control panel is
pretty<00:00:23.220> big<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.460> bulky<00:00:24.260> you<00:00:25.260> probably<00:00:25.590> want

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
pretty big and bulky you probably want

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.410 
pretty big and bulky you probably want
to<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> different<00:00:26.730> place<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
to have it in a different place in the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.320 
to have it in a different place in the

the<00:00:38.129> changes<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> body<00:00:39.090> itself<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.190> has

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the changes on the body itself so it has

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.130 
the changes on the body itself so it has
a<00:00:41.489> new<00:00:41.760> type<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.030> Richard<00:00:42.450> bends<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.809> doesn't

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
a new type of Richard bends it doesn't

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.069 
a new type of Richard bends it doesn't
use<00:00:43.260> bull<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:44.610> very<00:00:45.059> similar<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.629> an

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
use bull it's I think very similar to an

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.490 
use bull it's I think very similar to an
itch<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.219> itch<00:00:47.480> Enosh<00:00:48.480> widgets<00:00:49.079> design

except<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.100> arm<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.460> arm<00:00:50.520> looks<00:00:50.760> pretty

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
except for the arm the arm looks pretty

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.299 
except for the arm the arm looks pretty
bad<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.260> something<00:00:52.469> I'll<00:00:52.710> improve<00:00:53.160> in

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
bad but it's something I'll improve in

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.180 
bad but it's something I'll improve in
an<00:00:53.460> instant<00:00:54.180> version<00:00:54.510> 6<00:00:54.800> also<00:00:55.800> sometimes

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
an instant version 6 also sometimes

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.580 
an instant version 6 also sometimes
they'll<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.059> any<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> joints<00:00:58.170> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
they'll do this in any of the joints you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.290 
they'll do this in any of the joints you
just<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> render<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.430> yeah<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.270> looks

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
just have to render it yeah and it looks

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.850 
just have to render it yeah and it looks
fun<00:01:01.489> also<00:01:02.780> same<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> legs<00:01:04.229> except<00:01:04.710> it's

much<00:01:05.220> much<00:01:06.030> better<00:01:06.540> than<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> arm<00:01:07.260> Bend<00:01:08.159> I

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
much much better than the arm Bend I

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.450 
much much better than the arm Bend I
think<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.170> don't<00:01:10.650> know<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.950> don't<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.280> know

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
think I don't know I don't really know

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.320 
think I don't know I don't really know

what happened to the arms and then um

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.980 
what happened to the arms and then um
you<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.420> you've<00:01:15.570> got<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.130> this<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.640> know

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
finger which I fingers which i think is

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520 
finger which I fingers which i think is
really<00:01:23.729> good<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.750> got<00:01:24.900> kind<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.409> same

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
really good it's got kind of the same

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.950 
really good it's got kind of the same
controls<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.250> switch<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.630> move<00:01:27.780> this

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
controls and switch but as you move this

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.810 
controls and switch but as you move this
up<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:29.100> opens<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.670> whole

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
up and it opens up this whole

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.380 
up and it opens up this whole
it's<00:01:31.390> UV<00:01:31.780> maps<00:01:32.729> correctly<00:01:33.729> so<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:33.970> has<00:01:34.150> the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
it's UV maps correctly so it has the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.240 
it's UV maps correctly so it has the
same<00:01:34.600> skin<00:01:34.930> tone<00:01:34.960> it's<00:01:35.380> actually<00:01:35.530> not<00:01:35.830> UV

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
same skin tone it's actually not UV

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.960 
same skin tone it's actually not UV
mapped<00:01:36.460> perfectly<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:39.040> sampling<00:01:39.729> from

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
mapped perfectly but it's sampling from

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.580 
mapped perfectly but it's sampling from
somewhere<00:01:40.360> around<00:01:40.479> here<00:01:40.720> so<00:01:41.260> you<00:01:41.350> need<00:01:41.500> to

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
somewhere around here so you need to

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.590 
somewhere around here so you need to
have<00:01:41.650> skins<00:01:42.040> with<00:01:42.340> pretty<00:01:42.700> low<00:01:43.150> cut<00:01:43.360> tee

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
have skins with pretty low cut tee

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.000 
have skins with pretty low cut tee
shirts<00:01:43.840> like<00:01:43.990> this<00:01:44.850> anyways<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:47.020> I<00:01:47.530> think<00:01:47.920> it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
shirts like this anyways it I think it

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.440 
shirts like this anyways it I think it
looks<00:01:48.040> really<00:01:48.550> nice<00:01:50.910> sometimes<00:01:51.910> like<00:01:52.150> I<00:01:52.300> said

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
looks really nice sometimes like I said

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.790 
looks really nice sometimes like I said
the<00:01:52.540> couch<00:01:52.720> is<00:01:52.840> not<00:01:52.960> like<00:01:53.080> that<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.440> just<00:01:53.500> need

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
the couch is not like that you just need

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.370 
the couch is not like that you just need
to<00:01:53.920> do<00:01:54.130> that<00:01:54.160> I<00:01:54.550> also<00:01:55.180> say<00:01:55.479> with<00:01:55.600> thumb<00:01:55.900> when

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
to do that I also say with thumb when

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.230 
to do that I also say with thumb when
you<00:01:56.470> move<00:01:56.619> this<00:01:56.740> down<00:01:56.979> it<00:01:57.220> when<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:57.850> move<00:01:58.090> it

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
you move this down it when you move it

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.660 
you move this down it when you move it
does<00:01:58.450> that<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:59.140> then<00:01:59.979> you<00:02:00.100> can<00:02:00.280> go<00:02:00.430> ahead<00:02:00.460> and

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
does that and then you can go ahead and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.760 
does that and then you can go ahead and
move<00:02:00.820> this<00:02:01.800> thumb<00:02:02.850> yeah<00:02:03.850> so<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.780> is<00:02:04.960> really

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
move this thumb yeah so this is really

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.779 
move this thumb yeah so this is really
nice<00:02:06.039> I<00:02:06.280> think<00:02:06.600> took<00:02:07.600> quite<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:07.869> while<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.080> make

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
nice I think took quite a while to make

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.640 
nice I think took quite a while to make
but<00:02:09.789> I<00:02:09.850> think<00:02:10.239> it's<00:02:10.390> definitely<00:02:10.570> worth<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.410> I

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
but I think it's definitely worth it I

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.229 
but I think it's definitely worth it I
think<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.489> looks<00:02:12.520> really<00:02:12.730> nice<00:02:15.239> also

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
think it looks really nice also

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.490 
think it looks really nice also

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
something that I entered on the right

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.990 
something that I entered on the right

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
it's animated uh yeah it works for every

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.280 
it's animated uh yeah it works for every
tool<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:32.620> it's<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:34.390> what<00:02:34.570> makes<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.989> rig<00:02:35.260> is

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
tool it it's it's what makes this rig is

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.259 
tool it it's it's what makes this rig is
laggy<00:02:35.680> as<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.370> mean<00:02:36.519> it's<00:02:36.640> not<00:02:36.760> too<00:02:37.030> laggy

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
laggy as it is I mean it's not too laggy

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.660 
laggy as it is I mean it's not too laggy
buts<00:02:37.690> its<00:02:38.200> MA<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.650> has<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:38.830> little<00:02:39.190> bit<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.430> lag

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
buts its MA it has a little bit of lag

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.550 
buts its MA it has a little bit of lag
that's<00:02:40.239> what<00:02:40.420> made<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.690> rig<00:02:40.840> laggy<00:02:41.080> all<00:02:41.320> those

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
that's what made the rig laggy all those

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.620 
that's what made the rig laggy all those
tools<00:02:41.799> I<00:02:42.160> also<00:02:43.000> you've<00:02:43.180> got<00:02:43.330> your<00:02:43.420> phone

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.600 

so<00:02:51.390> down<00:02:51.540> for<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.750> facial<00:02:52.170> expressions<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
so down for the facial expressions the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.310 
so down for the facial expressions the
facial<00:02:54.000> features<00:02:54.030> i<00:02:54.450> think<00:02:54.690> are<00:02:54.870> really<00:02:55.080> nice

um there's the left eye the right eye
and<00:03:01.130> then<00:03:02.130> both<00:03:02.370> eyes<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:04.460> believe<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.490> these

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
and then both eyes I believe that these

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.300 
and then both eyes I believe that these
two<00:03:06.810> are<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.290> scales<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.550> think<00:03:09.290> yep<00:03:10.310> and

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
two are the I scales I think yep and

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.520 
two are the I scales I think yep and
then<00:03:11.460> you<00:03:12.300> know<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.510> just<00:03:12.690> select<00:03:12.900> one<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.260> do

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
then you know you just select one and do

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.390 
then you know you just select one and do
it<00:03:14.570> yeah<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:15.870> think<00:03:16.080> that's<00:03:16.350> pretty<00:03:16.770> nice<00:03:17.010> and

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
then also the blink like so there's the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.250 
then also the blink like so there's the
math<00:03:26.070> position<00:03:28.610> story<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:30.600> mouth<00:03:30.870> open<00:03:31.230> and

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
math position story the mouth open and

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.570 
math position story the mouth open and
close<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:32.090> can<00:03:33.090> go<00:03:33.240> a<00:03:33.270> lot<00:03:33.540> thinner<00:03:34.440> than<00:03:34.860> yeah

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
close it can go a lot thinner than yeah

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.020 
close it can go a lot thinner than yeah
a<00:03:35.880> lot<00:03:36.090> narrower<00:03:36.560> then<00:03:37.560> my<00:03:37.800> old<00:03:37.980> math<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.790> my

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
a lot narrower then my old math and my

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.430 
a lot narrower then my old math and my
old<00:03:39.180> mouth<00:03:39.360> was<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:40.610> lot<00:03:41.610> wider<00:03:42.290> yeah<00:03:43.290> it's

pretty yes and also it's got I think
some<00:03:46.470> pretty<00:03:46.830> nice<00:03:47.010> expressions<00:03:47.640> them<00:03:48.290> kind

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
some pretty nice expressions them kind

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.110 
some pretty nice expressions them kind
of<00:03:49.320> like<00:03:49.440> garnish<00:03:49.710> wages<00:03:49.860> Riggs

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
of like garnish wages Riggs

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.140 
of like garnish wages Riggs
I<00:03:52.950> think<00:03:53.950> that's<00:03:54.069> pretty<00:03:54.250> nice<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:57.370> teeth<00:03:57.700> top

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
I think that's pretty nice the teeth top

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.270 
I think that's pretty nice the teeth top
and<00:03:58.360> bottom

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:12.240 

so<00:04:04.940> that's<00:04:05.090> nice<00:04:05.330> and<00:04:05.780> then<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:07.610> eyebrows<00:04:10.120> and

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
so that's nice and then the eyebrows and

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.300 
so that's nice and then the eyebrows and
the<00:04:13.250> eyebrows<00:04:13.819> rotate

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.020 

so<00:04:18.940> yeah<00:04:19.090> it's<00:04:19.269> pretty<00:04:19.419> cool<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:20.700> unlike<00:04:21.700> my

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
so yeah it's pretty cool and unlike my

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.810 
so yeah it's pretty cool and unlike my
old<00:04:22.440> control<00:04:23.440> panel<00:04:23.770> Steve<00:04:24.040> Rick<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.550> can

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
old control panel Steve Rick you can

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.020 
old control panel Steve Rick you can
move<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:25.480> control<00:04:25.870> panel<00:04:25.900> around<00:04:26.410> and

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
move this control panel around and

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.780 
move this control panel around and
rotate<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.480> it<00:04:28.840> works<00:04:29.139> perfect<00:04:30.100> because

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
rotate it and it works perfect because

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.090 
rotate it and it works perfect because
it<00:04:31.630> uses<00:04:31.930> them<00:04:33.450> it<00:04:34.450> uses<00:04:34.630> my<00:04:34.930> new<00:04:35.110> method<00:04:35.980> of

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
it uses them it uses my new method of

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.280 
it uses them it uses my new method of
object<00:04:36.550> user<00:04:36.790> data<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.480> one<00:04:37.750> that<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:37.930> made<00:04:38.169> the

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
object user data the one that I made the

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.670 
object user data the one that I made the
second<00:04:38.680> tutorial<00:04:38.800> on<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.570> it<00:04:40.570> works<00:04:40.750> really

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
second tutorial on and it works really

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.920 
second tutorial on and it works really
nicely<00:04:42.040> if<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:43.270> don't<00:04:43.419> want<00:04:43.570> to<00:04:43.630> see<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:43.840> you

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
nicely if you don't want to see it you

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.120 
nicely if you don't want to see it you
can<00:04:44.080> just<00:04:44.110> go<00:04:44.320> ahead<00:04:44.350> and<00:04:44.530> make<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:44.980> invisible

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
can just go ahead and make it invisible

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.180 
can just go ahead and make it invisible
an<00:04:45.430> editor<00:04:45.760> like<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.889> it's<00:04:47.889> invisible

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
an editor like so and it's invisible

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.830 
an editor like so and it's invisible
measure<00:04:50.760> if<00:04:51.760> you<00:04:51.880> don't<00:04:52.090> like<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.419> rim<00:04:52.600> then

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
measure if you don't like the rim then

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.940

so<00:04:53.470> be<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:53.760> also<00:04:54.760> there's<00:04:55.389> a<00:04:55.479> way<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:55.950> one

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
so be it also there's a way to one

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.090 
so be it also there's a way to one
second<00:04:58.320> there's<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.380> way<00:04:59.470> to<00:04:59.500> individually

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
second there's a way to individually

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.860 
second there's a way to individually
move<00:05:00.220> around<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.490> panels<00:05:00.880> you<00:05:01.419> just<00:05:01.660> go<00:05:01.780> ahead

you don't and you and if you're going to
use<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.760> control<00:05:22.120> panel<00:05:22.600> I<00:05:22.780> just<00:05:23.410> moved

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
use the control panel I just moved

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.080 
use the control panel I just moved
around<00:05:23.770> you're<00:05:24.340> going<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:24.550> want<00:05:24.640> to<00:05:24.729> click<00:05:24.880> the

around you're going to want to click the
lock<00:05:25.300> again<00:05:25.330> so<00:05:25.780> you<00:05:25.930> can't<00:05:26.200> select<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:27.400> rims

lock again so you can't select the rims

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.649 
lock again so you can't select the rims
just<00:05:29.200> to<00:05:29.289> make<00:05:29.410> it<00:05:29.500> a<00:05:29.590> lot<00:05:29.770> easier

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
just to make it a lot easier

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:35.559 
just to make it a lot easier
let's<00:05:32.659> see<00:05:32.900> what<00:05:33.199> else<00:05:33.229> do<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:33.680> have<00:05:34.539> also<00:05:35.539> I

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:35.569 
let's see what else do I have also I

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.230 
let's see what else do I have also I
used<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:36.110> have<00:05:36.289> the<00:05:36.919> ability<00:05:37.340> to<00:05:37.370> I<00:05:37.520> deform<00:05:38.180> the

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
used to have the ability to I deform the

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.999 
used to have the ability to I deform the
feet<00:05:38.629> sky<00:05:38.960> like<00:05:39.110> an<00:05:39.229> image<00:05:39.499> which<00:05:39.680> is<00:05:39.800> rigged

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
feet sky like an image which is rigged

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:41.619 
feet sky like an image which is rigged
actually<00:05:40.849> I<00:05:40.879> think<00:05:40.909> I<00:05:41.120> have<00:05:41.210> an<00:05:41.300> old<00:05:41.449> version

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:41.629 
actually I think I have an old version

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:43.839 
actually I think I have an old version
with<00:05:41.900> Steve<00:05:42.139> rig<00:05:42.349> set<00:05:42.650> actually<00:05:42.800> of<00:05:43.249> this<00:05:43.610> an

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
with Steve rig set actually of this an

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.050 
with Steve rig set actually of this an
older<00:05:44.210> version<00:05:44.360> of<00:05:44.599> this<00:05:44.749> that<00:05:45.729> actually<00:05:46.729> has

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
older version of this that actually has

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.739 
older version of this that actually has
that<00:05:47.539> maybe<00:05:48.529> it's<00:05:48.740> here<00:05:51.249> yes<00:05:52.249> okay<00:05:52.849> so<00:05:53.539> it<00:05:53.629> has

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:53.749 
that maybe it's here yes okay so it has

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:57.580 
that maybe it's here yes okay so it has
the<00:05:53.930> ability<00:05:54.319> to<00:05:54.349> D<00:05:54.650> formats<00:05:55.599> but<00:05:56.599> it<00:05:57.229> doesn't

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
the ability to D formats but it doesn't

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.279 
the ability to D formats but it doesn't
look<00:05:57.710> too<00:05:58.009> great<00:05:58.189> and<00:05:58.960> also<00:06:01.090> the<00:06:02.090> bones<00:06:02.419> adding

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
look too great and also the bones adding

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.439 
look too great and also the bones adding
those<00:06:03.439> phones<00:06:03.800> made<00:06:04.550> it<00:06:04.699> so<00:06:05.000> that<00:06:05.029> it<00:06:05.240> bends

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
those phones made it so that it bends

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.300 
those phones made it so that it bends
like<00:06:05.719> this<00:06:05.949> and<00:06:06.949> that<00:06:07.069> is<00:06:07.629> terrible<00:06:08.629> so<00:06:09.310> I'll

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
like this and that is terrible so I'll

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.029 
like this and that is terrible so I'll
add<00:06:10.699> the<00:06:11.150> ability<00:06:11.240> to<00:06:11.689> deform<00:06:12.080> these<00:06:12.229> probably

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
add the ability to deform these probably

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.879 
add the ability to deform these probably
and<00:06:13.400> Steve<00:06:13.699> reg<00:06:13.879> version<00:06:14.240> 6<00:06:14.479> um<00:06:14.870> I<00:06:16.539> wouldn't<00:06:17.539> i
