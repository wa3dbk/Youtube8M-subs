00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.410
 hello guys and girls today I'm going to 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.559
 teach how I made a boat 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.929
 diapers to give to a baby of 5 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.420
 months is an original gift is practical 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.830
 and I will show you how I said 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.830
 used a carton 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.820
 adhesive tape diapers gummies to make 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.750
 bracelets 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.720
 wooden sticks fishing line paper 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.550
 transparent cellophane and blue ribbon 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.960
 after two sizes and two colors 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.210
 various different funds 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.970
 First, let's take the 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:50.030
 diapers and we're going to roll them up rolled 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.160
 as you see putting it to hold them 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.739
 pretty 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.180
 and so we do is a lot of 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.579
 As I say, it's a five-month-old baby 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.129
 is already grown up is not a newborn 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.479
 if you do that to give some good 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.180
 born with diapers will be more 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:08.390
 tiny ones with which the boat will be more 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.630
 tiny and we will use more diapers 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.030
 but good the idea is that and then I've 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.070
 done and I've also taken Spain 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.260
 together as you see to make a roll that 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.850
 it gets bigger and this is will be 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.850
 or vivanco fireplace 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.640
 then the gummies equal and then to 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:34.130
 cover the rubber band because I put 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.130
 with a blue ribbon 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.060
 and this will be a chimney of my boat 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.569
 because it's a titanic type ship 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.640
 cruise and good but it will hold the 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:50.009
 chimney on slope a wooden stick and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.009
 then I have also taken a diaper 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.890
 just one roll I just put another 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.909
 stick taking care not to break the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.950
 bathroom 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.530
 good as you can see there are three chimneys with 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.530
 the stick and one and one only 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.840
 the carton of diapers good what 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.580
 it was not a promotion and it came in a 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.630
 cardboard, I used that cardboard 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.750
 I have assembled the box and reused it for 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.819
 to make the base of derivatives then 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.700
 Well, as you can see, I've put a ribbon 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.100
 adhesive around and then simply 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.430
 Well, I used as a base 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:34.530
 all around flat diapers us 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.340
 and that would be because it will be what the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.430
 water and bar waves 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.250
 I have put everything around and starting 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.830
 from there I'm going to put we're going to do is what 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.810
 which is the boat the time as we are going to 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.000
 make the front true as 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.450
 after putting together with loaves and 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.080
 foot 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.910
 It is not easy for us 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.370
 in the project 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.950
 if it's bursts to do it then it's 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.960
 more practical but good the idea is to put 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.690
 accompany a break roll and then 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:13.280
 two then three and then fourth 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.280
 and then the tour of 5 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.239
 you are putting us sometimes interspersed in 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.739
 the gaps and then when we have 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.420
 five from then on I've put 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.420
 seven rows of 5 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.000
 simply to shape the boat 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.200
 then as I tell you if they are faults of more 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.200
 little girls you can put much more 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.440
 and then to hold all this because I've 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.590
 position 1 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.810
 the careless with fishing line 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.710
 you can also put a rope if you do not 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.930
 you have a string does not matter 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.380
 and it does not squeeze but squeeze a lot 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.810
 ok I made a knot two knots for 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.280
 hold it and then you see inside that's why it has 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.140
 said with you learn a lot because then 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.730
 of being put all around back 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.690
 with the diaper 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.680
 in this way for him 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.680
 the ship's hull 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:25.849
 well the diapers all around and then 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.490
 I have put a tape that is for 100 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:31.039
 fishing line or rope with that I've 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.800
 said you can put because the point then 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.920
 with the tape this country 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.170
 after a tie 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.160
 then I have continued to get closer 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:46.040
 of the ship what the waves will be 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:51.100
 more diapers and then over 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.990
 the 41st place if they go from base to plane and 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.470
 then the rolls of assumptions of two 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.140
 in two 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.350
 Job see other gum together I 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:04.100
 put four packs of two and over 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:07.280
 another four packages three fingers and at 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.290
 final one just so it does not stick out 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.030
 and all this because I'm going to be 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.440
 then in a loop you put this ribbon 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.240
 I could put it before I put the 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.520
 rolls or after it does not matter 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.220
 and with another tape 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.879
 to be fastened all together undone 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.879
 arm 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.360
 there is what has been seen in profile or 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.810
 what is to see 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.480
 the small windows of the bank and then I have 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.340
 very narrow position wags 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.640
 I wanted to put four to be a 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.330
 titanic but it has not given me for good not 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.730
 it was pretty good then and then the one 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.140
 you're only on the roll just because 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.480
 of our two clubs because I was given 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.190
 account that one was not enough in the 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.320
 back where the flag will hang 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.420
 which is the flag because it is simply a 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.250
 swimsuit that I bought at duty in the 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.790
 part of the front we put the captain 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.130
 of the boat we put the name of the boat and 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.980
 of post even a mermaid 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.260
 for example in the water then you have left 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.730
 then put more gifts more products 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.820
 what you want where you want as 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.100
 you want with a gift and then the paper 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.680
 cellophane and another tie and well you already have 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.710
