00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and then the neck or the head itself is

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.190 
and then the neck or the head itself is
on<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> swivel<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.770> well<00:01:32.520> face<00:01:33.180> mask<00:01:33.479> pops<00:01:33.990> off

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.010 
on a swivel as well face mask pops off
way<00:01:34.470> too<00:01:34.530> easily<00:01:35.479> decent<00:01:36.479> paintwork<00:01:36.780> though

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
way too easily decent paintwork though

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.870 
way too easily decent paintwork though
there's<00:01:37.409> lots<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.740> little<00:01:37.890> details<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
there's lots of little details in the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
there's lots of little details in the
face<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.479> they<00:01:39.930> painted<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> mouth<00:01:40.619> part

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
face and they painted the mouth part

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.469 
face and they painted the mouth part
nicely<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.790> that's<00:01:41.970> okay

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
nicely so that's okay

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.539 
nicely so that's okay
I<00:01:42.509> don't<00:01:42.869> care<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.290> design<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
I don't care for the design but the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.550 
I don't care for the design but the
figure<00:01:44.790> itself<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.210> okay<00:01:45.570> shoulders<00:01:46.409> have

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
figure itself is okay shoulders have

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.370
