so go to mydish.com is that windows 8 and
then this is your account number.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:43.870
right here its usually a 8255909 number.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:53.170
so goto log in and out there.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:04.229
now it brings up where you enter your password
and we don't have one, we want to go to create

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:15.190
online id. now you are going to put in your
phone number or your 16 digit account number,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:34.229
now you create 
your id and password.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:02:04.240
it you have created the id and password it
will bring up 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.830
a screen that says success.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:37.350
you can now log in. and because the hopper
is already on your account and we have created

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.900
this and we have a online id and password.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.310
that all we have to do but if we log in here
were gonna be able to see what our billing

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.400
is and you can go in here and check and there
is a thing in here for referrals so if you

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.610
refer someone to us you need to get a club
dish number once you have one of those call

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.310
me with the club dish number and we hook them
up you get 5.00 off your bill a month for

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.680
10 months and they get 50 off their first
bill.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.600
so this is where you can manage everything.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.250
and if you are on a computer you can download
the dish anywhere stuff onto your computer

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:24.970
so you can watch live tv on your computer
from anywhere.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:34.180
so now download the dish anywhere app its
the red dish app. the first time you go into

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.319
this its gonna ask you for that online id
and password and as you can see it didn't

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.269
ask me for it because i'm already logged in.

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:51.540
its hooked up to my hopper in the showroom
there so if i click on something just like

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.489
i'm sitting in front of the tv. i hit watch
and then watch on this device.

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:05.480
then it synced up to the hopper in the office
and sends video over ip. so if you were to

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.879
download this app on your smart phone this
is exactly what you would see and now i'm

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:21.160
watchin tv. the laptop didn't do the whole
app download its not a app its a download

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.490
onto your computer if you wanted to watch
it on a computer like i have some customers

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.490
that live in japan for a few months a year
so they watch tv on their computer because

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.280
there is nothing more than bbc america there.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.500
so they have a hopper with sling here at their
house and watch all their tv on their laptop.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.780
and if you wanted to do that you would have
to do this and it will ask you to do a download

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.889
at some point.

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:53.940
but when you do a smartphone or tablet it
just uses the app.
