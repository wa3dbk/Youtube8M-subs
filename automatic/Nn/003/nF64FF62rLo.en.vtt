00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.450
 hello, I'm daniel and invest silver 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.759
 puntocom in this video we will compare 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.850
 the gold with the silver that is better 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.160
 invest in gold or invest in silver the 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.720
 short answer is silver 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.539
 I think investing in silver is better 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.939
 invest in gold however the gold 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.800
 it's not a bad investment either 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.050
 prognosis is that the value of gold 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.659
 will increase ten times if you invest a thousand 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.060
 dollars in gold now you will get 10,000 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.640
 dollars workouts but if you invest 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.680
 in silver it will increase your wealth 60 times 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.680
 that is if you invest a thousand dollars now 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.970
 you will get 60 thousand dollars this for 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.100
 course according to what I 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.410
 I investigated but of course you have 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.150
 the last word but why why 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.430
 is this because silver will rise more than 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.560
 value silver has two characteristics 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.780
 that gold does not have the silver 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.210
 will increase more value in the first place 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.580
 there is a shortage of silver while there is no 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.530
 shortage of gold every time there is less silver 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.620
 in the world while every time there is 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.450
 more gold in the world silver is scarce 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.610
 because silver always ends in a 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.990
 trash can silver is used to make TV 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.990
 stable cell 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.060
 computers and so on and all those things 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.369
 sooner or later they always end up 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.040
 some dumpster nobody recycles silver or 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.009
 almost nobody recycles silver because it is not 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.899
 profitable recycle it and this does not happen with 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.880
 gold gold is always stored in 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.009
 somewhere in the form of ingots 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.470
 in some central bank or in the form of 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.030
 jewelry in someone's house and 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.610
 although sometimes also used the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.020
 silver to make jewelry or ingots the 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.729
 truth is that in most cases 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.799
 Silver is used as raw material for 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.049
 different industries and as I said 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.569
 previously they always end in something 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.369
 more southerly and another advantage that the 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.259
 silver and that does not have gold is that the 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.470
 Silver is used for different industries 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.080
 silver has an objective value the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.000
 Silver is worth because it has a function 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.159
 Gold is worth it because I will be pretty 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.229
 say the value of gold depends on the 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.840
 people perceived the value of the 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.539
 Silver is an objective value depends on your 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.250
 function in different industries the 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.319
 point is that both silver and gold 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.119
 they are excellent investments my 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.250
 recommendation is invest in silver 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.569
 especially if you are a class person 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.450
 mean so to speak 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.859
 if you are a person who has not know their 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.620
 savings of one thousand dollars two thousand two thousand 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:21.260
 dollars ten thousand dollars 30 thousand dollars 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.749
 50 thousand dollars I recommend you 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.269
 you invest 100% in bullion and coins 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:28.129
 of silver and so you have millions 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.930
 combine software diversifies mind 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.819
 convert one part into silver and another 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.340
 part of the gold but at least I 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.069
