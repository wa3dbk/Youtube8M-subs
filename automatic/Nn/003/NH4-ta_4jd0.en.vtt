00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
doubles as they stand with three viewing

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.999

so<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.220> not<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.030> sturdy<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> does

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
so it's not on that sturdy and it does

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.950 
so it's not on that sturdy and it does
fall<00:01:22.470> quite<00:01:22.830> easily<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.720> something

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
