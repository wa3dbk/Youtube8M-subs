00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 and 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.420
 and 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.360
 Hello friends, today we are going to cook 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.850
 Some octopus with onion is a very 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.770
 easy to prepare the only thing that requires 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.390
 it's a little bit of patience when it comes to 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.530
 serve it to make this point 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.920
 we will need the following 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.940
 ingredients 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.940
 some octopuses 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.250
 onion 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.510
 olive oil salt and pepper now what 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.579
 first thing we're going to do and I'm going to 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.629
 teach how pulpits are cleaned 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.400
 because we have to empty 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.890
 I explain 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.430
 we take the octopus 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.990
 we will turn the head without 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.180
 fear 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:07.560
 and now we have to take it 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.560
 all this part 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.000
 and this we are going to cut 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.460
 We cut the 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.530
 we are making progress 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.840
 and we turn you around 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.429
 we cut what the eyes are 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.330
 here you have to be careful 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:35.840
 because this 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.840
 many times they splash the other eye 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.409
 and it breaks 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.280
 and we will take it away too 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.280
 and then the tentacles 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.880
 what I think is the mouth but not 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.880
 I'm sure 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:59.890
 the onion we cut it to juliana 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.960
 if thin, do not be scared though 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.170
 you see that there is a lot of onion but if it comes out 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.619
 much tastier octopus and now we're going 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.619
 To do it 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.340
 we light the fire we are going to put 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:20.150
 pretty olive oil 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.150
 and then we throw to the points 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.159
 at the moment only the points 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.910
 when we change color then we 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.260
 we will put the onion 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.210
 we'll try and let's make a 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.600
 bit 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.730
 the fire is low so that it goes 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.620
 taking the color and do not stay 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.130
 I change the color 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.130
 rosebush 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.050
 and they have all taken the pink color 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.670
 Now let's raise the fire a little 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.620
 so that the water goes away and now the 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.380
 octopuses release machado and before 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.120
 put onion is better than not us 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.120
 be sung 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.560
 now we are going to take the onion 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.879
 we will be removing it so that we go 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.879
 having everything 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.370
 we will do some laps 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.060
 we do not want the fire and in low other 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.310
 time 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.260
 and we will take 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.790
 in a little bit we will put the 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.660
 pepper when she is more I 'm going to 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.660
 a little bigger 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.120
 to the past and about 10 minutes and you see the 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.030
 onion and has dropped a lot of volume 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.270
 and it's going to be soft now we're going 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.130
 to take the pepper 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.130
 the salt we will throw at the end 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.060
 we will cover it again and we will leave it 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.060
 go chubut 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.850
 the bodies have been cooking for 45 minutes 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.350
 with onion has almost almost disappeared 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.110
 we will see a little water 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.040
 so that it counts better if the water 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.520
 you can put hot 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.180
 and you are adding it as you see 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.180
 what is necessary 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.380
 now she 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.220
 is the point very soft is the moment 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.220
 to put the salt 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.010
 and leave it we'll give you a couple of 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.680
 turns and we'll let you do a couple 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.360
 more minutes 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.360
 so that the salt is well integrated 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.750
 good friends, we already have 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:12.720
 prepared our delicious dish 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.150
 octopus with onions this dish i os 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.210
 I advise if you can do it the day 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.010
 previous is much better because the 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.960
 flavors are concentrated and then 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.360
 time to go and take it, you just have to 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.810
 heat it always with very fire 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.810
 slowly 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.129
 I hope you like bon appetit
