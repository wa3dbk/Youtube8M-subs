00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.840
 heil hello everyone welcome for 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.130
 a new video on call of duty 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.130
 advanced warfare today we're going 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.410
 to speak of lavery jo so of l'albera 3 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.300
 April gijoe versus insanity the goal of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.530
 this video is not of course 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.910
 will tell you the infiniti she is too 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.260
 well and everything and everything since that all the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.820
 world knows it clean serenity and well 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.770
 better not much better is better 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.060
 that the true jo the goal is especially of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.980
 put a little in front of the real doe 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.529
 to say to those who do not have the INSEE 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.480
 initiation it is not necessarily a big 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.640
 big problem certainly you're going to be in 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.679
 has a disadvantage against an infiniti 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.309
 if you do not have it but the real jo 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.320
 is still 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.399
 it is still largely on the road 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.559
 I'll see you in this video 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.790
 so before starting this episode 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.460
 focus I wanted to thank 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.870
 especially mr crazy who like you 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.370
 have surely noticed in the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.090
 last video redone me all the design 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.289
 chain 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.489
 I had you who I like a lot 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.480
 so I do not know if you there you 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.980
 please do not hesitate to tell me one 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.420
 message do not hesitate to tell me but 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.610
 if you tell me that you do not like it 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.539
 it's not going to change so that's it 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.829
 but me it pleases me so it's 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.570
 rather nice so if you want 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.100
 to see go see his work 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.539
 do not hesitate I want to put his link 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.600
 to his twitter and youtube 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.250
 in the description and in annotations and 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.420
 at the level of the gameplay level at 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.950
 level of gameplay it's a part that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.659
 is going to be monstrous since it's going to be 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.640
 simply the part in which 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.310
 I will make the points record 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.420
 1 my points record simply 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.740
 because you will see that I do it 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.090
 just in the first run I'm going 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.439
 to make more than 10000 points 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.820
 unfortunately it was not so 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.720
 far in the second run so I do not 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.490
 do not know how far I will leave you 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.350
 the gameplay but 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.119
 I did more than 16000 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.259
 points in all in this part what 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.090
 is still huge 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.810
 so now let's talk about other 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.130
 because we are not here to 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.840
 talk about the east part of the gameplay on 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.420
 is there to talk about the average joe and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.009
 of infiniti and all simply 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.270
 we'll start talking about guys like 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.080
 usually then both men do 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.039
 exactly the same damage to 30 40 33 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.409
 25 red parades already starting 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.840
 to confuse me 40 33 25 for the damage 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.009
 average joe and infiniti is where that 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.600
 change it's going to be at the door level 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.280
 and since the portela average joe is going 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.709
 be slightly higher because it 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.659
 brought max will go from 43 meters to 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.399
 50 meters including 43 meters for INSEE 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.530
 nitties and 50 for the average joe which 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.299
 is still a little boost enough 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.429
 friendly but who is not who is not 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.440
 not really changing that's not what 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.819
 every tear will change all of the true 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.009
 jo since making shots over 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.299
 43 m really need to really want it 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.560
 go in the sniper corridors must 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.120
 really be sure riot is drawn to 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.470
 the other end of the map to make 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.120
 pulls over 43 meters you go 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.010
 not really see the advantage of 7 this 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.480
 bonus to wear unfortunately then 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.709
 there by cons there is where he goes there 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.030
 have a little problem at the level of 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.860
 true jo it's at the level of cadence 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.019
 of course since the pace of the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.060
 true jo is at 857 on the first 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.650
 bullets and goes down to 625 thereafter 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.420
 while that of nine is initiated at 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.519
 1000 on the first balls and goes down 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.049
 at 750 thereafter which makes that 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.250
 the INSEE initiated has the big advantage of 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.320
 shoot much faster and you 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.299
 will be much more effective at 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.130
 short range then the disadvantage that 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.810
 it's having a bigger fatter 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.250
 cadence and that the recoil is going to feel a 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.489
 little more since the more you shoot 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.500
 quick 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.910
 well it makes you shoot faster 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.680
 that makes the army go down less 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.030
 quickly if we can say that like that so 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.560
 inevitably you will have a recoil that 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.620
 is going to be a little bit higher on 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.060
 the initiatory insee but it's sure that it's worth 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.859
 outright the blow of having more than 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.970
 pace rather than having a tiny 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.230
 little less hindsight but it's true that 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.640
 the real jo will have less trouble doing 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.230
 shots from afar that the insee nitti that 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.760
 it's something to know too, and 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.470
 more with his bonus to wear it's true 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.069
 that it's rather it's rather 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.019
 nice 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.100
 so then at the level of accuracy 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.750
 to judge this is the last 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.400
 this is the last point that has to 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.230
 these two weapons since the real jo to a 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.209
 20 % penalty to the judge and 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.190
 while infiniti has a penalty that 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.329
 of 10% and it is clear that there we see 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.590
 right now that the real joke is 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.150
 rather done for the long-range and 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.139
 and then the insiders rather made for the 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.930
 short to medium range 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.329
 but still I have to tell you that the 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.169
 true joker is very very very good 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.260
 remains a very good weapon all 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.700
 simply because she has the same 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.290
 clean damage bonus means you 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.030
 go kill in case of maximum ball 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.549
 no matter which one you wear it to 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.079
 go draw that is to say that in fact the 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.250
 radio l incentive you're going to kill in 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.319
 three brooms in case of ball exactly 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.860
 to even wear that it's really the very 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.110
 good thing 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.629
 the pace they unfortunately it's 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.769
 really that does anyway that 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.150
 tunis enit is much better this is his 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.250
 cadence and that's the only thing 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.500
 literally that's the only thing that 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.940
 you lose when you use the 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.190
 true joke compared to the insee nitti 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.840
 stella cadente you lose pretty much 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.099
 you lose nothing else because 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.390
 that honestly the accuracy to the judge and 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.609
 I think we can do without one know 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.829
 not if you shoot if you judge 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.030
 with one with an atrocious br 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.500
 did not necessarily understand how 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.970
 the art market because it's clear that 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.289
 it's really assault rifles that is 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.329
 rather an assault rifle details 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.370
 it's not an assault rifle you 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.870
 will use to make shots at 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.400
 judged as a machine gun for example 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.260
 it is clear that we will have to aim with 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.990
 this assault rifle but it's really 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.160
 it's really the only thing you 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.539
 will lose between the two is the 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.370
 cadence so if you do not have the INSEE 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.389
 nittis a whore that's twenty prestige 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.060
 that I passed I always pale 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.560
 insanity stuff honestly if you 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.060
 have not tested laundry jo you have 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.160
 missed something because the real jo 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.680
 is really excellent at this level 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.729
 it's really the only little thing 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.870
 lindsay's sister does not hold everything 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.370
 it's just the little sister of 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.690
 lindsay nor guy is the only thing that 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.460
 you will lose there you know the pace 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.199
 and she really really went really 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.400
 very good so that's start I hope 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.810
 that you enjoyed the perco view 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.070
 to appreciate the gameplay I 'm not going to 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.389
 put until the end I put you the 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.800
 little final score anyway 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.389
 to show you how far it has been 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.220
 it is true that it was very very far 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.419
 but good on this score that you have 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.530
 appreciated I wanted it's the effect rod 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.699
 wished as usual a good 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.080
 day and a good evening and then we 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.349
 find yourself next time go 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.349
 ciao 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.240
 again
