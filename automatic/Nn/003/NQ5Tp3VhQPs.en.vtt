the inspired miniature his Reaper I gave
him<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.060> much<00:02:00.840> bigger<00:02:01.170> base<00:02:02.810> by<00:02:03.810> using<00:02:04.200> quote

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
him a much bigger base by using quote

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.030 
him a much bigger base by using quote
plates<00:02:05.100> and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
plates and

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:14.370 
plates and
I<00:02:06.930> covered<00:02:07.930> this<00:02:08.170> with<00:02:09.630> modeling<00:02:10.630> paste<00:02:13.380> this

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
I covered this with modeling paste this

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.810 
I covered this with modeling paste this
parts<00:02:14.830> here<00:02:15.190> are<00:02:15.750> leftovers<00:02:16.750> from<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.820> dryads

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.680 
parts here are leftovers from the dryads
kid<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:21.340> think<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.660> quite<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.230> fitting

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
kid and I think that is quite a fitting

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.780 
kid and I think that is quite a fitting
surrounding<00:02:25.690> area<00:02:26.080> for<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:26.860> guy<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:28.770> yeah

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790

this year our testing models to find a

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.410 
this year our testing models to find a
proper<00:02:33.280> color<00:02:33.940> scheme<00:02:34.300> for<00:02:34.780> him<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:36.310> for<00:02:36.880> the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
proper color scheme for him and for the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.240 
proper color scheme for him and for the
next<00:02:37.540> one<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:39.820> one<00:02:40.060> here<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:42.040> also

next one this one here this is also

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.960 
next one this one here this is also
under<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.760> conversion<00:02:44.370> mainly<00:02:45.370> parts<00:02:45.760> from

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
under the conversion mainly parts from
