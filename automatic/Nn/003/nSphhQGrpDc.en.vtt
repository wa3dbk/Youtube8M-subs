00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
like that and if you're in rough terrain

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.109 
like that and if you're in rough terrain
you<00:01:30.720> will<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.200> drive<00:01:32.040> forward<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.790> bit<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
you will have to drive forward a bit and

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:46.270 
you will have to drive forward a bit and
then<00:01:33.570> reverse<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.770> unpacked<00:01:35.460> properly

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:55.940

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
as you can see when you unpack it it is

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.100 
as you can see when you unpack it it is
trying<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:57.050> unpack<00:01:58.050> itself<00:01:58.259> but<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.250> only<00:02:00.110> has

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
trying to unpack itself but it only has

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.169 
trying to unpack itself but it only has
such<00:02:01.530> little<00:02:01.740> pushing<00:02:02.340> power<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.910> you<00:02:03.030> have

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
such little pushing power that you have

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.980 
such little pushing power that you have
to<00:02:03.390> drive<00:02:04.080> forward<00:02:04.410> of<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:06.330> help<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
to drive forward of it to help it to

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:17.140 
to drive forward of it to help it to
extend<00:02:11.329> and<00:02:13.280> this<00:02:14.280> other<00:02:14.459> truck<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.660> the

straight<00:04:27.510> like<00:04:27.960> this<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:30.450> same<00:04:30.660> goes<00:04:30.900> for

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
straight like this and the same goes for

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:39.680 
straight like this and the same goes for
the<00:04:32.220> long<00:04:32.700> lock<00:04:32.910> trailer<00:04:37.850> as<00:04:38.850> you<00:04:39.390> can<00:04:39.540> see

there's no arrow window or anything and
from<00:04:48.900> this<00:04:49.230> angle<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.860> hope<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:50.640> can<00:04:50.790> see<00:04:51.060> that

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
from this angle I hope you can see that

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.760 
from this angle I hope you can see that
the<00:04:51.890> trailer<00:04:52.890> it<00:04:53.430> is<00:04:53.490> not<00:04:53.820> flat<00:04:54.720> but<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.590> is

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
the trailer it is not flat but it is

the trailer it is not flat but it is
straight

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
straight

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.950 
straight
compared<00:04:58.620> to<00:04:58.950> my<00:04:59.669> trunk

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.970 

and<00:05:05.300> after<00:05:06.300> that<00:05:06.480> you<00:05:06.660> just<00:05:06.840> click<00:05:07.100> load<00:05:08.100> up<00:05:08.280> oh

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
and after that you just click load up oh

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.490 
and after that you just click load up oh
dear<00:05:10.980> that's<00:05:11.340> kind<00:05:11.640> of<00:05:11.700> heavy<00:05:12.350> yeah

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
dear that's kind of heavy yeah

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.670 
dear that's kind of heavy yeah
so<00:05:13.620> these<00:05:13.770> are<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.070> long<00:05:14.250> locks<00:05:15.380> now<00:05:16.380> let's

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
so these are the long locks now let's

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:32.390 
so these are the long locks now let's
load<00:05:17.280> up<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:18.680> medium<00:05:19.680> locks<00:05:31.010> yeah<00:05:32.010> it's<00:05:32.250> going

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
load up the medium locks yeah it's going

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.820 
load up the medium locks yeah it's going
to<00:05:32.460> be<00:05:32.580> kind<00:05:32.850> of<00:05:32.940> hard<00:05:33.210> to<00:05:33.480> move<00:05:34.200> forward<00:05:34.650> with

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
to be kind of hard to move forward with

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.290 
to be kind of hard to move forward with
these<00:05:35.090> and<00:05:37.040> another<00:05:38.040> point<00:05:38.310> of<00:05:38.460> confusion<00:05:38.850> is

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
these and another point of confusion is

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:49.550 
these and another point of confusion is
the<00:05:39.720> crane<00:05:46.490> when<00:05:47.490> you<00:05:47.550> start<00:05:47.790> your<00:05:47.940> engine<00:05:48.560> you

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
the crane when you start your engine you

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.340 
the crane when you start your engine you
will<00:05:49.710> get<00:05:49.860> these<00:05:50.100> different<00:05:50.840> options<00:05:51.840> like

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
will get these different options like

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.130 
will get these different options like
mechanism<00:05:52.950> crane

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
mechanism crane

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.310 
mechanism crane
this<00:05:55.140> lets<00:05:55.500> you<00:05:55.770> move<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:56.669> crane<00:05:57.080> with<00:05:58.080> the

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
this lets you move the crane with the

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.540 
this lets you move the crane with the
driving<00:05:59.010> buttons<00:05:59.430> that<00:05:59.789> would<00:05:59.940> be<00:06:01.310> lost

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
driving buttons that would be lost

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:10.230 
driving buttons that would be lost
qe<00:06:03.150> or<00:06:03.419> Anki

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:18.070 

now<00:06:13.389> you<00:06:14.389> can<00:06:14.960> only<00:06:15.289> use<00:06:16.099> the<00:06:16.280> crane<00:06:16.870> to<00:06:17.870> pick

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
now you can only use the crane to pick

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.929 
now you can only use the crane to pick
up<00:06:18.289> logs<00:06:18.620> that<00:06:19.580> you<00:06:19.879> have<00:06:20.210> dropped<00:06:21.729> what<00:06:22.729> are

00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:22.939 
up logs that you have dropped what are

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:25.089 
up logs that you have dropped what are
the<00:06:23.210> logs<00:06:23.479> that<00:06:23.659> you<00:06:23.840> have<00:06:23.990> propped<00:06:24.289> well

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
the logs that you have propped well

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:28.270 
the logs that you have propped well
basically<00:06:25.780> if<00:06:26.780> you<00:06:26.960> flip<00:06:27.199> a<00:06:27.229> trailer<00:06:27.650> and<00:06:27.979> your

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
basically if you flip a trailer and your

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:39.629 
basically if you flip a trailer and your
load<00:06:29.770> is<00:06:30.770> lost<00:06:31.189> or<00:06:32.860> you<00:06:35.530> click<00:06:36.530> this<00:06:36.710> drop<00:06:37.039> load

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:46.469 

you<00:06:40.639> can't<00:06:40.940> use<00:06:41.330> it<00:06:41.539> to<00:06:41.810> for<00:06:42.379> example<00:06:42.500> pick<00:06:43.159> up

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.219 

those<00:06:47.949> not<00:06:48.949> possible<00:06:49.509> those<00:06:50.509> piles<00:06:50.870> they're

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:51.229 
those not possible those piles they're

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:57.459 
those not possible those piles they're
just<00:06:51.469> basically<00:06:51.889> static<00:06:53.319> and<00:06:55.840> you<00:06:56.840> can't<00:06:57.139> even

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:57.469 
just basically static and you can't even

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:04.930 
just basically static and you can't even
pick<00:06:57.800> up<00:06:57.979> those<00:06:59.379> fallen<00:07:00.379> trees<00:07:00.620> over<00:07:01.430> here<00:07:03.940> not

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940 
pick up those fallen trees over here not

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.999 
pick up those fallen trees over here not
possible<00:07:05.479> at<00:07:06.409> least<00:07:06.469> in<00:07:06.740> the<00:07:06.860> current

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:07.009 
possible at least in the current

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.129 
possible at least in the current
spintires<00:07:07.610> version<00:07:08.090> like<00:07:08.210> I<00:07:08.419> mean<00:07:08.719> I've<00:07:08.870> tried

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
spintires version like I mean I've tried

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:16.749 
spintires version like I mean I've tried
and<00:07:09.439> tried<00:07:09.500> but<00:07:09.680> it's<00:07:10.069> not<00:07:10.250> possible<00:07:15.729> so<00:07:16.729> let's

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 
and tried but it's not possible so let's

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:23.130 
and tried but it's not possible so let's
just<00:07:17.210> pack<00:07:17.870> this<00:07:18.050> all<00:07:18.229> up

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.070 

now<00:07:24.140> I<00:07:24.200> hope<00:07:24.620> this<00:07:24.860> cleared<00:07:25.310> up<00:07:25.490> some<00:07:25.730> things

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 
now I hope this cleared up some things

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.140 
now I hope this cleared up some things
for<00:07:27.080> you<00:07:27.290> and<00:07:27.820> my<00:07:28.820> next<00:07:29.180> video<00:07:29.330> I<00:07:30.430> am<00:07:31.430> going<00:07:32.030> to

is the plains map on hardcore mode I
have<00:07:51.800> done<00:07:51.980> a<00:07:52.010> little<00:07:52.810> pre-planning<00:07:53.810> I've

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:54.760 
have done a little pre-planning I've

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.630 
have done a little pre-planning I've
