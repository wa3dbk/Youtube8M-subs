did you left that team thought the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.570

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
future of the team was really unstable

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.300 
future of the team was really unstable
in<00:02:56.970> Keeper<00:02:57.480> Rapanos<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.709> then<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.920> got<00:02:59.070> offer

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
in Keeper Rapanos and then I got offer

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.660 
in Keeper Rapanos and then I got offer
from<00:02:59.700> no<00:03:00.450> toy<00:03:00.630> hunter<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.190> think

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
from no toy hunter and that's I think

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.310 
from no toy hunter and that's I think
it's<00:03:02.970> much<00:03:03.090> better<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.480> be<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.690> full<00:03:03.930> Swedish

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
it's much better to be a full Swedish

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.380 
it's much better to be a full Swedish
team<00:03:04.500> as<00:03:04.620> well<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.310> thought<00:03:05.489> like<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.030> team

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
team as well and I thought like the team

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.750 
team as well and I thought like the team
and<00:03:06.570> more<00:03:06.750> potential<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.380> become<00:03:07.560> good<00:03:07.890> and

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
and more potential to become good and

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.430 
and more potential to become good and
yeah<00:03:08.910> in<00:03:09.090> then<00:03:09.360> was<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.750> right<00:03:09.989> decision

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
yeah in then was the right decision

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.580 
yeah in then was the right decision
so<00:03:11.180> no<00:03:12.180> toy<00:03:12.360> hunter<00:03:12.690> asked<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.440> play

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
so no toy hunter asked you to play

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.310 
so no toy hunter asked you to play
together<00:03:13.739> here<00:03:14.070> yeah<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:15.209> when<00:03:16.200> they're

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.200 
want to play all teams in the tournament
and<00:06:17.789> beat<00:06:17.910> them<00:06:18.090> but<00:06:18.720> I<00:06:18.990> think<00:06:19.350> virtus<00:06:19.740> Pro<00:06:19.950> is

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
and beat them but I think virtus Pro is

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.969 
and beat them but I think virtus Pro is
strong<00:06:21.210> a<00:06:21.240> team<00:06:21.510> so<00:06:21.810> I<00:06:21.840> think<00:06:21.960> they<00:06:22.229> would<00:06:22.380> come

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
strong a team so I think they would come

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:24.040 
strong a team so I think they would come
out<00:06:23.039> ahead

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
out ahead

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.650 
out ahead
