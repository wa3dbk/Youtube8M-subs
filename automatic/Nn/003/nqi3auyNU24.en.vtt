regularly<00:05:35.240> when<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.330> soy<00:05:36.540> was<00:05:36.870> black<00:05:37.140> that

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
regularly when the soy was black that

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.290 
regularly when the soy was black that
means<00:05:37.560> it's<00:05:37.710> already<00:05:38.070> water<00:05:38.370> when<00:05:39.060> it's<00:05:39.210> a

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
means it's already water when it's a

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.510 
means it's already water when it's a
light<00:05:39.540> brown<00:05:39.900> that<00:05:40.290> means<00:05:40.530> that<00:05:40.920> you<00:05:41.160> need<00:05:41.370> to

light brown that means that you need to

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.580 
light brown that means that you need to
water<00:05:41.730> it<00:05:41.880> if<00:05:42.180> you<00:05:42.900> don't<00:05:43.020> water<00:05:43.350> it<00:05:43.470> regularly

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590
