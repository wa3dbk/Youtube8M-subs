got home it was time to design the quilt
I<00:03:52.400> played<00:03:53.400> around<00:03:53.640> with<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.909> design<00:03:54.360> for<00:03:54.720> many

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
I played around with a design for many

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.740 
I played around with a design for many
many<00:03:55.110> weeks<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.829> eventually<00:03:56.549> came<00:03:57.299> up<00:03:57.540> with

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
many weeks and eventually came up with

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.800 
many weeks and eventually came up with
my<00:03:57.959> five<00:03:58.260> big<00:03:58.620> trees<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.340> smaller<00:04:00.209> tree<00:04:00.569> in<00:04:00.689> the

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
my five big trees a smaller tree in the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.259 
my five big trees a smaller tree in the
distance<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.530> then<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.310> really<00:04:02.670> small<00:04:02.970> ones

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
distance and then the really small ones

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.069 
distance and then the really small ones
right<00:04:04.079> on<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.530> horizon<00:04:04.829> line<00:04:05.359> which<00:04:06.359> give<00:04:06.989> you

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
right on the horizon line which give you

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.319 
right on the horizon line which give you
the<00:04:07.200> feeling<00:04:07.409> I<00:04:07.739> think<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.609> you<00:04:08.730> can<00:04:08.940> step

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
the feeling I think that you can step

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.979 
the feeling I think that you can step
into<00:04:09.599> the<00:04:09.840> quilt<00:04:10.940> most<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.239> fabrics<00:04:12.750> in

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
into the quilt most of the fabrics in

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.530 
into the quilt most of the fabrics in
the<00:04:13.560> background<00:04:14.099> we're<00:04:14.760> pieces<00:04:15.269> that<00:04:15.450> I

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
the background we're pieces that I

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.080 
the background we're pieces that I
painted<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.380> then<00:04:16.949> I<00:04:16.979> cut<00:04:17.639> them<00:04:17.789> up<00:04:17.910> into

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
painted and then I cut them up into

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.250 
painted and then I cut them up into
diamonds<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:19.430> particularly<00:04:20.430> enjoyed

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
diamonds I particularly enjoyed

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.379 
diamonds I particularly enjoyed
constructing<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.380> trees<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:23.070> loved<00:04:23.760> using<00:04:24.060> all

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
constructing the trees I loved using all

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.110 
constructing the trees I loved using all
the<00:04:24.539> different<00:04:24.870> patterns<00:04:25.289> I<00:04:25.850> kept<00:04:26.850> quite

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
the different patterns I kept quite

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.719 
the different patterns I kept quite
strictly<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.900> my<00:04:28.050> color<00:04:28.350> scheme<00:04:28.639> although<00:04:29.639> it

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
strictly to my color scheme although it

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.240 
strictly to my color scheme although it
was<00:04:29.850> tempting<00:04:30.389> to<00:04:30.630> keep<00:04:31.080> adding<00:04:31.410> more<00:04:31.440> color<00:04:31.830> I

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
was tempting to keep adding more color I

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.879 
was tempting to keep adding more color I
was<00:04:33.030> very<00:04:33.300> aware<00:04:33.510> of<00:04:33.750> where<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.680> light<00:04:34.860> was

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
was very aware of where the light was

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.330 
was very aware of where the light was
coming<00:04:35.190> from<00:04:35.729> and<00:04:36.320> how<00:04:37.320> that<00:04:37.380> affected<00:04:38.280> the

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
coming from and how that affected the

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.570 
coming from and how that affected the
colors<00:04:38.990> trying<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.260> keep<00:04:40.530> one<00:04:40.979> side<00:04:41.280> much

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
colors trying to keep one side much

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.140 
colors trying to keep one side much
darker<00:04:42.440> for<00:04:43.440> each<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.770> these<00:04:43.919> segments<00:04:44.669> they

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
darker for each of these segments they

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.360 
darker for each of these segments they
were<00:04:45.210> made<00:04:45.539> individually<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:46.800> then<00:04:46.860> I

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
were made individually and then I

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.400 
were made individually and then I
applicate<00:04:47.970> them<00:04:48.150> back<00:04:48.300> together<00:04:48.510> so<00:04:49.199> it<00:04:49.289> was

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
applicate them back together so it was

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.320 
applicate them back together so it was
much<00:04:49.650> easier<00:04:49.979> to<00:04:50.490> fit<00:04:50.639> them<00:04:50.789> underneath<00:04:51.090> the

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
much easier to fit them underneath the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.040 
much easier to fit them underneath the
sewing<00:04:51.660> machine<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:53.490> bottom<00:04:54.300> part<00:04:54.690> of<00:04:54.870> this

were from my daughter's dresses and once
again<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:02.099> painted<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.210> fabrics<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.990> get<00:05:04.139> them

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
again I painted the fabrics to get them
