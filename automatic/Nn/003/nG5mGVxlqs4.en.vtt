00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
big machine that's churning away we set

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.910 
big machine that's churning away we set
out<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.420> build<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:37.200> building<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.739> really

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
out to build a building that really

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
the organization's DNA and I think we've

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.979 
the organization's DNA and I think we've

we had an amazing vertical atrium space
it<00:02:05.160> offered<00:02:05.459> an<00:02:05.550> opportunity<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.209> pull<00:02:06.989> the

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
it offered an opportunity to pull the

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.350 
it offered an opportunity to pull the

spaces<00:02:09.660> out<00:02:09.989> into<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.619> open<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.730> meant<00:02:11.970> that

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
spaces out into the open it meant that

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.699 
spaces out into the open it meant that
suddenly<00:02:12.480> people<00:02:12.720> were<00:02:12.989> ejected<00:02:13.110> into<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
suddenly people were ejected into the

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.589 
suddenly people were ejected into the
space<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.790> they<00:02:14.940> were<00:02:15.000> part<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
space and that they were part of the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.600 
space and that they were part of the
space<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.170> they<00:02:16.260> added<00:02:16.410> life<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:17.010> what<00:02:17.250> could

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
space and they added life to what could

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.150 
space and they added life to what could
potentially<00:02:18.120> have<00:02:18.209> been<00:02:18.270> quite<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.230> dull<00:02:19.590> sort

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
potentially have been quite a dull sort

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.339 
potentially have been quite a dull sort
of<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.370> true<00:02:20.640> space<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.870> knew<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.230> the

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
of a true space we knew that the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
staircase was going to be the activity

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.940 
staircase was going to be the activity
zone<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.900> agent<00:02:25.230> because<00:02:25.319> where<00:02:25.650> people

move<00:02:26.420> inevitably<00:02:27.420> that's<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.870> opportunity

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
move inevitably that's the opportunity

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.790 
move inevitably that's the opportunity

building<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.100> they<00:03:55.280> wanted<00:03:55.550> to<00:03:55.730> be<00:03:56.570> part<00:03:56.600> of

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
building that they wanted to be part of

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.080 
building that they wanted to be part of
and<00:03:57.260> working<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.890> sustainability<00:03:58.490> came<00:03:58.910> out

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
and working and sustainability came out

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.120 
and working and sustainability came out
as<00:03:59.300> very<00:03:59.330> important<00:04:00.170> so<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.650> think<00:04:00.740> the<00:04:00.950> use<00:04:01.100> of

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
as very important so I think the use of

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.210 
as very important so I think the use of
the<00:04:01.280> materials<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.690> design<00:04:03.110> effect<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.130> we

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
the materials the design effect that we

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.220 
the materials the design effect that we
are<00:04:04.370> going<00:04:04.610> for<00:04:05.000> six<00:04:05.360> star<00:04:05.930> green

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
are going for six star green

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.590 
are going for six star green
accreditation<00:04:07.070> that's<00:04:07.760> all<00:04:07.940> very<00:04:08.090> important

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
accreditation that's all very important

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.510 
accreditation that's all very important
in<00:04:08.690> terms<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.440> sustainability<00:04:10.040> of<00:04:10.280> our

this building has a chilled beam air
conditioning<00:04:17.120> system<00:04:17.570> what<00:04:18.110> that<00:04:18.290> means<00:04:18.560> is

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
conditioning system what that means is

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.520 
conditioning system what that means is
there's<00:04:19.160> 50%<00:04:19.519> more<00:04:20.150> fresh<00:04:20.480> air<00:04:20.720> in<00:04:21.140> this

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
building we're pumping harbor water into

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.070 
building we're pumping harbor water into
the<00:04:25.550> basement<00:04:25.970> of<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.120> building<00:04:26.150> and<00:04:26.630> it's

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
the basement of the building and it's

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.720 
the basement of the building and it's
cooling<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.620> heat<00:04:27.800> exchanger<00:04:28.370> which<00:04:28.550> is

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
cooling a heat exchanger which is

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.700 
cooling a heat exchanger which is
providing<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.240> cooling<00:04:29.720> element<00:04:29.870> for<00:04:30.620> the

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
providing the cooling element for the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.560 
providing the cooling element for the
air<00:04:30.830> conditioning<00:04:31.280> system<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:32.060> it's<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:32.210> really

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
air conditioning system so it's a really

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.540 
air conditioning system so it's a really
really<00:04:32.720> unique<00:04:33.140> feature<00:04:33.500> first<00:04:34.100> team<00:04:34.400> that

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
really unique feature first team that

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.120 
really unique feature first team that
moved<00:04:34.760> in<00:04:34.940> their<00:04:35.300> paper<00:04:35.840> usage<00:04:36.350> is<00:04:36.560> already

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
moved in their paper usage is already

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
moved in their paper usage is already
down<00:04:37.370> 70%<00:04:38.140> we<00:04:39.140> actually<00:04:39.410> have<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.890> team<00:04:40.790> in

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
down 70% we actually have a team in

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.060 
down 70% we actually have a team in
Carlsbad<00:04:41.900> which<00:04:42.110> actually<00:04:42.440> focuses<00:04:42.920> on<00:04:43.010> a

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
Carlsbad which actually focuses on a

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.920 
Carlsbad which actually focuses on a
clean<00:04:43.400> technology<00:04:43.850> private<00:04:44.150> equity<00:04:44.390> fund<00:04:44.600> and

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
clean technology private equity fund and

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.660 
clean technology private equity fund and
so<00:04:45.590> it's<00:04:45.710> great<00:04:45.890> to<00:04:45.920> actually<00:04:46.280> be<00:04:46.400> able<00:04:46.520> to

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
so it's great to actually be able to

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.640 
so it's great to actually be able to
practice<00:04:47.000> what<00:04:47.120> we<00:04:47.270> preach<00:04:47.300> in<00:04:47.840> that<00:04:48.200> respect

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
practice what we preach in that respect

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.430 
practice what we preach in that respect
and<00:04:48.830> I<00:04:48.950> think<00:04:49.030> that<00:04:50.030> helps<00:04:50.330> connect<00:04:51.260> with<00:04:51.410> a

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
and I think that helps connect with a

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.960 
and I think that helps connect with a
lot<00:04:51.650> of<00:04:51.680> investors<00:04:52.220> particularly<00:04:52.640> in<00:04:52.850> these

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
lot of investors particularly in these

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.840 
lot of investors particularly in these
days<00:04:53.210> of<00:04:53.450> U<00:04:53.960> n<00:04:54.110> PRI<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:55.130> corporate

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
days of U n PRI and corporate

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.320 
days of U n PRI and corporate
responsibility

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.209 

there<00:04:59.330> is<00:04:59.479> a<00:04:59.509> real<00:04:59.899> sense<00:05:00.229> of<00:05:00.469> dynamism<00:05:00.979> and

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:01.219 
there is a real sense of dynamism and

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:02.950 
there is a real sense of dynamism and
energy<00:05:01.669> in<00:05:01.849> this<00:05:01.999> building<00:05:02.059> compared<00:05:02.839> to
