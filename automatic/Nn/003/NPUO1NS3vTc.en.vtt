00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.539
 after the first half of the week 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.099
 Wettertechnisch has started quite quiet 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.259
 succeeded in the 100 th day in one 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.580
 more turbulent weather phase in particular 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.500
 also the north of germany 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.390
 we see here on the bottom pressure had 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.490
 from thursday 9 o'clock a relative 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.439
 weak low pressure area that is still 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.640
 in the lake area between scotland and 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.650
 Iceland is located 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.689
 it shifts in the further course 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.699
 across southern Scandinavia to the 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.879
 get ahead and step up 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:38.030
 clearly on the wind map we see 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.219
 that we are in the area of ​​the North Sea coast tomorrow 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.969
 early already have the first squalls 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.649
 the wind is increasing and that too 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.629
 quickly becomes the highlight for the 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.329
 North Sea area expected on Thursday evening 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.300
 for the area of ​​baltic sea at night 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.039
 friday in the south it is from the 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.840
 Wind speeds less 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.250
 but dramatic gusts are 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.750
 expected on the next card are the 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.699
 have shown peak wages and indeed 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.580
 we take a relatively wide strip 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.909
 along the coasts as well as in the adjacent 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.920
 inland where we gale with strength 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.380
 with a wind speed of over 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.570
 120 kilometers per hour work in 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.310
 an area here north Frisia but 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.689
 Also, Schleswig Holstein can share it 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.540
 get a little stronger 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.579
 there are sometimes extreme gale-force winds 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.680
 wind speeds of over 140 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.899
 kilometers per hour expected 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.460
 in a strip of south of it 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.450
 joins in the North German 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.170
 We still have low levels 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.780
 orkanartige gusts with 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.920
 Wind speeds around 110 kilometers 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.899
 to be expected per hour 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.149
 further south, it is not all 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.329
 as dramatic as it will be spread yet 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.700
 storm gusts to about 80 85 kilometers per 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.740
 expected hour and then, however 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.890
 in the highlands in the summit days 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.509
 Heavy gusts or hurricanes 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.240
 squalls the current information 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.200
 You can always visit www.weg.de 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.780
 get a small one 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.030
 Outlook still on the friday the wind 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.740
 takes off only very slowly so in the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.710
 area of ​​the coasts we will continue 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.570
 occasional gale-force gusts 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.360
 but overall he is slowing down though 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.120
 steadily after, but on friday 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.770
 the cold air coming from the north 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.750
 then the precipitation is the most form 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.970
 fall from chill then up in 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.480
 let deep layers pass into snow 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.640
 together with snow in cooperation 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.170
 the snow and the wind can do it 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.070
 especially in the mountain country and partly to strong 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.120
 snowdrifts come 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.210
 That was it until the next German 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.570
 weather service weather and climate from one 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.570
