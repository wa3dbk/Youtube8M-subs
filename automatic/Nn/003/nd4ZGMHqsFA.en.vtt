00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
have used anything with beta alanine

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.910 
have used anything with beta alanine
before<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.630> do<00:01:21.810> tend<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> get<00:01:22.409> some<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.830> those

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
before you do tend to get some of those

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.740 
before you do tend to get some of those
like<00:01:23.220> burning<00:01:23.700> tingles<00:01:24.240> throughout<00:01:24.600> your

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
like burning tingles throughout your

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.840 
like burning tingles throughout your
face<00:01:24.990> or<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.290> body<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.890> didn't<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.700> get

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
face or your body I didn't really get

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.870 
face or your body I didn't really get
too<00:01:27.119> much<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:28.080> beta<00:01:28.530> alanine<00:01:29.100> tingles

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
too much of the beta alanine tingles

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.819 
too much of the beta alanine tingles
going<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.570> again<00:01:30.659> everyone<00:01:31.500> has<00:01:31.799> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
going on but again everyone has a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.440 
going on but again everyone has a
different<00:01:32.040> sensitivity<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.180> beta

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
different sensitivity to the beta

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.620 
different sensitivity to the beta
alanine<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:35.610> wasn't<00:01:35.939> bothersome<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.600> me

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
alanine so that wasn't bothersome to me

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.560 
alanine so that wasn't bothersome to me
at<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:37.340> there<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.490> caffeine<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.360> it's
