00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.100
 we come to light and we realize that 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.590
 our states are files 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.580
 trying but these files come out 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.580
 director 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.740
 we're going to do is 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:29.510
 start run we click but 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.790
 also with the key 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.599
 the symbol key of windows to be 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.599
 It does not matter 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.739
 and we wrote cmd 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.879
 in cmd 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.879
 we wrote 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.519
 the route where it shines 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.470
 in two points 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.000
 and we are already inside the disk 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.560
 where is the memory you see 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.370
 there we write 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.370
 to tripp 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.230
 but flash 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.280
 of splash 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.700
 s 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.700
 I 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.570
 r 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.570
 I 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.790
 h I who know everything is like space 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.520
 of this kind of asterisk 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:51.250
 and we give a brief explanation to the trip 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.930
 is to display modify attributes 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.350
 links to be able to process folders 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.920
 That's what it is to be able to process your 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.580
 folders - r is to remove attributes from just 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.960
 reading 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.630
 - h is removing hidden attributes and less 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.330
 that is to remove attribute from the system and 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.890
 and the asterisk dot this disk is for 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.500
 files of any name with 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.880
 any extension good that's all and 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.210
 once we go back to the usb 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.000
 and we are going to find the documents that are not 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.320
 we had lost alone and now only 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.260
 we put it sort of sorted by type 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.970
 of element and everything they see with everything 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.970
 what says direct access 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.090
 everything that has direct access what 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.090
 erase 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.150
 remove 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.810
