 and 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.869
 a few months ago we met in Granada

 mythical rally paris dakar at the end 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.070
 decided to transform his travel notebook 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.640
 in a book with his experiences where 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.790

 with the current adventure models of 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.160
 the Japanese brand followers of tan 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.160
 illustrious last name 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.370
 we meet mario 'montoro author 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.680
 of this magnificent book that is called 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.210
 stumbled across Africa that narrates its 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.530
 Two-month trip to African lands 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.960
 on the back of the tannery of the year 89 mario 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.060
 how the idea of ​​taking a trip arises 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.400
 so is this size almost without 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.110
 good experience because the idea arises a 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.729
 little unconsciously when we 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.400
 we hope there is a tree there in the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.290
 have and we decide may be the first 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.970
 ecological travelers looking for our 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.830
 Our several tree had already been 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.450
 boy and we said come let's put and ya 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.869
 they were in need of a tree 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.000
 far away and curious things that I've 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.649
 read that it occurs to you to buy the motorcycle or 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.020
 not three days before leaving you did not have 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.000
 motorcycle is still not true I did not have motorcycle 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.340
 fortunately well an announcement of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.350
 they put one in Barcelona and send me 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.479
 macri manolito see her and good 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.710
 I think it was a success because it 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.600
 came to go with the other bike that is 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.550
 destined sure that did not happen of the trancó 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.880
 the door we're going fixed 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.680
 assistance because on motorcycles with that age 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.869
 He did not have much reliability, because he 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.790
 we had a thermometer with some strips and 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.070
 little more 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.570
 no yes yes yes yes we managed to convince 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.250
 a pair of SUVs through 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.840
 internet and they accompanied us you know that 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.310
 when you get in scrubs by half 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.280
 the desert needs water needs 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.250
 gasoline and good if we wanted to take 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.530
 part of the trip I know we had 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.870
 organized on paper so I did 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.810
 missing but good not for that reason it stops being 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.150
 easier are more difficult is some 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.510
 problem with borders when passing 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.950
 some country complicated good the border 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.500
 I already knew that they were complicated and it is 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.230
 truth that they are sites that as soon as possible 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.810
 you pass the best people, well, good 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.700
 money asks you people who ask you for papers 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.790
 that you know you do not need 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.430
 and that they say yes but good 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.709
 unique so a little complicated in Niger 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.750
 the coincidences I feel we are going with a 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.360
 SUV that takes a few girls 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.989
 then in the unemployed and stuffed forms 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.420
 the papers and all the time he was telling me 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.459
 Montoro is still his toyota I say no 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.770
 I do not go on a Yamaha do not give us your Toyota 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.180
 and then there was no way that in those 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.310
 papers put the names of the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.420
 girls that border I passed as owner 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.430
 absolute of having 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.370
 and another because they did not want that in name 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.870
 of women was reflected in the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.760
 today I keep asking for that touch the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.060
 mine we are going at least in papers and 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.340
 tell us some curious anecdote 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.170
 well one I do not know if you can count 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.360
 well, he's going to tell if it 's good to be 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.640
 lost and in a stand can 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.989
 get all the Moroccan soldiers and 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.060
 with the rifles at least it's going to 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.280
 to shoot us see that we were a few simple 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.600
 bikers that we had not lost and good 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.970
 share a meal with them 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.150
 wonderful exceptional a few months 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.910
 then we went to take him a radio 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.160
 the detail of food and then he manu 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.410
 he knows it cost us close to the time 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.940
 there of the interrogation the jurisdiction where 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.310
 we are because they did not understand how 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.650
 we go with a radio that they 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.970
 they thought it was to bribe them at the end 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.100
 the radio unfortunately we had 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.840
 to take the kids poor that the 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.700
 border they have not imagine what they 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.220
 we would pass but well I hope that we 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.220
 forgive us sometime let's wait 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.690

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.270
 I always say it is the same is a 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.460
 granite that is falling and good little to 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.260
 little forming a small desert like 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.450

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.370

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.610
 that invites you to go to Africa to meet her 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.780
 without fear with little budget 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.480
 I'm revealing the truth I'm 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.880
 very happy as you know we carry everything 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.500
 this year in a small turner in Spain 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.730
 and the truth that the affection of the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.610
 exceptional response 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:45.660
 but good little by little and a little bit more 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.730
 people have to read a little more the 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.280
 book I advise it is very pleasant very 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.830
 entertaining and good will want to 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.230
 travel on upcoming projects you have 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.940
 in mind that may be the man 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.280
 I have a very cool thing in a 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.500
 continent starts over there and they end 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.850
 Of course I will not say because what happens 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.650
 that it is true that for that I need 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.240
 let's sell I do not know how many millions of 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.250
 books there we are why we are but 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.129
 As soon as we get the money, 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.779
 have doubts that there will be a trip 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.639
 the book will be another song 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.860
 first the trip and we'll see it but if 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.449

 ask the movie for when good 

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:29.069
 I like that you ask me that question because 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.689
 we are in negotiations with brad pitt and 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.330
 whenever he does this do of me 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.860
 then we will go forward the part 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.300
 to be angelina jolie 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.789
 I've already made my wife to forgive me 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.610
 but good the scene added bed 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:44.590
 I do not think there's a double, you know, myself 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.090
 several we only ask you one thing that 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.069
 when you make your next trip to 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.169
 stumbling that starts there will end 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:53.409
