00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
we're trying to use them as the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.000 
we're trying to use them as the
centerpiece<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.520> real<00:01:59.790> catalyst<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
centerpiece and real catalyst to

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.380 
centerpiece and real catalyst to
re-energize<00:02:02.010> in<00:02:02.280> our<00:02:02.430> building<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.180> know<00:02:03.360> a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
re-energize in our building you know a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
we'll get our energy level in this

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.390 
we'll get our energy level in this
building<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:17.250> be<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.760> best<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> country
