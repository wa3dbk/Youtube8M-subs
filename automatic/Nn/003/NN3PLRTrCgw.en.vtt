00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 of antiquity that had no point of 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.410
 comparison they tried to describe what 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.150
 they looked according to recognized images 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.710
 of the daily process but that today 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.960
 if you try to follow the foot of the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.089
 letter seems to be a phenomenon that today 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.240
 anyone would understand as for example 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.869
 a jet rocket without going any further in 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.000
 Ezekiel 14 says the prophet himself 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.900
 attention to the bumps behind very 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.529
 image he says I looked and saw how it came from 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.700
 north a whirlpool a big cloud 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.000
 attention something that moves by the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.890
 true sky and a fire that was stirring 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.809
 within itself as a system of 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.579
 true propulsion with a fire that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.649
 obviously it is emanating from this own 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.559
 cloud and that is stirred because clearly 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.230
 is generating smoke and fed up and autocad was 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.050
 good around them from the object that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.780
 it generated this there was a glow look 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.760
 eye and in its center something similar a 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.949
 clear metal he seems to be 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.309
 writing with a ship towards a ship 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.710
 space a shiny metal that came out 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.450
 from the middle of the fire it was obviously the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.950
 center that generated this was 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.869
 that was located by the sky that is a 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.719
 scientist who has worked in different 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.070
 projects for the nasa in which 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.929
 they make the ferries in the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.570
 principal designer is in fact aircraft 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.340
 in question and that said look we need 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.500
 a propulsion system to launch it 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.020
 up to the stratosphere and it's unusual 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.270
 of Beijing goes on etc. Etcetera started 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.340
 to read online by line all 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.719
 aspects of that who told him to see him 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.100
 let's give an interpretation is this 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.159
 it's as if they were describing me 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.200
 a spaceship because he said that 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.789
 he said it was like a wheel and the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.020
 attention I thought is that in a wheel of 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.750
 nation to one more than this was a 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.610
 flying dish despite a wheel 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.979
 true could I do if it were a plate of 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.739
 the curved ones that could move from 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.170
 right to left top to bottom without 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.670
 have to turn around it would seem that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.069
 I was writing an object that 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.289
 it can rise certain descend and 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.599
 move to where you want without need 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.909
 of having to turn or turn as a 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.739
 cart then describe it inside their 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.929
 own capabilities ok 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:12.299
 they said oh what success is a ship and yes 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.140
 that is supported because he wants to exist 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.600
 four turbines 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.480
 it's true or four creatures that have 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.660
 like true wings and that shine like 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.000
 that the metal and they are holding 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.790
 this luminous object similar to metal 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.310
 that goes out fire and that travels and flies like 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.200
 the cloud came to the conclusion that it is a 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.810
 perfect description and is a model to 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.630
 scale of which one would be and that is the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.350
 famous bullrich ship that is a 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.420
 aerospace engineer that based on the 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.880
 Ezekiel's texts ended by saying 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.580
 probably what this man saw is 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.310
 something similar to the following as a 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.680
 modern helicopter that obviously the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.080
 four figures that hold this would be 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.090
 the buttocks would be the pagans and that 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.790
 obviously when he talks about eyes 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.709
 refers to the number of windows that 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.290
 where these beings who appear 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.420
 then they descended he describes it with 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.780
 wheels able to go from one place to another 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.780
 without having to spin certain with four 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.970
 wings that obviously he is a propeller 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.019
 according to space scientists with the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.490
 type of trolley wheels 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.410
 supermarkets 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.000
 that can be accommodated for the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.330
 any address that serve to 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.760
 perch and that the true blades as well as 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.040
 those of a helicopter are four 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.830
 wings because he interprets that with that 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.290
 can fly and everything else good we go 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.570
 to see about similarities 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.950
 completely remarkable that has to do 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.590
 with our race that are like the 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.860
 Sumerians with the famous Anunnaki in the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.720
 history of the in here supposedly 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.290
 they came down from the sky of 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.510
 space some creatures that saw the 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.310
 man in a primitive state almost 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.730
 animal a site practically a primate 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.620
 they manipulated it genetically and created 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.020
 a human race similar to what we are 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.700
 us much more evolved so that 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.160
 I served them in mining terms 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.830
 agricultural and the great kilo 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.660
 that man says in the writing of the 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.650
 Sumerians and in scriptures that a report 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.330
 there in the bar that was called adamo 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.520
 imagine the closest thing to art the most 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.190
 similarity is practically because the 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.530
 first man that was created by god he 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.230
 flame has hit and after a 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.050
 and obviously I think your partner I want the 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.060
 woman attention who says what in the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.700
 bible that adam believes it or the neighborhood 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.340
 true I feel that it constituted as a 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.990
 model that was influenced by life and that 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.389
 obviously that's where the first being came from 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.130
 human who is called fairy who says lohan 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.620
 one here on his part that with the 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.770
 technology and then it is understood that 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.680
 with the ability to create life 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.900
 obviously that is how like the 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.380
 laboratory from where the form is created 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.419
 they say it was made from 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.850
 normal particles such as the 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.300
 carbon silicon and everything that makes up 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.300
 a quadrant
