00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:11.309
 of speed it's going to do it in the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:13.290
 sweet pink 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.039
 yeah increase the incidence with the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.670
 red here is nickel nathan the red tail 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.070
 their leu 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.970
 the back is too tight in my opinion 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.800
 is that your balloon take the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.369
 speed is not enough speed is 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.609
 exciting and its spread and come back 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.349
 staff and its customers 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.349
 but it'll it'll work you see how 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.920
 the problem the problem is that for 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.160
 get to stabilize both it takes 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.690
 you also you they think 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.270
 bosses it's true you're too pivoting 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.270
 and there it works awesome nickel 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.190
 in the video there 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.340
 and then 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.530
 thomassin they advance faster than your 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.510
 balloon and he is faster to react 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.730
 that's all it takes for your balloon 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.680
 take speed in the mind 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.720

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:20.590
 there and there and there you continue the room there 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.040
 you start moving a lot there 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.040
