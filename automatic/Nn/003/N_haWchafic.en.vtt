00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.520 
three reactor microphones in a Decca
tree<00:02:08.880> setup<00:02:09.240> configuration<00:02:09.470> creates<00:02:10.470> a

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
tree setup configuration creates a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.370 
tree setup configuration creates a
recording<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.280> larger<00:02:11.700> than<00:02:11.849> life<00:02:12.319> so<00:02:13.319> if

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
recording that is larger than life so if

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.990 
recording that is larger than life so if
you're<00:02:13.530> recording<00:02:13.770> either<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.160> single<00:02:14.520> guitar

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
you're recording either a single guitar

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.570 
you're recording either a single guitar
or<00:02:15.239> an<00:02:15.390> entire<00:02:15.780> Orchestra<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:17.190> set<00:02:17.459> of

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
or an entire Orchestra the set of

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.780 
or an entire Orchestra the set of
possibilities<00:02:18.330> are<00:02:18.510> endless<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.430> there<00:02:20.670> you

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
possibilities are endless so there you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.640 
possibilities are endless so there you
have<00:02:20.849> it<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.660> reactor<00:02:22.110> microphone

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
have it the reactor microphone

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.010 
have it the reactor microphone
cutting-edge<00:02:23.459> technology<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.330> design<00:02:24.450> from

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
cutting-edge technology and design from

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:34.160 
cutting-edge technology and design from
who<00:02:25.200> else<00:02:25.380> blue<00:02:26.100> microphones
