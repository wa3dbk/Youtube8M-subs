00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.380
 for this design and they need five 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.330
 different colors white black 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.300
 stickers for French manicure and a 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.550
 stick so let's start first 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.880
 I recommend you to paint your nails 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.880
 White 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.149
 Now you just have to paint each 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.149
 nail of its corresponding color 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.820
 put the sticker a little below 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.820
 half of the nail like that 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.170
 now paint the area below the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.170
 white sticker 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.350
 if you have jello 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.580
 and with a drop of black enamel in one 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.130
 sheet of paper 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.480
 now wet the brave kart already six 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.480
 points in each 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.570
 A) Yes 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.570
 these will be the usual ones 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.540
 now used the same black 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.170
 and make a black line on the edge of the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.970
 White 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.700
 here 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.890
 If you have a fine brush do not hesitate 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.560
 use it because it makes the lines be 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.040
 more straight and it looks better but if not 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.820
 do you have 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.820
 that's how it is 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.960
 to make the laces you have to do 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.070
 two v- shaped lines using the 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.070
 toothpick and white enamel 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.340
 and a v 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.160
 I repeat if you have the brush a floor 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.470
 when you have finished it just makes 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.069
 a layer of transparent to protect 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.069
 the orchards 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.169
 and we are finished
