but when I play Resident Evil 4 on thank

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.779 
but when I play Resident Evil 4 on thank
you<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.820> control<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:46.010> was<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.219> good<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> was

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
you the control was was so good it was

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.150 
you the control was was so good it was
you<00:00:48.450> had<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> little<00:00:48.989> laser<00:00:49.230> dot<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.010> was

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
you had the little laser dot and it was

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
you had the little laser dot and it was
just<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.579> precise<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.329> way<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.510> moved<00:00:51.750> around

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
just so precise the way it moved around

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.630 
just so precise the way it moved around
and<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.739> reason<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.610> because

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and the reason for that is because

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520 
and the reason for that is because
they're<00:00:54.030> zombies<00:00:54.149> are<00:00:54.510> sort<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.809> slow<00:00:55.170> they

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
they're zombies are sort of slow they

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.189 
they're zombies are sort of slow they
cover<00:00:55.739> yeah<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.789> not<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.510> fast-paced

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
cover yeah it's not really so fast-paced

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.160 
cover yeah it's not really so fast-paced
and<00:00:58.910> it<00:00:59.910> gives<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.120> time<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> iron<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.989> stuff

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and it gives you time to iron and stuff

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.840 
and it gives you time to iron and stuff
which<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:01.739> cool<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.190> reasonable<00:01:02.820> for

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
