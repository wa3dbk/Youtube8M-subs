now let's take a moment and we will set
aside<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.650> ducati<00:01:35.010> belt

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
aside the ducati belt

great belt we talked about it and let's
bring<00:01:41.460> over<00:01:43.100> our<00:01:44.100> 900<00:01:45.030> belt<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> explain<00:01:48.510> a

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
bring over our 900 belt so to explain a

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.610 
bring over our 900 belt so to explain a
little<00:01:48.750> bit<00:01:49.020> about<00:01:49.640> exact<00:01:50.640> fit<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.480> best<00:01:52.440> of

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
little bit about exact fit and best of

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.570 
little bit about exact fit and best of
industry<00:01:53.040> practice<00:01:54.740> on<00:01:55.740> your<00:01:56.040> right<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.550> the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
industry practice on your right is the

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.280 
industry practice on your right is the
exact<00:01:57.480> fit<00:01:57.690> 900<00:01:58.350> belt<00:01:59.090> and<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.270> your<00:02:00.450> left<00:02:00.660> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
exact fit 900 belt and on your left the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.080 
exact fit 900 belt and on your left the
696<00:02:02.010> belt<00:02:04.220> initially<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.370> only<00:02:05.400> difference

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
696 belt initially the only difference

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.500 
696 belt initially the only difference
appears<00:02:06.480> to<00:02:06.690> be<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:07.290> width<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:07.740> belt<00:02:08.480> so<00:02:09.480> I

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
appears to be the width of the belt so I

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.470 
appears to be the width of the belt so I
was<00:02:09.840> proposing<00:02:10.260> that<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.830> made<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.220> 696<00:02:12.090> belt

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
was proposing that we made the 696 belt

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.740 
was proposing that we made the 696 belt
be<00:02:13.350> for<00:02:13.680> both<00:02:13.920> they<00:02:14.610> had<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.970> same<00:02:15.240> number<00:02:15.510> of

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
be for both they had the same number of

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.210 
be for both they had the same number of
teeth<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:17.550> same<00:02:17.790> tooth<00:02:18.240> pitch<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.220> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
teeth the same tooth pitch and the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.830 
teeth the same tooth pitch and the
thicker<00:02:20.550> width<00:02:20.910> would<00:02:21.150> only<00:02:21.300> be<00:02:21.570> more

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
thicker width would only be more

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.550 
thicker width would only be more
reliable<00:02:22.470> for<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.100> 900<00:02:24.470> however<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
reliable for this 900 however the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.600 
reliable for this 900 however the
engineer<00:02:25.980> said<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.080> tooth<00:02:28.380> profile<00:02:29.250> is

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
engineer said that the tooth profile is

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.670 
engineer said that the tooth profile is
different<00:02:30.240> between<00:02:30.600> these<00:02:31.140> two<00:02:31.410> belts<00:02:31.710> I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
different between these two belts I

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.470 
different between these two belts I
actually<00:02:34.680> was<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.070> bit<00:02:35.310> surprised<00:02:35.760> if<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.239> see

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
actually was a bit surprised if you see

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.930 
actually was a bit surprised if you see
these<00:02:36.690> they<00:02:37.560> really<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.220> tooth<00:02:38.430> profile

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
these they really the tooth profile

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.260 
these they really the tooth profile
really<00:02:39.239> does<00:02:39.540> seem<00:02:39.810> identical<00:02:40.940> but<00:02:41.940> whatever

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
really does seem identical but whatever

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.670 
really does seem identical but whatever
the<00:02:42.420> difference<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.959> in<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.890> tooth<00:02:44.070> profile<00:02:44.670> I

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
the difference is in the tooth profile I

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.070 
the difference is in the tooth profile I
am<00:02:46.680> amazed<00:02:47.370> at<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> difference<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.780> fact

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
am amazed at the difference and the fact

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.410 
am amazed at the difference and the fact
that<00:02:49.200> they<00:02:49.410> simply<00:02:50.010> recommended<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.209> do

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
that they simply recommended that you do

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.400 
that they simply recommended that you do
not<00:02:51.630> mix<00:02:52.020> tooth<00:02:52.410> profile<00:02:53.120> they<00:02:54.120> said<00:02:54.420> no<00:02:54.690> you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
not mix tooth profile they said no you

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.880 
not mix tooth profile they said no you
really<00:02:55.680> do<00:02:56.010> want<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.940> not<00:02:57.209> use<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.900> 6-6<00:02:58.590> belt

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
really do want to not use the 6-6 belt

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.410 
really do want to not use the 6-6 belt
on<00:02:59.130> the<00:03:00.000> 900s<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:04.800> we'll<00:03:05.040> leave<00:03:05.250> our<00:03:05.489> 900<00:03:06.180> belt

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
on the 900s so we'll leave our 900 belt

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.280 
on the 900s so we'll leave our 900 belt
out<00:03:06.660> in<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.140> set<00:03:07.350> aside<00:03:07.650> our<00:03:08.060> 696<00:03:09.060> belt

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290

looked identical to be interchanged it
made<00:04:07.980> me<00:04:08.099> realize<00:04:08.489> perhaps<00:04:08.940> is<00:04:09.120> not<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.389> best

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
made me realize perhaps is not the best

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.599 
made me realize perhaps is not the best
of<00:04:09.810> industry<00:04:10.200> practice<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:11.069> have<00:04:11.190> this<00:04:11.400> other
