00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.299
 an excellent atmosphere for the future 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.640
 against the ajax women's competition 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.740
 that of psv fc eindhoven 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.040
 and here the playful of the month claudia 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.669
 of the holy mountain and its wash ready 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.570
 for the match against psv ajax 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.099
 of course 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.970
 a very nice victory during the week 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.830
 booked on fc twente 0 4 victory and 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.559
 that line of wilders extend here 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.449
 petra hogeweder comes 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.629
 contact cam seaman and 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.430
 desiree van lunteren van lunteren but 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.140
 a weak shot that can be natural 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.820
 much better 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.769
 moments later van de lunteren's corner kick 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.019
 good corner Hoogendijk the bee and then 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:56.070
 ice cream to bake but good on the right 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.150
 spot on this header from ascii baker 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.280
 just before the break one of the few 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.080
 attacks by psv 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.760
 missions you will defend there 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.650
 the ball of law and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.650
 then coopers but not ball goes right next 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.770
 it was not the game full of opportunities 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.130
 therefore the resting position 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.200
 0 0 that would be in the second half 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.520
 ajax in attack comes the ball 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.590
 at van lunteren 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.750
 lay the ball ready for a mandy 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.750
 what the chance increased mark 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:30.060
 wrist wrap this possibility of mandy 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.740
 naturally she had more out of it 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.100
 can get 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.549
 but the tone was set Ajax continued 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.549
 mandy 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.740
 by lisa behind the must note 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.689
 got up the right back in duel with 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.630
 myrthe roel vincken 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.399
 holes along the musts for move 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.590
 resit for the moss there comes the 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.389
 but just missed the ice cream 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.389
 not baker and concentrated ajax remained 

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:03.509
 press your hunt for goal 

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:04.619
 then corner of psv is missed and 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.049
 then the costs 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.580
 from her own penalty area yet 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.700
 costs always stood on the supplier of 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.700
 Ajax 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.090
 more than 60 meters of ball still 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.140
 costs with the overview on mandy 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.349
 increases 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.569
 a lot of space for crossings 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.950
 comes the cross and then your own 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:34.220
 goal of more the helm 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.890
 the unlucky bird of psv but ajax 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.780
 earned on a one or origin and the 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.390
 plow continued with saint claudia 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.250
 mountain with the cross 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.379
 the ball ends up at desiree van 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.410
 lunteren cuts and shoot with the left but 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:53.480
 krist in her place and again 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.540
 van lunteren with the boss at chantal door 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.400
 earlier the substitute entered the team 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.430
 for est bins with the cross and then is 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.579
 it from the holy mountain and is co2 0 then 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.629
 is the duel decided and see what we 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:10.519
 discharge from the holy mountain to the 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.069
 Bank 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.069
 Vita party with the service 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.209
 ajax concluded a beautiful one with this victory 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.219
 departed 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.209
 First there was the 0 4 victory at FC 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:25.189
 twente and then the 2 0 win over psv one 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.870
 of the other teams purchase with 20 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.670
 points 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.370
 partly due to this goal by claudia van 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.730
 the holy mountain 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.379
 player of the month next week 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.900
 there an international match 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.329
 then the away match against design and 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.280
 ajax takes part in the victory again 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.280
 against twente and psv 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.790
 I have to compliment the group 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.189
 for the way they last 20 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.599
 25 minutes came through because in the 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.419
 rest it was said there were some 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.219
 they were rickety and that makes sense 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.189
 in the end it is so that you just 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.329
 who must make 90 minutes plus 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.799
 well we have plenty of examples 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.060
 full season so you only have to 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.949
 but to mention and then it is good 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.500
 and henk aarts siemens panenka min 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:11.750
 together in a 2 in there are thinking i 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.690
 know my fire and you will see a piece now 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.370
 discharge and that is nice that is beautiful 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.780
 because they have up button and if you do then 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.989
 reward yourself rewards 2 minutes before 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.640
 time with a 2 0 yes then the competition 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.230
 played and then it was finished 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.490
 moment trip exciting 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.530
 and with a bit of luck I have to 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.960
 say the goal falls but we have 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.550
 Always trust just had to 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.650
 so we had to win you 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.470
 finally he falls happy 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.840

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.870
 yes we do n't need a single team 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.760
 but it must also want one 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.860

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.350
