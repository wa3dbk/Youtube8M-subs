trick and then clicking it left or do a

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.860 
trick and then clicking it left or do a
kickflip<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:33.430> right<00:01:33.760> to<00:01:34.270> do<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.450> heel<00:01:34.630> flip

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
kickflip and right to do a heel flip

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.630 
kickflip and right to do a heel flip
obviously<00:01:35.290> always<00:01:35.500> tapping<00:01:36.010> x2<00:01:36.310> landed

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
obviously always tapping x2 landed

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.940 
obviously always tapping x2 landed
afterwards<00:01:37.260> once<00:01:38.260> you've<00:01:38.380> got<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.560> basics

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
afterwards once you've got the basics

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.410 
afterwards once you've got the basics
down<00:01:39.070> you<00:01:39.250> can<00:01:39.400> start<00:01:39.610> sort<00:01:39.970> of<00:01:40.030> looking<00:01:40.300> at

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
down you can start sort of looking at

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.240 
down you can start sort of looking at
more<00:01:40.540> complicated<00:01:40.930> tricks<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:41.500> kind<00:01:41.860> of<00:01:41.950> doing

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
more complicated tricks so kind of doing

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.150 
more complicated tricks so kind of doing
quarter<00:01:43.120> circles<00:01:43.660> quarter<00:01:44.590> turns<00:01:44.830> will<00:01:45.040> do

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
quarter circles quarter turns will do

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.620 
quarter circles quarter turns will do
some<00:01:45.340> easier<00:01:45.640> skateboarding<00:01:46.120> tricks<00:01:46.360> like

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
some easier skateboarding tricks like

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.170 
some easier skateboarding tricks like
pop<00:01:46.900> shuvit<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:48.460> can<00:01:48.610> take<00:01:48.730> the<00:01:48.850> upstart

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.660 
Hill flips and very ellipse and once you
get<00:01:59.290> in<00:01:59.410> more<00:01:59.620> confident<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.250> can<00:02:00.370> start

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
get in more confident you can start

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.540 
get in more confident you can start
adding<00:02:01.350> half<00:02:02.350> circle<00:02:02.770> terms<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.160> you<00:02:03.280> can<00:02:03.310> be

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
adding half circle terms so you can be

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.420 
adding half circle terms so you can be

this<00:02:09.399> way<00:02:10.019> and<00:02:11.019> when<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.200> get<00:02:11.319> really<00:02:11.560> really

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
this way and when you get really really

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.199 
this way and when you get really really
really<00:02:12.190> confident<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:12.760> can<00:02:12.849> start<00:02:13.090> doing

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
really confident you can start doing

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.720 
really confident you can start doing
full<00:02:13.599> circles<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.410> things<00:02:14.650> like<00:02:14.860> 360<00:02:15.550> hard

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
full circles to do things like 360 hard

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.420 
full circles to do things like 360 hard
flips<00:02:16.410> or<00:02:17.410> even<00:02:17.710> getting

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
writer up to left that so that's kind of

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.830 
writer up to left that so that's kind of
the<00:02:24.519> basics<00:02:24.849> of<00:02:24.909> just<00:02:25.120> pulling<00:02:25.359> tricks<00:02:25.599> but

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
the basics of just pulling tricks but

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.509 
the basics of just pulling tricks but
you're<00:02:26.680> never<00:02:26.769> going<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.010> reach<00:02:27.159> the<00:02:27.250> top<00:02:27.430> of

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
you're never going to reach the top of

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.559 
you're never going to reach the top of
the<00:02:27.579> high<00:02:27.670> school<00:02:27.909> board<00:02:28.090> if<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.239> just<00:02:28.420> cruise

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
the high school board if you just cruise

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.119 
the high school board if you just cruise
along<00:02:28.719> busting<00:02:29.200> kick<00:02:29.379> flips<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.739> heel<00:02:29.890> flips

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
along busting kick flips and heel flips

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.319 
along busting kick flips and heel flips
and<00:02:30.280> stuff<00:02:30.370> like<00:02:30.579> that<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.969> need<00:02:31.060> start

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
and stuff like that you need start

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.000 
and stuff like that you need start
linking<00:02:31.420> them<00:02:31.659> together<00:02:31.840> into<00:02:32.109> combos<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.920> do

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
linking them together into combos to do

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.849 
linking them together into combos to do
that<00:02:33.159> you're<00:02:33.250> going<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.400> need<00:02:33.549> to<00:02:33.640> use<00:02:33.670> grinds

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
that you're going to need to use grinds

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.030 
that you're going to need to use grinds
so<00:02:35.859> do<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.849> grind<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.569> it's<00:02:38.019> all<00:02:38.170> based<00:02:38.439> on<00:02:38.590> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
so do a grind you it's all based on the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.379 
so do a grind you it's all based on the
left<00:02:39.459> analog<00:02:39.639> sticks<00:02:40.000> when<00:02:40.180> you're<00:02:40.269> on<00:02:40.359> the

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.389 
left analog sticks when you're on the

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.869 
left analog sticks when you're on the
ground<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:41.139> you<00:02:41.230> flip<00:02:41.439> the<00:02:41.560> stick<00:02:41.799> that'll<00:02:42.790> be

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
ground and you flip the stick that'll be

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.280 
ground and you flip the stick that'll be
tricks<00:02:43.150> when<00:02:43.450> you're<00:02:43.569> in<00:02:43.659> the<00:02:43.750> air<00:02:43.930> if<00:02:44.170> you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
tricks when you're in the air if you

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.610 
tricks when you're in the air if you
hold<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.620> stick<00:02:44.829> in<00:02:44.980> blue<00:02:45.159> grinds<00:02:46.349> so<00:02:47.349> if<00:02:47.530> I

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
hold the stick in blue grinds so if I

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.259 
hold the stick in blue grinds so if I
come<00:02:47.769> up<00:02:47.799> to<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.129> come<00:02:48.730> up<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:48.909> this<00:02:49.000> next

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
come up to this come up to this next

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.839 
come up to this come up to this next
layer<00:02:49.480> show<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:49.980> flip<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.099> stick<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.790> then

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
layer show you flip the stick and then

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.110 
layer show you flip the stick and then
it<00:02:51.970> hold<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.209> again<00:02:52.419> to<00:02:52.510> grind<00:02:53.879> and<00:02:54.879> again

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
it hold it again to grind and again

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.699 
it hold it again to grind and again
holding<00:02:55.599> different<00:02:55.750> directions<00:02:56.290> will<00:02:56.530> call

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
holding different directions will call

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.740 
holding different directions will call
that<00:02:56.859> in<00:02:56.980> science<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:57.579> holding<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.569> right

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
that in science so holding the right

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.780 
that in science so holding the right
we'll<00:02:58.900> do<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:58.989> nosegrind<00:02:59.500> holder<00:03:00.250> left<00:03:00.519> will<00:03:00.700> do

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
we'll do a nosegrind holder left will do

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.009 
we'll do a nosegrind holder left will do
a<00:03:00.819> 5m<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.590> tail<00:03:02.590> slides<00:03:02.919> and<00:03:03.159> so<00:03:03.310> on<00:03:04.019> grinds

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
a 5m a tail slides and so on grinds

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.420 
a 5m a tail slides and so on grinds
actually<00:03:05.260> work<00:03:05.379> a<00:03:05.530> lot<00:03:05.680> like<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:05.980> tricks<00:03:06.250> and

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
actually work a lot like the tricks and

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.690 
actually work a lot like the tricks and
tapping<00:03:06.730> x2<00:03:07.000> lance<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.480> later<00:03:07.719> i<00:03:07.840> press<00:03:08.109> grind

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
tapping x2 lance and later i press grind

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.709 
tapping x2 lance and later i press grind
the<00:03:09.700> more<00:03:09.879> points<00:03:10.120> are<00:03:10.269> school<00:03:10.480> for<00:03:10.629> that

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719

it comes up in green and I got a little
flame<00:03:32.019> eBoost<00:03:32.319> on<00:03:32.530> them<00:03:32.620> aboard<00:03:32.829> as<00:03:33.010> well<00:03:33.159> to

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
flame eBoost on them aboard as well to

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.780 
flame eBoost on them aboard as well to
let<00:03:33.430> me<00:03:33.489> know<00:03:33.579> that<00:03:33.699> I've<00:03:33.760> done<00:03:33.909> it<00:03:34.379> so<00:03:35.790> that's

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
let me know that I've done it so that's

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.550 
let me know that I've done it so that's
the<00:03:36.939> basics<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.840> can<00:03:37.959> then<00:03:38.079> start<00:03:38.229> putting

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
the basics you can then start putting

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.289 
the basics you can then start putting
those<00:03:38.650> together<00:03:38.859> so<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.340> can<00:03:39.370> do<00:03:39.639> a<00:03:39.970> trick

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
those together so you can do a trick

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.270 
those together so you can do a trick
into<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.750> grind<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:41.439> a<00:03:41.470> tricked<00:03:41.709> out<00:03:41.769> of<00:03:42.189> that

into a grind and a tricked out of that
grind<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:42.879> then<00:03:42.970> pull<00:03:43.239> another<00:03:43.419> grind<00:03:43.659> off

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
grind and then pull another grind off

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.869 
grind and then pull another grind off
the<00:03:43.840> back<00:03:43.989> of<00:03:44.139> that<00:03:44.250> keep<00:03:45.250> going<00:03:45.519> until<00:03:45.669> you

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
the back of that keep going until you

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.939 
the back of that keep going until you
know<00:03:46.299> you've<00:03:47.019> got<00:03:47.049> millions<00:03:47.319> and<00:03:47.620> millions<00:03:47.650> of

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
know you've got millions and millions of

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.300 
know you've got millions and millions of
points<00:03:48.099> just<00:03:48.879> going<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.060> skip<00:03:49.239> forward<00:03:49.419> to

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
points just going to skip forward to

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.439 
points just going to skip forward to
later<00:03:51.310> level<00:03:51.729> than<00:03:51.849> might<00:03:52.000> have<00:03:52.030> some<00:03:52.269> more

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
later level than might have some more

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.990 
later level than might have some more
combo<00:03:53.049> opportunities<00:03:53.669> you'll<00:03:54.669> see<00:03:54.819> what<00:03:54.939> the

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
combo opportunities you'll see what the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.869 
combo opportunities you'll see what the
axe<00:03:55.150> thing<00:03:55.329> really<00:03:55.479> comes<00:03:55.659> into<00:03:55.870> play<00:03:55.959> here<00:03:56.139> so

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
axe thing really comes into play here so

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.800 
axe thing really comes into play here so
once<00:03:57.879> you<00:03:57.970> start<00:03:58.209> linking<00:03:58.329> your<00:03:58.569> tricks

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
once you start linking your tricks

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.069 
once you start linking your tricks
together<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.439> getting<00:04:00.099> really<00:04:00.370> big<00:04:00.519> combos

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
together and getting really big combos

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.390 
together and getting really big combos

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
becomes super oh my face ok once you

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.909 
becomes super oh my face ok once you
were<00:04:10.139> once<00:04:11.139> you<00:04:11.259> start<00:04:11.470> getting<00:04:11.560> really

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
really big combo is it already comes

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.789 
really big combo is it already comes
down<00:04:13.509> to<00:04:13.629> hitting<00:04:13.870> exit<00:04:14.199> just<00:04:14.409> the<00:04:14.500> right<00:04:14.590> time

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
down to hitting exit just the right time

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.289 
down to hitting exit just the right time
at<00:04:14.979> the<00:04:15.009> very<00:04:15.250> end<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.639> I<00:04:15.729> combo<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.090> get<00:04:16.209> the

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
at the very end and I combo to get the

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.509 
at the very end and I combo to get the
most<00:04:16.479> points<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:17.829> could<00:04:18.039> link<00:04:18.220> all<00:04:18.340> this

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
most points so I could link all this

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.029 
most points so I could link all this
stuff<00:04:18.669> together<00:04:19.199> do<00:04:20.199> loads<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:20.560> tricks<00:04:20.799> but<00:04:20.919> if

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
stuff together do loads of tricks but if

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.350 
stuff together do loads of tricks but if
I<00:04:21.099> don't<00:04:21.159> know<00:04:21.370> that<00:04:21.579> perfect<00:04:21.970> landing<00:04:22.210> at<00:04:22.330> the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
I don't know that perfect landing at the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.280 
I don't know that perfect landing at the
end<00:04:22.570> zone

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
end zone

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.530 
end zone
and<00:04:23.410> then<00:04:24.340> my<00:04:24.520> school<00:04:24.730> gets<00:04:24.940> multiplied<00:04:25.360> by

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
and then my school gets multiplied by

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.720 
and then my school gets multiplied by
like<00:04:25.720> no<00:04:25.960> point<00:04:26.260> no<00:04:26.620> no<00:04:26.830> no<00:04:27.010> one<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.490> i<00:04:27.550> end<00:04:27.670> up

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
like no point no no no one and i end up

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.190 
like no point no no no one and i end up
with<00:04:27.790> basically<00:04:28.150> nothing<00:04:28.600> so<00:04:28.900> you<00:04:28.990> show<00:04:29.110> you

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
with basically nothing so you show you

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.880 
with basically nothing so you show you
the<00:04:29.290> difference<00:04:31.170> this<00:04:32.170> time<00:04:32.230> around<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:32.740> try

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
the difference this time around I try

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:41.430 
the difference this time around I try
and<00:04:32.950> do<00:04:33.070> something<00:04:33.190> super<00:04:33.520> good<00:04:40.290> so<00:04:41.290> that's

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
and do something super good so that's

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.410 
and do something super good so that's
like<00:04:41.560> 55,000<00:04:42.460> points<00:04:42.730> I<00:04:42.790> do<00:04:42.910> that<00:04:43.120> again<00:04:43.330> I'll

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
like 55,000 points I do that again I'll

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.930 
like 55,000 points I do that again I'll
and<00:04:43.600> its<00:04:43.750> lucky<00:04:44.020> let's<00:04:44.200> see<00:04:44.260> what<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:44.410> get<00:04:47.940> okay

like<00:05:40.810> poor<00:05:43.950> so<00:05:44.950> paul<00:05:45.160> also<00:05:45.370> starts<00:05:45.760> to

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
like poor so paul also starts to

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.010 
like poor so paul also starts to
introduce<00:05:46.150> something<00:05:46.330> else<00:05:46.570> knew<00:05:46.750> which<00:05:46.900> is

introduce something else knew which is

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.330 
introduce something else knew which is
these<00:05:47.170> double<00:05:47.500> height<00:05:47.680> levels<00:05:48.040> so<00:05:48.160> you've<00:05:48.310> got

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
these double height levels so you've got

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.770 
these double height levels so you've got
these<00:05:48.490> roofs<00:05:48.790> and<00:05:49.000> these<00:05:49.090> market<00:05:49.420> stalls<00:05:49.660> you
