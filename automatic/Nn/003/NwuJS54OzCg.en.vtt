are good and which exercises are bad for
their<00:00:13.530> condition<00:00:14.040> there's<00:00:14.580> millions<00:00:15.030> of

exercises<00:00:15.960> there's<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.279> many<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:18.090> count

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270

that<00:00:40.469> there's<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.210> certain

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that there's going to be certain

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.240 
that there's going to be certain
exercises<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.200> are<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.649> be<00:00:43.920> bad<00:00:44.219> for

exercises that are going to be bad for
your<00:00:44.700> back<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> reason<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.809> that

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
your back and the reason is is that

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.380 
your back and the reason is is that
you're<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> move<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.890> spine<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you're going to move your spine in the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.750 
you're going to move your spine in the
same<00:00:48.780> sort<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.289> direction<00:00:49.739> creating<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.489> same

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
same sort of direction creating the same

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.360 
same sort of direction creating the same
kinds<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.270> pressures<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> tissue<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.829> your

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
kinds of pressures on the tissue as your

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.389 
kinds of pressures on the tissue as your
day<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> day<00:00:53.960> functional<00:00:54.960> tasks<00:00:55.320> require<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.370> I

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
day to day functional tasks require so I

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.500 
day to day functional tasks require so I
can't<00:00:56.760> take<00:00:56.969> away

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510

moving your spine in the direction
that's<00:01:27.960> very<00:01:28.320> similar<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.829> what<00:01:29.100> caused<00:01:29.880> the

that's very similar to what caused the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.219 
that's very similar to what caused the
problem<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> first<00:01:30.720> place

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
problem in the first place

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.499 
problem in the first place
it's<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.369> challenge<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:32.939> patients<00:01:33.390> to

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
it's a it's a challenge for patients to

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.749 
it's a it's a challenge for patients to
understand<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.189> usually<00:01:35.430> requires

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
understand that and it usually requires

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.960 
understand that and it usually requires
a<00:01:36.479> clinical<00:01:37.409> assessment<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.850> know

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
a clinical assessment in the you know

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.080 
a clinical assessment in the you know
with<00:01:39.150> me<00:01:39.360> or<00:01:39.630> others<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:41.340> know<00:01:41.520> which<00:01:41.729> ones<00:01:41.970> are

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
with me or others to know which ones are

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.300 
with me or others to know which ones are
bad<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.659> definitely<00:01:42.869> depends<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:43.920> what<00:01:44.100> is

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
bad and it definitely depends on what is
