to<00:03:07.099> hold<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.459> post<00:03:07.670> underneath<00:03:08.359> and<00:03:08.629> tried<00:03:08.840> to

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
to hold the post underneath and tried to

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.349 
to hold the post underneath and tried to
remove<00:03:09.319> the<00:03:09.590> gym<00:03:09.859> that<00:03:10.250> was<00:03:10.400> magnetized<00:03:11.150> on

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
remove the gym that was magnetized on

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.509 
remove the gym that was magnetized on
the<00:03:11.420> top<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:12.260> was<00:03:12.379> really<00:03:12.859> hard<00:03:13.099> to<00:03:13.159> get<00:03:13.370> off

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
the top it was really hard to get off

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.220 
the top it was really hard to get off
but<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.090> think<00:03:14.329> that's<00:03:14.480> because<00:03:14.659> the<00:03:14.959> pen

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
but I think that's because the pen

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.589 
but I think that's because the pen
underneath<00:03:15.799> its<00:03:16.069> magnetic<00:03:16.609> was<00:03:17.150> drawing

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
underneath its magnetic was drawing

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.839 
underneath its magnetic was drawing
towards<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.230> holder<00:03:18.590> underneath<00:03:19.069> so<00:03:19.549> it<00:03:19.670> was

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
towards the holder underneath so it was

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.330 
towards the holder underneath so it was
like<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.239> was<00:03:20.359> creating<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.900> pole<00:03:21.139> and<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:21.889> when

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
like it was creating a pole and so when

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.849 
like it was creating a pole and so when
I<00:03:22.370> tried<00:03:22.790> without<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.720> tool<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.590> came<00:03:24.829> off

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
I tried without the tool it came off

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.460 
I tried without the tool it came off
easily<00:03:25.189> as<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:25.849> saw<00:03:26.090> in<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.629> earlier<00:03:27.019> footage

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
easily as you saw in the earlier footage

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.520 
easily as you saw in the earlier footage
I<00:03:27.980> would<00:03:28.669> say<00:03:28.939> is<00:03:29.239> if<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.989> have<00:03:30.169> one<00:03:30.379> that

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
I would say is if you have one that

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.220 
I would say is if you have one that
isn't<00:03:30.739> magnetized<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.730> need<00:03:31.939> to<00:03:32.060> stop<00:03:32.329> if<00:03:33.109> you

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
isn't magnetized you need to stop if you

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.740 
isn't magnetized you need to stop if you
have<00:03:33.409> one<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.709> is<00:03:33.769> magnetized<00:03:34.430> then<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.629> you

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
have one that is magnetized then and you

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.240 
have one that is magnetized then and you
can<00:03:35.870> get<00:03:36.049> it<00:03:36.139> off<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.290> get<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.709> making<00:03:37.069> twice

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
can get it off and get that making twice

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.429 
can get it off and get that making twice
base<00:03:37.639> on<00:03:37.909> then<00:03:38.359> you<00:03:38.510> find<00:03:38.750> you're<00:03:39.019> good<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.409> go

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.439 
base on then you find you're good to go

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.830 
base on then you find you're good to go
so<00:03:39.829> yeah<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:40.760> do<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.150> think<00:03:41.269> I'm<00:03:41.599> with<00:03:41.810> a

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
so yeah and do you think I'm with a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.360 
so yeah and do you think I'm with a
meeting<00:03:42.169> that<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.409> could<00:03:42.620> be<00:03:42.739> about<00:03:42.889> practice

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
meeting that it could be about practice

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.069 
meeting that it could be about practice
as<00:03:43.549> well<00:03:43.760> like<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.090> was<00:03:44.419> your<00:03:44.510> first<00:03:44.720> attempt

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079

easier<00:03:59.030> than<00:03:59.060> having<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.480> change<00:03:59.840> it<00:04:00.140> if<00:04:01.010> you

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
easier than having to change it if you

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.370 
easier than having to change it if you
didn't<00:04:01.610> have<00:04:01.760> these<00:04:01.940> and<00:04:02.300> it<00:04:02.569> was<00:04:02.720> stuck<00:04:03.110> and

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
didn't have these and it was stuck and

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.530 
didn't have these and it was stuck and
you'd<00:04:03.709> be<00:04:03.860> like<00:04:04.010> ah<00:04:04.310> what<00:04:05.060> do<00:04:05.120> I<00:04:05.180> do<00:04:05.270> now

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
you'd be like ah what do I do now

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.390
