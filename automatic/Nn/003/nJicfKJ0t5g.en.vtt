00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
way out to get to that Lister so this is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.260 
way out to get to that Lister so this is
the<00:01:23.450> second<00:01:24.200> most<00:01:24.470> difficult<00:01:25.130> vista<00:01:25.610> in

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
it looks like a steel structure that has

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.670 
it looks like a steel structure that has
been<00:01:37.190> broken<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.840> have<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.110> get<00:01:39.290> on<00:01:39.500> it

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680
