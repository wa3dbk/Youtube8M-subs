00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.019
 of billboards to bring a hint from where 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.050
 You will find the car you have so far. 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.270
 is the fastest car of hot dogs where 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.280
 You can steal this car so that you can 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 use this car on your missions 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.850
 good for those who do not know is great 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.309
 blog for you to get a car you 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.210
 have two options is three options you can 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.219
 buy it 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.710
 you can steal you can hack 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.649
 someone who has sputum and then you spend 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.989
 have access to this car and I ended up 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.960
 Finding where the car was 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.750
 It's really cool now that you've stayed 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.329
 available here in my list of cars 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.220
 for mission then it is if you take it here 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.950
 pull by cell here was the application 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.710
 car on demand and you tell us 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.710
 cars is performance 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.270
 You will see that you have here the 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:21.630
 bitter turbo boxer is the box berg r 1 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.390
 the sca this affects gt which is the name of the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.610
 car and the pope came, then let's go 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.710
 compare here the two most expensive cars 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.689
 that's here right then we have the Pope 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.040
 came here if you look here you will 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.340
 see that the maximum acceleration speed 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.520
 maximum durability two stars and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.850
 handling of almost 4 stars is there you 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.619
 here it affects gt 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.590
 you see there is maximum speed 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.140
 maximum acceleration durability 2 and 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.810
 handling of four is ie the car 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.530
 faster so far already found here 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.299
 It's in billboards at least for me, right? 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.180
 let it show in the shows the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.880
 progression of others so that's it 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.509
 Where is that on the map? 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.270
 You will hit the map button ok. 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.890
 and then it 's very easy for you to look like 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.840
 Do you have a map on the side of your house? 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.989
 this tip of the kinect map 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.420
 acting where you have to hack and there it is 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.819
 here it is more or less here at that point 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.340
 you will find're this has a 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.170
 box here near an ATM that 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.819
 asks you will find more or less 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.140
 here is an ATM that 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.330
 between these two ATMs 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.940
 in this block ok 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.000
 Good, there's an easier tip here. 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.150
 although there has been up there this 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.670
 aldora cnec usually return with this 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.540
 car is orange come back with the same car 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.940
 blue 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.200
 Just there you just go and get in here. 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.280
 within this logic 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.930
 okay you will find the car I 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.840

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.720
 I will not need to get him again, okay? 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.819
 But the car will be here or will it go?
