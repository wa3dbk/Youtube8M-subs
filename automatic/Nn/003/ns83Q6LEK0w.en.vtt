try<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> nose<00:01:23.909> down<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.630> least

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
try to get the nose down like at least

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.770 
try to get the nose down like at least
flatten<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.409> out<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:26.130> helps<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.270> if

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
flatten it out it helps if you have if

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.730 
flatten it out it helps if you have if
you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.470> put<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.729> nose<00:01:30.000> down<00:01:30.560> because<00:01:31.560> then

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
you can put the nose down because then

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.100 
you can put the nose down because then
you<00:01:31.860> get<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.130> leverage<00:01:32.340> pressure<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.840> push

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
you get more leverage pressure just push

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.080 
you get more leverage pressure just push
on<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:34.290> back<00:01:34.530> foot<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.460> more<00:01:35.759> friction

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
on your back foot and more friction

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.990 
on your back foot and more friction
which<00:01:36.420> gives<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.780> more<00:01:36.960> power<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.590> control

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
which gives you more power and control

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.260 
which gives you more power and control
two<00:01:39.650> ways<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.860> I'm<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> teach<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.280> my

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
two ways to do I'm going to teach you my

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.630 
two ways to do I'm going to teach you my
way<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:43.829> other<00:01:43.860> way<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.340> other<00:01:44.369> ways

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
way and the other way the other ways

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.200 
way and the other way the other ways
better<00:01:45.420> downstairs<00:01:46.020> or<00:01:46.170> whatever<00:01:47.060> first<00:01:48.060> of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
better downstairs or whatever first of

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.300 
better downstairs or whatever first of
all<00:01:48.799> where<00:01:49.799> you're<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.040> down

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.750 

of<00:01:53.310> course<00:01:53.520> okay<00:01:53.909> my<00:01:54.750> way<00:01:55.100> we're<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.190> only<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
of course okay my way we're not only and

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.710 
of course okay my way we're not only and
flatten<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.119> out<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:58.369> take<00:01:59.369> my<00:01:59.640> guess<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:00.630> have

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
flatten it out I take my guess I do have

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.859 
flatten it out I take my guess I do have
to<00:02:00.930> take<00:02:01.080> my<00:02:01.200> shoe<00:02:01.380> off<00:02:02.479> instead<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.600> just<00:02:03.720> like

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
to take my shoe off instead of just like

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.080 
to take my shoe off instead of just like
shaking<00:02:04.770> or<00:02:05.340> whatever<00:02:05.580> because<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.820> mean<00:02:05.970> look

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
shaking or whatever because I mean look

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.540 
shaking or whatever because I mean look
you<00:02:06.360> could<00:02:06.509> even<00:02:06.600> hear<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.280> my<00:02:08.280> shoes

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you could even hear that my shoes

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.479 
you could even hear that my shoes
sliding<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.780> won't<00:02:10.289> get<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:10.979> fast<00:02:11.220> as<00:02:11.400> a

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
sliding so you won't get as fast as a

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.070 
sliding so you won't get as fast as a
spin<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.510> when<00:02:12.660> you're<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> air<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.610> kind<00:02:14.610> of

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
spin so when you're in the air I kind of

or<00:02:19.890> whatever<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.550> don't<00:02:20.730> Ollie<00:02:21.000> pushing

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
or whatever like you don't Ollie pushing

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.979 
or whatever like you don't Ollie pushing
then<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.040> know<00:02:23.069> your<00:02:23.489> back<00:02:23.670> foot

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
then like that you know your back foot

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.440 
then like that you know your back foot
comes<00:02:24.989> off<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.440> little<00:02:25.590> bit<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.700> like<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.120> take

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
comes off a little bit so I like to take

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.470 
comes off a little bit so I like to take
it<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:28.140> when<00:02:28.290> my<00:02:28.410> back<00:02:28.620> foot<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.480> part

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
it and when my back foot is in that part

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.560 
it and when my back foot is in that part
of<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.600> air<00:02:30.930> where<00:02:31.739> it's<00:02:31.890> like<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.489> then<00:02:32.730> i

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
of the air where it's like that then i

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.930 
of the air where it's like that then i
flatten<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.200> nose<00:02:34.410> down<00:02:34.709> my<00:02:35.340> foot<00:02:35.610> kind<00:02:35.850> of

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
flatten the nose down my foot kind of

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.509 
flatten the nose down my foot kind of
goes<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.390> little<00:02:37.350> bit<00:02:37.620> behind<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:39.800> board<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.459> I

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
goes a little bit behind the board and I

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.900 
goes a little bit behind the board and I
kind<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.790> flick<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.810> like<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.730> got

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
kind of flick it like that so I got

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.090 
kind of flick it like that so I got
under<00:02:45.239> flip<00:02:45.510> but<00:02:46.380> when<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.620> do<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.860> under

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
under flip but when you do the under

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.270 
under flip but when you do the under
flip<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:48.120> can't<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.720> trucks<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.130> doesn't

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
flip you can't be trucks so it doesn't

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.110 
flip you can't be trucks so it doesn't
flip<00:02:52.069> so<00:02:53.069> that's<00:02:53.280> that's<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.670> way<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.970> do

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
flip so that's that's the way that I do

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.350 
flip so that's that's the way that I do
Ollie<00:02:54.600> bone<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.829> out<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.280> then<00:02:56.310> take<00:02:57.209> your

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
Ollie bone it out and then take your

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.880 
Ollie bone it out and then take your
foot<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.900> kick<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.410> side<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:59.630> it<00:03:00.829> sounds<00:03:01.829> a

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
foot and kick the side of it it sounds a

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.500 
foot and kick the side of it it sounds a
little<00:03:02.100> difficult<00:03:02.549> but<00:03:02.700> once<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.299> actually

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
little difficult but once you actually

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.220 
little difficult but once you actually
try<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> air<00:03:04.470> it's<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.489> lot<00:03:05.790> like<00:03:06.570> just

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
try it in the air it's a lot like just

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.380 
try it in the air it's a lot like just
go<00:03:07.320> out<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.530> try<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.829> and<00:03:08.070> like<00:03:08.670> flatten<00:03:09.299> the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
go out and try it and like flatten the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.319 
go out and try it and like flatten the
nose<00:03:09.570> out<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.959> then<00:03:10.110> kick<00:03:10.739> also<00:03:11.549> wait<00:03:11.970> until

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
nose out and then kick also wait until

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.560 
nose out and then kick also wait until
you're<00:03:12.690> at<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.959> height<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.590> your<00:03:14.250> all<00:03:14.570> because

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
you're at the height of your all because

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.080 
you're at the height of your all because
uh<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:16.049> got<00:03:16.560> like<00:03:16.739> sometimes<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.670> try<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:17.880> do<00:03:18.000> it

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
uh I got like sometimes I try to do it

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.660 
uh I got like sometimes I try to do it
really<00:03:18.329> late<00:03:18.480> like<00:03:19.079> when<00:03:19.230> I'm<00:03:19.320> coming<00:03:19.769> all<00:03:19.950> the

really late like when I'm coming all the
way<00:03:20.700> back<00:03:21.030> down<00:03:21.090> run<00:03:21.720> about<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.110> ground

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
way back down run about to the ground

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.840 
way back down run about to the ground
then<00:03:22.470> do<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.739> I<00:03:22.920> mean<00:03:23.370> that's<00:03:23.489> why<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:23.640> tell

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
pushing really hard you got to have all

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.920 
pushing really hard you got to have all
that<00:03:34.920> friction<00:03:35.370> mob<00:03:36.299> griptape<00:03:36.570> will<00:03:36.810> help

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
that friction mob griptape will help

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.610 
that friction mob griptape will help
this<00:03:37.140> is<00:03:38.040> jess<00:03:38.310> up<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.609> sucks<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:40.410> i<00:03:40.440> really

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
this is jess up it sucks so i really

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.430 
this is jess up it sucks so i really
have<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.890> do<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.130> like<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.989> go<00:03:43.109> out<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.380> do

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
have to do it like so you go out and do

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.770 
have to do it like so you go out and do
it<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.590> know<00:03:43.680> ollie<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.280> then<00:03:44.880> kick<00:03:45.120> front

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
it you know ollie and then kick front

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.090 
it you know ollie and then kick front
foot<00:03:45.959> doesn't<00:03:46.109> do<00:03:46.320> any<00:03:46.560> things<00:03:46.769> your<00:03:46.950> back

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
foot doesn't do any things your back

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.069 
foot doesn't do any things your back
foot<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.370> mean<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:48.180> can<00:03:48.299> scissor<00:03:48.540> kick<00:03:48.840> it

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
foot I mean you can scissor kick it

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.130 
foot I mean you can scissor kick it
makes<00:03:49.859> it<00:03:50.010> easier<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:51.180> can<00:03:51.269> do<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.480> 360<00:03:51.959> like

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
makes it easier you can do it 360 like

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.599 
makes it easier you can do it 360 like
that<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.560> just<00:03:52.590> put<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:52.950> lot<00:03:53.100> of<00:03:53.130> force<00:03:53.370> or<00:03:53.459> two

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
that you just put a lot of force or two

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.050 
that you just put a lot of force or two
so<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:55.470> second<00:03:55.859> way<00:03:55.980> which<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.790> way<00:03:56.880> that

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
so the second way which is the way that

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.229 
so the second way which is the way that
the<00:03:57.510> pros<00:03:57.989> do<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.500> or<00:03:58.799> how<00:03:59.310> I'll<00:03:59.579> do<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.910> going

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
the pros do it or how I'll do it going

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.510 
the pros do it or how I'll do it going
down<00:04:00.419> a<00:04:00.449> set<00:04:01.350> or<00:04:01.560> gap<00:04:01.769> or<00:04:02.010> light<00:04:02.190> or<00:04:02.340> whatever

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
down a set or gap or light or whatever

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.750 
down a set or gap or light or whatever
is<00:04:03.610> when<00:04:03.790> you<00:04:03.910> ollie<00:04:05.310> really<00:04:06.310> high<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.460> then

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
is when you ollie really high and then

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.120 
is when you ollie really high and then
when<00:04:06.910> you're<00:04:07.000> like<00:04:07.380> probably<00:04:08.380> half<00:04:08.590> way<00:04:08.830> past

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
when you're like probably half way past

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.740 
when you're like probably half way past
the<00:04:09.400> ledge<00:04:09.640> when<00:04:10.030> you're<00:04:10.150> going<00:04:10.300> down<00:04:10.570> or

the ledge when you're going down or
whatever<00:04:11.160> then<00:04:12.160> you<00:04:12.430> kick<00:04:13.120> it<00:04:13.150> around<00:04:13.360> but<00:04:14.040> you

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
whatever then you kick it around but you

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.830 
whatever then you kick it around but you
gotta<00:04:15.220> have<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.370> lot<00:04:15.490> of<00:04:15.520> air<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:16.000> do<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.330> like

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
gotta have a lot of air to do that like

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.960 
gotta have a lot of air to do that like
you're<00:04:16.959> throwing<00:04:17.140> flat<00:04:17.470> ground<00:04:17.800> that's<00:04:18.730> why<00:04:18.940> I

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
you're throwing flat ground that's why I

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.860 
you're throwing flat ground that's why I
keep<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.390> side<00:04:19.630> because<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:20.049> need<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.350> fast<00:04:20.860> spin

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
keep the side because I need a fast spin

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.970 
keep the side because I need a fast spin
it'll<00:04:22.870> go<00:04:22.990> slow<00:04:23.260> if<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:23.530> do<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.800> other<00:04:23.830> way

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
it'll go slow if you do it the other way

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.160 
it'll go slow if you do it the other way
so<00:04:24.940> you<00:04:25.720> could<00:04:25.840> go<00:04:25.960> off<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.140> ramp<00:04:26.410> or<00:04:26.710> go

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
so you could go off a ramp or go

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.470 
so you could go off a ramp or go
downstairs<00:04:29.170> so<00:04:29.470> Ollie<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:30.190> then<00:04:31.090> when<00:04:31.390> you're

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480

downstairs so Ollie and then when you're
coming<00:04:31.780> just<00:04:32.460> sip<00:04:33.460> it<00:04:33.730> um<00:04:33.940> it's<00:04:34.690> almost<00:04:34.870> like<00:04:35.020> a

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
coming just sip it um it's almost like a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.410 
coming just sip it um it's almost like a
bail<00:04:35.410> you'll<00:04:36.100> be<00:04:36.490> coming<00:04:36.940> down<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.240> hallway

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420
