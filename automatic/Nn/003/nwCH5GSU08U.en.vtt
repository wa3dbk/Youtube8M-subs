00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
that but I knew I didn't want to do it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.800 
that but I knew I didn't want to do it
on<00:01:48.619> my<00:01:48.740> own<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.279> I<00:01:49.369> know<00:01:49.520> some<00:01:49.789> women<00:01:49.939> go<00:01:50.659> off

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.179 
on my own so I know some women go off
and<00:01:51.049> do<00:01:51.169> it<00:01:51.200> on<00:01:51.289> there<00:01:51.409> but<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.619> just<00:01:51.709> wasn't<00:01:51.979> one

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
and do it on there but I just wasn't one

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.739 
and do it on there but I just wasn't one
of<00:01:52.219> those<00:01:52.369> women<00:01:52.609> and<00:01:52.789> so<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:53.119> was<00:01:53.509> sort<00:01:53.630> of

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
of those women and so I was sort of

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:55.359 
of those women and so I was sort of
trying<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.109> let<00:01:54.289> go<00:01:54.529> of<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:54.799> idea<00:01:54.829> of<00:01:55.249> having

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
trying to let go of the idea of having
