the apple store and we were wondering

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.549 
the apple store and we were wondering
why<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.610> didn't<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.090> iBooks<00:00:39.450> icon<00:00:39.809> but

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
why we didn't have this iBooks icon but

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.040 
why we didn't have this iBooks icon but
now<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.950> iOS<00:00:41.340> 8.1<00:00:41.850> Apple<00:00:42.300> has<00:00:42.450> updated<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
now in iOS 8.1 Apple has updated the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
now in iOS 8.1 Apple has updated the
iBooks<00:00:43.379> icon<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> book<00:00:44.579> has<00:00:44.820> now<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.300> of

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
iBooks icon so the book has now more of

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.240 
iBooks icon so the book has now more of
our<00:00:45.480> rounded<00:00:45.870> look<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.350> instead<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:47.039> that

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
our rounded look to it instead of that

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.220 
our rounded look to it instead of that
more<00:00:47.430> squared-off<00:00:47.910> look<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
more squared-off look so that was the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.860

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.170 
them a lot better so just a slight
change<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.979> make<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> UI<00:01:11.490> look<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:12.030> better

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
wanted to change the privacy settings on

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.679 
wanted to change the privacy settings on
your<00:01:26.340> device<00:01:26.490> you'd<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> go<00:01:27.600> into

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
your device you'd have to go into

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
your device you'd have to go into
settings<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:28.380> privacy<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:29.850> you

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
settings and then privacy but now you

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.700 
settings and then privacy but now you
can<00:01:30.360> throw<00:01:30.600> all<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> way<00:01:30.990> down<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.320> settings

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
can throw all the way down in settings

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.499 
can throw all the way down in settings
and<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.040> shows<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> apps<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.299> your<00:01:33.329> device
