so<00:00:23.529> special<00:00:24.419> let<00:00:25.419> me<00:00:25.539> give<00:00:25.660> you<00:00:25.750> two<00:00:25.779> reasons

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.320 

first<00:00:28.680> off<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.340> experiment<00:00:29.940> is<00:00:30.119> pretty

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
first off the experiment is pretty

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.560 
first off the experiment is pretty
powerful<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.800> add<00:00:32.009> levels<00:00:32.220> we<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.270> remove

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
powerful we can add levels we can remove

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.460 
powerful we can add levels we can remove
levels<00:00:34.489> we<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.900> give<00:00:36.900> XP

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
levels we can give XP

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.799 
levels we can give XP
but<00:00:39.010> we<00:00:39.160> can't<00:00:39.430> remove<00:00:39.820> EXPEED

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.069 

secondly<00:00:43.820> giving<00:00:44.820> XP<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> lower<00:00:45.690> levels

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
secondly giving XP in the lower levels

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.830 
secondly giving XP in the lower levels
even<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.399> smallest<00:00:47.699> amount<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.300> give<00:00:48.449> one

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
even the smallest amount we can give one

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.259 
even the smallest amount we can give one
XP<00:00:49.230> further<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.129> quite<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> huge<00:00:50.610> chunk<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
XP further up quite a huge chunk of the

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:52.630 
XP further up quite a huge chunk of the
whole<00:00:51.390> bar

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
whole bar

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.900 
whole bar
but<00:00:53.600> in<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.870> higher<00:00:54.079> levels<00:00:54.470> you<00:00:54.760> might<00:00:55.760> not

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
but in the higher levels you might not

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.210 
but in the higher levels you might not
even<00:00:56.059> notice<00:00:56.450> it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
even notice it

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.680 
even notice it
despite<00:00:58.220> that<00:00:58.460> P<00:00:58.670> bar<00:00:58.850> I<00:00:58.879> showed<00:00:59.239> you<00:00:59.480> was

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
despite that P bar I showed you was

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.750 
despite that P bar I showed you was
filling<00:01:00.650> up<00:01:00.770> pretty<00:01:00.800> smoothly<00:01:01.340> wasn't<00:01:01.760> it

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
filling up pretty smoothly wasn't it

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.210 
filling up pretty smoothly wasn't it
so<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
so do that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.270 
so do that
while<00:01:05.910> we<00:01:06.120> can<00:01:06.330> remove<00:01:06.660> XP<00:01:07.050> directly<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:08.160> are

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
while we can remove XP directly we are

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.030 
while we can remove XP directly we are
able<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.820> reset<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> whole<00:01:09.420> XP<00:01:09.840> bar<00:01:10.020> either<00:01:10.740> by

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
able to reset the whole XP bar either by

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.180 
able to reset the whole XP bar either by
giving<00:01:11.160> more<00:01:11.550> XP<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.960> next<00:01:13.200> level<00:01:13.470> or

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
giving more XP to it the next level or

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.520 
giving more XP to it the next level or
by<00:01:14.640> removing<00:01:14.820> more<00:01:15.360> levels<00:01:15.750> than<00:01:16.080> we

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
by removing more levels than we

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.760 
by removing more levels than we
currently<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:17.190> in<00:01:17.930> both<00:01:18.930> cases<00:01:19.230> the<00:01:19.740> whole

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
currently have in both cases the whole

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.800 
currently have in both cases the whole
XP<00:01:20.280> bar<00:01:20.400> will<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.760> cleared<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.510> are<00:01:21.630> able

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
XP bar will be cleared and we are able

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.950 
XP bar will be cleared and we are able
to<00:01:21.930> add<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.380> actual<00:01:22.740> amount<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.160> XP<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.670> want

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
to add the actual amount of XP we want

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.080 
to add the actual amount of XP we want
so<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.020> will<00:01:25.350> appear<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:25.980> if<00:01:26.010> we<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.760> removed

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
so it will appear as if we just removed

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
so it will appear as if we just removed
XP

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
XP

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.910 
XP
what<00:01:29.580> about<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.970> other<00:01:30.120> problem<00:01:30.680> let's<00:01:31.680> say<00:01:31.890> I

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
what about the other problem let's say I

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950 
what about the other problem let's say I
am<00:01:32.250> at<00:01:32.400> level<00:01:32.760> zero<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.450> want<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.690> fill<00:01:33.870> up

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
am at level zero and want to fill up

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.840 
am at level zero and want to fill up
exactly<00:01:34.440> half<00:01:34.980> of<00:01:35.250> our<00:01:35.400> XP<00:01:35.820> bar<00:01:36.770> well<00:01:37.770> 3<00:01:38.250> XP<00:01:38.580> is

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
exactly half of our XP bar well 3 XP is

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.000 
exactly half of our XP bar well 3 XP is
not<00:01:39.180> enough<00:01:39.510> and<00:01:40.010> 4<00:01:41.010> X<00:01:41.190> P<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.550> already<00:01:41.850> too<00:01:42.030> much

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
not enough and 4 X P is already too much

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.040 
not enough and 4 X P is already too much
what<00:01:44.010> we<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.400> ever<00:01:44.610> after<00:01:45.300> resetting<00:01:45.810> our

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
what we can do ever after resetting our

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.410 
what we can do ever after resetting our
cone<00:01:46.260> state<00:01:46.700> let's<00:01:47.700> jump<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.150> a<00:01:48.180> higher<00:01:48.450> level

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
cone state let's jump to a higher level

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.940 
cone state let's jump to a higher level
then<00:01:51.420> give<00:01:51.630> ourselves<00:01:51.750> enough<00:01:52.260> XP<00:01:52.650> to<00:01:52.800> get

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
then give ourselves enough XP to get

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.170 
then give ourselves enough XP to get
half<00:01:53.370> of<00:01:53.520> our<00:01:53.700> bar<00:01:53.910> for

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.820 

and<00:01:57.270> then<00:01:57.840> remove<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> levels<00:01:58.650> again

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.980 

and<00:02:02.830> you<00:02:02.950> see<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.460> state<00:02:03.760> of<00:02:03.880> our<00:02:04.030> crunch<00:02:04.330> XP

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
and you see the state of our crunch XP

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.500 
and you see the state of our crunch XP
bar<00:02:05.140> stays<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.950> same<00:02:06.000> even<00:02:07.000> though<00:02:07.090> at<00:02:07.240> level

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
bar stays the same even though at level

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.330 
bar stays the same even though at level
zero<00:02:07.720> this<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.200> technically<00:02:08.590> not<00:02:08.800> possible

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
zero this is technically not possible

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.530 
zero this is technically not possible
and<00:02:10.260> that's<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.530> whole<00:02:11.650> trick<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:13.360> is

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and that's the whole trick and this is

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.360 
and that's the whole trick and this is
it<00:02:13.660> be<00:02:13.840> complete<00:02:14.140> setup<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.860> can<00:02:15.040> find<00:02:15.250> a

these<00:02:26.620> scoreboard<00:02:27.040> objectives<00:02:27.430> are<00:02:27.550> used<00:02:27.790> for

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
these scoreboard objectives are used for

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.480 
these scoreboard objectives are used for
the<00:02:28.270> system<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:29.410> will<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.770> create<00:02:30.040> them<00:02:30.280> for

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
the system so it will to create them for

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.360 
the system so it will to create them for
the<00:02:30.640> first<00:02:31.060> use<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.800> all<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:32.860> have<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.040> do<00:02:33.160> now

the first use and all you have to do now

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.090 
the first use and all you have to do now
is<00:02:33.640> activating<00:02:34.600> all<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.560> command<00:02:35.830> blocks<00:02:36.010> in

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
is activating all the command blocks in

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.500 
is activating all the command blocks in
the<00:02:36.190> back<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:36.910> use<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> fill<00:02:37.270> command

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
the back you can just use a fill command

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.030 
the back you can just use a fill command
in<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.780> middle<00:02:37.990> with<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.470> redstone<00:02:38.830> blocks

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
in the middle with the redstone blocks

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.040 
in the middle with the redstone blocks
you<00:02:39.880> also<00:02:40.000> have<00:02:40.209> these<00:02:40.510> two<00:02:40.570> command<00:02:40.900> blocks

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
you also have these two command blocks

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.840 
you also have these two command blocks
here<00:02:41.200> which<00:02:41.380> will<00:02:41.560> do<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.800> for<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.160> so

pressing this button should give you
enough<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.070> play<00:02:45.280> around<00:02:45.490> with<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:46.320> now<00:02:47.320> let<00:02:47.500> me

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
enough to play around with it now let me

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.260 
enough to play around with it now let me
go<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:47.830> game-mode<00:02:48.190> 0<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.000> can<00:02:49.150> actually

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
go in game-mode 0 so you can actually

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.770 
go in game-mode 0 so you can actually
see<00:02:49.660> my<00:02:49.840> XP<00:02:50.200> bar<00:02:50.760> just<00:02:51.760> pressing<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:52.720> button

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
see my XP bar just pressing this button

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.900 
see my XP bar just pressing this button
now<00:02:53.110> doesn't<00:02:53.709> do<00:02:53.770> anything<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.490> that's<00:02:54.730> good

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
now doesn't do anything and that's good

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.300 
now doesn't do anything and that's good
because<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:56.170> system<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.590> made<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:56.890> ignore

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
because the system is made to ignore

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.040 
because the system is made to ignore
everyone<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.240> doesn't<00:02:58.570> have<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.840> proper

well the 33% fold XP bar let's play it

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.130 
well the 33% fold XP bar let's play it
for<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.880> chat<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.240> clear<00:03:37.450> out<00:03:37.600> so<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.870> can<00:03:37.990> see

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
for the chat to clear out so you can see

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.670 
for the chat to clear out so you can see
it<00:03:38.230> there

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
it there

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.550 
it there
42<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.340> that's<00:03:40.120> that<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.630> can<00:03:41.020> change<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.410> to

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
42 and that's that I can change it to

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.880 
42 and that's that I can change it to
let's<00:03:41.890> say<00:03:42.130> 99<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:45.210> other<00:03:46.210> one

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
let's say 99 and other one

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.850 
let's say 99 and other one
I'm<00:03:47.890> another<00:03:48.250> one<00:03:48.460> with<00:03:48.700> 99%<00:03:49.180> and

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.870 

why<00:03:53.400> not<00:03:53.520> go<00:03:53.640> high<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:55.340> progress<00:03:56.340> that's

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
why not go high and progress that's

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.070 
why not go high and progress that's
exactly<00:03:57.570> 50

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.100 

and<00:04:00.200> that's<00:04:00.830> done<00:04:01.010> out<00:04:01.160> as<00:04:01.250> well<00:04:01.600> so<00:04:02.600> that's

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
and that's done out as well so that's

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.870 
and that's done out as well so that's
already<00:04:03.320> a<00:04:03.530> system<00:04:03.830> that's<00:04:04.220> how<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.460> use<00:04:04.700> it

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
already a system that's how to use it

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.130 
already a system that's how to use it
and<00:04:05.500> by<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.530> way<00:04:06.680> if<00:04:06.800> you're<00:04:06.950> wondering<00:04:07.310> about

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
and by the way if you're wondering about

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.760 
and by the way if you're wondering about
the<00:04:09.140> demonstration<00:04:09.710> I<00:04:10.070> did<00:04:10.220> in<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.370> beginning

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
the demonstration I did in the beginning

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.500 
the demonstration I did in the beginning
that<00:04:12.770> was<00:04:12.920> done<00:04:13.190> by<00:04:13.400> adding<00:04:13.670> a<00:04:13.970> clock<00:04:14.210> to<00:04:14.360> this

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
that was done by adding a clock to this

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.690 
that was done by adding a clock to this
and<00:04:15.260> having<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.620> little<00:04:15.830> setup<00:04:16.070> that<00:04:16.430> either

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
and having a little setup that either

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.800 
and having a little setup that either
increases<00:04:17.510> or<00:04:17.540> decreases<00:04:18.049> my<00:04:18.739> experience

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
increases or decreases my experience

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.280 
increases or decreases my experience
depending<00:04:20.810> on<00:04:20.930> which<00:04:21.170> state<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.739> switches<00:04:22.160> in

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.210 

that's<00:04:24.860> simple

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
that's simple

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.450 
that's simple
so<00:04:26.820> thanks<00:04:27.450> for<00:04:27.480> watching<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:28.100> see<00:04:29.100> you<00:04:29.190> next
