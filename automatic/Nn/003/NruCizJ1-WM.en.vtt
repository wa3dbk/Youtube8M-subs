primarily<00:00:00.510> the<00:00:00.630> phase<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.560> echo<00:00:01.890> what<00:00:01.920> you<00:00:02.129> saw

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
primarily the phase to echo what you saw

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.810 
primarily the phase to echo what you saw
in<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.429> previous<00:00:02.820> videos<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.480> phase<00:00:03.689> one

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:05.820 
in the previous videos the phase one

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.250 
in the previous videos the phase one
most<00:00:06.820> of<00:00:07.000> this<00:00:07.120> all<00:00:07.330> happened<00:00:07.840> in<00:00:07.960> the<00:00:08.020> last

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
most of this all happened in the last

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.110 
most of this all happened in the last
year<00:00:09.010> or<00:00:09.040> so<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:11.290> here<00:00:11.559> we<00:00:11.710> are<00:00:11.860> flowering<00:00:12.820> it

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
year or so so here we are flowering it

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.279 
year or so so here we are flowering it
flour<00:00:13.719> blend<00:00:14.520> facility<00:00:15.520> upstairs<00:00:16.000> and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
flour blend facility upstairs and

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.740 
flour blend facility upstairs and
this<00:00:18.099> was<00:00:18.369> the<00:00:18.400> beginning<00:00:18.730> of<00:00:18.999> the<00:00:19.269> 11<00:00:19.630> min

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
this was the beginning of the 11 min

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.740 
this was the beginning of the 11 min
endurance<00:00:20.230> wipe<00:00:20.500> and<00:00:20.829> the<00:00:21.519> aircraft<00:00:22.239> they<00:00:22.630> are

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
endurance wipe and the aircraft they are

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.749 
endurance wipe and the aircraft they are
actually<00:00:23.050> the<00:00:23.289> same<00:00:23.349> aircraft<00:00:23.739> as<00:00:24.310> this

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
actually the same aircraft as this

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.990 
actually the same aircraft as this
Malcolm<00:00:26.219> this<00:00:27.219> was<00:00:27.399> before<00:00:27.550> it<00:00:27.880> was

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
Malcolm this was before it was

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.100 
Malcolm this was before it was
rearranged<00:00:28.660> to<00:00:29.289> fit<00:00:29.829> with<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.839> commuter<00:00:31.839> body

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
rearranged to fit with the commuter body

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.380 
rearranged to fit with the commuter body
so<00:00:32.890> actually<00:00:33.070> all<00:00:33.399> the<00:00:33.519> actuators<00:00:34.239> and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
so actually all the actuators and

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.770 
so actually all the actuators and
propulsion<00:00:35.110> system<00:00:39.269> mechanisms<00:00:40.269> are<00:00:40.570> all<00:00:40.690> the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
propulsion system mechanisms are all the

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.869 
propulsion system mechanisms are all the
same<00:00:40.960> centered<00:00:41.470> in<00:00:41.589> here<00:00:41.890> you<00:00:42.370> can<00:00:42.519> tell<00:00:42.699> even

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
same centered in here you can tell even

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.969 
same centered in here you can tell even
at<00:00:43.089> that<00:00:43.239> point<00:00:43.659> which<00:00:43.960> was<00:00:44.199> reason<00:00:44.589> it<00:00:44.680> didn't

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:44.979 
at that point which was reason it didn't

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:50.549 
at that point which was reason it didn't
look<00:00:45.040> like<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.309> could<00:00:45.640> be<00:00:45.879> heard<00:00:46.629> but<00:00:49.199> so<00:00:50.199> this

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
look like it could be heard but so this

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.490 
look like it could be heard but so this
is<00:00:51.059> aerobatic<00:00:52.059> maneuver<00:00:52.509> so<00:00:52.659> here<00:00:52.930> it<00:00:53.199> did<00:00:53.409> an

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
is aerobatic maneuver so here it did an

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.320 
is aerobatic maneuver so here it did an
autonomous<00:00:54.960> 360-degree<00:00:55.960> lateral<00:00:56.350> flip<00:00:57.009> and

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
autonomous 360-degree lateral flip and

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.749 
autonomous 360-degree lateral flip and
all<00:00:58.330> I<00:00:58.390> did<00:00:58.689> was<00:00:58.720> hit<00:00:59.049> a<00:00:59.110> button<00:00:59.259> and<00:00:59.759> Carl

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:00.759 
all I did was hit a button and Carl

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:03.240 
all I did was hit a button and Carl
clean<00:01:01.000> be<00:01:01.180> like<00:01:01.449> chief<00:01:01.720> engineer<00:01:02.259> did<00:01:03.009> the

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
clean be like chief engineer did the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.600 
clean be like chief engineer did the
programming<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:05.100> facilitate<00:01:06.100> that<00:01:06.280> maneuver

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
programming to facilitate that maneuver

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.370 
programming to facilitate that maneuver
so<00:01:06.909> it<00:01:07.060> gave<00:01:07.210> it<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.729> very<00:01:10.420> hard<00:01:10.689> roll<00:01:10.990> command

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
so it gave it a very hard roll command

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.670 
so it gave it a very hard roll command
and<00:01:11.740> did<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:11.979> full<00:01:12.310> 360<00:01:13.150> degree<00:01:13.630> rotation<00:01:14.229> and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
and did a full 360 degree rotation and

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.580 
and did a full 360 degree rotation and
recovered<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:15.970> all<00:01:16.869> I<00:01:17.020> had<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.200> do<00:01:17.320> was<00:01:17.439> hit<00:01:17.530> a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
recovered and all I had to do was hit a

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.370 
recovered and all I had to do was hit a
button<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:19.119> here<00:01:19.360> we<00:01:19.509> are<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.899> first<00:01:20.079> time

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
button so here we are the first time

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.830 
button so here we are the first time
with<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.220> beleaguered<00:01:21.820> body<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.510> just

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
with the beleaguered body and just

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.430 
with the beleaguered body and just
trying<00:01:23.050> to<00:01:23.140> do<00:01:23.290> some<00:01:23.530> precision<00:01:23.890> hovering<00:01:25.440> so

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
trying to do some precision hovering so

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.060 
trying to do some precision hovering so
this<00:01:27.070> is<00:01:27.220> when<00:01:27.370> it<00:01:27.400> really<00:01:27.520> started<00:01:28.120> looking

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
this is when it really started looking

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.710 
this is when it really started looking
like<00:01:29.610> magic<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.300> had<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> burger

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
like magic because we had the burger

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.770 
like magic because we had the burger
body<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.290> there<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:32.400> put<00:01:32.580> some<00:01:33.420> kind<00:01:33.750> of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
body on there really put some kind of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.310 
body on there really put some kind of
fairly<00:01:34.080> realistic<00:01:34.440> we<00:01:34.950> were<00:01:35.010> pretty<00:01:35.820> happy

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
fairly realistic we were pretty happy

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.520 
fairly realistic we were pretty happy
try<00:01:37.320> not<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.550> bring<00:01:38.550> too<00:01:38.790> much<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.210> camera

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
try not to bring too much on camera

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.870 
try not to bring too much on camera
but<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.909> were<00:01:42.110> ecstatic<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:44.010> here<00:01:44.580> you<00:01:44.760> can

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
but we were ecstatic and here you can

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.870 
but we were ecstatic and here you can
see<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.350> prototype<00:01:46.350> ground<00:01:46.680> stations<00:01:47.280> only

display<00:01:52.080> with<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.350> video<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
display with the video and then the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.719 
display with the video and then the
tripod<00:01:53.940> has<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.509> radio<00:01:55.440> system<00:01:56.400> hub<00:01:56.610> on

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
tripod has the radio system hub on

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.310 
tripod has the radio system hub on
antenna<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.820> at<00:01:59.970> this<00:02:00.060> point<00:02:00.300> I<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:01.050> able<00:02:01.170> to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
antenna and at this point I was able to

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.399 
antenna and at this point I was able to
hover<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.800> very<00:02:02.070> tight<00:02:02.340> spot<00:02:03.140> this<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.290> an

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
hover in a very tight spot this is an

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.930 
hover in a very tight spot this is an
interesting<00:02:04.590> flight<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.700> without

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
interesting flight so here it is without

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.350 
interesting flight so here it is without
the<00:02:06.360> landing<00:02:07.200> skids<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.880> kind<00:02:09.270> of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the landing skids and this is kind of

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.979 
the landing skids and this is kind of
the<00:02:09.420> most<00:02:09.630> realistic<00:02:10.670> version<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.120> if<00:02:12.870> you

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
the most realistic version and if you

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.400 
the most realistic version and if you
look<00:02:13.200> at<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.410> closely<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.190> kind<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.790> see

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
look at it closely you can kind of see

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.520 
look at it closely you can kind of see
some<00:02:16.410> wiggle<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.450> see<00:02:18.630> through<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.080> bird

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
some wiggle you can see through the bird

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.040 
some wiggle you can see through the bird
body<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:20.100> can<00:02:20.250> see<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.910> little<00:02:21.120> bit<00:02:21.269> of<00:02:21.330> wiggle

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
body you can see a little bit of wiggle

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.490 
body you can see a little bit of wiggle
and<00:02:22.290> flight<00:02:22.890> control<00:02:23.310> mechanism<00:02:24.209> that's<00:02:24.660> part

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
and flight control mechanism that's part

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.259

of<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.680> high<00:02:25.890> speed<00:02:26.280> controls<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.209> are

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
of the high speed controls that are

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.030 
of the high speed controls that are
there<00:02:27.780> happening<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.380> be<00:02:28.440> able<00:02:28.530> time<00:02:28.800> but<00:02:28.980> I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
there happening to be able time but I

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.680 
there happening to be able time but I
don't<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.430> worry<00:02:29.670> about<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
don't have to worry about that the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.750 
don't have to worry about that the
onboard<00:02:31.170> control<00:02:31.560> system<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.100> working<00:02:32.250> at<00:02:32.519> all

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
onboard control system is working at all

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.330 
onboard control system is working at all
i'm<00:02:32.910> doing<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.390> saying<00:02:34.140> kind<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.500> fly<00:02:34.769> forward

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
i'm doing is saying kind of fly forward

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.070 
i'm doing is saying kind of fly forward
fly<00:02:35.580> backward<00:02:36.150> sideways<00:02:36.360> left

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
fly backward sideways left

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.320 
fly backward sideways left
alright<00:02:37.350> so<00:02:37.920> it's<00:02:38.010> pretty<00:02:38.250> simple<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.150> can

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
alright so it's pretty simple and I can

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.900 
alright so it's pretty simple and I can
take<00:02:39.450> my<00:02:39.630> hand<00:02:39.900> off<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.170> long<00:02:40.710> enough<00:02:41.040> to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
take my hand off that long enough to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.480 
take my hand off that long enough to
bring<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.240> in<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.920> catch<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.190> here<00:02:44.370> is

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
bring it in and catch it to here is

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.070 
bring it in and catch it to here is
outdoors<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.240> is<00:02:45.360> one<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.720> very<00:02:45.750> first

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
outdoors this is one of the very first

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.050 
outdoors this is one of the very first
outdoor<00:02:46.410> flights<00:02:46.980> again<00:02:47.190> with<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.610> bird<00:02:47.790> body

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
outdoor flights again with the bird body

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.720 
outdoor flights again with the bird body
in<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:49.230> upper<00:02:49.500> left<00:02:49.800> hand<00:02:49.920> corner<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.640> can

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
in the upper left hand corner you can

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.380 
in the upper left hand corner you can
see<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.830> first<00:02:52.830> video<00:02:53.160> imagery<00:02:53.910> from<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
see the first video imagery from the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.410 
see the first video imagery from the
aircraft<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.050> it's<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.290> little<00:02:55.410> bit<00:02:55.560> crude

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
aircraft and it's a little bit crude

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.090 
aircraft and it's a little bit crude
this<00:02:57.420> was<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.630> first<00:02:57.750> implementation<00:02:58.680> with<00:02:59.070> a

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
this was the first implementation with a

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.850 
this was the first implementation with a
video<00:02:59.400> camera<00:02:59.540> you<00:03:00.540> put<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:01.170> video<00:03:01.440> camera

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
video camera you put a video camera

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.040 
video camera you put a video camera
system<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.430> UAV<00:03:02.940> there's<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.780> lot<00:03:04.020> of

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
system on UAV there's a lot of

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.340 
system on UAV there's a lot of
fine-tuning<00:03:04.500> with<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:06.660> conditioning<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.230> the

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
fine-tuning with the conditioning of the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.560 
fine-tuning with the conditioning of the
power<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:07.950> signal<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.730> optics<00:03:09.210> this

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
power of the signal and the optics this

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.110 
power of the signal and the optics this
was<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.780> first<00:03:09.950> first<00:03:10.950> go<00:03:11.130> if<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:11.760> notice<00:03:12.030> at

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
was the first first go if you notice at

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.050 
was the first first go if you notice at
the<00:03:12.150> bottom<00:03:12.240> of<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.140> inset<00:03:14.010> window<00:03:14.490> video<00:03:14.970> you

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
the bottom of the inset window video you

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.180 
the bottom of the inset window video you
can<00:03:15.300> see<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.600> wingtips<00:03:16.050> commencement<00:03:16.770> of<00:03:16.920> you

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
can see the wingtips commencement of you

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.000 
can see the wingtips commencement of you
because<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.030> video<00:03:18.450> cameras<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:19.200> just<00:03:19.740> in<00:03:19.890> the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
because the video cameras is just in the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.270 
because the video cameras is just in the
neck<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.690> bird<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.350> can<00:03:22.470> pick<00:03:22.680> up<00:03:22.740> the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
neck of the bird and it can pick up the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.000 
neck of the bird and it can pick up the
wings<00:03:23.490> when<00:03:23.760> they're<00:03:23.910> out<00:03:24.060> in<00:03:24.090> front

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.130 

and<00:03:28.099> since<00:03:28.819> DARPA<00:03:29.180> was<00:03:29.299> interested<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:29.900> flying

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
and since DARPA was interested in flying

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.220 
and since DARPA was interested in flying
indoors<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.430> up<00:03:31.580> close<00:03:31.879> to<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.840> outside<00:03:33.170> of

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
indoors and up close to the outside of

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
indoors and up close to the outside of
the<00:03:33.290> building<00:03:33.439> I<00:03:33.739> wanted<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.099> demonstrate

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
the building I wanted to demonstrate

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.240 
the building I wanted to demonstrate
that<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.120> fluid<00:03:36.110> outdoors<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.829> then<00:03:36.920> hovered

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
that so fluid outdoors and then hovered

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.160 
that so fluid outdoors and then hovered
it<00:03:37.370> lined<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.939> up<00:03:38.000> with<00:03:38.060> this<00:03:38.299> doorway<00:03:38.599> and<00:03:39.049> now

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
it lined it up with this doorway and now

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.869 
it lined it up with this doorway and now
i'm<00:03:39.290> flying<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.709> george<00:03:40.159> you<00:03:40.459> can<00:03:40.579> see<00:03:40.730> the

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
i'm flying to george you can see the

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.940 
i'm flying to george you can see the
video<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.390> upper<00:03:41.689> left<00:03:41.930> that's<00:03:42.739> the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
video of the upper left that's the

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.430 
video of the upper left that's the
flower<00:03:43.189> one<00:03:43.549> facility<00:03:44.180> where<00:03:44.720> we<00:03:44.959> did<00:03:45.349> the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
flower one facility where we did the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.510 
flower one facility where we did the
hanover<00:03:45.799> good<00:03:45.950> research<00:03:46.519> and

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
hanover good research and

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.510 
hanover good research and
so<00:03:49.240> here<00:03:49.420> we<00:03:49.570> r<00:03:49.600> i'm<00:03:50.320> charging<00:03:50.740> controlling<00:03:51.430> it

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
so here we r i'm charging controlling it

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.260 
so here we r i'm charging controlling it
to<00:03:51.790> rotate<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.420> around<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:53.050> fly<00:03:53.200> back<00:03:53.440> out

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.670 

it's<00:03:57.660> a<00:03:57.720> prototype<00:03:57.960> system<00:03:59.900> that's<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.440> best

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
it's a prototype system that's the best

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.980 
it's a prototype system that's the best
we<00:04:01.860> could<00:04:02.040> do<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.760> simulate<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.420> mission

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
we could do to simulate that mission

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.660 
we could do to simulate that mission
that<00:04:04.140> we<00:04:04.290> showed<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.650> in<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.860> first<00:04:05.040> video<00:04:05.310> at

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
that we showed you in the first video at

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.850 
that we showed you in the first video at
