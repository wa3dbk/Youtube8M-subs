when I blend it in it does look kind of
grey<00:01:33.110> but<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.560> blend<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.909> give<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.270> a

grey but as I blend it in if I give it a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.899 
grey but as I blend it in if I give it a
minute<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.259> oxidize<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:38.220> my<00:01:38.340> skin<00:01:38.700> tone

don't have to conceal when I where'd

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.229 
don't have to conceal when I where'd
this<00:02:56.830> um<00:02:57.600> BB<00:02:58.600> cream<00:02:58.870> because<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.770> pretty

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
this um BB cream because it is a pretty

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.330 
this um BB cream because it is a pretty
medium<00:03:01.260> coverage<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.440> wouldn't<00:03:02.709> say<00:03:02.860> it's<00:03:03.010> full

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
medium coverage I wouldn't say it's full

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.280 
medium coverage I wouldn't say it's full
I<00:03:03.640> mean<00:03:03.820> you<00:03:03.940> can<00:03:04.060> probably<00:03:04.270> make<00:03:04.570> it<00:03:04.750> full<00:03:04.989> but

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
I mean you can probably make it full but

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.500 
I mean you can probably make it full but
then<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:06.130> might<00:03:06.430> look<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.700> little<00:03:06.910> cakey<00:03:07.180> so<00:03:07.480> I

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
then it might look a little cakey so I

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.420 
then it might look a little cakey so I
don't<00:03:07.840> know<00:03:07.930> how<00:03:07.959> that<00:03:08.410> would<00:03:08.440> turn<00:03:08.590> out<00:03:08.860> but<00:03:09.220> I

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
don't know how that would turn out but I

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.400 
don't know how that would turn out but I
really<00:03:10.030> like<00:03:10.180> this<00:03:10.330> BB<00:03:10.690> cream<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:11.050> think<00:03:11.290> it's
