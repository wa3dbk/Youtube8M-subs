week<00:02:19.950> usually<00:02:20.450> those<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> little<00:02:21.720> delay

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959

between this update and the last update
but<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.450> assume<00:02:24.780> that's<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.140> because<00:02:25.230> they

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
but I assume that's just because they

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.560 
but I assume that's just because they
were<00:02:25.590> building<00:02:26.270> their<00:02:27.270> widget<00:02:28.040> which<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.160> like
