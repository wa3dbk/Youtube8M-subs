00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.509
 yes it's going super fast 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.320
 and be careful we will go into the 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:31.050
 mountain there just wrongly 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.809
 no doubt here we are at Valmeinier the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.950
 family resort ory the activity of the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.380
 quieter and more dizzying 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.270
 go we ask ourselves and we will find 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.920
 Ronan he can tell us 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.160
 more about what we can do 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.720
 in the area there is skiing for all 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.340
 levels as well beginners as 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.250
 confirmed with a beautiful ski area 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.440
 alpin the mobilboard the speed riding him 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.510
 hellemmes we have of course the paragliding 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.649
 near everything and everyone 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.910
 at the foot of the slopes so it's really 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.989
 a resort suitable for families 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.470
 for skiers and all others 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.870
 activities 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.030
 that's what I thought there is 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.189
 really for everyone here but say 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.219
 you mentioned the word billboard 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.469
 can you tell us a little more because 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.569
 that I'm not really sure of being 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.179
 well aware of this practice 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:20.850
 it's an electric device with two 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.229
 self balanced gyropode wheels which 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.030
 allows us to walk around 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.619
 paths for both people who are 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.999
 hiking enthusiasts should do 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.229
 a hike a little cooler and then also 

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:29.819
 for people who do not have the physique 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.340
 for the hike who want to go 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.649
 take a quiet walk 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.569
 but yes I had already seen in town 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.950
 must be really great to be able to 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.940
 to do mountain is so 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.830
 silent rides or like me 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.960
 a transport and who are those who in 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.580
 benefit most of the time it's going 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.530
 say a majority of people who have the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.210
 forty or so looking for 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.040
 another sensation but that is not 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.960
 a feeling of speed gliding bed 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.600
 it's an amazing sensation because the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.220
 on the snow it's pretty amazing and we 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.240
 still has people from 20 years 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.010
 who come to find others 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.020
 sensations and they are not looking for a 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.310
 different discovery of the mountain of 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.060
 electric way in an ecological way 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.760
 it's something that is very 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.010
 important also for that looks very 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.930
 instinctive that means of displacement in 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.180
 does just lean for 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.310
 advance and straighten up to brake 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.260
 or stop if we lose dresses using 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.760
 we can see how many kilometers 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.870
 on average we will not talk about 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.790
 kilometers because it's not a 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.200
 speed we'll talk about a time it's 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.680
 an initiation of one hour in general 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.180
 after one hour 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.310
 it's true we're in the mountains 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.510
 is also at 1800 meters altitude so 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.100
 after one hour it is largely 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.120
 enough to take pleasure in 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.520
 mobile yes yes we must already do 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.870
 nice walks and then after my 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.390
 emotions in ulm 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.400
 I think a little escape to 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.400
 mobilboard would do me the greatest good
