this oils Bentley sorry this turbo has

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.869 
this oils Bentley sorry this turbo has
been<00:00:39.600> leaking<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.930> lot<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.170> oil<00:00:40.550> did<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
been leaking a lot of oil did you see it

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.080 
been leaking a lot of oil did you see it
all<00:00:41.969> down<00:00:42.120> there<00:00:42.590> mark<00:00:43.590> everywhere<00:00:44.000> as<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
all down there mark everywhere as you

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.510 
all down there mark everywhere as you
drive<00:00:45.329> sprays<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.960> everywhere<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.399> that's

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
drive sprays it everywhere so that's

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
drive sprays it everywhere so that's
gonna<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.760> fixed<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> few<00:00:48.780> other<00:00:48.930> bits<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
gonna be fixed with a few other bits and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.170 
gonna be fixed with a few other bits and
pieces<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.739> while<00:00:49.920> I'm<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.219> gonna<00:00:51.000> make

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
pieces to do while I'm in you gonna make

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.360 
pieces to do while I'm in you gonna make
a<00:00:51.210> little<00:00:51.420> bracket<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.750> hold<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.370> few

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
a little bracket to hold that up few

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
a little bracket to hold that up few
other<00:00:53.489> bits<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.789> pieces<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.469> yeah<00:00:55.469> I'll<00:00:55.620> get

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
other bits and pieces so yeah I'll get

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.590 
other bits and pieces so yeah I'll get
started<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.309> show<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.030> progress<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.510> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
started on it show you the progress as I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.779 
started on it show you the progress as I
go

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
go

okay<00:00:59.789> so<00:00:59.850> I've<00:01:00.149> had<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> little<00:01:00.420> bit<00:01:00.570> of

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
okay so I've had a little bit of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.200 
okay so I've had a little bit of
progress<00:01:01.280> all<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.309> intercooler<00:01:02.730> pipe<00:01:03.000> work

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
progress all the intercooler pipe work

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.750 
progress all the intercooler pipe work
is<00:01:03.420> off<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.780> end<00:01:03.840> coolers<00:01:04.260> off<00:01:04.549> better<00:01:05.549> made<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
is off the end coolers off better made a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.070 
is off the end coolers off better made a
good<00:01:05.939> clean<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.420> got<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> bit<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.869> loiter

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
good clean it's got a bit of a loiter

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.600 
good clean it's got a bit of a loiter
origin<00:01:07.530> at<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> cool<00:01:08.040> thing<00:01:08.310> there<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.460> want

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
origin at the cool thing there I want

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.179 
origin at the cool thing there I want
the<00:01:08.760> best<00:01:09.470> it's<00:01:10.470> probably<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.799> good<00:01:10.920> thing<00:01:10.979> this

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the best it's probably a good thing this

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.710 
the best it's probably a good thing this
is<00:01:11.340> all<00:01:11.460> happening<00:01:11.610> now<00:01:11.820> cycle<00:01:12.299> change<00:01:12.540> all

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
is all happening now cycle change all

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.000 
is all happening now cycle change all
these<00:01:12.810> lines<00:01:13.080> around<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.439> stuff<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.740> lot<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
these lines around of stuff a lot of the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.990 
these lines around of stuff a lot of the
happy<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.250> word<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> way<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.790> was<00:01:14.880> done

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
happy the word the way it was done

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.820 
happy the word the way it was done
originally<00:01:15.500> probably<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> end<00:01:16.710> up

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
originally probably going to end up

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.200 
originally probably going to end up
taking<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.220> front<00:01:17.430> bumper<00:01:17.580> off<00:01:17.790> again<00:01:18.090> as

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
taking the front bumper off again as

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.740 
taking the front bumper off again as
well<00:01:19.700> all<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> bolts<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.240> stuff<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.509> coming

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
well all the bolts and stuff are coming

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
well all the bolts and stuff are coming
out<00:01:21.840> without<00:01:22.110> issue<00:01:22.290> which<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.710> good<00:01:22.890> nothing

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
out without issue which is good nothing

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700 
out without issue which is good nothing
stuck<00:01:23.900> hasn't<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:25.110> been<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.439> there<00:01:25.560> long

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
stuck hasn't really been in there long

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.109 
stuck hasn't really been in there long
enough<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.100> stuck<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.520> suppose<00:01:26.880> but

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
enough to get stuck I suppose but

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.749 
enough to get stuck I suppose but
happens<00:01:27.930> sometimes<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.310> sort<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.579> see

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
happens sometimes you can sort of see

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.850 
happens sometimes you can sort of see
more<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.119> oil<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.540> crap<00:01:30.720> now<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.710> just

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
more of that oil and crap now it's just

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.280 
more of that oil and crap now it's just
everywhere<00:01:32.340> by<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> manifold

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.740 

yeah<00:01:37.100> I'm<00:01:37.280> taking<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.670> manifold<00:01:38.150> motor<00:01:38.450> off

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
yeah I'm taking the manifold motor off

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.090 
yeah I'm taking the manifold motor off

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.920 
custom-made tools that I've got couple
of<00:01:47.960> shorts<00:01:48.560> panels<00:01:48.980> cuts<00:01:49.160> banners<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:50.810> can

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
of shorts panels cuts banners so you can

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.770 
of shorts panels cuts banners so you can
access<00:01:51.320> certain<00:01:51.560> spots<00:01:52.390> like<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.900> get<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.170> this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
access certain spots like to get to this

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.870 
access certain spots like to get to this
what's<00:01:56.780> your<00:01:56.930> call<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:58.010> part<00:01:58.280> well<00:01:58.490> here<00:01:58.760> is

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
what's your call that part well here is

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.940 
what's your call that part well here is
extremely<00:01:59.270> difficult<00:01:59.510> so<00:01:59.960> I<00:01:59.990> had<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.320> cut<00:02:00.920> a

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
extremely difficult so I had to cut a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.700 
extremely difficult so I had to cut a
spanner<00:02:01.280> in<00:02:01.490> half<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.020> idea<00:02:03.320> is<00:02:03.470> if<00:02:03.620> you

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
spanner in half and the idea is if you

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.160 
spanner in half and the idea is if you
actually<00:02:03.830> back<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:04.430> off<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.610> little<00:02:04.850> bit

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
actually back that off a little bit

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.240 
actually back that off a little bit
wobble<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.260> whole<00:02:06.410> thing<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:06.740> have<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.070> under

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
wobble the whole thing you have to under

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.609 
wobble the whole thing you have to under
the<00:02:07.340> flames<00:02:07.550> underneath<00:02:08.020> but<00:02:09.020> undo<00:02:09.380> these<00:02:09.560> two

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
the flames underneath but undo these two

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.710 
the flames underneath but undo these two
bolts<00:02:10.160> either<00:02:10.730> side<00:02:10.940> here<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.240> little<00:02:11.450> bit<00:02:11.630> of

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
bolts either side here a little bit of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.830 
bolts either side here a little bit of
it's<00:02:11.870> time<00:02:12.110> until<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.100> can<00:02:13.220> pop<00:02:13.400> them<00:02:13.550> out

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
it's time until you can pop them out

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.090 
it's time until you can pop them out
reason<00:02:14.840> for<00:02:14.990> that<00:02:15.050> is<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.500> flare<00:02:15.740> out<00:02:15.770> on

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
reason for that is is the flare out on

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.530 
reason for that is is the flare out on
that<00:02:16.280> on<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.460> dumb<00:02:16.820> pipe<00:02:17.000> wasn't<00:02:17.330> exactly

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
that on that dumb pipe wasn't exactly

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.460 
that on that dumb pipe wasn't exactly
big<00:02:17.840> enough<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.980> did<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.340> trick<00:02:19.990> so<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.320> have

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
big enough it did the trick so you have

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.140 
big enough it did the trick so you have
to<00:02:21.590> lift<00:02:21.890> this<00:02:22.010> up<00:02:22.190> under<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.640> dump<00:02:22.820> pot<00:02:23.000> from

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
to lift this up under the dump pot from

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.980 
to lift this up under the dump pot from
underneath<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.720> its<00:02:23.840> joint<00:02:24.080> flange<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:25.990> yeah

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
underneath in its joint flange and yeah

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.770 
underneath in its joint flange and yeah
then<00:02:27.230> I'll<00:02:27.320> be<00:02:27.440> able<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:28.210> get<00:02:29.210> that<00:02:29.330> dumb<00:02:29.540> pipe

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
then I'll be able to get that dumb pipe

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.240 
then I'll be able to get that dumb pipe
out<00:02:29.990> I'm<00:02:30.230> doing<00:02:30.440> all<00:02:30.530> those<00:02:30.620> manifold<00:02:31.040> bolts

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
out I'm doing all those manifold bolts

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.530 
out I'm doing all those manifold bolts
manifold<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:31.940> turbo<00:02:32.240> will<00:02:32.390> come<00:02:32.510> out<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:35.330> yeah

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
manifold and turbo will come out so yeah

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.340 
manifold and turbo will come out so yeah
that's<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.230> waste<00:02:36.740> go<00:02:37.900> all<00:02:38.900> right<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.230> works

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
that's the waste go all right that works

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.560 
that's the waste go all right that works
this<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:39.890> dumps<00:02:40.250> manifold<00:02:41.030> pressure<00:02:41.300> out

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
this is it dumps manifold pressure out

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.630 
this is it dumps manifold pressure out
of<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.770> exhaust<00:02:42.770> manifold<00:02:43.250> because<00:02:43.520> that

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
of the exhaust manifold because that

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.760 
of the exhaust manifold because that
losses<00:02:44.000> if<00:02:44.510> you've<00:02:44.660> got<00:02:44.870> one<00:02:45.050> piece<00:02:45.230> line<00:02:45.530> your

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
losses if you've got one piece line your

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.530 
losses if you've got one piece line your
intake<00:02:46.040> manifold<00:02:46.490> you<00:02:46.550> have<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.820> have<00:02:46.910> one<00:02:47.090> psi

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
intake manifold you have to have one psi

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.090 
intake manifold you have to have one psi
on<00:02:47.600> your<00:02:47.660> exhaust<00:02:48.080> manifold<00:02:48.560> for<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.890> work

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
on your exhaust manifold for it to work

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.690 
on your exhaust manifold for it to work
that's<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.180> be<00:02:50.240> a<00:02:50.300> balance<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:51.560> if<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.489> take

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
that's to be a balance so if you take

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.280 
that's to be a balance so if you take
away<00:02:52.850> pressure<00:02:53.239> from<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.600> exhaust<00:02:53.810> manifold

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
away pressure from the exhaust manifold

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.780 
away pressure from the exhaust manifold
you<00:02:54.410> know<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.739> pressure<00:02:55.310> on<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.580> intake

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
you know the pressure on the intake

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.000 
you know the pressure on the intake
manifold<00:02:56.300> that's<00:02:57.230> how<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.380> external<00:02:57.620> gate

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
manifold that's how the external gate

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.330 
manifold that's how the external gate
works<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:59.260> won't<00:03:00.260> go<00:03:00.440> into<00:03:00.620> why<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:00.890> use<00:03:01.220> an

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
works I won't go into why I use an

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.680 
works I won't go into why I use an
external<00:03:01.610> gate<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.060> video<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.660> a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
external gate this video it is a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.550 
external gate this video it is a
performance<00:03:02.959> extra<00:03:03.530> makes<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.370> nice<00:03:04.550> noise<00:03:04.580> too

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
performance extra makes a nice noise too

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.550 
performance extra makes a nice noise too
but<00:03:06.560> yeah<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:07.720> last<00:03:08.720> stop<00:03:08.930> waffling<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.440> I'll

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
but yeah I last stop waffling and I'll

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.090 
but yeah I last stop waffling and I'll
do<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> bit<00:03:09.920> more<00:03:09.950> work<00:03:10.100> here<00:03:10.520> and<00:03:11.920> it's<00:03:12.920> stuck

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
do a bit more work here and it's stuck

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.710 
do a bit more work here and it's stuck
into<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.370> more<00:03:14.380> now<00:03:15.380> well<00:03:15.670> looks<00:03:16.670> like<00:03:16.760> powers

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
into a more now well looks like powers

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.000 
into a more now well looks like powers
that<00:03:17.870> they<00:03:18.020> are<00:03:18.140> telling<00:03:18.410> me<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.620> stop<00:03:18.800> working

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
that they are telling me to stop working

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.250 
that they are telling me to stop working
on<00:03:19.250> this<00:03:19.430> for<00:03:19.610> today<00:03:19.760> my<00:03:20.690> voice<00:03:20.870> has<00:03:21.080> just

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
on this for today my voice has just

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.530 
on this for today my voice has just
 up<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:21.770> me<00:03:21.920> see<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.970> car<00:03:23.120> sitting<00:03:23.390> on

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
 up on me see the car sitting on

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.490 
 up on me see the car sitting on
an<00:03:23.630> angle<00:03:24.280> well<00:03:25.280> for<00:03:25.700> some<00:03:25.880> reason<00:03:26.330> I've<00:03:27.260> tried

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
an angle well for some reason I've tried

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.470 
an angle well for some reason I've tried
to<00:03:27.650> go<00:03:27.770> up<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.250> hydraulics<00:03:28.760> sort<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.150> made

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
to go up and the hydraulics sort of made

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.340 
to go up and the hydraulics sort of made
a<00:03:29.510> funny<00:03:29.870> noise<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.440> shat<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:31.180> then<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.540> tried

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
a funny noise and shat and then I tried

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.350 
a funny noise and shat and then I tried
to<00:03:33.470> go<00:03:33.590> back<00:03:33.800> down<00:03:34.010> but<00:03:34.220> only<00:03:34.790> this<00:03:34.910> side<00:03:35.150> would

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
to go back down but only this side would

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.000 
to go back down but only this side would
go<00:03:35.510> down<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:35.989> now<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.200> safety<00:03:36.590> interlocks

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
go down so now the safety interlocks

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.040 
go down so now the safety interlocks
locked<00:03:37.280> in<00:03:37.489> because<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.239> cable<00:03:38.780> has<00:03:38.870> gone

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
locked in because that cable has gone

otherwise but no it would be because if
it<00:04:55.460> was<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:55.820> wouldn't<00:04:56.090> hear<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.330> pump<00:04:56.540> keep

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
it was you wouldn't hear the pump keep

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.840 
it was you wouldn't hear the pump keep
running<00:04:57.140> if<00:04:57.770> there<00:04:57.980> was<00:04:58.100> any<00:04:58.220> drag<00:04:58.580> from

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
like that it stopped very quickly so I'm

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.390 
like that it stopped very quickly so I'm
pretty<00:05:05.170> sure<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.530> pumps<00:05:05.830> just<00:05:06.040> lost<00:05:06.220> its

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
pretty sure the pumps just lost its

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.550 
pretty sure the pumps just lost its
drive<00:05:06.700> maybe<00:05:06.970> it's<00:05:07.210> dropped<00:05:07.450> the<00:05:07.540> key<00:05:07.750> grub

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560
