modern<00:00:25.890> warfare<00:00:26.010> 3<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:27.029> it'd<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.150> really

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
modern warfare 3 I think it'd be really

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.060 
modern warfare 3 I think it'd be really
a<00:00:27.539> great<00:00:27.779> addition<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.500> they<00:00:28.650> brought<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.980> back

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
a great addition if they brought it back

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.609 
a great addition if they brought it back
in<00:00:29.279> black<00:00:29.429> ops<00:00:29.640> 2<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.510> now<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.929> really<00:00:31.410> wanted

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
in black ops 2 but now I really wanted

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.080 
in black ops 2 but now I really wanted
to<00:00:31.679> tell<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.949> guys<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> little<00:00:32.399> secret<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.030> mine

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
