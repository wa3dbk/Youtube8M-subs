python<00:00:13.159> that<00:00:13.279> I<00:00:13.699> honest<00:00:14.029> I<00:00:14.269> asked<00:00:14.659> when<00:00:14.989> they

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
python that I honest I asked when they

python that I honest I asked when they
did<00:00:15.349> the<00:00:15.529> Python<00:00:16.330> speaks<00:00:17.330> I<00:00:17.660> think<00:00:17.869> it's<00:00:18.050> cold

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:19.089 
did the Python speaks I think it's cold

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.929 
did the Python speaks I think it's cold
I<00:00:20.089> was<00:00:20.750> against<00:00:21.259> doing<00:00:21.769> it<00:00:21.919> and<00:00:22.189> so<00:00:22.640> were<00:00:22.910> a

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
I was against doing it and so were a

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.529 
I was against doing it and so were a
couple<00:00:23.480> of<00:00:23.810> us<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:25.220> in<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:25.640> end<00:00:25.789> we<00:00:25.970> were<00:00:26.269> sort

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
couple of us and in the end we were sort

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.150 
couple of us and in the end we were sort
of<00:00:26.630> thought<00:00:26.869> well<00:00:27.140> maybe<00:00:27.169> wouldn't<00:00:27.890> do<00:00:28.009> any

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
of thought well maybe wouldn't do any

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.089 
of thought well maybe wouldn't do any
harm<00:00:28.189> and<00:00:28.730> then<00:00:28.970> I<00:00:29.240> was<00:00:29.630> actually<00:00:30.259> surprised

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
harm and then I was actually surprised

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.459 
harm and then I was actually surprised
at<00:00:31.669> how<00:00:32.029> interesting<00:00:32.689> it<00:00:32.809> was<00:00:32.899> I<00:00:33.079> thought<00:00:33.350> it

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
at how interesting it was I thought it

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.740 
at how interesting it was I thought it
was<00:00:33.559> genuinely<00:00:34.250> interesting<00:00:35.090> to<00:00:35.449> say<00:00:35.600> with

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
was genuinely interesting to say with

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
was genuinely interesting to say with
time<00:00:36.020> have<00:00:36.230> you<00:00:36.320> gained<00:00:36.500> any<00:00:36.649> more

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
time have you gained any more

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.459 
time have you gained any more
perspective<00:00:37.250> on<00:00:37.340> what<00:00:37.460> you<00:00:37.579> all<00:00:37.760> accomplished

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
perspective on what you all accomplished

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.349 
perspective on what you all accomplished
no<00:00:39.469> it<00:00:39.680> was<00:00:39.829> more<00:00:40.039> learning<00:00:40.520> what<00:00:40.910> people<00:00:41.270> were

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
no it was more learning what people were

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.119 
no it was more learning what people were
thinking<00:00:41.390> at<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.020> time<00:00:42.050> you<00:00:42.649> know<00:00:42.829> it's<00:00:43.039> very

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
thinking at the time you know it's very

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.069 
thinking at the time you know it's very
surprising<00:00:43.489> sometimes<00:00:44.210> you<00:00:44.570> said<00:00:44.750> I'd<00:00:44.930> have

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
surprising sometimes you said I'd have

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.959 
surprising sometimes you said I'd have
no<00:00:45.379> idea<00:00:45.769> that<00:00:45.949> he<00:00:46.129> thought<00:00:46.399> that<00:00:46.730> at<00:00:46.940> that

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
no idea that he thought that at that

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.270 
no idea that he thought that at that
time<00:00:47.149> all<00:00:47.750> that<00:00:47.899> he<00:00:48.050> didn't<00:00:48.379> like<00:00:48.620> doing<00:00:48.920> that

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
time all that he didn't like doing that

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.700 
time all that he didn't like doing that
and<00:00:49.609> that<00:00:49.699> that's<00:00:49.960> to<00:00:50.960> me<00:00:51.109> is<00:00:51.320> kind<00:00:51.410> of

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
and that that's to me is kind of

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.229 
and that that's to me is kind of
interesting<00:00:51.949> is<00:00:52.309> it's<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.609> paradoxical

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
interesting is it's the paradoxical

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.119 
interesting is it's the paradoxical
stuff<00:00:53.629> that's<00:00:53.899> interesting<00:00:54.530> in<00:00:54.649> life<00:00:54.829> you

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
stuff that's interesting in life you

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.590 
stuff that's interesting in life you
know<00:00:55.250> is<00:00:55.399> when<00:00:55.609> it's<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:55.910> opposite<00:00:56.300> of<00:00:56.420> what

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
know is when it's the opposite of what

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.369 
know is when it's the opposite of what
you<00:00:56.780> expected<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.120> I'm<00:00:59.120> very<00:00:59.690> surprised<00:01:00.170> that

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
you expected so I'm very surprised that

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.680 
you expected so I'm very surprised that
and<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.949> documentary<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.940> main<00:01:02.149> reason<00:01:02.570> we

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
and the documentary the main reason we

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.950 
and the documentary the main reason we
did<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.989> documentary<00:01:03.199> I<00:01:03.829> think<00:01:04.430> ultimately

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
did the documentary I think ultimately

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.660 
did the documentary I think ultimately
was<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.260> to<00:01:06.530> one<00:01:06.740> of<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:06.950> producers<00:01:07.130> with

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
Terry Jones his son we didn't like to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.400

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
I had a very close connection with and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.420 
I had a very close connection with and
he<00:01:32.570> was<00:01:32.720> an<00:01:32.900> extraordinary<00:01:33.290> did<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.160> have<00:01:34.310> any

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
he was an extraordinary did you have any

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.250 
he was an extraordinary did you have any
reluctance<00:01:35.000> I'm<00:01:35.330> curious<00:01:35.570> as<00:01:35.690> he<00:01:35.810> walked<00:01:36.050> up

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
reluctance I'm curious as he walked up

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.780 
reluctance I'm curious as he walked up
to<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:37.000> podium<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.540> deliver<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.050> eulogy

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
to that podium to deliver that eulogy

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.040 
to that podium to deliver that eulogy
and<00:01:40.790> I<00:01:40.910> guess<00:01:41.120> that<00:01:41.330> we're<00:01:41.450> all<00:01:41.510> thinking<00:01:41.780> how

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
and I guess that we're all thinking how
