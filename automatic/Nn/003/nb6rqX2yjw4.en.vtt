for push-ups if you're a beginner is to

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.750 
for push-ups if you're a beginner is to

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
do them in a standing position or

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.049 
do them in a standing position or
slightly<00:00:54.230> inclined<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.710> am<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.160> this

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
slightly inclined like I am here this

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.760 
slightly inclined like I am here this
way<00:00:57.239> you're<00:00:57.449> not<00:00:57.629> having<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> push<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.469> lot<00:00:58.649> of

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
way you're not having to push a lot of

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
way you're not having to push a lot of
your<00:00:58.859> body<00:00:59.070> weight<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.910> eventually<00:01:00.180> that's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
your body weight but eventually that's

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.990 
your body weight but eventually that's
going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.020> become<00:01:01.350> too<00:01:01.649> easy<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.219> then<00:01:02.789> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
going to become too easy and then you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.530 
going to become too easy and then you
probably<00:01:03.480> want<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.809> get<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> ground<00:01:05.540> okay

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
probably want to get to the ground okay

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.050 
probably want to get to the ground okay
here's<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> next<00:01:07.439> progression<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.310> dealing

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
here's the next progression and dealing

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.980 
here's the next progression and dealing
with<00:01:09.180> your<00:01:09.330> knees<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> ground<00:01:11.990> eventually

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
with your knees on the ground eventually

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.750 
with your knees on the ground eventually
that's<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> become<00:01:13.950> too<00:01:14.159> easy<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
that's going to become too easy so you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.300 
that's going to become too easy so you
want<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.030> always<00:01:15.470> change<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.740> challenge<00:01:16.979> your

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
want to always change and challenge your

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.460 
want to always change and challenge your
body<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.000> keep<00:01:18.270> getting<00:01:18.570> result<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.320> your

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
body so you keep getting result in your

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.590 
body so you keep getting result in your
abs<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:20.009> well<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.700> other<00:01:20.880> muscles<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.420> you're

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
abs as well as other muscles that you're

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840 
abs as well as other muscles that you're
working<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.530> natural<00:01:23.009> progression<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.729> be

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
working so natural progression would be

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.940 
working so natural progression would be
to<00:01:24.000> get<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.270> feet<00:01:24.540> your<00:01:25.049> knees<00:01:25.140> off<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to get your feet your knees off the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.740 
to get your feet your knees off the
ground<00:01:28.040> okay<00:01:29.090> essentially<00:01:30.090> that's<00:01:30.329> going<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
ground okay essentially that's going to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.749 
ground okay essentially that's going to
become<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.079> little<00:01:31.380> bit<00:01:31.500> too<00:01:31.650> easy<00:01:31.829> here's<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
become a little bit too easy here's the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.499 
become a little bit too easy here's the
next<00:01:33.000> progression<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.759> how<00:01:35.759> about<00:01:36.000> feet

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
next progression for you how about feet

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.610 
next progression for you how about feet
elevated<00:01:38.090> okay

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
elevated okay

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.650 
elevated okay
eventually<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.670> may<00:01:41.850> need<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.060> challenge

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
eventually you may need a challenge

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.870 
eventually you may need a challenge
after<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.490> anything<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.550> can<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.760> an

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
after this anything you can do an

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.410 
after this anything you can do an
elevated<00:01:45.680> spider-man<00:01:46.680> pressure<00:01:47.300> okay<00:01:50.420> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
elevated spider-man pressure okay so

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.450 
elevated spider-man pressure okay so
that's<00:01:51.630> what<00:01:51.930> i<00:01:51.960> mean<00:01:52.230> by<00:01:52.530> increasing<00:01:53.370> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that's what i mean by increasing the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.550 
that's what i mean by increasing the
intensity<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:54.120> your<00:01:54.150> exercise<00:01:54.660> as<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.440> can

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
intensity of your exercise as you can

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.680 
intensity of your exercise as you can
see<00:01:55.740> even<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.190> bodyweight<00:01:56.670> movement<00:01:57.180> you

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
see even with bodyweight movement you

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.240 
see even with bodyweight movement you
don't<00:01:57.870> have<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.410> look<00:01:58.590> dumbbells<00:01:59.070> and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
don't have to just look dumbbells and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.070 
don't have to just look dumbbells and
increase<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.880> weight<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.780> challenge

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
increase the weight you can challenge

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.690 
increase the weight you can challenge
your<00:02:01.290> body<00:02:01.470> with<00:02:01.800> different<00:02:02.190> body<00:02:02.430> weight

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
your body with different body weight

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.970

going at the same speed 30 45 maybe even
60<00:02:28.080> minutes<00:02:28.670> constantly<00:02:29.670> let's<00:02:29.970> say<00:02:30.180> going

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
60 minutes constantly let's say going

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.990 
60 minutes constantly let's say going
for<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.050> walker<00:02:31.380> or<00:02:31.830> walking<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> treadmill

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
for a walker or walking on a treadmill

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.410 
for a walker or walking on a treadmill
so<00:02:33.990> what<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.260> want<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.530> do<00:02:34.680> there<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.420> to

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
maybe one week you're doing 3.5 miles an

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.680 
maybe one week you're doing 3.5 miles an
hour<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.720> walking<00:02:43.650> for<00:02:44.130> 30<00:02:44.310> minutes<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:45.390> next

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
hour of walking for 30 minutes the next

week you want to go to 4 miles an hour
for<00:02:48.270> 30<00:02:48.480> minutes<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:49.050> would<00:02:49.680> suggest<00:02:49.830> even<00:02:50.430> take

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
for 30 minutes I would suggest even take

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.000 
for 30 minutes I would suggest even take
that<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> step<00:02:51.300> further<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.989> vary<00:02:52.770> the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
that a step further and vary the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.860 
that a step further and vary the
intensity<00:02:53.540> within<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.720> work<00:02:54.930> out<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:56.220> your

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
intensity within the work out of your

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.780 
intensity within the work out of your
cardio<00:02:57.870> training<00:02:58.320> in<00:02:59.040> other<00:02:59.220> words<00:02:59.430> maybe<00:02:59.610> you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
cardio training in other words maybe you

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.030

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
go for a walk for two minutes and then

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.080 
go for a walk for two minutes and then
