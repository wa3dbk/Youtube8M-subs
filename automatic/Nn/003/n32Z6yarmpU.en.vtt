clear<00:01:40.600> them<00:01:40.749> for<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:40.960> little<00:01:41.109> bit<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.619> unless

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
clear them for a little bit and unless

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.859 
clear them for a little bit and unless
you<00:01:42.189> really<00:01:42.700> get<00:01:43.030> into<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.359> game<00:01:43.600> you'll

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
you really get into the game you'll

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.749 
you really get into the game you'll
probably<00:01:44.140> never<00:01:44.469> look<00:01:44.710> at<00:01:44.829> them<00:01:44.920> again<00:01:45.009> there

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
probably never look at them again there

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.300 
probably never look at them again there
is<00:01:45.939> something<00:01:46.329> that<00:01:46.479> you<00:01:46.600> can<00:01:46.630> unlock<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.560> the

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
is something that you can unlock and the

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.039 
is something that you can unlock and the
unlockable<00:01:48.789> ones<00:01:49.090> aren't<00:01:49.329> different<00:01:49.689> I<00:01:49.990> know

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
unlockable ones aren't different I know

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.499 
unlockable ones aren't different I know
it's<00:01:50.350> pretty<00:01:50.590> much<00:01:50.859> the<00:01:50.920> same<00:01:51.249> stuff<00:01:51.639> back

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
it's pretty much the same stuff back

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.209 
it's pretty much the same stuff back
when<00:01:52.719> I<00:01:52.749> did<00:01:53.200> have<00:01:53.439> them<00:01:53.590> unlocked<00:01:53.950> on<00:01:54.130> the

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
when I did have them unlocked on the

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.099 
when I did have them unlocked on the
gamecube<00:01:54.759> version<00:01:54.789> back<00:01:55.299> here<00:01:55.539> at<00:01:55.689> them<00:01:55.869> just

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
gamecube version back here at them just

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:57.929 
gamecube version back here at them just
as<00:01:56.259> much<00:01:56.289> as<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.770> nine<00:01:57.340> that<00:01:57.369> you<00:01:57.670> get<00:01:57.819> is

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
as much as the nine that you get is

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.559 
as much as the nine that you get is
standard<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:58.990> anywhere<00:01:59.549> under<00:02:00.549> archaean<00:02:01.359> and

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
standard so anywhere under archaean and

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.899 
standard so anywhere under archaean and
under<00:02:02.109> original<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.829> can<00:02:03.009> choose<00:02:03.249> the<00:02:03.310> player

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
under original you can choose the player

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.330 
under original you can choose the player
by<00:02:04.060> Arcade<00:02:04.509> rules<00:02:04.780> or<00:02:05.049> have<00:02:05.289> a<00:02:05.319> set<00:02:05.619> time<00:02:05.649> and

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
by Arcade rules or have a set time and

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.010 
by Arcade rules or have a set time and
the<00:02:06.549> arcade<00:02:06.969> worlds<00:02:07.329> is<00:02:07.389> basically<00:02:07.869> you've

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
the arcade worlds is basically you've

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.380 
the arcade worlds is basically you've
got<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> checkpoint<00:02:08.740> system<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:09.789> when<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.149> pick

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
got a checkpoint system so when you pick

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.390 
got a checkpoint system so when you pick
people<00:02:10.780> up<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.080> drop<00:02:11.319> them<00:02:11.470> off<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.860> get<00:02:12.040> time

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
people up and drop them off you get time

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.070 
people up and drop them off you get time
and<00:02:12.730> you've<00:02:12.880> gotta<00:02:13.090> go<00:02:13.330> as<00:02:13.480> long<00:02:13.690> as<00:02:13.870> possible

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
and you've gotta go as long as possible

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.200 
and you've gotta go as long as possible
and<00:02:14.470> therefore<00:02:15.100> get<00:02:15.580> as<00:02:15.670> much<00:02:15.820> money<00:02:16.090> as

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
and therefore get as much money as

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:26.280 
and therefore get as much money as
possible<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.610> basic<00:02:25.330> rule<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.540> depending<00:02:26.290> on

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
possible so basic rule is depending on

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.430 
possible so basic rule is depending on
what<00:02:26.590> color<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.960> person<00:02:28.960> is<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.260> pick

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
what color the person is that you pick

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.840 
what color the person is that you pick
up<00:02:29.590> depends<00:02:29.980> on<00:02:30.070> how<00:02:30.130> much<00:02:30.280> money<00:02:30.340> you've<00:02:30.670> got

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
up depends on how much money you've got

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.120 
up depends on how much money you've got
it<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.240> I've<00:02:32.020> just<00:02:32.080> realized<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.980> way

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
it and I've just realized that the way

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.530 
it and I've just realized that the way
that<00:02:33.280> word<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.700> sounds<00:02:34.000> incredibly<00:02:34.330> racist

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
that word it sounds incredibly racist

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.140 
that word it sounds incredibly racist
but<00:02:34.930> basically<00:02:35.380> every<00:02:35.830> character<00:02:36.340> has<00:02:36.520> a

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
but basically every character has a

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.480 
but basically every character has a
symbol<00:02:37.540> above<00:02:37.630> them<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:38.200> that's<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.710> cola<00:02:38.980> so

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
symbol above them and that's the cola so

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.190 
symbol above them and that's the cola so
if<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.820> red<00:02:40.060> will<00:02:40.360> give<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.690> fairly<00:02:41.080> any

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
if the red will give you a fairly any

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.170 
if the red will give you a fairly any
money<00:02:41.470> orange<00:02:42.010> give<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.460> barely<00:02:42.730> any<00:02:42.940> money

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
money orange give you barely any money

yell or give you better money yellowy

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.700 
yell or give you better money yellowy

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
you can get and it's just basically you

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.810 
you can get and it's just basically you
drive<00:02:53.350> around<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.980> pick<00:02:54.430> up<00:02:54.580> different

drive around and pick up different
people<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.450> drop<00:02:55.660> them<00:02:55.780> off<00:02:55.930> wherever<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
people and drop them off wherever the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.380 
people and drop them off wherever the
mantra<00:02:56.650> for<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:57.040> can<00:02:57.250> check<00:02:57.820> where<00:02:58.180> they're

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
mantra for you can check where they're

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.480 
mantra for you can check where they're
going<00:02:58.660> by<00:02:58.810> holding<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.260> square<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.770> pretty

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
going by holding the square and pretty

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.830 
going by holding the square and pretty
much<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.820> only<00:03:00.850> things<00:03:01.240> that<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.420> can<00:03:01.630> do

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
much the only things that you can do

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.470 
much the only things that you can do
while<00:03:02.080> we<00:03:02.500> act<00:03:02.650> accelerate<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.820> going

while we act accelerate and going
reverse<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:06.280> doesn't<00:03:06.610> have<00:03:06.700> any<00:03:06.880> of<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
features that the newer games up they've

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.620 
features that the newer games up they've
not<00:03:08.890> done<00:03:08.920> anything<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:10.090> is<00:03:10.300> just<00:03:10.330> a

not done anything to it it is just a

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.270 
not done anything to it it is just a
port<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.050> original<00:03:11.620> game<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:12.100> if<00:03:12.190> you

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
port of the original game so if you

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.310 
port of the original game so if you
loved<00:03:12.490> it<00:03:12.640> you'll<00:03:12.850> still<00:03:12.970> love<00:03:13.240> it<00:03:13.390> if<00:03:13.570> you

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
loved it you'll still love it if you

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.040 
loved it you'll still love it if you
don't<00:03:15.040> like<00:03:15.370> all<00:03:15.640> games<00:03:16.000> then<00:03:16.600> you're<00:03:16.840> pretty

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
don't like all games then you're pretty

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.720 
don't like all games then you're pretty
much<00:03:17.200> here<00:03:17.530> at<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:17.770> because<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:18.370> totally

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
much here at this because it's totally

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.000 
much here at this because it's totally
different<00:03:19.200> anything<00:03:20.200> that's<00:03:20.350> out<00:03:20.470> there<00:03:20.710> here

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
original Mod as you might have figured

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.610 
original Mod as you might have figured
is<00:03:56.670> totally<00:03:57.540> different<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.960> arcade<00:03:58.320> mode<00:03:58.560> i

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
is totally different the arcade mode i

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.830 
is totally different the arcade mode i
will<00:03:58.890> sure<00:03:59.220> why<00:03:59.430> now<00:03:59.670> I'll<00:03:59.940> by<00:04:00.210> simply<00:04:00.630> cutting

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
will sure why now I'll by simply cutting

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.250 
will sure why now I'll by simply cutting
into<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.260> arcade<00:04:01.560> mode<00:04:02.690> basically<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:04.080> thing

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
into the arcade mode basically the thing

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.020 
into the arcade mode basically the thing
that<00:04:04.380> changes<00:04:04.830> is<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.100> layout<00:04:05.640> of<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.850> city

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
that changes is the layout of the city

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.670 
that changes is the layout of the city
it's<00:04:06.330> one<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.840> them<00:04:06.960> begin<00:04:07.230> play<00:04:07.500> doesn't

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
it's one of them begin play doesn't

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.890 
it's one of them begin play doesn't
change<00:04:08.010> we<00:04:08.340> still<00:04:08.610> are<00:04:08.790> getting<00:04:09.150> people<00:04:09.780> and
