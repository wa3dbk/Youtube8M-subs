00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
in three sections try to divide them

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:38.830 
in three sections try to divide them
evenly<00:01:36.459> these<00:01:37.459> two<00:01:37.759> sections<00:01:38.090> are<00:01:38.479> going<00:01:38.719> to

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
evenly these two sections are going to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.050 
evenly these two sections are going to
be<00:01:39.200> your<00:01:39.469> bow<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.789> make<00:01:41.569> both<00:01:41.989> of<00:01:42.020> them<00:01:42.469> even

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
be your bow so make both of them even

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.050 
be your bow so make both of them even
but<00:01:44.060> make<00:01:44.270> them<00:01:44.299> both<00:01:44.719> a<00:01:45.020> little<00:01:45.579> thicker<00:01:46.579> than

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
but make them both a little thicker than

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.940 
but make them both a little thicker than
the<00:01:47.119> middle<00:01:47.539> section<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.200> middle<00:01:48.500> section

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
the middle section the middle section

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.029 
the middle section the middle section
needs<00:01:49.129> to<00:01:49.369> be<00:01:49.569> thinner<00:01:50.569> than<00:01:50.929> the<00:01:51.560> two<00:01:51.799> outer

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
needs to be thinner than the two outer

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:59.979 
needs to be thinner than the two outer
sections<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:56.619> these<00:01:57.619> two<00:01:58.129> sections<00:01:58.759> are<00:01:59.299> going

00:01:59.979 --> 00:01:59.989 
sections so these two sections are going

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:05.709
