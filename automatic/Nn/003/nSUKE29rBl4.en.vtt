00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.610
 and hello everyone with you android fan and we 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.660
 continue to pass the game called 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.240
 the simpsons spelling field and this 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.180
 the seventeenth issue in this issue I you 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.689
 I'll tell you that very soon we will build 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.670
 springfield library and it seems to be with us 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.320
 will open a new character do not know so 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.199
 library costs 20,000 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.700
 we still have 10 and so I 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.980
 now 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.100
 strained all the characters and they are engaged 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.100
 your business in general is what you still have 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.610
 we are here a lot of things by the way ghost 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.649
 mechanical device part 10 here 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.070
 need to reach level 12 build 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.230
 library that is, we are both 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.600
 let's do two tasks let's build a library 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.559
 and then we can send down to 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.809
 library what else what else 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.739
 now our tank laughs viciously for 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.490
 8 hours 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.369
 by the way now it is to ng he is quite 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.250
 makes more money than others 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.939
 for example, in 8 hours one character 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:23.520
 bring about 300 350 dollars 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:26.369
 Akkond brings on 420 on 450 in general 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.890
 than at night than cooler characters so 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.759
 more they bring in general what else is there 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.829
 changed I slightly expanded as 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.890
 see here because the places 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.470
 In general, I did not have and soon 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.229
 will have to expand even more with this 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.030
 parties also but more there right now 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.409
 even show standing here 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:59.189
 to expand here you need to see from 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:02:01.740
 9000 599 but 2 600 it will expand 999 19 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.560
 already nifiga this is near the sea further already 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.560
 it will not be so that after all the price tags 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.129
 how to bend and in general, by the way here 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.050
 flies plate shitty is 2 nano 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.050

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.330
 It opens and in general, this is all that I 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.250
 I wanted to tell you soon 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.270

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.510
 characters 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.110
