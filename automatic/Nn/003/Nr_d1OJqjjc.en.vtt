off<00:02:29.160> when<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:29.970> measured<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.810> if<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.700> some

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
off when I measured so if you have some

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.820 
off when I measured so if you have some
risers<00:02:33.210> or<00:02:33.240> protectors<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.140> some<00:02:34.470> sort

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
risers or protectors of some sort

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.250 
risers or protectors of some sort
underneath<00:02:35.130> your<00:02:35.520> tables<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.990> want<00:02:37.170> to

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
underneath your tables you want to

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.870 
underneath your tables you want to
remove<00:02:37.590> those<00:02:37.860> when<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.430> take<00:02:38.700> your

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
remove those when you take your

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.050 
remove those when you take your
measurements<00:02:40.130> another<00:02:41.130> thing<00:02:42.200> if<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.710> a

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
measurements another thing if you have a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.120 
measurements another thing if you have a
square<00:02:45.060> table<00:02:45.990> you're<00:02:46.500> probably<00:02:46.740> not<00:02:46.950> going

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
square table you're probably not going

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.640 
square table you're probably not going
to<00:02:47.190> run<00:02:47.340> into<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:47.700> problem<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:49.050> we<00:02:49.260> did<00:02:49.580> the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
to run into this problem that we did the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.190 
to run into this problem that we did the
foam<00:02:53.330> we<00:02:54.330> needed<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.750> cut<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.080> out<00:02:56.540> with<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:57.960> cut

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
foam we needed to cut it out with we cut

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.120 
foam we needed to cut it out with we cut
it<00:02:58.320> out<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.860> shape<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.460> my<00:03:00.000> table<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:01.140> so

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
it out to the shape of my table and so

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.620 
it out to the shape of my table and so
the<00:03:02.910> styrofoam<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:04.020> everywhere<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:06.450> not

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
the styrofoam is everywhere and it not

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.880 
the styrofoam is everywhere and it not
everywhere<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.350> we<00:03:07.470> used<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:09.200> we<00:03:10.200> used<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.530> bread

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
everywhere and we used a we used a bread

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.710 
everywhere and we used a we used a bread
knife<00:03:11.100> because<00:03:11.489> it's<00:03:11.670> serrated<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.300> cut<00:03:12.540> it

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
knife because it's serrated to cut it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.590 
knife because it's serrated to cut it
and<00:03:12.989> then<00:03:13.050> we<00:03:13.980> take<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.640> edges<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.420> with

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
and then we take the edges of it with

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.470 
and then we take the edges of it with
duct<00:03:15.930> tape<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.470> like<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.739> said<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:18.239> little

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
duct tape and like I said the little

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.080 
duct tape and like I said the little
styrofoam<00:03:18.989> stuff<00:03:19.260> has<00:03:20.070> gotten<00:03:20.520> everywhere

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
styrofoam stuff has gotten everywhere

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.170 
styrofoam stuff has gotten everywhere
and<00:03:21.690> it's<00:03:22.200> taken<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.830> couple<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.190> days<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.790> be

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
and it's taken a couple of days to be

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.600 
and it's taken a couple of days to be
able<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.420> get<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.860> it's<00:03:25.860> still<00:03:26.040> like<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.489> know

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
able to get it it's still like you know

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.250 
able to get it it's still like you know
when<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.880> sweep<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.330> floats<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.900> into<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
when you sweep this floats it into the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.280 
when you sweep this floats it into the
air<00:03:28.610> you<00:03:29.610> know

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
air you know

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.830 
air you know
three<00:03:30.439> lands<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:31.010> weary<00:03:31.310> cleaning<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:32.599> it's

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
three lands and weary cleaning so it's

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.890 
three lands and weary cleaning so it's
been<00:03:33.260> really<00:03:33.560> good<00:03:33.829> to<00:03:34.280> get<00:03:35.060> this<00:03:35.239> done<00:03:35.599> that's

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
been really good to get this done that's

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.750 
been really good to get this done that's
real<00:03:36.140> nice<00:03:36.290> one<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.890> other<00:03:37.040> things<00:03:37.370> is

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
real nice one of the other things is

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.179 
real nice one of the other things is
about<00:03:38.599> ten<00:03:39.109> minutes<00:03:39.290> after<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:39.769> turned<00:03:40.040> off<00:03:40.159> the

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189 
about ten minutes after I turned off the

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.899 
about ten minutes after I turned off the
camera<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:41.540> showed<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.109> my<00:03:42.260> table<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:43.609> cap

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
camera and showed you my table the cap

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.460 
camera and showed you my table the cap
down<00:03:44.510> here<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.829> realized<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.939> the<00:03:47.930> way<00:03:48.079> she

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
down here and I realized and the way she

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.039 
down here and I realized and the way she
scratches<00:03:48.859> things<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.549> would<00:03:49.760> not<00:03:49.970> heat<00:03:50.299> my

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
scratches things it would not heat my

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.979 
scratches things it would not heat my
table<00:03:51.530> looking<00:03:52.400> as<00:03:52.549> good<00:03:52.760> as<00:03:52.819> it<00:03:53.090> did<00:03:53.239> so<00:03:53.510> I

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
table looking as good as it did so I

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.619 
table looking as good as it did so I
went<00:03:54.319> ahead<00:03:54.409> out<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.129> I<00:03:55.970> bought<00:03:58.150> some<00:03:59.150> clear

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
went ahead out and I bought some clear

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.390 
went ahead out and I bought some clear
plastic<00:04:00.409> money<00:04:01.389> that's<00:04:02.389> used<00:04:03.040> you<00:04:04.040> know<00:04:04.099> what

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
plastic money that's used you know what

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.119 
plastic money that's used you know what
to<00:04:05.359> cover<00:04:05.569> chairs<00:04:06.049> and<00:04:06.530> things<00:04:06.680> for<00:04:07.010> your

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
to cover chairs and things for your

dining<00:04:07.310> room<00:04:07.790> or<00:04:09.609> anyway<00:04:10.609> I<00:04:10.639> got<00:04:10.849> the<00:04:11.000> 20<00:04:11.359> gauge

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
dining room or anyway I got the 20 gauge

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.129 
dining room or anyway I got the 20 gauge
and<00:04:11.810> it's<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.139> thickest<00:04:12.650> that<00:04:12.919> they<00:04:13.069> sold

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
and it's the thickest that they sold

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.199 
and it's the thickest that they sold
I've<00:04:15.139> got<00:04:15.409> enough<00:04:15.859> to<00:04:16.039> hang<00:04:16.489> over<00:04:16.699> a<00:04:16.910> really

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
I've got enough to hang over a really

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.360 
I've got enough to hang over a really
long<00:04:17.599> on<00:04:17.959> one<00:04:17.989> side<00:04:18.560> because<00:04:18.949> it's<00:04:19.190> near<00:04:19.340> the

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
long on one side because it's near the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.390 
long on one side because it's near the
back<00:04:19.609> door<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:20.000> figured<00:04:20.419> you<00:04:21.320> know<00:04:21.349> if<00:04:21.829> somebody

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
back door I figured you know if somebody

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.070 
back door I figured you know if somebody
comes<00:04:22.729> running<00:04:23.479> in<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.690> end<00:04:23.810> or<00:04:24.020> something

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
comes running in the end or something

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.029 
comes running in the end or something
that's<00:04:24.620> not<00:04:24.889> gonna<00:04:25.930> rub<00:04:26.930> it<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.289> too<00:04:27.740> much<00:04:28.660> I

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
that's not gonna rub it to too much I

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:36.879 
that's not gonna rub it to too much I
also<00:04:31.039> cut<00:04:32.000> out<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:33.580> hole<00:04:34.580> for<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.560> needle<00:04:36.560> plate

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
also cut out a hole for the needle plate

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:43.719 
also cut out a hole for the needle plate
just<00:04:37.400> right<00:04:37.669> under<00:04:37.940> here<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:42.340> then<00:04:43.340> my<00:04:43.520> left

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
just right under here and then my left

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.180 
just right under here and then my left
piece<00:04:44.510> hanging<00:04:44.780> over<00:04:45.050> but<00:04:45.289> I<00:04:45.320> head<00:04:45.680> out<00:04:45.710> enough

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
piece hanging over but I head out enough

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.360 
piece hanging over but I head out enough
to<00:04:46.460> where<00:04:46.610> this<00:04:47.060> slides<00:04:47.710> right<00:04:48.710> up<00:04:48.889> against<00:04:49.190> to

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
to where this slides right up against to

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.370 
to where this slides right up against to
the<00:04:49.460> edge<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:49.940> throat<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.599> then<00:04:51.110> cut<00:04:51.349> out

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
the edge of the throat and then cut out

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.610 
the edge of the throat and then cut out
enough<00:04:51.979> that<00:04:52.280> it<00:04:52.789> goes<00:04:53.419> over<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:54.169> other<00:04:54.320> edge

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
enough that it goes over the other edge

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.230
