but again on the professional level it's

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.660

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.680 
towers by lumber mill did complete i'm
not<00:04:38.280> sure<00:04:38.400> if<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.550> guys<00:04:38.700> saw<00:04:38.880> that<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.540> see

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.640 
not sure if you guys saw that you see
i'm<00:04:39.780> going<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:39.960> quickly<00:04:40.020> try<00:04:40.350> to<00:04:40.410> take<00:04:40.620> down

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
i'm going to quickly try to take down

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.620 
i'm going to quickly try to take down
and<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:41.550> see<00:04:41.730> he<00:04:41.880> is<00:04:41.940> at<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.090> tree<00:04:42.300> Vegas<00:04:42.570> so

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
and you see he is at the tree Vegas so

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.910 
and you see he is at the tree Vegas so
he's<00:04:42.780> been<00:04:42.870> only<00:04:43.020> gonna<00:04:43.200> have<00:04:43.320> dry<00:04:43.530> as<00:04:43.680> really

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
he's been only gonna have dry as really

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.130 
he's been only gonna have dry as really
so<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.940> was<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.090> great<00:04:45.300> idea<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:45.630> get<00:04:45.720> a<00:04:45.780> mortar

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
so it was a great idea to get a mortar

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.930 
so it was a great idea to get a mortar
and<00:04:46.290> fortunately<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.310> motor<00:04:47.490> is<00:04:47.640> finished

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
and fortunately that motor is finished

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.180 
and fortunately that motor is finished
so<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.600> think<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.230> will<00:04:49.260> be<00:04:49.440> able<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.830> take<00:04:50.160> it

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
so I think I will be able to take it

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.380 
so I think I will be able to take it
down<00:04:50.490> right<00:04:50.840> now<00:04:52.940> because<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.060> fact<00:04:54.210> that<00:04:54.270> I

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
down right now because the fact that I

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.570 
down right now because the fact that I
do<00:04:54.450> have<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:54.720> mortar<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:56.160> I'd<00:04:56.250> Sam<00:04:56.430> in<00:04:56.520> a

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
do have that mortar and I'd Sam in a

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.270 
do have that mortar and I'd Sam in a
micro<00:04:56.880> my<00:04:57.030> orders<00:04:57.450> and<00:04:57.830> I<00:04:58.830> build<00:04:59.070> spell

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
micro my orders and I build spell

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.310 
micro my orders and I build spell
breakers<00:04:59.690> because<00:05:00.690> spell<00:05:00.930> breakers<00:05:01.200> are

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
breakers because spell breakers are

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.810 
breakers because spell breakers are
effective<00:05:01.650> versus<00:05:01.890> truth<00:05:02.130> of<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.280> cloth<00:05:02.490> and

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
effective versus truth of the cloth and

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.150 
effective versus truth of the cloth and
I<00:05:03.060> you<00:05:03.120> see<00:05:03.270> all<00:05:03.450> he<00:05:03.630> have<00:05:03.780> really<00:05:04.080> has<00:05:04.260> is<00:05:07.160> all

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
I you see all he have really has is all

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.300 
I you see all he have really has is all
he<00:05:08.490> really<00:05:08.640> has<00:05:08.970> is<00:05:09.390> a<00:05:09.830> dry<00:05:10.830> ads<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:11.250> other

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
he really has is a dry ads and other

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.460 
he really has is a dry ads and other
such<00:05:11.610> such<00:05:12.390> units<00:05:12.720> so<00:05:12.870> this<00:05:13.140> is<00:05:13.230> going<00:05:13.320> to<00:05:13.410> be

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
such such units so this is going to be

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.990 
such such units so this is going to be
important<00:05:13.830> for<00:05:13.860> me<00:05:13.980> to<00:05:14.010> put<00:05:14.340> these<00:05:14.430> powers<00:05:14.820> up

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
important for me to put these powers up

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.880 
important for me to put these powers up
they<00:05:15.510> see<00:05:15.570> my<00:05:15.840> ivory<00:05:16.110> tower<00:05:16.140> stiffen<00:05:16.650> it<00:05:16.680> very

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
they see my ivory tower stiffen it very

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.370 
they see my ivory tower stiffen it very
quickly<00:05:17.070> so<00:05:17.310> I<00:05:17.340> this<00:05:18.090> human<00:05:18.780> this<00:05:19.020> game<00:05:19.200> does

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
quickly so I this human this game does

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.960 
quickly so I this human this game does

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
because the fact that seat is just so

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.930 
because the fact that seat is just so
powerful<00:05:50.240> that<00:05:51.470> the<00:05:52.470> hundreds<00:05:53.340> are<00:05:53.550> so<00:05:53.760> weak

they're<00:05:54.120> unarmored<00:05:54.540> you<00:05:54.630> in<00:05:54.750> seeing<00:05:54.900> with<00:05:55.020> the

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
they're unarmored you in seeing with the

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.260 
they're unarmored you in seeing with the
dryads<00:05:55.410> if<00:05:55.500> you<00:05:55.620> see<00:05:55.830> mortars<00:05:56.280> inhuman<00:05:57.000> you

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
dryads if you see mortars inhuman you

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.700 
dryads if you see mortars inhuman you
see<00:05:57.420> that<00:05:57.600> with<00:05:57.690> human<00:05:57.990> he<00:05:58.290> should<00:05:58.500> have<00:05:58.590> gone

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
see that with human he should have gone

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.320 
see that with human he should have gone
straight<00:05:59.040> to<00:05:59.220> bears<00:05:59.550> and<00:05:59.730> he<00:05:59.790> didn't<00:06:00.150> and

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
straight to bears and he didn't and

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.850 
straight to bears and he didn't and
that's<00:06:00.390> what<00:06:00.600> lost<00:06:00.840> in<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.080> game<00:06:01.260> because<00:06:01.680> of

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
that's what lost in the game because of

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.260
