00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 will all come here guys orgasmic with one 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.160
 new scud builder always a listen 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.019
 gold builder except for one player 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.009
 silver that I needed to make agreement 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:19.140
 worth after I will show you the team in 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:22.050
 question is a hybrid between brazil and then 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.740
 what is lecce nigeria i felt a little 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.250
 all brazilian russian league is a team 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.779
 very interesting now I would not like 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.590
 immediately review the team in general 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.559
 but the players because I decided to al 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.800
 ie place in the final clips 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.530
 in the end to show the team a little 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.050
 will be clips arising from multiple theme parts 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.809
 only one or two at the most 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.170
 games and there will be no music but rather 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.960
 my voice to comment a little 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.500
 team like the game and so on 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.350
 flaws and pros and cons here we say 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.789
 let's start right away with the concierge 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.790
 wait until I put the form that is the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.670
 module 4 1 2 1 2 1 of the best modules 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.159
 guillermo dm the goalkeeper of the locomotive 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.630
 fly is really my first 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.570
 impression was that a goalkeeper 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.580
 fortissimo does not have much values 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.820
 high for example positioning or 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.950
 however taken at 85 of tuff 82 of reflections 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.080
 that allow this goalkeeper costing 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.380
 1100 therefore to be very strong to mine 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.290
 opinion we have as right back but 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.840
 kiev misery to make agreement later 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.210
 you will see 250 credits must be paid well 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.200
 also seems like a great methods 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.619
 truth 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.100
 then as you say we have also given it 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.680
 paid 7500 obviously its price is 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.990
 much lower, however, than the 4 1 2 1 2 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.119
 they cost so much and vab and it's a lot 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.380
 strong in defense there is nothing to say 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.880
 you all know him 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.790
 the other says felipe santana wandered 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.090
 paid 6500 excellent good defender 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.869
 header and above all and speed 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:10.420
 as a left-back we have alaba 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:13.270
 paid 6,000 really a 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.270
 even great could have values 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.610
 however, many more in defense 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.900
 strong is also a good shot if not 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.470
 wrong as cdc we have fernando that is 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.900
 I paid the port midfielder 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.880
 very little 450 and it's really a lot 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.290
 solid as a midfielder there 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.750
 advice and to put in front of the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.930
 defense is really great as and of 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.269
 we have maggie of the los killer of the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.850
 spartak 5 paid stability of a thousand 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.350
 really little credits came fast 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.690
 a good shot a good dribbling 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:55.540
 really very high as we have 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.739
 michel bastos that I honestly didn't have 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.209
 never tried as a player I had then 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.280
 just wanted to try it to see some 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.040
 how I was and I must say that it is a 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.470
 good midfield outside bon bon is not 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.130
 his shot too fast though 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:18.880
 it is very successful clicked 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:20.940
 oh my god epic fail fuck lol i was 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.090
 I missed the connection anyway I said 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.310
 bastos I paid 3900 price really 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.190
 great for a really good player 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.840
 good a great shot only flaws for the 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.260
 made that to a right that sucks though 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.500
 c o I put this into play it damage it 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:43.269
 dias that I tried it now and it is a lot 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.060
 forte has an incredible shot and has one 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.700
 good speed a playmaker really 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.829
 very complete I have to say 4 served 4 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.720
 weak foot ensure large behind 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.829
 good speed good pass nothing from 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.000
 say for 550 credits I recommend it 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:03.730
 instead in attack we have the attack 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.190
 bagato with and meghni that on one side e 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.100
 wellington on the other there are two 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.750
 strikers locked up because I didn't 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.950
 interested others use it because they don't 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.979
 I have to use it too, paid 1 1800 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.900
 the other 6800 was fine with it 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.539
 they are two very physical players 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.450
 very fast great shot the other a lot 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.200
 fast 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:31.370
 great shot good header too and 46 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.310
 nice boy skills let's go with the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.690
 team review I would like to reiterate 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.560
 the fact that in my opinion this starts 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:43.960
 really strong indeed in these clips 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:47.210
 you will really see what bailouts he will then do 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.410
 the beauty of this team in my opinion is 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:54.380
 the fact that to a defense enough 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.650
 solid with felipe santana and dede vabbÃ¨ 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.560
 an insurmountable goalkeeper almost goes well 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.960
 obviously if you meet opponents who 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.570
 they play a lot of zigzags with the others 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.480
 tightrope walkers will be difficult to play but like 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.610
 with all the defenders along the goal here 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.020
 by emenike who is a great finisher 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.290
 here's another nice thing about this one 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.350
 team is the game is very variable 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.770
 I play both on the bands and on the 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.200
 three quarters that is half of the field I mean 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.550
 because you really can do it 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.860
 a lot of everything with this team is a lot 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:32.270
 funny 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:36.460
 so I recommend it because it costs me 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:39.230
 paid about 40 45 maximum thousand credits 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.650
 and I must say that I'm having fun 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:46.820
 I think a lot is also a lot 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:50.050
 competitive as you can see then 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:53.510
 precisely from the bands on one side with 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.980
 deny I can ring very well go 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.790
 off in speed, etc. on the other 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.420
 part 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:03.440
 I can do long shots with is called 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.000
 michel bastos really very powerful 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.680
 ah well obviously we can take it too 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.900
 gol see luca with very strong 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:13.640
 physically but a little all the defenders 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:15.980
 ie they will undergo a little 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:20.320
 lukaku's physical strength as of all 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.320
 other type benteke etcetera 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:27.200
 I repeat the team is very offensive 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.120
 because the two attackers are really 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.510
 very offensive 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.150
 thanks no in the sense that they have work rates 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.910
 high attack and defense I think low 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.660
 it seems to me I don't even remember the greatness of 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.780
 bastos also very attacking the 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.120
 trequartista danilo dias 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.320
 then obviously you meet swine and she does 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.530
 stigol here 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.490
 logical however still a team indeed 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.490
 strong 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.370
 I advise you to do so that is less than 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.670
 try it so much it doesn't even cost 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:08.900
 exaggeratedly, you have security 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:10.820
 defensive and offensive in midfield goes 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.000
 well there is only one midfielder you have to 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:17.300
 to return to some extent to the 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.010
 external and the trequartista even if to a 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:23.180
 work rates not perfect bro 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.350
 here he had even gone into 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.090
 disadvantage 32 I can immediately find the 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.820
 goal with whelton that as I said also 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.770
 strong of head 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:37.340
 what's called michel bastos is really 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:39.110
 very strong in crosses too, however 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.300
 the episode ends here I invite you to it 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.570
 I don't like a comment and sign up 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:47.570
 to the channel my messages or comments 

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:51.460
 on scud builder you would like to see and there 

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.460
 see next beautiful episode raga
