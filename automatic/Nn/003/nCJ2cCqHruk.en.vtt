00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.550
 Hello dear friends with you I am a crane 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.770
 and today we have another issue of headings 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.980
 deer and inadequate all sorts of ridiculous and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.140
 cool moments in the game world of tanks 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.420
 I remind you not to forget 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.580
 use promotion services 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.040
 novice channels if you want to become 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.620
 popular water affair then this is what 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.989
 you need a link in the description and also 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.540
 I remind you that these replays 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.510
 you personally send in a special topic 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.289
 group in contact can be a reference too 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.760
 below and today we will look at such 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.210
 a cheerful platoon from e-ncs to 3 e 25 who 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.530
 on al-Khaluf climbed up the hill and 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.940
 it is not clear what they start to do 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.219
 simply stand well, our hero into t 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.600
 25/2 they said something they want to answer 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.030
 we will punish you now and here is one of her 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.890
 25 such brave brave fellow 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.990
 just takes rolls off 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.200
 his slides and for some reason 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.850
 dad pressed to the forehead of our hero but 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.390
 he did not like it because there is 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.310
 the rod is so light it is 25/2 just 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.500
 do not notice that it is propped up at all and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.369
 then they simply start 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.890
 three to rely on the poor american 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.810
 who don't understand what's going on 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.530
 you stuck to me start on it 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.280
 shoot 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.369
 one of them turns blue immediately but on this 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.890
 he doesn't finish his pranks his not 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.630
 embarrass 2 too 2 shoots the same 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.360
 Blue is generally already two blue friends 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.329
 fun attacker watching something apparently 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.119
 one flew into the autobahn one still lived like that 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.860
 let's say well, and the third note friends 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.930
 the third as if nothing had happened and 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.210
 oh guys they serve not with them well in 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.070
 what kind of platoon left guys called i 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.170
 I'm not aware of anything at all if something is not 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.390
 blue or just starting 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.510
 roll back one flew into 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.050
 autobahns 2 killed too 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.790
 pester our platoon with platoon 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.010
 incomprehensible platoon one seems to be 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.930
 how not at affairs 2 just flew away 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.090
 autobahn why do we need to collect a platoon if 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.030
 you are not adequate and one of you 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.920
 fly away soon in ban meaning then in general 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.950
 gather but the bottom line is that such 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.830
 three funny kids who thanks 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.709
 they poured him a fight well, and here is our third such 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.989
 let's say heroes quotes just as in 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.000
 than not worth the attack I'm fighting I 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.579
 it's not by chance that everything was for me 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.160
 there is a common brother playing at the computer going 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:51.440
 just for whom 13 merges but what else 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.480
 he has to do next, we have a hero on 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.600
 yagdtigre which for some reason 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.230
 went deep on the green and see what's here 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.810
 are trying to attack the enemy estechka 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.690
 object 430 option 2 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.730
 and yes he does not lose his opportunities all 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.010
 yet our hero is fri-shka by the way here we are 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.500
 shoot and impenetrable right in the side 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.840
 the caterpillar of all and here and need naturally 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.180
 the cake especially as slow as yaga 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.459
 cheat at Yaga understeer 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.549
 no power density at all 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.980
 no generally light this production well, 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.200
 enemy st-shka weird because 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.540
 it is not quite sp he is not fully 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.900
 turns the tower and therefore with difficulty 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.650
 trying to cheat our hero and here 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.540
 already seemingly hopeless situation 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.609
 need to do something and gave our hero 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.459
 all the same that it turns out even though he 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:47.440
 lost most of my health 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:50.970
 Here you can already get a shot but no 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.010
 Allied artillery sent our 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.420
 he is the head of the head and he becomes 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.080
 shot for the enemy 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.390
 This naturally gets it though ours 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.680
 heroes coped with the enemy haircut himself 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:08.640
 quite calm and easy well and in the end 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.880
 lost the battle because of the tagged artillery on 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.750
 queues we have a sandy river yes and this 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.040
 firefly account and only 10 7 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.799
 our win 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.200
 but the firefly does not despair and begins 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.420
 take the base but still you never know what 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.520
 happen because the main part 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.280
 enemies up almost all the enemies that 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.100
 left they hang out somewhere in the mountains 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.560
 near the allied base on the allied base 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.710
 notice no one is left except 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.100
 two artillery flock on capture see 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:45.990
 704 objects of the Union which arrived 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:49.200
 then looks 12 8 I'll go if we don't know 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.830
 around the house is still ahead of the artillery won guv 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.470
 the panther glows and further the main deer 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.870
 and inadequate today will be exactly 704 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.460
 the object is right here before reaching artillery 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:06.390
 and see you 13 8 our brother pt to 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.430
 hike bombanulo and shiz jammed because 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.820
 that what he will start doing now 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.560
 defies no logic 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.720
 turns around and what do you think 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.820
 happen now yes he kills 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.210
 firefly on which the main capture 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:24.440
 kept in the meantime 2 union u will return 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.630
 two enemies passed through the sands of the ladies and 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.630
 begin to seize the allied base 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.660
 Well, our two ally stand exactly in 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.240
 same moment and now man moment many 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.460
 moments in general I can't need 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.280
 just a third person stand on 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.950
 capture and then one hundred percent victory but 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.440
 our blue object 704 of this is not 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.930
 understand and starts to go somewhere he is 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.840
 sees that two enemies stand on the hold 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:56.180
 here you can only win by capturing 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.320
 thanks to the fact that the three of us will become a nose 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.780
 last seconds just a circle and 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.200
 naturally 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.690
 nobody's friends he could immediately take the base he 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.430
 the firefly could not stray he could help 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.800
 eventually grab her 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.919
 but he did none of that all 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.580
 ruined and with such an account gave ally 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:19.100
 team lose this epic you think 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.139
 it's all oh no today i am for you 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.650
 prepared another replay 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:27.139
 I play Wait Tatyanam because of the clans myself 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.350
 yes we played in a platoon I merged as 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:33.400
 last days right now tatyana center tried 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:36.560
 drag find the sixth score again 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:40.370
 green 98 seems to be winning even 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.250
 10 8 Nov stasya well immediately made it clear 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.230
 because the situation is tense and necessary 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.090
 in any way they get on the capture again 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.790
 another fight to merge because it is already 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.610
 there were a few plums then in a row 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:57.500
 more enemies move all along the top 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:07:01.430
 parts of the map on the ally base one tiger 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:05.000
 these whole horde excuse me deer in 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.160
 the center of the map is written jagdtigr what the hell 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.520
 what are they to take the base and what's next 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:13.760
 it will just happen to me 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.610
 friends I just almost lost my mind 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.910
 because ten seconds left and 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:22.010
 Jagdtigr kills staza on with that 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.350
 Stasia was like a community but was 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.410
 drawing is not enough yes like an account 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:31.010
 12:09 no need to take it says base but 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:34.640
 the bottom line is what will happen next 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:37.610
 Arab opponents just getting on 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.530
 grab and in 3 snout literally in a few 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.530
 seconds sweeping away the tiger 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:45.200
 start to capture the base and as you already 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.690
 understand the base will be taken 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.060
 I then wanted to break the curse 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:52.430
 keyboard friends so deer 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.600
 come across not only a bath and me 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.600
 have to face them 

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.289
 unbearably do not forget them 

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:02.510
 complain to subscribe to the channel with 

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:06.970
 Like one deer die it 

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.970
 verified information well i went
