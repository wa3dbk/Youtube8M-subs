00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.929
 Hi guys all right 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.140
 today I come from the review of the kabuki kit 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.539
 containing four brushes that I 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.939
 I got there from the charming month shop 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.010
 This kit here when I liked the photo 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.099
 is not the money, kiss the girls 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.460
 have gone crazy to know more about 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.250
 close 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.980
 so let's go there the kit review 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.989
 Good girls, this kit is good looking 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.700
 with that you're the explosions already 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.680
 I will show you here on the channel for you 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.230
 review only that it has some 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.750
 differences I'll show you 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.860
 so I got a brush of the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.739
 explosions 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.410
 Look, he's coming up and I'm going to get the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.210
 same brush that comes in the kit is 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.699
 showing you what the difference is 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.260
 of the kit when the circumstance 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:07.080
 People look at this one, it's a lot fatter. 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:10.260
 and plumper it is denser O I 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.400
 I already washed it is in relation to the design 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.979
 Here's the cable brush here too. 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.560
 more chubby and is a design much more 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:25.049
 nice and a cable is also chubby 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.369
 and the size of people is just a little bit 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.560
 difference 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.770
 I do not know if it will give you any idea. 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.650
 but it's just a little bit of difference 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.579
 He's just a little fatter in size. 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.619
 he has quite certain and he is super 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.110
 super soft 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.899
 So you're getting poor today. 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.869
 I believe that even the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.140
 He is going to give super cef for this. 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.229
 Applying and what I found most cool 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.890
 in this kit people I washed and did not 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.049
 I did not wash any sows like that. 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.719
 we arrived which was amazing we went 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.840
 The only kit I have that will not let go 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.390
 none 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.879
 catch what is then tip is super 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.440
 already positive for the good kit then that is 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.319
 the next sky tire 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.959
 Unfortunately, I do not have the cics for you. 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.150
 making a comparison for you because 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.360
 My damage when I already told you here. 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.970
 for you guys in some video but this is it 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.879
 It's what I found the most like then 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.290
 he looks so serious 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:34.660
 also super soft and it is very well 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.840
 this money with the other of cics 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.470
 This is the right brush. 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.260
 It's getting base and beak in and everything. 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.209
 it leaves the skin well polished and very pretty 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.090
 so a brush to show you 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.849
 You 're the one I use to make it. 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.780
 the contour or also the silver by applying 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.730
 today he is very fat with him too 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.860
 quite a lot of bills 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.230
 He's very dense and I'll be catching on. 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.290
 of explosions for you to see 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.810
 difference then look at the difference 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:13.269
 size of the two is this 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:19.829
 And, look, people are screaming the difference. 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:23.709
 look this is ben gordan give a good fan 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:27.220
 while this one is thinner here 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.200
 So it ends up here that he's going to be 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.650
 more accurate when you are 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.599
 making the outline the tatá passing blush 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.590
 while the one from here will pick up an area 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.630
 bigger 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.840
 but I found this incredible potential 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:45.609
 people are very soft so this is the 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.790
 brush brush and the most different is 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.769
 this one is the famous silver brush 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.590
 applying corrective 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.599
 But I found it too big to 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.269
 I'm getting corrective, I do not know if I'm going. 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.130
 I adapt well with him but I found one 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.669
 Brush pretty good, are you doing it? 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.680
 outline too he's pretty precise then 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.870
 if you do not want to do the outline 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.380
 with this one because he thinks he gets the 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.950
 sea ​​is bigger you like applying 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.620
 today with this and even applying by doing 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.920
 outline with this one then it is so 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:24.630
 girls, he has a lot of bristles too 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.760
 Look, he's very dense and has this point. 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.790
 here is super nice to you doing the 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.720
 nose contour also looks people at 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.520
 difference between the two is glaring 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.650
 that's why I do not think I'm going 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.450
 adapt a lot to apply the concealer 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.240
 with which he takes up an area well 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.090
 big and I prefer brushes 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.490
 Smaller is getting the corrective 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.190
 then this is the difference between the two 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.710
 years with love then this kit
