00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.750
 hello everybody is not only the visual years we will understand the operation of a 

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:07.340
 both simplistic 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.370
 then we have here the electric scheme that represents that bond 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.279
 these two terminal weeks are presented 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.159
 connected to our power supply. 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:19.070
 or higher court 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.060
 is in that pole of the source that we join will consist of having 127 volts 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.730
 so this first segment of driver 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.300
 You want to know how I feel? 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.349
 to do 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.500
 here is your representation 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.159
 to be taken 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.159
 to the first terminal of the single switch 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.980
 here is your presentation 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.800
 the second terminal 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.570
 of the yew river that has become the segment of fiuk we call return 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.850
 here your symbol to the first lamp terminal 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.870
 I give you second lamp terminal 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.670
 leaves with our last segment of driver 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.690
 here is called the neutral and is taken back to our source. 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.240
 that pole we considered as zero votes 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.710
 on the right side we have the real situation that this 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.710
 first design the electrical system represents 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.260
 so we'll see here 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.940
 three ground phase conductors and no other 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.410
 where it did as well as in china 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.190
 a branch leads to the first terminal 322 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.620
 of the second terminal in which the driver exits the segment of conductor that receives the name 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.100
 and goes to the first lamp terminal 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.950
 of the second terminal of lampadosa is another segment that is connected to our 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.410
 neutral and back there pro frame 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.229
 d 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.670
 distribution 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.450
 let's take a look now at the schematic representation of this scheme 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.310
 so we have here 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.460
 any room 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.360
 is intended straight segments 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.630
 question in the center of our Brazil 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.630
 I represent our products 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.429
 we have a lamp 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:16.959
 which is normally regarded as a reference point of distribution 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.369
 by circuit 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:20.929
 when we look at this representation 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:24.379
 soon we understand that for this first conduit 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.479
 we passed two drivers 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.489
 do it 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.499
 the neutral 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.269
 as 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.459
 by this or other conduit 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.869
 also pass the two drivers 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.079
 does that and the return 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.519
 if we remember those who is best epic seen previously 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.789
 we will observe 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.269
 What wire does this? 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.899
 he is taken up 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:49.509
 the switch 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.679
 another switch leaves a return wire 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:55.619
 raised to the lamp 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.509
 dulko second fernanda lamps comes out a neutral wire 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:05.239
 if taken back to our power board then we have here 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.529
 to the world 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:08.659
 the comeback 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:09.829
 returning 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.019
 and a neutral also that going back there for our food
