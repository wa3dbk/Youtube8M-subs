from the website from the patient of

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
these they actually looked a lot better

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.969 
these they actually looked a lot better
quality<00:01:11.729> than<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> first<00:01:12.180> ones<00:01:12.500> but<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.860> know

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

quality than the first ones but you know
again<00:01:14.280> i'm<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.700> put<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.030> test

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
again i'm going to put it to the test

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.840 
again i'm going to put it to the test
when<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.780> guess<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.110> point<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> box

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
when I guess that point you see the box

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.609 
when I guess that point you see the box
is<00:01:18.000> still<00:01:18.060> falling<00:01:18.390> apart<00:01:21.170> but<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.590> go

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
is still falling apart but here you go

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.370 
is still falling apart but here you go
right<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.920> adizero<00:01:25.920> 5-star

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
right here so this is the adizero 5-star

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.020 
right here so this is the adizero 5-star
2<00:01:28.380> point<00:01:28.650> 0<00:01:29.780> does<00:01:30.780> feel<00:01:31.079> extra<00:01:31.979> light<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:33.000> I

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
2 point 0 does feel extra light so I

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.300 
2 point 0 does feel extra light so I
mean<00:01:33.270> that's<00:01:33.299> their<00:01:33.600> whole<00:01:33.780> thing<00:01:34.020> right<00:01:34.310> 6.7

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
mean that's their whole thing right 6.7

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.800 
mean that's their whole thing right 6.7
ounces<00:01:35.729> compared<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> first<00:01:36.570> version

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
ounces compared to the first version

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.050 
ounces compared to the first version
which<00:01:37.140> was<00:01:37.220> six<00:01:38.220> point<00:01:38.400> nine<00:01:38.490> ounces<00:01:38.939> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
which was six point nine ounces I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
which was six point nine ounces I
believe<00:01:39.470> some<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> differences<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.130> don't

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
believe some of the differences I don't

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.830 
believe some of the differences I don't
had<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.579> five-star<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.210> first<00:01:42.390> ones<00:01:42.659> but

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
had the five-star the first ones but

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.060 
had the five-star the first ones but
some<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:43.740> bit<00:01:43.920> higher

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
some of this is this a little bit higher

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.160 
some of this is this a little bit higher
here<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:45.210> kind<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.509> concerned<00:01:45.840> about<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
here I'm kind of concerned about the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.810 
here I'm kind of concerned about the
heel<00:01:46.409> counter<00:01:46.649> because<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.130> heel<00:01:47.310> color<00:01:47.610> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
heel counter because the heel color is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.300 
heel counter because the heel color is
so<00:01:48.060> low<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:49.110> don't<00:01:49.259> know<00:01:49.320> how<00:01:49.590> stay<00:01:50.100> will

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
so low so I don't know how stay will

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.679 
so low so I don't know how stay will
your<00:01:50.460> foots<00:01:50.670> going<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.240> last<00:01:51.509> time

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.109 
that I test out let's see says the color
treatment<00:01:57.000> will<00:01:57.149> begin<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.540> wear<00:01:57.719> off<00:01:57.930> over

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
treatment will begin to wear off over

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.399 
treatment will begin to wear off over
time<00:02:00.119> with<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.630> kind<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.140> chrome

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.120 
pleats too so we'll see how long that
lasts<00:02:03.750> or<00:02:03.840> if<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.990> starts<00:02:04.229> chip<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.799> little

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
lasts or if it starts chip in a little

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.950 
lasts or if it starts chip in a little
way<00:02:05.549> out<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:05.880> I'm<00:02:06.000> kind<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.360> interested<00:02:06.659> in

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
way out but I'm kind of interested in

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.320 
way out but I'm kind of interested in
seeing<00:02:07.320> what<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.039> support<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.209> this

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
seeing what the support is like in this

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.510 
seeing what the support is like in this
in<00:02:09.539> terms<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> cushioning<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:11.190> ankle

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
in terms of the cushioning the ankle

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.340 
in terms of the cushioning the ankle
support<00:02:11.970> those<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:12.510> some<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.750> things<00:02:12.780> on

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
support those are some of the things on

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.020 
support those are some of the things on
obviously<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.100> lightweight<00:02:14.490> it'll<00:02:14.820> probably

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
obviously is lightweight it'll probably

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.030 
obviously is lightweight it'll probably
weigh<00:02:15.240> in<00:02:15.420> less<00:02:15.630> than<00:02:15.810> any<00:02:16.020> other<00:02:16.200> cleat<00:02:16.470> to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
weigh in less than any other cleat to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.300 
weigh in less than any other cleat to
have<00:02:17.280> but<00:02:18.120> really<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:19.620> terms<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:20.070> weight<00:02:20.280> you

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
have but really in terms of weight you

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.190 
have but really in terms of weight you
want<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.910> support<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.450> rebound<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.020> every

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
want that support and rebound so every

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.740 
want that support and rebound so every
time<00:02:22.230> your<00:02:22.590> foot<00:02:23.060> pounds<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.300> ground<00:02:24.540> it's

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
time your foot pounds to the ground it's

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.810 
time your foot pounds to the ground it's
absorbing<00:02:25.260> your<00:02:25.320> energy<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:25.980> then<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.610> want

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
absorbing your energy and then you want

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.610 
absorbing your energy and then you want
the<00:02:26.940> shoe<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.150> return<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.870> energy<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.470> so

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the shoe to return the energy to you so

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.900 
the shoe to return the energy to you so
it<00:02:28.680> doesn't<00:02:28.980> matter<00:02:29.070> if<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.400> have<00:02:29.430> really

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
it doesn't matter if you have really

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.340 
it doesn't matter if you have really
light<00:02:30.060> cleats<00:02:30.390> if<00:02:30.600> it's<00:02:30.750> not<00:02:30.870> returning<00:02:31.290> to

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
light cleats if it's not returning to

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.560 
light cleats if it's not returning to
energy<00:02:31.790> you're<00:02:32.790> not<00:02:32.940> going<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.150> be<00:02:33.210> as<00:02:33.330> fast

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
energy you're not going to be as fast

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.810 
energy you're not going to be as fast
and<00:02:33.810> that's<00:02:33.960> something<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.290> zoom<00:02:34.830> air<00:02:35.070> does

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
and that's something that zoom air does

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.400 
and that's something that zoom air does
which<00:02:36.240> is<00:02:36.270> why<00:02:36.420> i<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.720> my<00:02:36.870> carbon<00:02:37.200> flies

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
which is why i like my carbon flies

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.250 
which is why i like my carbon flies
because<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.040> has<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> zoomare<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:39.660> has<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> super

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
because it has a zoomare it has a super

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.520 
because it has a zoomare it has a super
i<00:02:40.530> think<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.370> called<00:02:41.400> super<00:02:41.730> sprint<00:02:42.000> skin

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
i think it's called super sprint skin

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.720 
i think it's called super sprint skin
that's<00:02:43.530> something<00:02:43.740> from<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.070> tribe<00:02:44.310> pleated

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
that's something from the tribe pleated

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.070 
that's something from the tribe pleated
cycle<00:02:45.120> one<00:02:45.510> material<00:02:45.840> synthetic<00:02:46.800> leather<00:02:48.080> you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
cycle one material synthetic leather you

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.910 
cycle one material synthetic leather you
know<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.440> should<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.650> really

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
know so this should be really

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.070 
know so this should be really
