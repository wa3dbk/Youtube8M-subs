the screw is going through the antenna
and<00:05:46.570> the<00:05:46.900> board<00:05:49.200> now<00:05:50.200> we'll<00:05:51.070> take<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.580> back

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
and the board now we'll take the back

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.500 
and the board now we'll take the back
housing<00:05:52.240> and<00:05:53.229> we'll<00:05:53.349> reassemble<00:05:53.830> it<00:05:54.510> starting

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
housing and we'll reassemble it starting

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.870

and you merely hold and squeeze snaps
back<00:06:03.340> together

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 
back together

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.320 
back together
squeeze<00:06:05.289> the<00:06:06.039> contacts<00:06:06.580> are<00:06:06.759> in<00:06:06.879> there<00:06:07.059> good

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
squeeze the contacts are in there good

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.499 
squeeze the contacts are in there good
we<00:06:08.259> flip<00:06:08.529> it<00:06:08.650> back<00:06:08.830> over<00:06:08.860> and<00:06:09.520> now<00:06:10.210> it's<00:06:10.360> time

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509 
we flip it back over and now it's time

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.739 
we flip it back over and now it's time
to<00:06:10.569> put<00:06:10.809> our<00:06:10.840> screws<00:06:11.199> in<00:06:12.330> take<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:13.449> Phillips

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:13.749 
to put our screws in take the Phillips

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:18.689 
to put our screws in take the Phillips
screwdriver<00:06:14.370> install<00:06:15.370> the<00:06:15.550> screws<00:06:17.339> nice<00:06:18.339> and
