to<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> love<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> fact<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.119> there's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
to this so I love the fact that there's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.210 
to this so I love the fact that there's
like<00:01:36.509> decent<00:01:36.750> capacity<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> hip<00:01:37.979> belt

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
like decent capacity for the hip belt

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.800 
like decent capacity for the hip belt
pockets<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.850> both<00:01:39.000> sides<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.689> good

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
pockets and on both sides a really good

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.109 
pockets and on both sides a really good
job<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.470> would<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.100> prefer<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.880> this

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
job I would actually prefer that this

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.969 
job I would actually prefer that this
was<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> material<00:01:42.869> instead<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.530> mesh<00:01:43.710> just

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
was a material instead of a mesh just

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.859 
was a material instead of a mesh just
because<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.430> way<00:01:44.610> whatever<00:01:45.240> items<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.720> put

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
because that way whatever items I put

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.539 
because that way whatever items I put
inside<00:01:46.200> are<00:01:46.740> protected<00:01:47.250> from<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> elements

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
inside are protected from the elements

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.630 
inside are protected from the elements
but<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.240> mean<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:49.229> way<00:01:49.409> these<00:01:49.770> are<00:01:50.009> set<00:01:50.369> up<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
but I mean the way these are set up I

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.160 
but I mean the way these are set up I
mean<00:01:50.790> I'll<00:01:50.880> take<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.630> anyways

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
mean I'll take it I like it anyways

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.830 
mean I'll take it I like it anyways
that's<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> little<00:01:53.399> nitpick

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that's just a little nitpick

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.270 
that's just a little nitpick
going<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.250> suspension<00:01:56.640> itself<00:01:58.009> this<00:01:59.009> bag

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
going to the suspension itself this bag

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.940 
going to the suspension itself this bag
has<00:01:59.520> what's<00:01:59.759> called<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.060> airspeed<00:02:00.479> system

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
has what's called the airspeed system

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.080 
has what's called the airspeed system
probably<00:02:01.950> seen<00:02:02.189> similar<00:02:02.399> systems<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:02.969> other

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
probably seen similar systems on other

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.550 
probably seen similar systems on other
bags<00:02:03.299> before<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:03.750> basically<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.289> is

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
bags before but basically what it is

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.039 
bags before but basically what it is
you<00:02:04.859> got<00:02:05.009> an<00:02:05.130> aluminum<00:02:05.640> frame<00:02:05.789> or<00:02:06.630> an<00:02:06.780> alloy

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
you got an aluminum frame or an alloy

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.960 
you got an aluminum frame or an alloy
frame<00:02:07.319> that<00:02:07.649> bends<00:02:07.859> away<00:02:08.039> from<00:02:08.220> your<00:02:08.580> back<00:02:08.700> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
frame that bends away from your back and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.350 
frame that bends away from your back and
then<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:10.140> mesh<00:02:10.649> panel<00:02:10.920> over<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:12.209> so

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
then you have a mesh panel over it so

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.789 
then you have a mesh panel over it so
that<00:02:12.510> way<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.810> extra<00:02:13.140> space<00:02:13.319> allows<00:02:13.620> air

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
that way this extra space allows air

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.080 
that way this extra space allows air
circulation<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.430> go<00:02:14.519> in<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.730> then<00:02:14.879> when<00:02:14.970> you're

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
circulation to go in so then when you're

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.119 
circulation to go in so then when you're
carrying<00:02:15.569> this<00:02:15.720> bag<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.379> trail<00:02:16.590> you're

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
carrying this bag on the trail you're

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.559 
carrying this bag on the trail you're
not<00:02:17.250> gonna<00:02:17.370> get<00:02:17.580> sweaty<00:02:17.849> back<00:02:18.030> from<00:02:18.299> having

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
not gonna get sweaty back from having

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.960 
not gonna get sweaty back from having
all<00:02:19.019> your<00:02:19.319> gear<00:02:19.590> loaded<00:02:19.890> up<00:02:20.099> against<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.580> now

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
you got to be a little bit more careful

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.539 
you got to be a little bit more careful

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
weight is more evenly distributed but

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.949 
weight is more evenly distributed but
you<00:02:26.099> do<00:02:26.220> have<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.549> comfort<00:02:27.060> area<00:02:27.269> right<00:02:27.750> here

that's easy now one thing I will give a
hit<00:03:08.130> here<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.519> for<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.790> compression<00:03:09.180> straps

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
hit here is for the compression straps

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.729 
hit here is for the compression straps
these<00:03:09.959> are<00:03:10.200> just<00:03:10.940> strapped<00:03:11.940> in<00:03:12.120> there's<00:03:12.359> no<00:03:12.540> a

loading<00:03:59.620> bags<00:03:59.739> so<00:03:59.950> it<00:03:59.980> would<00:04:00.129> have<00:04:00.220> liked<00:04:00.370> an

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
loading bags so it would have liked an

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.339 
loading bags so it would have liked an
extra<00:04:00.760> pocket<00:04:00.910> right<00:04:01.150> here<00:04:03.180> going<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.450> but<00:04:05.290> I'm

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
extra pocket right here going to but I'm

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:06.900 
extra pocket right here going to but I'm
guessing<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:06.010> reason<00:04:06.280> they<00:04:06.370> left<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.610> pocket

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
guessing the reason they left the pocket

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.729 
guessing the reason they left the pocket
out<00:04:06.989> zippers<00:04:07.989> add<00:04:08.140> weight<00:04:08.349> because<00:04:08.620> it's

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
out zippers add weight because it's

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.020 
out zippers add weight because it's
metal<00:04:08.920> so<00:04:09.160> I'm<00:04:09.250> guessing<00:04:09.489> they're<00:04:09.610> trying<00:04:10.000> to

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
metal so I'm guessing they're trying to

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.610 
metal so I'm guessing they're trying to
streamline<00:04:10.480> this<00:04:10.629> as<00:04:10.810> much<00:04:10.989> as<00:04:11.110> possible<00:04:11.290> and

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:20.399 
check that out pretty cool I really

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:22.760 
check that out pretty cool I really
don't<00:05:20.550> want<00:05:20.669> to<00:05:20.729> call<00:05:20.879> it<00:05:21.089> I<00:05:21.389> mean<00:05:21.569> yeah<00:05:22.529> they

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
don't want to call it I mean yeah they

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.169 
don't want to call it I mean yeah they
would<00:05:22.919> probably<00:05:23.219> be<00:05:23.279> listed<00:05:23.580> as<00:05:23.669> side<00:05:23.819> pockets

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:24.179 
would probably be listed as side pockets

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:25.820 
would probably be listed as side pockets
but<00:05:24.360> actually<00:05:24.719> I<00:05:24.779> would<00:05:25.080> say<00:05:25.379> these<00:05:25.529> are<00:05:25.589> too

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
but actually I would say these are too

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.320 
but actually I would say these are too
big<00:05:26.009> front<00:05:26.249> pockets<00:05:26.580> because<00:05:26.939> they<00:05:27.179> don't

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
big front pockets because they don't

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.369 
big front pockets because they don't
expand<00:05:27.599> from<00:05:27.779> the<00:05:27.839> side<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.139> bag<00:05:28.259> they

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:28.379 
expand from the side of the bag they

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.079 
expand from the side of the bag they
actually<00:05:28.679> extend<00:05:28.979> outward<00:05:29.339> from<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.639> top<00:05:29.849> so

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.089 
actually extend outward from the top so

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:37.059 
actually extend outward from the top so
it<00:05:30.179> doesn't<00:05:30.509> feel<00:05:31.050> too<00:05:31.110> bulky<00:05:31.729> that's<00:05:32.729> cool
