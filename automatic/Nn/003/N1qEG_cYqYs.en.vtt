I'm not gonna really show that one off
we<00:03:56.890> were<00:03:56.980> looking<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.280> hub<00:03:57.519> a<00:03:57.549> little<00:03:57.880> bit's

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
we were looking the hub a little bit's

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.449 
we were looking the hub a little bit's
change<00:03:58.299> at<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.570> hub<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.890> if<00:03:59.980> you<00:04:00.070> click<00:04:00.250> up

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459
