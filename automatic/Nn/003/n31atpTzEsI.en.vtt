00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello people welcome to the second part 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.160
 my magic 2014/2015 Germany 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.219
 So yes, primary booster display can do that 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.840
 it will be a long name now 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.250
 proceed as follows 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.170
 It is difficult though now 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.020
 probably the second part earlier 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.240
 as the first part is yes 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.769
 actually no matter 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.029
 but as I said at the first part of the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.039
 Charge up and that's pretty 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.910
 long or takes too long 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.790
 Now I do not do the second part 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.980
 as long and as you can see here are the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.100
 booster cup before as I said to the first 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.420
 part made 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.829
 then they will also look up 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.239
 every case the first part but you 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.820
 you'll probably be the second one now 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.430
 as a first topic so first here couple 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.510
 pass the second part 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.989
 can open up 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.699
 because I said yes I will 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.199
 other highlands as fast as possible 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.320
 lasts too long it still lasts 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.090
 About two hours because here is a kag 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.320
 Internet line so I will as 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.220
 First this boxing and so first 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.040
 So upload I think will only be 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:15.259
 and as I said, I'm starting now 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.640
 As I said you have the packs here 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.110
 artworks that would be everything in the first 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.650
 Couple of toes I have everything again 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:36.079
 Here we have from camel lady explained 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:36.079
 war many rudi stohl expect 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:49.370
 with power card midfield bayern 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:55.150
 stocker maly valdez is said to have a parking card 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.150
 Mittelfeld is teams flights too long 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.260
 winged pliers crabs and ribery 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.230
 that's the new team did so very much 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.820
 very cool as I said I'm really like 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.910
 thanks to other dealers than me 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.530
 in the display could have as promo the 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.260
 geo there is no one 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.330
 the cards are always so turned over like that 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.730
 I have the first part I have 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.760
 already said that I like the pace cards 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:28.840
 not kiessling star player very horny 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:31.150
 the base cards will not show that way 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.400
 So as you said you have 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.400
 Matchwinner coming in five what 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.420
 packs then you have hat trick 56 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.720
 packs and club 100 was the belief 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.720
 I 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.709
 160 pack 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.590
 I would have seen that here 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:59.230
 Union Berlin second division sign very cool 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.230
 and here we have another price 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:15.440
 the other video it pretty much takes 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.940
 long yes so I will definitely 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:23.840
 the first part still takes scene 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:30.319
 about twelve minutes left report 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.250
 was probably smoother bvb and right in 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.269
 hamburg also another two 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.670
 favorite team nicky eagle my 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:41.900
 is 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.849
 matchwinner carlos zambrano very cool 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.739
 10.4 million worth up here with 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.930
 The value of the men just sit 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.140
 you do not have to be really awesome cool 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.140
 say 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.360
 and that's the match for me 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:10.150
 werder bremen wolfsburg I confused 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:12.250
 at wolfsburg club lewandowski as 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.200
 I want last pack here then I can 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.820
 Show you this too because we have one 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.100
 have pulled transparent card 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:25.110
 and here is captain from augsburg the 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:28.450
 is a transparent Paul publishers here 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.460
 794 million as well as a map very much 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.230
 In any case, I have made cool 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.960
 a few already pulled and already 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.419
 here always have earlier and hennings that 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.680
 It was from the second part of my display 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.690
 you see I still have a lot of them 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.750
 cards left over, which we will open later 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.669
 In any case, what I wanted to say is 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.470
 yes as I said you see yourself loud 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.820
 first part is high but that takes time 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.490
 Hold on for a long time as I said that 's it 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.669
 from the video of me I hope 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.290
 So it fits in order it does you 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.910
 somehow do not do it hard but that 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.290
 the first parts will definitely follow suit 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.370
 the second that was mine and me 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.370
 say goodbye until then
