00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
MSRP which is almost exactly what I'd

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.380

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
anticipated it was going to be so no

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.690 
anticipated it was going to be so no
shocker<00:00:45.629> there<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:46.050> least<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.379> my<00:00:46.410> part<00:00:46.700> I'm

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
shocker there at least on my part I'm

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.040 
shocker there at least on my part I'm
not<00:00:47.879> disappointed<00:00:48.149> by<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.570> by<00:00:48.840> any<00:00:48.960> means

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
not disappointed by it by any means

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.130 
not disappointed by it by any means
because<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.739> was<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.039> was<00:00:50.160> expecting<00:00:50.520> I

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
because it was what I was expecting I

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.119 
because it was what I was expecting I
think<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> reasonable<00:00:52.469> price<00:00:52.920> even

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
think it's a reasonable price even

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
think it's a reasonable price even
though<00:00:53.280> I'm<00:00:53.399> sure<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> lot<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.059> people

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
though I'm sure that a lot of people

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.500 
though I'm sure that a lot of people
will<00:00:54.629> disagree<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.230> me<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.510> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
will disagree with me on that and the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.200 
will disagree with me on that and the
launch<00:00:57.719> date<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.500> going<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:59.010> marched<00:00:59.309> 27th
