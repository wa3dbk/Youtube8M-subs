from<00:00:47.730> my<00:00:47.789> opinion<00:00:48.510> no<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.160> mean<00:00:50.160> listen<00:00:50.809> TNA<00:00:51.809> has

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
from my opinion no I mean listen TNA has

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.729 
from my opinion no I mean listen TNA has
a<00:00:52.020> history<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.620> heel<00:00:53.010> turns<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.670> sake<00:00:53.969> of

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
a history of heel turns for the sake of

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.229 
a history of heel turns for the sake of
swerving<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.949> Internet<00:00:56.340> audience<00:00:56.550> and

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
swerving the Internet audience and

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.209 
swerving the Internet audience and
seeing<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.989> kind<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.379> behavior<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.070> past

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
seeing this kind of behavior in the past

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.930 
seeing this kind of behavior in the past
so<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.120> take<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> lot<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.340> direction<00:01:02.340> from<00:01:02.520> TNA

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
so I take a lot of direction from TNA
