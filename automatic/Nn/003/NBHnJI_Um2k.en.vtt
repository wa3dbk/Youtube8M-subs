up the other day to see how well the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.479 
up the other day to see how well the
system<00:00:36.180> works<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.750> found<00:00:37.559> their<00:00:37.770> claims<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> be

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
system works I found their claims to be

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.619 
system works I found their claims to be
very<00:00:38.940> true

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
very true

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.380 
very true
it<00:00:39.989> was<00:00:40.230> indeed<00:00:40.590> amazingly<00:00:41.550> robust<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
it was indeed amazingly robust and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.020 
it was indeed amazingly robust and
fairly<00:00:43.020> easy<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.410> use<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.610> editing

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
fairly easy to use I was editing

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
fairly easy to use I was editing
instantly<00:00:45.719> after<00:00:46.110> uploading<00:00:46.469> my<00:00:46.680> clips<00:00:47.010> now

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
instantly after uploading my clips now

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.549 
instantly after uploading my clips now
let<00:00:48.149> me<00:00:48.300> say<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.809> think<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.200> helped

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
let me say that I do think it helped

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.810 
let me say that I do think it helped
that<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.680> already<00:00:49.980> know<00:00:50.100> how<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.280> edit<00:00:50.579> video

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that I already know how to edit video

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.450 
that I already know how to edit video
and<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.539> WeVideo<00:00:52.050> system<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.770> very<00:00:53.129> similar

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and the WeVideo system is very similar

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.840 
and the WeVideo system is very similar
to<00:00:53.789> standard<00:00:54.390> video<00:00:54.899> editing<00:00:55.320> software<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.219> it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
to standard video editing software so it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.520 
to standard video editing software so it
was<00:00:57.210> easy<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.690> me<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.840> find<00:00:58.079> my<00:00:58.260> way<00:00:58.410> around

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
was easy for me to find my way around

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
was easy for me to find my way around
but<00:00:58.980> if<00:00:59.100> you're<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.430> as<00:00:59.640> familiar<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.210> video

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
but if you're not as familiar with video

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.750 
but if you're not as familiar with video
editing<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.859> will<00:01:01.980> take<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> bit<00:01:02.460> more

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
editing then it will take you a bit more

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
editing then it will take you a bit more
time<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> learn<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.539> honestly<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.140> still

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
time to learn but honestly it's still

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.859 
time to learn but honestly it's still
really<00:01:04.739> easy<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.790> know<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.510> can

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
really easy and I know you can

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.520 
really easy and I know you can
absolutely<00:01:07.610> master<00:01:08.610> their<00:01:08.790> system<00:01:09.530> WeVideo

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
absolutely master their system WeVideo

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.190 
absolutely master their system WeVideo
is<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:11.040> an<00:01:11.340> automated<00:01:12.000> editing<00:01:12.540> system<00:01:12.930> like

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
is not an automated editing system like

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.620 
is not an automated editing system like
Animoto<00:01:13.799> although<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.360> feature

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
Animoto although they do have a feature

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.450 
Animoto although they do have a feature
called<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> video<00:01:16.259> wizard<00:01:16.890> which<00:01:17.280> will

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
called the video wizard which will

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.219 
called the video wizard which will
automate<00:01:17.909> part<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.360> process<00:01:18.780> if<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.020> wish

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
automate part of the process if you wish

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.460 
automate part of the process if you wish
but<00:01:19.590> generally<00:01:20.520> speaking<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:21.119> video<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.170> much

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
but generally speaking we video is much

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.890 
but generally speaking we video is much
more<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:23.130> standard<00:01:23.640> video<00:01:23.790> editing<00:01:24.390> it's

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
more like standard video editing it's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.600 
more like standard video editing it's
just<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> cloud<00:01:26.130> not<00:01:26.430> on

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
just that you do it in the cloud not on

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.819 
just that you do it in the cloud not on
your<00:01:26.759> own<00:01:26.850> computer<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.619> complete

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
your own computer so you have complete

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.490 
your own computer so you have complete
control<00:01:29.460> over<00:01:30.329> how<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.810> finished<00:01:31.259> video

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
control over how your finished video

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.010 
control over how your finished video
looks<00:01:32.070> which<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.150> case<00:01:33.329> for

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
looks which is not the case for

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.020 
looks which is not the case for
automated<00:01:34.650> systems<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.340> Animoto

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
automated systems like Animoto

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.210 
automated systems like Animoto
but<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.720> course<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.380> video<00:01:37.680> will<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.040> as

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
but of course we video will not be as

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.760 
but of course we video will not be as
fast<00:01:38.520> or<00:01:38.790> brainless<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.600> Animoto<00:01:40.140> either<00:01:40.380> so

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
fast or brainless as Animoto either so

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.999 
fast or brainless as Animoto either so
both<00:01:41.490> systems<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.210> their<00:01:42.329> advantages<00:01:43.009> now

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
both systems have their advantages now

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.609 
both systems have their advantages now
here's<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.700> process<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.299> using<00:01:45.750> WeVideo<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
here's the process of using WeVideo in a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.160 
here's the process of using WeVideo in a
nutshell<00:01:46.970> first<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.180> uploaded<00:01:48.720> some<00:01:48.930> video

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
nutshell first I uploaded some video

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.429 
nutshell first I uploaded some video
clips<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:50.280> video<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.880> accept<00:01:51.240> clips<00:01:51.659> taken<00:01:52.290> on

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
clips we video can accept clips taken on

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.980 
clips we video can accept clips taken on
any<00:01:52.799> device<00:01:53.189> camera<00:01:53.909> or<00:01:54.240> telephone

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
any device camera or telephone

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.679 
any device camera or telephone

so that compatibility alone is really

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.230
