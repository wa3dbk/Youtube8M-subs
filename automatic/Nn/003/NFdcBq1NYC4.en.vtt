right<00:05:15.720> on<00:05:15.960> one<00:05:16.560> of<00:05:16.590> our<00:05:16.860> grooves<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.849> I<00:05:18.599> start

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
right on one of our grooves and I start

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.290 
right on one of our grooves and I start
the<00:05:19.139> drill<00:05:19.409> a<00:05:19.620> little<00:05:19.919> high<00:05:20.099> and<00:05:20.789> I<00:05:20.909> turn<00:05:21.270> it

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
the drill a little high and I turn it

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.330 
the drill a little high and I turn it
just<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:21.900> little<00:05:22.020> tick<00:05:22.380> soap<00:05:22.680> because<00:05:23.039> I<00:05:23.070> won't

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
just a little tick soap because I won't

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.760 
just a little tick soap because I won't
exactly<00:05:24.150> fit<00:05:24.389> between<00:05:24.599> these<00:05:25.050> legs<00:05:25.380> with<00:05:25.620> this

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
exactly fit between these legs with this

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.860 
exactly fit between these legs with this
drill<00:05:26.130> and<00:05:26.669> then<00:05:26.849> I<00:05:27.000> start<00:05:27.389> up<00:05:27.509> the<00:05:27.630> drill<00:05:27.840> I

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
drill and then I start up the drill I

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.040 
drill and then I start up the drill I
can<00:05:28.289> get<00:05:28.770> it<00:05:28.889> started

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
can get it started

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.439 
can get it started
and<00:05:30.169> then<00:05:30.319> I'm<00:05:30.500> going<00:05:30.710> to<00:05:30.830> bring<00:05:31.250> it<00:05:31.370> down<00:05:31.580> so

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
and then I'm going to bring it down so

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.050 
and then I'm going to bring it down so
line<00:05:32.810> in<00:05:33.139> line<00:05:33.410> with<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.280> other<00:05:34.460> structure

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
line in line with the other structure

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.290 
line in line with the other structure
and<00:05:35.330> now<00:05:35.509> I<00:05:35.810> just<00:05:36.289> eat<00:05:36.830> up<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.129> drill<00:05:37.430> and<00:05:37.669> I

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
and now I just eat up the drill and I

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.869 
and now I just eat up the drill and I
put<00:05:38.629> a<00:05:38.659> piece<00:05:38.960> of<00:05:38.990> duct<00:05:39.800> tape<00:05:39.919> on<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.400> drill<00:05:40.699> at

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:40.879 
put a piece of duct tape on the drill at

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.320 
put a piece of duct tape on the drill at
five-eighths<00:05:41.449> so<00:05:41.960> I<00:05:41.990> can't<00:05:42.349> drill<00:05:42.620> too<00:05:42.860> deep

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
five-eighths so I can't drill too deep

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.600 
five-eighths so I can't drill too deep
once<00:05:44.330> I<00:05:44.599> have<00:05:45.139> the<00:05:45.379> holes<00:05:45.590> drilled<00:05:45.919> I'll<00:05:46.310> dry

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
once I have the holes drilled I'll dry

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.719 
once I have the holes drilled I'll dry
assemble<00:05:47.180> as<00:05:47.330> I<00:05:47.569> have<00:05:47.870> here<00:05:48.379> and<00:05:48.560> then<00:05:49.250> I'll

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
assemble as I have here and then I'll

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.510 
assemble as I have here and then I'll
measure<00:05:50.150> the<00:05:50.860> distance<00:05:51.860> to<00:05:51.979> the<00:05:52.220> next

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
measure the distance to the next

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.189 
measure the distance to the next
stretcher<00:05:52.970> and<00:05:53.180> I'll<00:05:53.629> drill<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:53.990> hole<00:05:54.169> for

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
stretcher and I'll drill the hole for

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.040 
stretcher and I'll drill the hole for
that<00:05:54.470> above<00:05:55.159> on<00:05:55.430> this<00:05:55.610> side<00:05:55.849> below<00:05:56.509> on<00:05:56.720> that

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
that above on this side below on that

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.950 
that above on this side below on that
side<00:05:57.379> and<00:05:57.680> then<00:05:58.250> I'll<00:05:58.430> do<00:05:58.639> the<00:05:58.669> final<00:05:59.060> one<00:05:59.360> draw

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
side and then I'll do the final one draw

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.499 
side and then I'll do the final one draw
drilling<00:06:00.860> to<00:06:01.009> the<00:06:01.099> opposite<00:06:01.789> so<00:06:02.090> that<00:06:02.270> these

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
drilling to the opposite so that these

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.260 
drilling to the opposite so that these
back<00:06:02.990> stretchers<00:06:03.560> form<00:06:03.860> an<00:06:04.009> X<00:06:04.280> and<00:06:04.550> I'm<00:06:05.030> not

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
back stretchers form an X and I'm not

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.230 
back stretchers form an X and I'm not
entering<00:06:05.690> this<00:06:05.990> leg<00:06:06.259> on<00:06:06.440> the<00:06:07.280> same<00:06:07.520> plane<00:06:07.880> with

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
entering this leg on the same plane with

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.540 
entering this leg on the same plane with
any<00:06:08.419> of<00:06:08.599> my<00:06:08.630> mortises<00:06:09.319> that's<00:06:10.130> all<00:06:10.310> there<00:06:10.520> is

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
any of my mortises that's all there is

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.230 
any of my mortises that's all there is
to<00:06:10.909> it

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
to it

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.899 
to it
now<00:06:11.810> that<00:06:12.080> we've<00:06:12.229> glued<00:06:12.590> our<00:06:13.310> stool<00:06:13.639> all

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:13.909 
now that we've glued our stool all

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.290 
now that we've glued our stool all
together<00:06:14.120> and<00:06:14.860> wedge<00:06:15.860> the<00:06:16.190> tenants<00:06:16.789> and<00:06:17.060> we've

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
together and wedge the tenants and we've

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.939 
together and wedge the tenants and we've
wedged<00:06:17.569> it<00:06:17.840> in<00:06:17.930> such<00:06:18.139> a<00:06:18.169> way<00:06:18.380> that<00:06:18.409> we're<00:06:18.740> going

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
wedged it in such a way that we're going

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:22.209 
wedged it in such a way that we're going
to<00:06:19.130> expand<00:06:19.729> the<00:06:19.759> Tenon's<00:06:20.419> along<00:06:21.349> the<00:06:21.680> grain<00:06:21.919> of

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:22.219 
to expand the Tenon's along the grain of

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:25.029 
to expand the Tenon's along the grain of
the<00:06:22.310> seat<00:06:22.550> blank<00:06:22.849> and<00:06:23.120> not<00:06:23.330> across<00:06:23.719> it<00:06:24.039> across

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
the seat blank and not across it across

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.450 
the seat blank and not across it across
would<00:06:25.400> split<00:06:25.789> the<00:06:25.819> blank<00:06:26.180> possibly<00:06:26.810> and<00:06:27.460> now

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
would split the blank possibly and now

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.490 
would split the blank possibly and now
all<00:06:28.789> we<00:06:28.819> have<00:06:29.120> to<00:06:29.240> do<00:06:29.419> is<00:06:29.569> trim<00:06:29.870> these<00:06:30.020> Tenon's

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
all we have to do is trim these Tenon's

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.379 
all we have to do is trim these Tenon's
off<00:06:30.650> and<00:06:30.949> the<00:06:31.039> best<00:06:31.280> tool<00:06:31.520> for<00:06:31.639> that<00:06:31.879> is<00:06:32.060> a<00:06:32.090> big

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:32.389 
off and the best tool for that is a big

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.589 
off and the best tool for that is a big
fish<00:06:32.629> nail<00:06:33.020> down<00:06:33.259> a<00:06:34.030> little<00:06:35.030> bit<00:06:35.150> of<00:06:35.270> sanding

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
fish nail down a little bit of sanding

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.039 
fish nail down a little bit of sanding
and<00:06:35.750> finishing<00:06:35.810> and<00:06:36.380> we're<00:06:36.710> all<00:06:36.770> done
