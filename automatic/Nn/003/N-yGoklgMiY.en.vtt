have<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:04.720> be<00:04:04.840> super<00:04:05.050> duper<00:04:05.350> nice<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.920> so

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
have to be super duper nice and so

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.890

everything else and get the most view as
possible<00:04:12.670> how<00:04:13.090> does<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:13.540> make<00:04:13.989> any<00:04:14.050> sense

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410
