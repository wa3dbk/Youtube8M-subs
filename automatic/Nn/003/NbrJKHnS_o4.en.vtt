 no 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.110
 had not l 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.340
 hi everyone was said to be a gamer 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.230
 hd i hope you're good at everything 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.430
 case me it's great today we get 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.920
 found for a new video on 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.489
 call of duty modern warfare 2 then 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.220
 it's a gameplay of myself I was 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.140
 with the silent vector but tweeted 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.140
 pro commando pro pass pass pro and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.479
 pro opposition force in equipment 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.710
 I had space 12 in equipment 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.570
 youth spent in secondary weapons 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.020
 never space 12 and equipment 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.880
 were pomegranate centex or knives 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.560
 throw I do not remember anymore because 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.180
 that in fact I do not have the gameplay under 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.080
 eyes so I could not help you 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.380
 specify further on there and in 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.970
 equipment grenade I had grenades 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.450
 for example strong in equipment you 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.320
 understand then I will send this 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.940
 video to different channels 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.710
 community and I thank her well 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.660
 obviously if she ever claude me 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.130
 as you could see in the title 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.710
 today I gave you my little ones 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.050
 tips and my advice to choose 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.950
 a microphone when we start on youtube or 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.709
 so when we would simply want 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.229
 change of microphone 1 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.849
 so often when someone launches 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.090
 on youtube he's going to buy a headset 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.509
 micro style tritons or so turtle 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.090
 beach 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.220
 good it's not really the best 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.860
 quality but it's true that's why 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.630
 it gives me forgiveness anyway 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.700
 good quality is that that there but 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.790
 in my opinion, it's still helmets 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.680
 who are made to play video games 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.010
 and it's not done to comment on a 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.480
 video but I do not want to offend you 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.680
 saying that because I know there is 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.020
 many people who comment 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.849
 their videos with headphones and I do not 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.069
 am not against that it's still a 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.849
 pretty good quality but you have to know 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.880
 that usb condenser microphones have a 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.200
 better audio quality and it's true 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.510
 that now on youtube 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.330
 you have to try to have a maximum of 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.420
 quality to try to succeed and to 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.879
 to make known in maximum and I would say 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.770
 and to be loved by the community because 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.840
 that if you do not have a good microphone 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.810
 it is true that it is not very pleasant 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.980
 to hear in the video good I think 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.080
 Everyone 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.170
 who would get started on youtube is going 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.670
 buy a pure gameplay hd it's obligatory 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.650
 otherwise it will never work and it will 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.900
 simply also train to 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.040
 to do his acting acting and I find myself 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.250
 that it's still something 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.870
 very very hard either that we have a gift and 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.940
 we immediately have really 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.280
 very comfortable to comment on a video 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.470
 but I've been going for two years 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.379
 the videos and I still have a little trouble 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.200
 anyway sometimes to find the words a 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:28.200
 commented it's true it's not easy 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.120
 and it takes time before you can 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.430
 well commented me frankly I 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.840
 still struggling after two years but that's 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.340
 true that there are some who are more talented 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.879
 than others who arrive more 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.920
 easily 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.410
 well it was a little parenthesis that 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.549
 had nothing to do with the subject but 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.069
 good, I still wanted you 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.650
 talk about that then the micro to 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.650
 usb capacitor are microphones that 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.049
 posed an internal membrane there can be 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.200
 have two or three sometimes have a 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.560
 as I already said then these micro 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.260
 lasson 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:05.470
 are at 50 or 70 euros basic price but 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.280
 it can go up very easily up to 3 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.739
 400 euros 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.560
 very very easily it can frankly 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.720
 radio microphones maybe it's 3000 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.849
 but we are not here to 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.470
 ruin and we would like to try you 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.440
 advise as best as possible 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.000
 so with all these mic here at 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.970
 capacitor end in description 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.639
 you'll put a lot of micro to 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.050
 usb capacitor like that that you 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.669
 will do a little bit of sorting 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.960
 but you do not have to go that 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.760
 on my links you can do your 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.880
 little research on the internet 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.910
 so frankly if you have the budget 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.040
 I advise you to buy the blue yeti 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.750
 because he really has a relationship 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.630
 huge price quality 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.210
 he only listens to our standards 3 euros or 93 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.090
 euros for those who prepared because 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.090
 yes, I'm Belgian, it only costs you 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.850
 93 euros on amazon and it's really a 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.880
 unbeatable price because 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.360
 it's really very low as price 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.600
 and it offers a quality really 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.400
 huge 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.810
 and frankly I advise you to 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.539
 cowardice good I'm not here to do the 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.400
 blue yeti pub but it's really 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.070
 something that I advise you 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.070
 so what is often advised with 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.100
 a microphone is to buy an anti pop 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:25.000
 so a pop stefan tool I put you 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.650
 in the video an image and that it must 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.590
 cost between 20 and 30 euros 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.870
 and it's going to take away the basics frequent 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.139
 the low frequencies forgiveness that you 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.320
 produce when you speak it's in 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.840
 big is when you kids I 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.000
 can not explain well but 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.030
 it's going a little bit better quality 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.470
 of your voice and I advise you 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.270
 frankly to buy it you me I 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.680
 have not bought but it's true it's 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.450
 still very much advised of the 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.770
 community who have microphones and that's it 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.110
 so here I hope I would have you 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.479
 not bad advice so this is the case I 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.360
 invite you to leave a little secular and 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:07.479
 if you find that helmets or 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.159
 then the condenser mics are everything 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.260
 as well to make videos put 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.760
 the month in the comments but you are 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.210
 far in the strings I do not know if that 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.099
 thinks I do not think tell me what 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.669
 you prefer as a microphone and if I you 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:23.620
 have helped or not here now I have a 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:26.080
 little bit about you about the gameplay is a 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.390
 modern warfare gameplay good I have it 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.340
 already said I'm repeating myself 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.280
 I drool a little good knight because 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.800
 I went to bed at 7 am 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.639
 got up at 11 o'clock in the morning 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.770
 so I only slept four hours 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.909
 well here we do not care a bit but he 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.069
 I had to tell you because 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:46.509
 that's good this video is coming to an end 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.800
 I hope you have enjoyed it in everything 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:49.840
 case me it really made me very 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.939
 pleasure to comment on this video
