00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:12.769
 components of utilities started in 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:15.730
 flow direction with a round of the ball 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.500
 Plombe is a distance piece 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.460
 because the counter 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.960
 turn a spacer around the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:30.400
 to fit the actual goal 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.539
 followed by a shut-off valve 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.739
 emptying with reflux prevention 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.739
 and the exam 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:48.399
 I want to keep showing cold water meter 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:54.440
 Water meters are wet runners that is 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:57.679
 the counter and the dial stand 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.479
 under water what on what will I become 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:05.540
 pay attention when I read the water meter 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:09.380
 I will pay attention that the seal 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:13.490
 Okay then I'll get that 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:17.270
 a state listing after that 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.500
 counter number and then I will 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.500
 Read water meter clockwise 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.250
 the biggest unit up here is the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.969
 cubic meters and the smallest unit here 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.619
 below 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:36.079
 that's the songs number i'll give it to me 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:39.009
 so I want to write it down on the second one 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:42.500
 water meter show up here the 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.530
 Black numbers are the cubic meters 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.880
 then a comma is replaced and afterwards 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.530
 the red numbers 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:55.759
 It is the liter of water 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.670
 house connection in the sense I drawn 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.670
 I would like to tour them individually 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.950
 I will win 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.700
 from the direction of main mounted 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.420
 shut-off valve without explanation thereon 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.050
 follows the water meter with ten hangers 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.470
 and his pieces for the right one 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.810
 to be able to motivate 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.230
 then follows a shut-off valve 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.239
 Backflow of inler the work emptying 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.239
 and but examining leadership 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.730
 This is followed by the water filter 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.400
 water filter of the gv in the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.250
 is a house installation participation 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.390
 the house installation is a plastic 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.970
 the water filter is recommended 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.549
 then the drug also follows 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.540
 pressure medium around animals when the 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.970
 work-up pressure over 5 bar is 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:01.160
 and then again follows 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.980
 shut-off valve with adhesive I have here 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.650
 once draw a line of separation 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.970
 I want to show that this 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:14.570
 Parts of property from water supply 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.650
 I want to go to the water meter too 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.769
 can talk 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.190
 A cold water CD is taken every six years 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.980
 enough 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:28.150
 a noticeable filter in 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.750
 flow direction of a plastic pipe 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:36.380
 after filtering a meta line of the 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.660
 Manufacturer says every two months should 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.350
 the filter will be rinsed 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.380
 You open this ball valve twice 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.630
 about ten seconds 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.780
 then the water is opposed to the 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.780
 Flow direction sent through the filter 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.410
 and the fine particles will be out 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.410
 felt
