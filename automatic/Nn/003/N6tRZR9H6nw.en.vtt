00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 with youtube people as you are waiting 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.950
 that are very good, well, as 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.720
 you know today is the first game of mexico 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.400
 in the world cup so what better 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.080
 to learn this typical song 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.940
 Mexican that I always go there in 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.440
 stadiums so because already know 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.299
 go for their guitars and we're going to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.670
 start okay friends then let's start 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.320
 with this very good song is very 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.640
 simple since we are only three 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.980
 chords that would be greater sun 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.160
 of 7 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.289
 and do major 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.869
 and the right hand let's go would be the typical 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.270
 mexican strum the famous chunta is 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.920
 which is very simple only with the 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.140
 thumb let's touch in this case the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.320
 under the chord that that what is the 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.670
 fret 3 of the sixth and then with these 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.510
 three fingers we are going to make two features 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.580
 down 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:51.730
 ok as if we were coming to us the 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:54.200
 water ok then we make a trip or two 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.290
 ratios down 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.540
 Contact 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.520
 and here we are going to alternate the bass in 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.590
 all the chords in the case of sun 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.870
 we will alternate it in the fourth 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.700
 We are going to do 1 and 1 rope 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.789
 It would be this way I do not play very slow 1 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.789
 Y 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.310
 ta ta ta 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.870
 nothing 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.870
 then then we change to 17 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.290
 the same concept only the vacceos 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.840
 we are going to alternate between the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.840
 fourth string and the fifth string 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.799
 they would be our verse I play it for 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.799
 that check-ins in this way 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.280
 slow 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.280
 and you 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.130
 and we go to the day famous chorus which is what 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.130
 same greater sun 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.830
 and here we are going to use the C major and 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.420
 look here very well the lows in do 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.430
 we will alternate between the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.670
 fifth rope and the sixth rope in sun 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.260
 on the fret sixth string 3 no 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.260
 we only raise this finger 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.749
 already 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.610
 ok is the only different thing we do 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.990
 I'm going to play between the verse and the choir 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.990
 once again so that the checks 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.409

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.340

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.850

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.400
 pattern of rapids only to joke and 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.590

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.960
