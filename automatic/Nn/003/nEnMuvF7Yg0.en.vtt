00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
you could do is a variation is rather

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.480 
you could do is a variation is rather
than<00:01:31.190> hammering<00:01:31.730> hammering<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.660> pulling<00:01:32.690> off

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
than hammering hammering and pulling off

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.740 
than hammering hammering and pulling off
you<00:01:34.490> could<00:01:34.640> actually<00:01:34.790> just<00:01:35.090> take<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.390> note

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
you could actually just take the note

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.140 
you could actually just take the note
and<00:01:36.020> bend<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.500> up<00:01:36.680> from<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.430> fifth<00:01:37.640> fret<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:37.970> g

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:47.029 
and bend it up from the fifth fret of g
string<00:01:38.480> so

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.230 

up-to-speed<00:01:48.039> that<00:01:48.609> would<00:01:48.729> sound<00:01:48.850> something

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
up-to-speed that would sound something

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.440 
up-to-speed that would sound something
like<00:01:49.270> this

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.210
