00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello people welcome to further 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:11.940
 Recording of gta4 so last time 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.799
 I had the nissan 370z nismo it 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.309
 the without I hope for that right 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.960
 told 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.880
 and yes it was actually relatively good 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 until the moment where you are each 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.390
 yes, they are aware of it 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.810
 has decided the canadian 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.939
 throw out and be ready 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.270
 you should never really be a part of it 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.460
 They like to have grenades 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.219
 throw and yes they finally land 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.899
 everywhere and of course that is in 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.640
 I've learned excellent 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.140
 thought these are three pieces in the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.789
 lend a vehicle with grenades 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.520
 armed so I'm already 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.110
 times exciting as that will go out but 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:56.670
 This time I have a mercedes benz 6 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:59.039
 s 5 and s 65 amg 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.770
 my goodness and now I just wanted 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.750
 the route only backwards 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.309
 it will not be so good though 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.369
 I will not go to the waypoint here 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.840
 drive away point is somehow easy 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.780
 for you can see here 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.780
 well, 33 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.790
 I have the total for a very short time 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:31.170
 Spotty out of control, it runs 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:35.710
 not funny so 3210 so i now 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.619
 Of course that is there 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.060
 patrol where they once say and 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:47.440
 though this march into benz s 63 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:51.340
 he has such a blatant acceleration 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.130
 sometimes and god that one so 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:02.069
 problem with the tail get to it 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:04.539
 luckily the white ford started 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.289
 no no go 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.289
 what the devil 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.850
 first of course run it or me 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.190
 blow yourself up 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.660
 you are real professionals we would have 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.110
 maybe wait a moment 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.110
 the police inside 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.260
 i hate invisible walls and i was 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:33.719
 meant was not so people 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.819
 Welcome back 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.370
 although I have four oscars pont but only 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.560
 one wanted to get in 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.049
 500 euro anyway I think it's honest 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.780
 sometimes it's pretty interesting 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.459
 at the met or just like me 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.700
 have placed me I have none 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.230
 I suspect but I did not think any kinds 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.120
 are also little weird little were 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.639
 if you try this come 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.230
 and you can not get away and still 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.939
 Grenades or throw because of that 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.290
 I thought so, of course, too 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.209
 violent discussion with myself 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.919
 made only two hours 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.560
 needed and I have decided 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:12.599
 Hayward often also bombs the power too 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:19.060
 but how could i get the vehicle right away 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:20.849
 So 3210 maybe today 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.550
 enter 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:27.940
 62 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.130
 until you really like that 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.590
 not so funny because you shot 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:39.040
 again belongs to me please stay 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:42.390
 anyway to the conflict and only understand 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.390
 that vehicles niessl 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.560
 nevertheless what represented 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:04:09.150
 it is not good for the vehicle 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:09.150
 friendship plus the tank size really 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.150
 not bad from many thanks you have 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.440
 thanks 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.280
 I do not find interesting with you 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.060
 bad at you anybody 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:26.470
 coincidentally a mercedes benz altogether 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.100
 coincidentally, ness 65 no for that 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.100
 can also think 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.210
 I do not really have it with me 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.210
 calculated that the vehicle is burning or 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.340
 but that happen brake brakes the 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.810
 brake back drive 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.070
 after having safely dismantled 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:55.260
 from the trunk 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:57.240
 no you stay here it is quite 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.160
 very important and good on you 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.930
 Wish and that's because I'm doing it that way 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.960
 not land properly 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.690
 nanu I have again you want me 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:13.500
 fooled by it is also one 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:15.060
 well, yes, I could just have happened 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.830
 Now I have to get up again 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.320
 that was art and brain it is because 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.350
 I'll do it in the beginning 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.200
 no my conclusion no prognosis dare 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:29.190
 that my light this vehicle has it 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.400
 real with mc pg out due to it moves 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:35.100
 the whole time too strong with already 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:41.690
 mercedes here I am not that 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.690
 I do not get used to it, but I do not understand 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:48.030
 not with every case because I have that 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.070
 For example, at muscle cars, I found it 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.980
 already and then I always try 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.820
 stuck with it to take in addition to the well 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.010
 fit 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.200
 even if sometimes I find it funny 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.090
 driving muscle car of the world 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:05.250
 I have to admit I do not always have 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:08.100
 the best but my mercedes 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.350
 also added one that he did 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.360
 even so comes with merck this is a very 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:17.130
 weird again, it's crazy 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.840
 police yes what I wear or one 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:26.580
 look up and come on the case like 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:30.380
 katrin press board 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.380
 but daily direction 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:42.870
 no prince no no no people first 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.850
 thanks also police types of the 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.310
 deducted respect for that I have 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.550
 not hoped 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.470
 of course still at Pentecost canepa 43 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.360
 then you mocked everyone as a medal 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.530
 Of course , the most efficient 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.280
 understandable times rather of hers 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.500
 initiate 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.550
 that as my further shot of 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.120
 GTA 4 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.350
 I hope I've liked you find 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.970
 really sorry that this case you 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:11.190
 we can not have started, yes 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.190
 unfallen happen always later
