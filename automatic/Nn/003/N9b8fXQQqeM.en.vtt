hello this is another do-it-yourself
video<00:00:02.639> we<00:00:03.389> had<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:05.810> 1999<00:00:06.810> Saturn<00:00:07.440> SC<00:00:08.370> -<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.700> think

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
video we had a 1999 Saturn SC - I think

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.660 
video we had a 1999 Saturn SC - I think
it<00:00:09.240> was<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:10.620> forgot<00:00:10.920> what<00:00:11.070> size<00:00:11.250> engine<00:00:11.460> it

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
it was and I forgot what size engine it

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.320 
it was and I forgot what size engine it
was<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:12.030> was<00:00:12.179> not<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.559> hop<00:00:13.830> top<00:00:14.099> like<00:00:14.400> dual

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
was it was not the the hop top like dual

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.540 
was it was not the the hop top like dual
overhead<00:00:15.509> cam<00:00:15.929> when<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.230> don't<00:00:16.470> think<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
overhead cam when I don't think just a

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.849 
overhead cam when I don't think just a
plain<00:00:17.760> Jane<00:00:18.000> one<00:00:18.180> anyway<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:19.020> had<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.410> has<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
plain Jane one anyway it had a it has a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.970 
plain Jane one anyway it had a it has a
single<00:00:20.220> coolant<00:00:20.850> temperature<00:00:21.240> sensor<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.980> my

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
single coolant temperature sensor and my

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.320 
single coolant temperature sensor and my
sister's<00:00:23.310> car<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.670> she<00:00:23.820> said<00:00:24.000> look<00:00:24.150> this

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
sister's car and she said look this

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.019 
sister's car and she said look this
thing<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.600> got<00:00:25.289> no<00:00:25.320> power<00:00:25.680> installed<00:00:26.460> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
thing is got no power installed and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.960 
thing is got no power installed and
idles<00:00:27.750> really<00:00:28.320> bad<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.859> when<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.400> idling<00:00:29.789> it

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
idles really bad and when it's idling it

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.510 
idles really bad and when it's idling it
it's<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.560> coal<00:00:31.800> burning<00:00:32.099> machine

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
it's like it's a coal burning machine

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.010 
it's like it's a coal burning machine
there's<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:32.820> much<00:00:32.940> sweat<00:00:33.360> comes<00:00:33.750> out<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
there's so much sweat comes out of the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.920 
there's so much sweat comes out of the
tailpipe<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.239> jumped<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.450> she<00:00:36.600> says<00:00:36.780> geez

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
tailpipe so I jumped in it she says geez

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.090 
tailpipe so I jumped in it she says geez
it's<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.110> piece<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.440> junk<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.710> think<00:00:37.890> I'm<00:00:37.950> gonna

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
it's a piece of junk I think I'm gonna

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.549 
it's a piece of junk I think I'm gonna
just<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.879> away<00:00:39.030> from<00:00:39.239> parts<00:00:39.540> or<00:00:39.629> whatever<00:00:39.840> so

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
just get away from parts or whatever so

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.740 
just get away from parts or whatever so
I<00:00:41.129> said<00:00:42.059> well<00:00:42.149> let<00:00:42.239> me<00:00:42.270> look<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.719> I

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
I said well let me look at it so I

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.959 
I said well let me look at it so I
hopped<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.050> had<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> lock<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.430> she<00:00:44.850> had<00:00:44.940> just

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
hopped in had a lock and she had just

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.180 
hopped in had a lock and she had just
driven<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.719> long<00:00:46.140> distance<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> highway

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
driven a long distance on the highway

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.130 
driven a long distance on the highway
like<00:00:47.370> two<00:00:48.149> hours<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> highway<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.050> I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
like two hours on the highway and I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.930 
like two hours on the highway and I
looked<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> temperature<00:00:50.219> gauge<00:00:50.610> just

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
looked at the temperature gauge just

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.610 
looked at the temperature gauge just
happened<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> notice<00:00:51.390> temperature<00:00:52.260> gauge<00:00:52.410> was

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
happened to notice temperature gauge was

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.000 
happened to notice temperature gauge was
showing<00:00:52.890> cold<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:54.390> said<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.620> maybe

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
showing cold and I said you know maybe

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
showing cold and I said you know maybe
you<00:00:56.100> got<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> thermostat<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.059> stuck<00:00:57.420> open<00:00:57.780> but

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you got a thermostat that stuck open but

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.849 
you got a thermostat that stuck open but
I<00:00:57.930> would<00:00:58.050> think<00:00:58.109> even<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> stuck<00:00:58.710> open

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
I would think even a stuck open

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.119 
I would think even a stuck open
thermostat<00:01:00.289> wouldn't<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> temp<00:01:01.949> gauge

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
thermostat wouldn't have a temp gauge

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.009 
thermostat wouldn't have a temp gauge
being<00:01:02.520> cold<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.270> actually<00:01:03.719> she'd<00:01:03.870> been

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
being cold it was actually she'd been

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.960 
being cold it was actually she'd been
idling<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.439> my<00:01:04.530> driveway<00:01:04.799> for<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> while<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.610> so

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
idling in my driveway for a while so so

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.730 
idling in my driveway for a while so so
service<00:01:06.390> said<00:01:06.570> probably<00:01:07.020> anyway<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.119> got

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
service said probably anyway so I got

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.399 
service said probably anyway so I got
investigating<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.689> what<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.720> did<00:01:13.080> was<00:01:13.260> I

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
investigating that and what I did was I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.370 
investigating that and what I did was I
found<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.360> model<00:01:15.750> only<00:01:15.930> had<00:01:16.170> one

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
found this that this model only had one

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.300 
found this that this model only had one
coolant<00:01:16.740> temp<00:01:16.890> sensor

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
coolant temp sensor

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.980 
coolant temp sensor
I<00:01:17.460> think<00:01:17.820> these<00:01:17.909> cars<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.420> come<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.810> two

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
I think these cars can come with two

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.570 
I think these cars can come with two
different<00:01:19.619> models<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.280> only<00:01:20.400> had

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
different models but this one only had

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.140 
different models but this one only had
two<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:23.400> did<00:01:24.270> some<00:01:24.420> reading<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
two one and I did some reading on it and

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.760 
two one and I did some reading on it and
before<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> took<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:27.780> there<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.619> two

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
before I took it out there are two

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.310 
before I took it out there are two
little<00:01:29.040> T<00:01:29.250> tiny<00:01:29.960> contacts<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:31.140> two

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
little T tiny contacts in there two

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.870 
little T tiny contacts in there two
little<00:01:31.530> connected<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.520> connector

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
little connected well it's one connector

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.190 
little connected well it's one connector
but<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.270> what<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.110> do<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.570> wire

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
but that what you have to do is the wire

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.749 
but that what you have to do is the wire
harness<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.680> get<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> connector<00:01:38.220> off<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.610> this

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
harness to get the connector off of this

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.819 
harness to get the connector off of this
you<00:01:39.360> need<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.630> squeeze<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.350> sides<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.740> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
you need to squeeze the sides of it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.499 
you need to squeeze the sides of it
together<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.820> wiggle<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.299> pull<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
together and then wiggle it and pull it

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.010 
together and then wiggle it and pull it
back

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
back

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.420 
back
not<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> sensor<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> part<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.250> goes

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
not the sensor but the part that goes

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.889 
not the sensor but the part that goes
over<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> sensor<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> wire<00:01:45.390> harness<00:01:45.720> part

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
over the sensor the wire harness part

forth both elbows up so once I get it
off<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.979> could<00:01:50.909> see<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> pins<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.659> they<00:01:51.750> were<00:01:51.840> a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
off I could see the pins and they were a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.830 
off I could see the pins and they were a
little<00:01:52.110> bit<00:01:52.350> corroded<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:54.090> put<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:56.689> got<00:01:57.689> an

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
little bit corroded and I put a I got an

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.810 
little bit corroded and I put a I got an
ohmmeter<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.350> there<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:59.040> directly<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.549> had<00:01:59.729> to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
ohmmeter on there not directly I had to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.130 
ohmmeter on there not directly I had to
use<00:01:59.909> some<00:02:00.119> little<00:02:00.299> jumper<00:02:00.570> wires<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.960> would

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
use some little jumper wires that would

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.709 
use some little jumper wires that would
you<00:02:01.799> know<00:02:01.890> could<00:02:02.310> slide<00:02:02.549> over<00:02:02.759> those<00:02:02.880> pins<00:02:03.180> but

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
you know could slide over those pins but

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.420 
you know could slide over those pins but
anyway<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.930> measured<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> resistance<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
anyway I measured the resistance and it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.709 
anyway I measured the resistance and it
was<00:02:05.549> way<00:02:05.700> out<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> Tolerance<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.329> forget<00:02:06.600> what

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
was way out of Tolerance I forget what

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.230 
was way out of Tolerance I forget what
it<00:02:06.780> was<00:02:06.810> now<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.409> written<00:02:07.619> on

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
it was now but it's written on

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.510 
it was now but it's written on

anyway<00:02:12.380> it<00:02:12.500> was<00:02:12.590> out<00:02:12.710> of<00:02:12.800> tolerance<00:02:13.190> for<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.550> car

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
anyway it was out of tolerance for a car

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.150 
anyway it was out of tolerance for a car
that<00:02:14.000> should<00:02:14.180> be<00:02:14.300> hot<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:15.320> then<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.770> took<00:02:15.920> some

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
that should be hot so then I took some

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.750 
that should be hot so then I took some
resistors<00:02:17.860> if<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:19.010> still<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.310> them<00:02:19.430> here

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
resistors if I still have them here

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.930 
resistors if I still have them here
I<00:02:19.790> do<00:02:20.350> just<00:02:21.350> some<00:02:21.530> basic<00:02:21.860> resistors<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.370> had<00:02:22.520> an

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
assortment of these little resistors you

electronics parts store and what I did
was<00:02:29.600> before<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:32.090> really<00:02:32.330> got<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.570> kind<00:02:33.050> of

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
was before I you really got to kind of

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.780 
was before I you really got to kind of
know<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.500> little<00:02:33.560> bit<00:02:33.770> about<00:02:33.830> resistance

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
know a little bit about resistance

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.480 
know a little bit about resistance
values<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.240> those<00:02:35.300> resistors<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:35.960> anyway<00:02:36.200> I

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
values of those resistors but anyway I

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.690 
values of those resistors but anyway I
in<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.640> manual<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.090> said<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:40.280> sensor<00:02:40.670> should

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
in the manual it said the sensor should

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.180 
in the manual it said the sensor should
be<00:02:41.150> let's<00:02:41.930> make<00:02:42.110> up<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.350> number<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.710> thousand

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
be let's make up a number a thousand

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.670 
be let's make up a number a thousand
ohms<00:02:43.340> at<00:02:43.700> 50<00:02:44.600> degrees<00:02:44.870> Celsius<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.500> thought

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
ohms at 50 degrees Celsius I thought

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.140 
ohms at 50 degrees Celsius I thought
okay<00:02:45.890> well<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.160> cars<00:02:46.340> probably<00:02:46.550> at<00:02:46.880> 50

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
okay well the cars probably at 50

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150 
okay well the cars probably at 50
degrees<00:02:47.390> Celsius<00:02:47.600> so<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.320> took<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.620> thousand<00:02:49.010> ohm

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
degrees Celsius so I took a thousand ohm

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.480 
degrees Celsius so I took a thousand ohm
resistor<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.530> shorted<00:02:51.530> out<00:02:51.620> not<00:02:51.920> shorted<00:02:52.310> but

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
resistor and shorted out not shorted but

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.550 
resistor and shorted out not shorted but
I<00:02:52.520> connected<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.660> two<00:02:53.870> contacts<00:02:54.470> in

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
I connected it to the two contacts in

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.250 
I connected it to the two contacts in
the<00:02:54.650> wiring<00:02:54.860> harness<00:02:55.840> basically<00:02:56.840> taking<00:02:57.140> the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
the wiring harness basically taking the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.520 
the wiring harness basically taking the
real<00:02:57.500> sense<00:02:57.800> of<00:02:57.950> right<00:02:58.130> out<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.490> mix<00:02:58.730> and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
real sense of right out of the mix and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.590 
real sense of right out of the mix and
then<00:03:00.530> started<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.040> car<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:02.240> temp<00:03:02.450> gauge

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
then started the car and the temp gauge

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.540 
then started the car and the temp gauge
book<00:03:02.840> went<00:03:03.080> right<00:03:03.230> up<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.380> halfway<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.340> knew

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
book went right up to halfway so I knew

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.520 
book went right up to halfway so I knew
it<00:03:04.640> wasn't<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.910> problem<00:03:05.120> with<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.420> gauge<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.020> I

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
it wasn't a problem with the gauge and I

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.130 
it wasn't a problem with the gauge and I
knew<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.770> sensor<00:03:07.100> was<00:03:07.220> also<00:03:07.580> bad<00:03:07.960> but<00:03:08.960> when<00:03:09.110> I

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
knew the sensor was also bad but when I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.280 
knew the sensor was also bad but when I
took<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.350> sensor<00:03:09.800> out<00:03:10.930> if<00:03:11.930> you're<00:03:12.050> going<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.230> be

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
took a sensor out if you're going to be

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.920 
took a sensor out if you're going to be
able<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.440> see<00:03:12.590> this<00:03:14.110> right<00:03:15.110> there<00:03:16.720> right<00:03:17.720> there

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
able to see this right there right there

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.420 
able to see this right there right there
and<00:03:18.020> that<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.290> part<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.590> this<00:03:18.710> descent<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.370> the

baldy part that you're looking at it of

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.330 
baldy part that you're looking at it of
course<00:03:21.110> I'm<00:03:21.290> sure<00:03:21.320> my<00:03:21.650> camera<00:03:21.920> sucks<00:03:22.130> but

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
course I'm sure my camera sucks but

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.790 
course I'm sure my camera sucks but
anyway<00:03:22.580> I<00:03:22.790> can<00:03:23.300> see<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.480> complete<00:03:23.840> crack<00:03:24.350> right

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
anyway I can see a complete crack right

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.290 
anyway I can see a complete crack right

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
one of the things that is a giveaway

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.770 
one of the things that is a giveaway
that<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.470> sensors<00:03:33.770> got<00:03:33.920> a<00:03:33.950> crack<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.580> is

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
that the sensors got a crack in it is

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.240 
that the sensors got a crack in it is
when<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.840> take<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.200> wire<00:03:36.380> harness<00:03:36.770> off<00:03:36.950> and

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
when you take the wire harness off and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.100 
when you take the wire harness off and
you<00:03:37.610> look<00:03:37.820> in<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.180> end<00:03:38.360> where<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.600> contacts

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
you look in the end where the contacts

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.620 
you look in the end where the contacts
are<00:03:39.230> if<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:39.830> see<00:03:40.070> coolant<00:03:40.550> there<00:03:40.790> that's<00:03:41.420> not

are if you see coolant there that's not

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.050 
are if you see coolant there that's not
supposed<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:42.020> be<00:03:42.200> there<00:03:42.410> and<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:43.580> coolant<00:03:43.970> has
