 creepy pasta using tyson gameplay on 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.890
 tone universe string and good 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.260
 I could not make the laptop that is used 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.269
 normally in pc mode but good 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.070
 take into account that it is a beta version 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.280
 it's just in beta the mod 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.930
 so maybe later they'll put it on and not 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.240
 Are so many 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.970
 guts is good paper common paper let's go 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.000
 to put it in the oven 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.000
 Y 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.720
 once we put it on it , it will come out 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.720
 what would it be 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.190
 this which would be a creepy pasta without 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.680
 write with nothing like that and nothing nothing the 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.320
 clip and pasta and normal as good and at 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.280
 natural you could say to see that we do not 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.530
 of other 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.530
 good maybe and good 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.710
 and good that once it has given us 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.400
 the script until the clip is enough I'll 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.560
 say the creepy pasta sheet with ink with 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.000
 ink and creepy paper to be going to 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.070
 kraft table and we can crafter us 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.210
 follow the criticism are you for example 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.720
 that can capture what you want 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.990
 dry 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.989
 likewise it is not jacques heim the 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.180
 killers jeff killer islander man are the 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.180
 pipes that are up to now in this mod 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.270
 okay 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.780
 we want to match because it is something 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.780
 Of damage 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.750
 this is to say a lot because they do not 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.360
 so much but if they do something something not 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.790
 so that's fine so it's fine 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.790
 to see there it's good 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.260
 just ride having the difficulty 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.330
 to the maximum and with the paper we are going to touch 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.750
 the floor and we would come out as you see here 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.750
 slender man 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.739
 which is very difficult to kill certainly 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.260
 and low enough has I think it's 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:55.569
 improper and is very difficult what is 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.569
 we see with the following that it would be the yak 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.280
 which is also very difficult that is 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.720
 harder everyone I do not know why like that 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.670
 have kicks and punches at the same 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.030
 This time is very difficult 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.060
 he has 70 of life 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.990
 very well already dead has died both 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.600
 would follow james killer which has very 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.760
 little life is not dangerous it is certainly 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.980
 as the ornament floor 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.760
 we will continue with the get the killers 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.910
 which has 50 life and if it went down 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.700
 something was going halo 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.440
 of klerk smh of successes are all 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.390
 creepy pasta that you can kill them 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.950
 and you can acquire them in your 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.140
 survival to put them in a series and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.820
 It is based on the play mode and Tony 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.860
 well this is all in itself I hope that you 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.740
 If you liked it, it would prevent the X and not 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.070
 you have to subscribe and one until the 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.070
 next
