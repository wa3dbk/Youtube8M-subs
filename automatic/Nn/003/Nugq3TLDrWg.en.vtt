extrude<00:03:14.330> command<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:17.650> have<00:03:18.650> created<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:19.510> simple

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
extrude command I have created a simple

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.340 
extrude command I have created a simple
rectangular<00:03:21.110> sketch<00:03:21.410> on<00:03:21.620> a<00:03:22.840> angular<00:03:23.840> datum

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
rectangular sketch on a angular datum

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.600 
rectangular sketch on a angular datum
plane<00:03:24.940> now<00:03:26.440> going<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.650> extrude<00:03:28.989> and<00:03:30.610> select

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
plane now going to extrude and select

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:39.460 
plane now going to extrude and select
cut<00:03:34.330> now<00:03:35.330> my<00:03:36.130> cut<00:03:37.130> portion<00:03:37.430> is<00:03:38.080> normal<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.260> the

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
cut now my cut portion is normal to the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.060 
cut now my cut portion is normal to the
surface<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:43.790> can<00:03:43.850> see<00:03:44.350> so<00:03:45.350> here<00:03:45.709> are<00:03:45.860> this

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
surface you can see so here are this

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.210 
surface you can see so here are this
option<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:47.019> have<00:03:48.019> currently<00:03:48.260> selected<00:03:48.560> remove

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
option I have currently selected remove

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.259 
option I have currently selected remove
material<00:03:49.640> normal<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.269> surface<00:03:50.630> so

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
material normal to the surface so

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.540 
material normal to the surface so
wherever<00:03:53.269> this<00:03:53.450> sketch<00:03:53.750> will<00:03:53.930> be<00:03:54.050> projected

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
wherever this sketch will be projected

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.479 
wherever this sketch will be projected
the<00:03:55.550> cut<00:03:55.820> will<00:03:56.030> be<00:03:56.060> normal<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.930> my<00:03:57.100> this<00:03:58.100> aline

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
the cut will be normal to my this aline

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.560 
the cut will be normal to my this aline
surface<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.239> not<00:04:00.019> according<00:04:00.320> to<00:04:00.620> this

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
surface and not according to this

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.949 
surface and not according to this
direction<00:04:02.570> of<00:04:02.660> sketch<00:04:02.930> so<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:03.680> can<00:04:03.950> change<00:04:04.310> it

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
direction of sketch so you can change it

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.040 
direction of sketch so you can change it
simply<00:04:05.959> over<00:04:06.890> here<00:04:07.070> and<00:04:07.250> now<00:04:07.660> you<00:04:08.660> can<00:04:08.870> see

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
simply over here and now you can see

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.979 
simply over here and now you can see
that<00:04:09.310> this<00:04:10.310> portion<00:04:10.790> is<00:04:10.910> kind<00:04:11.120> of<00:04:11.300> more

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
that this portion is kind of more

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.970 
that this portion is kind of more
tapered<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.620> it<00:04:13.550> will<00:04:13.780> go<00:04:14.780> in<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.170> direction

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
tapered and it will go in the direction

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.529 
tapered and it will go in the direction
of<00:04:16.370> this<00:04:16.549> plane<00:04:17.049> sketch<00:04:18.049> projected<00:04:18.729> so<00:04:19.729> this

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
of this plane sketch projected so this

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.110 
of this plane sketch projected so this
is<00:04:20.720> about<00:04:21.310> sheetmetal<00:04:22.310> cut<00:04:22.729> that<00:04:22.880> you<00:04:23.030> should

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
is about sheetmetal cut that you should

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.080 
is about sheetmetal cut that you should
no<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:25.740> can<00:04:25.949> have<00:04:25.980> got<00:04:26.460> normal<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:26.970> the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
no you can have got normal to the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.620 
no you can have got normal to the
surface<00:04:27.480> or<00:04:28.910> moving<00:04:29.910> along<00:04:30.150> with<00:04:30.300> the

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
surface or moving along with the

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.090 
surface or moving along with the
direction<00:04:31.139> of<00:04:31.199> sketch<00:04:34.460> sorry<00:04:36.800> then<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:37.919> will

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
direction of sketch sorry then you will

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.420 
direction of sketch sorry then you will
have<00:04:38.190> another<00:04:38.610> options<00:04:39.030> like<00:04:40.430> remove

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
have another options like remove

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.290 
have another options like remove
material<00:04:41.820> normal<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.330> offset<00:04:42.720> surface<00:04:43.139> and

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
material normal to offset surface and

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.610 
material normal to offset surface and
normal<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.419> driving<00:04:45.660> surface<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.320> whatever

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
normal to driving surface and whatever

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.250 
normal to driving surface and whatever
so<00:04:47.460> this<00:04:48.330> is<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:50.300> important<00:04:51.300> thing<00:04:51.930> when<00:04:52.110> you

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
so this is the important thing when you

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.840 
so this is the important thing when you
are<00:04:52.639> dealing<00:04:53.639> with<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:54.210> extrude<00:04:55.169> cut<00:04:55.350> option

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
are dealing with the extrude cut option

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.200 
are dealing with the extrude cut option
morning<00:04:56.850> Euler<00:04:57.180> rethink<00:04:57.750> it<00:04:57.840> or<00:04:58.100> planes<00:04:59.210> so

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
morning Euler rethink it or planes so

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.120 
morning Euler rethink it or planes so
keep<00:05:01.110> in<00:05:01.260> mind<00:05:02.300> so<00:05:03.300> this<00:05:03.479> is<00:05:03.600> about<00:05:04.130> creating

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
keep in mind so this is about creating

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.909 
keep in mind so this is about creating
sheetmetal<00:05:05.520> cuts<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:06.500> corner<00:05:07.500> relief<00:05:07.770> in

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
sheetmetal cuts and corner relief in

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.550 
sheetmetal cuts and corner relief in
sheet<00:05:08.220> metal<00:05:08.250> thank<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.330> for<00:05:09.510> watching<00:05:09.840> you

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
sheet metal thank you for watching you

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.159 
sheet metal thank you for watching you
have<00:05:10.650> any<00:05:10.860> doubt<00:05:11.040> please<00:05:11.639> comment<00:05:12.120> I<00:05:12.479> will
