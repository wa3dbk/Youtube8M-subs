00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.410 
you're going to have the actual file
that's<00:02:23.250> going<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.489> be<00:02:23.580> used<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:24.000> root<00:02:24.269> the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.550 
device and then you're going to have
this<00:02:25.890> odin<00:02:26.660> program<00:02:27.660> odin<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.230> how<00:02:28.380> we're

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
this odin program odin is how we're

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.870 
this odin program odin is how we're
going<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.709> flash<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:31.250> now<00:02:32.250> what<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.700> going

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
going to flash it now what this is going

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.870 
going to flash it now what this is going
to<00:02:33.120> do<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:34.100> we're<00:02:35.100> going<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.280> flash<00:02:35.580> this

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
to do is we're going to flash this

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.820 
to do is we're going to flash this
through<00:02:36.120> odin<00:02:36.540> it's<00:02:36.780> going<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.200> temporarily

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
through odin it's going to temporarily

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.699 
through odin it's going to temporarily
install<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.880> custom<00:02:39.180> recovery<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:40.170> your<00:02:40.350> device

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
install a custom recovery on your device

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.830 
install a custom recovery on your device
so<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.930> program<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.470> then<00:02:43.950> go<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:44.370> and

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
so that the program can then go in and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.710 
so that the program can then go in and
flash<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.110> root<00:02:46.350> file<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.950> root<00:02:47.160> your<00:02:47.190> device

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
flash the root file and root your device

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.539 
flash the root file and root your device
then<00:02:48.720> when<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.290> all<00:02:49.440> done<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.920> will<00:02:50.190> replace

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
then when it's all done it will replace

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.910 
then when it's all done it will replace
the<00:02:51.090> custom<00:02:51.660> recovery<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.410> put<00:02:52.590> on<00:02:52.709> there

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
the custom recovery that it put on there

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.530 
the custom recovery that it put on there
with<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.160> stock<00:02:53.549> recovery<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.239> you'll<00:02:54.390> be

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
with the stock recovery so you'll be

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.560

back<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.750> stock<00:02:55.320> recovery<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.790> after<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.269> we

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
back to stock recovery so after that we

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.780 
back to stock recovery so after that we
will<00:02:57.750> flash<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.530> permanent<00:02:59.100> custom<00:02:59.519> recovery

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
