00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
to the floor or on top of a tub like you

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.240 
to the floor or on top of a tub like you
see<00:01:07.110> here<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.250> again<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.610> slides<00:01:08.909> very<00:01:09.180> easily

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
see here and again it slides very easily

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.820 
see here and again it slides very easily
it<00:01:11.250> has<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> very<00:01:12.450> low-profile<00:01:13.229> top<00:01:13.560> header

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
it has a very low-profile top header

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.410 
it has a very low-profile top header
that's<00:01:14.250> only<00:01:14.460> an<00:01:14.610> inch<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.000> an<00:01:15.060> eighth<00:01:15.240> or

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
that's only an inch and an eighth or

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.499 
that's only an inch and an eighth or
about<00:01:16.049> twenty-eight<00:01:16.590> point<00:01:16.890> six<00:01:17.220> millimeters

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
about twenty-eight point six millimeters

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.850 
about twenty-eight point six millimeters
so<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.049> makes<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> glass<00:01:19.590> look

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
so you can see it makes the glass look

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.100 
so you can see it makes the glass look
like<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.159> almost<00:01:20.520> floating<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.030> air<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:22.020> you

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
like it's almost floating in air so you

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.230 
like it's almost floating in air so you
have<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> low-profile<00:01:23.040> solid<00:01:23.610> stainless<00:01:23.880> steel

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
have a low-profile solid stainless steel

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.870 
have a low-profile solid stainless steel

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
below the header bar our new ball

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.149 
below the header bar our new ball
bearing<00:01:30.900> rolling<00:01:31.290> system<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.860> makes<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
bearing rolling system that makes it

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.310 
bearing rolling system that makes it
roll<00:01:32.369> very<00:01:32.610> smoothly

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320
