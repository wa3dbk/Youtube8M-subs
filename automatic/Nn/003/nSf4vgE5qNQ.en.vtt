00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
access through the deck this would be

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.520 
access through the deck this would be
like<00:03:57.160> on<00:03:57.580> lower<00:03:57.940> vibra<00:03:58.420> territory<00:03:59.080> levels

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
like on lower vibra territory levels

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.490 
like on lower vibra territory levels
when<00:03:59.920> I<00:03:59.950> mean<00:04:00.280> lo<00:04:00.519> I<00:04:00.549> don't<00:04:01.030> mean<00:04:01.299> bad<00:04:01.780> I<00:04:02.140> just

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
when I mean lo I don't mean bad I just

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.170 
when I mean lo I don't mean bad I just
mean<00:04:02.680> that<00:04:02.709> there<00:04:03.010> are<00:04:03.160> some<00:04:03.459> levels<00:04:03.970> that<00:04:04.120> are

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
mean that there are some levels that are

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.949 
mean that there are some levels that are
greater<00:04:04.630> like<00:04:05.459> exponentiate<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:07.480> the

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
greater like exponentiate and so the

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.110 
greater like exponentiate and so the
being<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.500> comes<00:04:08.920> through<00:04:09.280> this<00:04:09.640> or<00:04:10.000> the
