00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello everyone I'm nothing '01 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.620
 I do this video with the intention of 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.350
 give guitar specifications to them 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.290
 paul palmer 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:20.410
 or the copy in my opinion very good in 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:23.200
 price-quality ratio 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.000
 on the internet there is no video in the 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.280
 which specifications are given of this 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.220
 guitar so 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.270
 is the reason why I do this for 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.170
 start is a guitar 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.690
 american 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.990
 and the materials with which it is made 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.240
 well 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.580
 to start one of the cons could 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.410
 be that your body is made of 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.550
 plywood 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.690
 a body of the guitar 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.360
 plywood 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:57.600
 then it is something that 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.460
 I would give negative points to this model 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 but as we will see throughout the video 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.670
 would be one of the few because once 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.070
 to the other details on a guitar that 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.380
 outperforms other copies of other brands 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.840
 and for quite 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.770
 beginning with 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.100
 upper part 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.790
 we can see here the logo of the brand 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.740
 palmer their pegs 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.300
 Well, what can you say are generic 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.010
 bad especially 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.010
 here back the serial number 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.710
 as we go down then the 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.680
 mast 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.360
 the fretboard 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.530
 that is, the wood that is here in the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:48.150
 frets the rosewood 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.300
 and the mast is made of mahogany 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.100
 the mast is not detachable it is stuck 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.590
 to the body unlike other brands 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.320
 which is removable 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.320
 okay the guitar cap 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.370
 maple blending as you can see here 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.950
 can occur 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:16.300
 It has a very good design 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:19.220
 good perfectionist finished to do 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.760
 to make a copy 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.840
 and in relation to its price because it is worth 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.250
 worth the four classic potentiometers 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.110
 of the pau 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.909
 well these two who see in this in this 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.920
 Instead, they are those of the pill 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:40.330
 account 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:45.280
 volume and tone and this volume and tone of 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:50.240
 the pill of the mast 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.990
 It has a three position switch 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.420
 as you can see here 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:01.800
 the top position is kristen 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.270
 It is what ignites the pill 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.400
 mast 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.970
 central position lights both 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.760
 pills and the inferior position then 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.410
 just the bridge pickup the bridge is 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.440
 a fixed bridge 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.440
 you can not see them classic of les paul 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:31.120
 the weight of the guitar 4.5 kilos 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:36.210
 a good weight so that neither much 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:39.740
 nor little the height of the guitar are 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:45.400
 from its bottom to 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.400
 up to the top are 39 inches 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.510
 What more can be said 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.510
 ok the incrustations the english 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.510
 rectangular 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:05.769
 your frets contains 22 frets 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.769
 of jumbo size 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.920
 here we can see also 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.299
 and other details 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:21.440
 the points that mark the frets 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.440
 reference 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.980
 the dishes 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.430
 they have a very good incrustation 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.730
 they are very well leveled has never had 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.360
 problems with this guitar in the 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:42.700
 it is necessary to sand it because 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.730
 later on the strings for what 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:49.960
 his frets the frets are very good 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:52.750
 embedded there is no separation between 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.100
 wood and the fret has very good 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.720
 finish 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.720
 he is very perfectionist 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.060
 as the English can also see 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.770
 they are very well very well that we are 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.790
 feel no difference between 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.150
 wood and inlay completely 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.150
 smooth 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.980
 in fact you can 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.870
 I have had in my hands other 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:26.820
 and copies 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.820
 we are not going to talk about brands because 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:34.310
 It is not my duty to discredit others 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:37.699
 brands but brands in which 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.160
 details of the inlays are very 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.390
 poor 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:48.330
 and English sometimes pick up phrases 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.330
 lifted apart from the wood 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:56.889
 as well 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:59.330
 details like the edges lines 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:03.169
 with imperfections 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.889
 of this guitar can be visualized in 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.770
 all its expression 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.740
 and they are very precise when it comes to 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.520
 elaborate this guitar here is the 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.520
 entry of the wick 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.850
 and 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.910
 Because its price-quality ratio is very 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.850
 good 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.030
 it cost me talking about dollars 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.030
 American people 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.840
 at 360 dollars 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.479
 what 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:43.660
 to spend them on another in a copy of 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:47.230
 another mark, I do not regret 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.950
 because I've tried other models of 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.950
 sound very 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.309
 very poor 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:07:01.230
 is this guitar has a sound 

00:06:55.309 --> 00:07:03.000
 pretty clear in its clean mode 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.420
 and 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.100
 already adding profit with distortions 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.180
 and 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.180
 do not stay behind 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:17.439
 I could never compare it with a 

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:17.439
 guitar like 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:24.370
 an epiphone but as close as 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.370
 I could have 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:32.759
 Well, here comes the review of 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:37.840
 this edit I hope it serves you if I 

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:39.970
 it lacked any specification 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.470
 leave your comments or send me a 

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:46.950
 message that I will be attentive to 

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:49.790
 answer them as soon as possible 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.790
 this was all
