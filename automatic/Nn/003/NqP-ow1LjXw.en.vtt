 today we are going to talk about 'the express in 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.910
 concrete stationery products 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:18.240
 aliexpress welcome in time between 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:20.490
 papers the first plus I wanted to tell you 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.410
 that in paper time is point I'm going to 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.199
 upload all the photos in detail all 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.029
 the products and the stores and also the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.800
 price and how long they have taken me 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.929
 approximately in each of the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.279
 products that I am going to show you we begin 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.920
 with this product that the truth is that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.660
 is very well known is well known 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.520
 many people because I've only seen a lot 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 people both on instagram and their 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.960
 blogs in photos and is this product here 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.690
 do not worry if you do not see it well 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.239
 because in the blog is the photo in 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.000
 detail for you to see it are worth 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.329
 possible are markers to mark 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.370
 pages or to mark something in 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.160
 concrete that you want to mark the truth is 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.510
 that are super cute but here is a 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.229
 dog and very big is that they do not stick 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.610
 but for a second he does not understand 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.380
 the meaning I do not understand why 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.330
 I want bookmarks of pages that do not 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.460
 stick that yes they are very beautiful and the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.020
 many people use but I think they 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.759
 they will throw glue or something like that because of 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.789
 truth is that it takes off all the 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.310
 while they are very nice to see them from 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.960
 away like that so I would not go back to 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.000
 buy again although I know that many 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.649
 you are in love with these but to see is 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.920
 that do not help me at all then I do not 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.409
 I'm going to buy it and I would not recommend it 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.119
 in the second place another of these are things 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.069
 that you buy without aliexpress and that neither 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.409
 would buy again and this is from here they are 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.330
 these possible from here that the truth is 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.250
 that there were many types there were five 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.110
 assortment knew of the two pages that are 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.940
 literally there were granites other than 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.179
 very funny things the video in this 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.179
 heart 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.920
 that in itself the design because I do not 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.420
 He likes and only 20 but if it does not stick 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.490
 the other was not left this is not want 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.350
 to lose is that he directly flees from 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.640
 paper because it really seems like it's 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.220
 stuck it in truth here with 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.780
 glue looks at us to see I do not know if what 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.120
 You see I think to remove it 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.130
 and it can be removed because you are what 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.819
 look how it looks like they have been 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.819
 glue 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.290
 and then you are clearing the third 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.630
 place and not everything will do bad things 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.120
 were these polygraphs from here 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.830
 that are to die for non-human love 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.100
 to live of love that is much more 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:37.320
 nice yes yes to see each die these 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.320
 It has a color but it indicates here 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.990
 bright but they are very finite are 03 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.490
 and the truth is that they write well 1 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.440
 say that they write very well because yes 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.930
 that it's true that there are times when you're 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.640
 writing that it seems like they stop 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.500
 write and then come back again and then 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.270
 stop writing that you have to remark 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.740
 the several times so that you write do not 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.930
 you go that you wanted and we 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.970
 I would recommend to use to take notes 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.470
 because then you will lose a lot 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.240
 time to highlight what you have written 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.030
 if I would buy them again because they were 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.160
 pretty cheap and they come 10 so 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.620
 they are very good and above all one thing that 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.300
 I wanted to tell you about this seller that I 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.710
 they sent him another certificate of the 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.590
 things that I asked with express law with 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.170
 these stickers here that are 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.610
 stickers of this type are stickers 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.150
 as textiles 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.940
 Fabric version is version of the tÃ©lam no 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.400
 I know if you can see it but it has the fabric 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.220
 like cloth a plaid shirt things 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.810
 so you say yes perfect but it's 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.580
 that I had not asked for this I had 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.400
 had the other version the version of 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.930
 color red color pink so 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.610
 bright I did not order the version 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.500
 factory in then yes that I 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.890
 you will forgive sent that are very beautiful 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.260
 but it's not what I asked 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.390
 but I would stay more than other stores 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.740
 that in this because good I know wrong 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.270
 so this sent me I contacted with 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.450
 him to comment on it and in no time 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.100
 that store answered me to give it a 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.780
 solution and nothing so I do not the 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.550
 I would recommend to the store for nothing but 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.860
 however, if I would recommend this set 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.350
 because the truth is that they stick very well and 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.770
 they are very cool another of the things that 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.290
 I bought was 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.610
 hence this remains lovingly 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.610
 true loving 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.940
 but then this is more beautiful on the side 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.510
 and then this is already to live in love 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.450
 eternally in this case they are posts of 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.760
 various types and the good thing is that it does 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.710
 have really stick it takes off what 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.320
 you hit again and they keep hitting 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.060
 they fulfill their mission, that is to say they fulfill the 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.920
 objective for what they were born is to say 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.780
 to be possible to be stickers 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.850
 sticky and paste and this is what they do 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.500
 these adhesive cooperatives and stick what 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.960
 foolishness is not that I can think of in each 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.210
 thing they do have and therefore I 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.410
 they love these goods to some bolis that 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.800
 sure you have seen them in Instagram 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.050
 that are very well known and very cute are 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.620
 these bolides here that are shaped 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.740
 of ice cream 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.190
 a butterfly hanging lungs you see 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.900
 they were 12 x 10 this did cost me a little 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.670
 more expensive approximately five euros or 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.000
 six euros 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.670
 and they are 12 that is to say each 50 cents 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.040
 each one paints the same color as his 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.690
 ice cream so they seem very cool 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.010
 but it is true that I like myself 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.960
 the price would not buy 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.100
 because well no but I think today I 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.480
 that is, I 'm not going to carry 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.100
 choosing sins you already know that my 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.110
 box as you have seen life 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.150
 previous I do not fit more things then 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.520
 I can not take this, they paint 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.530
 about how these are 03 a 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.850
 Sometimes you have to go over why there are 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.770
 Sometimes it does not paint of viesques and 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.860
 then you have to go over again not 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.790
 but they are very good and they are very beautiful and 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.860
 they arrived quite a while ago it took like 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.540
 50 days are like that the truth that I had to 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.169
 wait as long as it was a contact with 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.360
 the seller 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.069
 It's not me, either, with reality, that 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.289
 seller because it took a lot but the 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.210
 product itself is very well fulfills its 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.009
 committed as I say it is to write and 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.599
 the video is good so far 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.740
 I hope you liked it and remember 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.689
 that you can follow me on twitter in 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.729
 instagram on dotcom paper types and 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:19.020
 on facebook so nothing studies a lot and 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.020
