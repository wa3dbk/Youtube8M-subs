00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.649
 Hello everyone, today I am here for 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 introduce you to my vehicle 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.880
 giorgia mounted with mac and then mac 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.340
 George 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.590
 I'm not making you a real one from 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.290
 profile easily see some dec 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.590
 the east river is a bit like cards 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:29.669
 play that touch but let's start those 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:37.780
 monsters various monsters we have fundamental 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:39.520
 3 ie armor gear obviously 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.690
 because without these cards already well not 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.360
 you can play you create a trip 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.610
 also these fundamental accellerator 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.220
 because they evoke special checks a 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.290
 gear including yourself then the 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.860
 story of two to fail cernic sisley 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.570
 young 4 and is very very good and ends 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.150
 with these 6 are a little are 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.920
 fundamental 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:08.680
 i play trender eat arsenal yes 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.450
 They could also play in two, however, 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.280
 game 3 for why this too 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.229
 I think it is very good as so many that 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.750
 allows him to summon armor at the end 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.990
 which is offered as a debut that ninjas 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.390
 therefore it allows to evoke the morra e 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.020
 it is not a blow costs two gears mk2 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.119
 simply because when it comes 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.389
 summoned another with holes and do 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.909
 urlike 3 or I ended the day 

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:38.530
 voice michele al campo i modÃ  the hand in 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:41.020
 campo armor however you want and these 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:48.909
 days the eleven georgia play but up 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:50.920
 whose texture fuselage usually thing of the mac 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.259
 which allows us to recover them 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.380
 in the fortresses or mac strength I never have 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:02.299
 guns then play strength goes from the end 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.399
 javier then has the fortress theme 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:10.880
 of course, even if the game admits these 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:13.550
 they want it is in fortress and not 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.489
 strength because you play one because two 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.750
 heavy tried to play it at 2 but not 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.519
 sicily you can't do it 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.819
 but you always draw dead card 15 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:31.489
 game two game where we came side 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:37.340
 by the effect called bayless and easy e 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:40.760
 golf and these were the dead we pass 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:48.709
 to magic magic they are generally 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:52.459
 always the same jacob lew hoad a 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:57.829
 joy for avarice a removal of 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:03.340
 limit or very red quoted a book 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:10.299
 then a black hole 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.299
 a powerful storm and two typhoons 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:20.110
 we go to the traps we have too 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.090
 a torrential tribute 2 gotto me that 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.480
 I don't have a warning so without a world 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:32.530
 some motorcycles are obviously not a 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:34.900
 judgment rennes 1 st wright 2 brive 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.850
 this deck we say that prophetic 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.230
 negrar and magic and traps 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:44.490
 so if they are good even if not anymore 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.940
 not now that it does nothing at all 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:53.080
 this was to look at the deck now 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:56.050
 we spend the extra extras abroad 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.090
 done a bit like cabbage are three 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.270
 for four or five cards we say 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.370
 I'm not obliged to put but 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.650
 which there are two are fundamental facts 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.100
 when they leave me these twice 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.150
 giant gear ips why 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.830
 easy to do with I guess 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.920
 accellerator because armor was enough 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.500
 covered the flame spena log in that does 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.270
 he takes me and breaks me 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.630
 fuselage and start making combo col 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:24.310
 mac as he says in the field this is 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.140
 fundamental without this you cannot 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.600
 play a charger bunch because it is 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.380
 impossible you can't play it final 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.000
 you struggle too much effort 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.020
 theologians clos the karakuri clock 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.760
 let's say equal good can play 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.669
 synchronous usually no story is told 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.860
 then I play between utopia because I didn't know 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.750
 what to put us, therefore, pious designs 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.020
 I would play only one pits for me 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.140
 I would play one but not only I do n't know what 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.960
 put ourselves still waiting for the zen mans 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.810
 which then serves me an operational butterfly 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.050
 photonic or with the very useful paper if there 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.430
 six assistant marshmallow sect 2 aldo 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.620
 this too is king of fairies 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.750
 according to me in one is mandatory 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.780
 I have it because I saw it anyway in the 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.250
 deck nodes of specimen the level of 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.510
 jazz shows, however, useful because 500 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.990
 Faith attack of all monsters not 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:23.560
 earth being a completely ground max 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:29.250
 it doesn't suck and this can be for 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:33.190
 down too know how gore cards is 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.900
 good because even if you make two each 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.250
 then turn off this part too 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.470
 even if we are serious it shows to the ground 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.180
 the effect, however, continues to remain 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.060
 therefore they remain diminished 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:47.580
 that is, not because a knight of one 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:52.449
 for a time actually i 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.070
 opponents a dragon forbid them incautiously 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.430
 store because he played because 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.169
 actually bale is a tunnel I am 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.370
 right in the shit I saw it co 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:05.680
 I do a cadastre and finally stardust 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.250
 I was making the other already miserable only for 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.160
 starlight this was the dec 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.700
 I hope you enjoyed commenting on me 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.700
 I recommend
