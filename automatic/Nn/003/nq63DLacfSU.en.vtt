yeah it seems like it's just shooting a
little<00:02:52.280> bit<00:02:52.519> low<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:52.910> think<00:02:54.790> again<00:02:55.790> it's<00:02:55.970> pretty

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
little bit low I think again it's pretty

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:20.500 
little bit low I think again it's pretty
cold<00:02:56.450> out<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:58.840> do<00:02:59.840> my<00:02:59.959> best<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.440> make<00:03:00.739> sure<00:03:01.160> that

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.240 

yeah<00:03:21.510> definitely<00:03:22.290> shooting<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.890> little

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
yeah definitely shooting just a little

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:39.080 
yeah definitely shooting just a little
bit<00:03:23.340> low<00:03:37.280> magazine<00:03:38.280> seemed<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.730> work<00:03:38.849> out

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
bit low magazine seemed to work out

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.809 
bit low magazine seemed to work out
pretty<00:03:39.150> good

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
pretty good

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.420 
pretty good
would<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:42.000> have<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.299> aim<00:03:42.569> up<00:03:43.250> yeah<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.280> just

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
would you have to aim up yeah I just

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.570 
would you have to aim up yeah I just
kept<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:44.940> having<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.959> front<00:03:46.170> sight<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:47.519> was

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
kept the having the front sight it was

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.270 
kept the having the front sight it was
kind<00:03:47.819> of<00:03:47.910> hard<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.209> judge<00:03:48.569> I<00:03:48.959> started<00:03:49.890> off<00:03:50.010> like

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
kind of hard to judge I started off like

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.759 
kind of hard to judge I started off like
right<00:03:50.549> here<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.180> knew<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.769> they're

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
right here so I knew that they're

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.190 
right here so I knew that they're
shooting<00:03:53.099> a<00:03:53.160> little<00:03:53.400> low<00:03:53.660> but<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:54.780> just<00:03:54.959> aimed

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
shooting a little low but I just aimed

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.949 
shooting a little low but I just aimed
the<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:56.130> know<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.340> front<00:03:56.610> sight<00:03:56.819> up<00:03:57.090> so<00:03:57.870> it

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
the you know the front sight up so it

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.660 
the you know the front sight up so it
was<00:03:58.079> basically<00:03:58.470> standing<00:03:58.799> on<00:03:59.160> top<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.459> the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
was basically standing on top of the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.940 
was basically standing on top of the
rear<00:03:59.849> sights<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.569> guess<00:04:01.410> is<00:04:01.560> what<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:01.829> could

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
rear sights I guess is what you could

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.789 
rear sights I guess is what you could
say<00:04:02.220> but<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.900> mean<00:04:03.900> it's<00:04:04.019> good<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.319> seemed<00:04:04.590> real

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
say but I mean it's good it seemed real

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.190 
say but I mean it's good it seemed real
good<00:04:04.980> left<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.340> right<00:04:05.549> because<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.569> was<00:04:06.720> kind<00:04:07.110> of

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
good left to right because I was kind of

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.550 
good left to right because I was kind of
shooting<00:04:07.500> over<00:04:07.650> here<00:04:07.950> on<00:04:08.730> accident<00:04:09.560> this

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
shooting over here on accident this

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.440 
shooting over here on accident this
needs<00:04:10.890> raised<00:04:11.160> up<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.610> little<00:04:11.790> more<00:04:12.090> yeah
