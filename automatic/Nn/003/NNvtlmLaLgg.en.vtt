xenon projector headlights as well with
a<00:02:49.910> blue<00:02:50.240> halo<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.900> lights<00:02:51.110> up<00:02:51.670> as<00:02:52.670> well<00:02:52.880> as

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
a blue halo that lights up as well as

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.190 
a blue halo that lights up as well as
six<00:02:53.620> 6kh<00:02:54.620> IDs<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:58.240> yeah<00:02:59.240> I'm<00:02:59.660> going<00:02:59.840> to<00:02:59.900> start

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
six 6kh IDs and yeah I'm going to start

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.720 
six 6kh IDs and yeah I'm going to start
it<00:03:00.290> up<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:00.740> you<00:03:00.830> could<00:03:00.920> see<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.190> LEDs<00:03:01.550> and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
it up so you could see the LEDs and

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:27.640 
it up so you could see the LEDs and
everything<00:03:06.160> with<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.280> help<00:03:07.460> of<00:03:07.610> my<00:03:07.910> assistant

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.630 

so<00:03:28.569> the<00:03:29.569> daylight<00:03:30.049> running<00:03:30.379> lights<00:03:30.620> are<00:03:31.250> wired

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
so the daylight running lights are wired

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.960 
so the daylight running lights are wired
to<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:32.510> Halos<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.200> LEDs<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:34.819> don't

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
to the Halos and the LEDs so you don't

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.300 
to the Halos and the LEDs so you don't
have<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.299> awkward

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
have the awkward

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.900 
have the awkward
low<00:03:37.580> beam<00:03:37.790> coming<00:03:38.120> on<00:03:38.690> instead<00:03:39.470> for<00:03:39.910> daylight

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
low beam coming on instead for daylight

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.100 
low beam coming on instead for daylight
running<00:03:41.030> lights<00:03:41.330> drop<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.840> two<00:03:41.990> halos

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
running lights drop the two halos

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.400 
running lights drop the two halos
LEDs<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.130> like<00:03:44.280> these<00:03:44.840> eyebrows<00:03:45.840> das

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.260 

now<00:03:49.800> let<00:03:50.040> me<00:03:50.070> turn<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.430> headlights<00:03:50.640> on<00:03:51.090> as

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
now let me turn the headlights on as

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.660 
now let me turn the headlights on as
well<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.720> we'll<00:03:51.810> hit<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.080> right<00:03:52.260> blinker

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.550 

I<00:03:55.730> can<00:03:56.330> see<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.569> 6000k<00:03:57.230> Chinese<00:03:57.950> coming<00:03:58.220> on
