map this map downturn I've kind of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.660 
map this map downturn I've kind of
figured<00:01:57.420> out<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> spawning<00:01:58.130> points<00:01:59.130> in

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
figured out the spawning points in

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.770 
figured out the spawning points in
certain<00:02:00.149> situations<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.369> I've<00:02:02.369> noticed<00:02:02.780> if
