00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
it's for reasons that aren't really what

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.530 
it's for reasons that aren't really what
they<00:00:31.380> need<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.009> still<00:00:32.430> find<00:00:32.669> such<00:00:32.969> characters

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
inspiring especially those who do so for

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.420 
inspiring especially those who do so for
the<00:00:36.570> sake<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.809> others<00:00:37.079> all<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.860> while<00:00:38.040> never

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the sake of others all the while never

characters that are willing to sacrifice

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.420 
characters that are willing to sacrifice
so<00:00:42.870> much<00:00:42.899> because<00:00:43.469> they<00:00:43.770> know<00:00:44.040> what<00:00:44.280> they<00:00:44.399> are

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
so much because they know what they are

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.150 
so much because they know what they are
doing<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> good<00:00:45.480> cause<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.289> sometimes

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
doing is for a good cause and sometimes

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.400 
doing is for a good cause and sometimes
I<00:00:47.309> feel<00:00:47.610> very<00:00:47.850> much<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> same<00:00:48.420> way<00:00:48.719> about<00:00:49.110> this

I feel very much the same way about this
channel<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.340> primary<00:00:50.640> reason<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.270> started

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
doing these videos was to work on my
voice<00:00:53.820> acting<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.480> I'm<00:00:54.570> also<00:00:54.780> very<00:00:55.230> pleased

opportunities<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> future<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.310> I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
opportunities in the future but then I

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.399 
opportunities in the future but then I
have<00:01:23.640> people<00:01:23.880> who<00:01:24.150> messaged<00:01:24.630> me<00:01:24.780> about<00:01:24.990> taking

Pegasus who's the best player ever I'm

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:06.309 
Pegasus who's the best player ever I'm
also<00:05:04.520> thinking<00:05:04.879> that<00:05:05.120> perhaps<00:05:05.509> I<00:05:05.990> should<00:05:06.199> be

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
also thinking that perhaps I should be

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.619 
also thinking that perhaps I should be
doing<00:05:06.620> more<00:05:06.650> podcasts<00:05:07.159> since<00:05:08.090> I<00:05:08.210> also<00:05:08.360> need

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
doing more podcasts since I also need

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:10.360 
doing more podcasts since I also need
practice<00:05:09.110> when<00:05:09.289> it<00:05:09.379> comes<00:05:09.560> to<00:05:09.710> unscripted

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
practice when it comes to unscripted

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.670 
practice when it comes to unscripted
conversation<00:05:11.270> but<00:05:11.779> the<00:05:11.900> more<00:05:12.080> I<00:05:12.139> think<00:05:12.289> about

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
conversation but the more I think about

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.649 
conversation but the more I think about
it<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:13.099> more<00:05:13.129> I<00:05:13.340> come<00:05:13.729> to<00:05:13.849> realize<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:14.270> i'm

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
it the more I come to realize that i'm

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.869 
it the more I come to realize that i'm
actually<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:15.169> far<00:05:15.590> better<00:05:15.800> listener<00:05:16.490> than<00:05:16.520> i<00:05:16.759> am

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:16.879 
actually a far better listener than i am

actually a far better listener than i am
a<00:05:16.909> talker<00:05:17.300> if<00:05:17.779> i'm<00:05:17.960> in<00:05:18.080> a<00:05:18.110> group<00:05:18.409> of<00:05:18.560> four<00:05:18.919> or

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
a talker if i'm in a group of four or

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.920 
a talker if i'm in a group of four or
more<00:05:19.310> i<00:05:19.610> tend<00:05:19.909> to<00:05:19.969> spend<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.330> majority<00:05:20.449> of<00:05:20.840> my

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
more i tend to spend the majority of my

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.929 
more i tend to spend the majority of my
time<00:05:21.289> just<00:05:21.349> listening<00:05:22.069> to<00:05:22.099> what<00:05:22.189> others<00:05:22.669> have

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:22.939 
time just listening to what others have

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.360 
time just listening to what others have
to<00:05:22.969> say<00:05:23.120> but<00:05:24.020> perhaps<00:05:24.169> if<00:05:24.590> I<00:05:24.710> was<00:05:24.860> doing<00:05:25.159> more

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
to say but perhaps if I was doing more

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.029 
to say but perhaps if I was doing more
one-on-one<00:05:26.270> conversations<00:05:27.199> for<00:05:27.349> a<00:05:27.379> podcast

one-on-one conversations for a podcast
that<00:05:28.219> might<00:05:28.699> help<00:05:29.000> my<00:05:29.210> hesitations<00:05:29.990> about

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
that might help my hesitations about

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.769 
that might help my hesitations about
