00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
done and I'm actually thinking of

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.699 
done and I'm actually thinking of
replacing<00:02:41.599> this<00:02:41.720> stuff<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.170> making<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.560> kind

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.530 
replacing this stuff and making it kind
of<00:02:42.799> like<00:02:42.950> grass<00:02:43.310> um<00:02:43.489> dirt<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.150> I'm<00:02:44.299> gonna

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
of like grass um dirt and I'm gonna

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.900 
of like grass um dirt and I'm gonna
thinking<00:02:45.140> about<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.769> know<00:02:45.890> making<00:02:46.370> buildings

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
thinking about you know making buildings

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.610 
thinking about you know making buildings
surrounding<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:47.390> entire<00:02:47.720> area<00:02:47.989> so<00:02:48.319> it's<00:02:48.440> kind

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
surrounding the entire area so it's kind

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.380 
surrounding the entire area so it's kind
of<00:02:48.650> like<00:02:48.799> almost<00:02:49.040> like<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.340> back<00:02:49.640> alley<00:02:49.940> some

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
of like almost like a back alley some

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.120 
of like almost like a back alley some
type<00:02:50.569> of<00:02:50.599> New<00:02:50.840> York<00:02:51.079> stuff<00:02:51.319> I<00:02:51.560> don't<00:02:51.709> know<00:02:51.890> I

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
type of New York stuff I don't know I

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.710 
type of New York stuff I don't know I
think<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:52.849> think<00:02:53.030> that's<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:53.480> little<00:02:53.569> bit

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
think that I think that's a little bit

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.770 
think that I think that's a little bit
more<00:02:53.930> creative<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:54.849> first<00:02:55.849> we<00:02:56.030> gotta<00:02:56.209> create

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
more creative but first we gotta create

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.030 
more creative but first we gotta create
the<00:02:57.640> Seahawk<00:02:58.640> colors<00:02:59.410> now<00:03:00.410> I'm<00:03:00.530> thinking<00:03:01.010> the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
the Seahawk colors now I'm thinking the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.740 
the Seahawk colors now I'm thinking the
top<00:03:01.459> should<00:03:02.450> be<00:03:02.799> like<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:03.980> green<00:03:04.340> because<00:03:05.060> let's

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
top should be like a green because let's

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.210 
top should be like a green because let's
see<00:03:05.870> here<00:03:06.109> if<00:03:06.200> we<00:03:06.319> can<00:03:06.500> find<00:03:06.680> like<00:03:06.889> a<00:03:06.920> neon

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
see here if we can find like a neon

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.789 
see here if we can find like a neon
green<00:03:07.250> I<00:03:09.160> think<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.880> would<00:03:11.090> be<00:03:11.590> this<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.769> a

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
green I think that would be this is a

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.710 
green I think that would be this is a
better<00:03:13.010> green<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.370> think<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.060> we're<00:03:14.389> gonna<00:03:14.480> make

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
better green I think so we're gonna make

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.300 
better green I think so we're gonna make
because<00:03:15.170> it's<00:03:15.319> not<00:03:15.470> too<00:03:15.769> bright<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.220> then

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
because it's not too bright and then

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.890 
because it's not too bright and then
this<00:03:16.489> hole<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.209> let's<00:03:17.389> make<00:03:17.569> sure<00:03:17.630> we<00:03:17.810> can

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
this hole and let's make sure we can

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.140 
this hole and let's make sure we can
make<00:03:18.019> like<00:03:18.230> some<00:03:18.350> type<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.530> Navy<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:20.000> will

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
make like some type of Navy this will

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.039 
make like some type of Navy this will
just<00:03:20.299> have<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.569> be<00:03:20.720> uh<00:03:22.389> there's<00:03:23.389> not<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.690> Navy

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
just have to be uh there's not a Navy

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.650 
just have to be uh there's not a Navy
and<00:03:24.350> navy<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:24.980> here<00:03:25.250> unfortunately<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:26.389> we're

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
and navy in here unfortunately so we're

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.379 
and navy in here unfortunately so we're
just<00:03:26.690> gonna<00:03:26.870> make<00:03:27.139> it<00:03:27.400> black<00:03:28.400> because<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:29.239> think

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
just gonna make it black because I think

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.020 
just gonna make it black because I think
that's<00:03:29.569> you<00:03:30.260> know<00:03:30.290> perfectly<00:03:30.799> okay<00:03:31.099> so<00:03:31.940> we're

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
that's you know perfectly okay so we're

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.490 
that's you know perfectly okay so we're
gonna<00:03:32.120> make<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:32.359> insides<00:03:32.720> black<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.290> guess

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
gonna make the insides black and I guess

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.680 
gonna make the insides black and I guess
if<00:03:33.739> there's<00:03:33.940> can't<00:03:34.940> think<00:03:35.090> of<00:03:35.180> any<00:03:35.299> other<00:03:35.359> NFL

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
if there's can't think of any other NFL

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.449 
if there's can't think of any other NFL
teams<00:03:36.109> that<00:03:36.260> are<00:03:36.470> have<00:03:36.650> this<00:03:36.829> these<00:03:37.220> type<00:03:37.430> of

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
teams that are have this these type of

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.699

that super educated on it and all the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.240 
that super educated on it and all the
reason<00:03:47.209> I'm<00:03:47.269> doing<00:03:47.470> see<00:03:48.470> how<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:48.650> colors<00:03:49.040> is

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
because I'm a fair-weather fan but

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.250 
because I'm a fair-weather fan but
because<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.389> don't<00:03:53.510> really<00:03:53.599> like<00:03:53.720> pain<00:03:54.019> Manny

even<00:03:54.590> though<00:03:54.650> he's<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.799> really<00:03:55.010> good

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
even though he's a really good

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.230 
even though he's a really good
quarterback<00:03:55.370> but<00:03:56.180> um

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
in the Super Bowl so yeah that's I'm a

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.180 
in the Super Bowl so yeah that's I'm a
