00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.000
 hi to all and neither software and 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.410
 today I'm going to make you a little 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.570
 tutorial on how to download 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.949
 screencast that will allow you to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.150
 so film your android screen so if 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.920
 you have not yet tasted your 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.500
 phones watch the tutorial 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.029
 previous because on this 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.109
 application you are obliged to the road 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.170
 and your phone 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.020
 so here you just look 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.370
 the tea the previous tutorial that I 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.140
 put doses in the description 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.079
 obviously so here you are watching the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.579
 first tutorial that's so it's very 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.770
 simple to download what a caste 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:54.300
 you're going to have to go to the wrong place 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.000
 obviously the blinds or what it is I 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.730
 am going to make a search tool 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:08.159
 here are the blinds you are going to look for 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:09.000
 so screen caste screencast this is my 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.170
 plan we see here 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.299
 and then you see that here there are two 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.240
 weeks breaks so a screencast of 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.450
 words so obviously it's not the one that 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.140
 going that will last we'll say it's a 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.910
 demo so we'll say it leads to nothing 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.710
 and 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.200
 so it's better still to 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.570
 download the paid version so who 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.570
 costs 3 euros 50 between courier and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.280
 here you can so well cracked 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.380
 but I'll take it on a note 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.729
 tutorial obviously that's after then 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.800
 when you have you download 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.690
 can open it when you have road 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.290
 and you can even record all that 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.850
 huh when you made videos 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.150
 could see that there will be videos 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.340
 who will appear if then here this is 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.280
 to make a score we will say 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.960
 phone then have these settings here 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.880
 so I put the best 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.560
 resolution 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.300
 then in auto here you have 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.989
 several settings not bad anyway 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.390
 with 30 frames per second it's great 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.900
 so you have even small 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.670
 slider you also have it in for the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.270
 photos also to make screenshot 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.820
 so here's a screen shot I still 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.540
 never done so it's very simple it 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.820
 there is no simpler like 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.510
 the application is just enough to type there 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.519
 on the red button 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.290
 finally over a year badly year it is gray you 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.860
 hit the true button and then 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.880
 you will be able and you will be able everything 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.150
 simply to record your screen 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.610
 so to make captures so of 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.680
 catches 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.790
 that's still something else so I 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.390
 think it's better not that I do 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.430
 pressure is going to cut the film so I 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.850
 not going to do so it's very 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:16.030
 simply way just m 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:18.160
 so he says it I think here ok that's it 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.650
 options so you can 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.740
 also set the format not png this is the 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.260
 better and so it's up to you to find 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.880
 how to make photos no i'm going to 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.350
 search on google for that matter because 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.590
 I do not know how to do it 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.180
 photos never done anyway it's 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.800
 videos that are more important 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.850
 because all of this is normally you 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.940
 have buttons to make 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.140
 screenshots on your phone and we're going 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.850
 watch anyway if it's possible 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.690
 screencast this is I believe they 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.390
 seek here here is then you can 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.900
 also apparently shared so that's 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.790
 While ac3 0.81 and updates 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.490
 then mine it is not recent 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:07.890
 recent so here I see no picture 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.890
 who who says how to do 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.390
 webb refused for you anyway 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.490
 normally on a phone like the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.090
 mine we can catch on all 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.760
 the phones 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.980
 here after mine it stayed supported 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.590
 on the power button and then stay 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.940
 press the button 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.220
 here is a minimum to do the wrestler 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.530
 if it's the same for you if I have you 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:35.470
 discover a thing here I push 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.810
 have finished the tutorial here and we can 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.400
 leave the application like this 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.840
 so here I will do a little tutorial 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.190
 also on how to crack 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.730
 applications like this one for example 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.950
 to pay 380 it's not very expensive so 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.110
 could still pay is a very 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.810
 good application 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.370
 so here I am smart to you for a 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.800
 next to the tutorial so I hope that 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.120
