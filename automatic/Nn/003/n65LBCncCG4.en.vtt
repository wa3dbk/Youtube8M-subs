hello<00:00:09.400> and<00:00:09.670> welcome<00:00:09.940> to<00:00:09.969> a<00:00:10.090> minute<00:00:10.389> Maya<00:00:10.540> in

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:10.839 
hello and welcome to a minute Maya in

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:12.360 
hello and welcome to a minute Maya in
this<00:00:11.230> tutorial<00:00:11.349> I'm<00:00:11.920> going<00:00:12.039> to<00:00:12.099> show<00:00:12.160> you<00:00:12.280> how

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.370 
this tutorial I'm going to show you how

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.029 
this tutorial I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:12.400> bake<00:00:12.670> ambient<00:00:13.209> occlusion<00:00:13.619> onto<00:00:14.619> a<00:00:14.650> texture

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.039 
to bake ambient occlusion onto a texture

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.909 
to bake ambient occlusion onto a texture
map<00:00:15.330> okay<00:00:16.330> so<00:00:16.390> we've<00:00:16.779> got<00:00:16.810> a<00:00:16.990> pretty<00:00:17.500> simple

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:17.919 
map okay so we've got a pretty simple

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.370 
map okay so we've got a pretty simple
asset<00:00:18.220> here<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:19.480> good<00:00:19.689> not<00:00:19.779> been<00:00:19.960> working<00:00:20.259> on

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
asset here so good not been working on

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.730 
asset here so good not been working on
it's<00:00:20.560> just<00:00:20.800> the<00:00:21.660> low<00:00:22.660> poly<00:00:22.960> model<00:00:23.050> without<00:00:23.529> any

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
it's just the low poly model without any

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.339 
it's just the low poly model without any
detail<00:00:24.189> so<00:00:24.849> if<00:00:25.000> I<00:00:25.119> take<00:00:25.270> a<00:00:25.300> quick<00:00:25.540> render<00:00:28.349> as

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
detail so if I take a quick render as

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.569 
detail so if I take a quick render as
you<00:00:29.559> can<00:00:29.710> see<00:00:29.919> it's<00:00:30.070> gotten<00:00:30.250> up<00:00:30.399> in<00:00:30.520> an

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
you can see it's gotten up in an

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.660 
you can see it's gotten up in an
occlusion<00:00:31.000> shader<00:00:31.239> on<00:00:31.509> it<00:00:32.370> if<00:00:33.370> you<00:00:33.460> want<00:00:33.579> to

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
occlusion shader on it if you want to

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.799 
occlusion shader on it if you want to
know<00:00:33.790> how<00:00:33.940> to<00:00:34.000> do<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.360> ambient<00:00:34.660> occlusion

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
know how to do the ambient occlusion

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.900 
know how to do the ambient occlusion
shader<00:00:35.260> I've<00:00:35.680> got<00:00:36.190> another<00:00:36.370> tutorial<00:00:36.700> that

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
shader I've got another tutorial that

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.090 
shader I've got another tutorial that
I've<00:00:37.059> put<00:00:37.239> in<00:00:37.390> in<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.719> description<00:00:38.469> a<00:00:38.649> few

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
I've put in in the description a few

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.760 
I've put in in the description a few
guys<00:00:39.280> to<00:00:39.309> follow<00:00:39.930> first<00:00:40.930> he<00:00:41.140> needs<00:00:41.290> to<00:00:41.380> do<00:00:41.500> is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
guys to follow first he needs to do is

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.690 
guys to follow first he needs to do is
to<00:00:41.800> have<00:00:42.100> a<00:00:42.400> model<00:00:43.000> with<00:00:43.660> UVs<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:45.340> as<00:00:45.490> you<00:00:45.610> can

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
to have a model with UVs so as you can

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.569 
to have a model with UVs so as you can
see<00:00:45.760> mumbles<00:00:46.210> good<00:00:46.360> movies<00:00:46.690> here

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
see mumbles good movies here

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.130 
see mumbles good movies here
so<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.730> yamaneika<00:00:49.060> should<00:00:49.360> be<00:00:49.450> baked<00:00:49.690> onto<00:00:49.989> it

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
so the yamaneika should be baked onto it

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.030 
so the yamaneika should be baked onto it
okay<00:00:50.590> so<00:00:51.690> these<00:00:52.690> go<00:00:52.900> into<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.310> render<00:00:54.310> panel

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
okay so these go into the render panel

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.310 
okay so these go into the render panel
going<00:00:57.040> to<00:00:57.190> lighting<00:00:57.579> and<00:00:57.730> shading<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:59.170> then

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
going to lighting and shading and then

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.340 
going to lighting and shading and then
go<00:00:59.440> down<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.860> batch<00:01:00.010> baked<00:01:00.630> mental<00:01:01.630> ray<00:01:01.780> and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
go down to a batch baked mental ray and

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.789 
go down to a batch baked mental ray and
click<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.770> square<00:01:03.750> okay<00:01:04.750> well<00:01:05.560> I've<00:01:05.649> already

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
click the square okay well I've already

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.340 
click the square okay well I've already
got<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.130> settings<00:01:06.549> already<00:01:06.700> set<00:01:06.969> up<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:08.110> do<00:01:08.259> it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
got the settings already set up to do it

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.219 
got the settings already set up to do it

maps and there's our big dark map if we

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.729 
maps and there's our big dark map if we
open<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.239> in<00:02:55.329> Photoshop<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.989> now<00:02:56.379> here<00:02:56.620> we

open it in Photoshop and now here we

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.530 
open it in Photoshop and now here we
have<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.430> beam<00:02:57.669> occlusion<00:02:58.090> map<00:02:58.120> with<00:02:58.450> you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
have the a beam occlusion map with you

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.179 
have the a beam occlusion map with you
in<00:02:58.599> Photoshop<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.810> ensure<00:03:02.139> about<00:03:02.439> where<00:03:02.680> your

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
in Photoshop you ensure about where your

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.399 
in Photoshop you ensure about where your
map<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.639> a<00:03:03.939> quick<00:03:04.419> way<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.689> finding<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.169> is<00:03:05.260> if

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
map is a quick way of finding it is if

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.119 
map is a quick way of finding it is if
you<00:03:05.500> go<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.730> script<00:03:07.030> editor<00:03:07.799> as<00:03:08.799> you<00:03:09.010> can

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
you go to the script editor as you can

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.890 
you go to the script editor as you can
see<00:03:09.310> here<00:03:09.579> this<00:03:09.969> is<00:03:10.120> where<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.329> maps<00:03:10.629> been

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
see here this is where the maps been

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.929 
see here this is where the maps been
baked<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.260> too<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:11.980> if<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.659> highlight<00:03:14.939> this

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939 
baked that too so if you highlight this

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:21.569 
baked that too so if you highlight this
part<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.480> script<00:03:18.209> copy<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:20.370> just<00:03:21.370> click

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
part of the script copy and just click

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.659 
part of the script copy and just click
here<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:21.849> paste<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.750> address<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:24.250> get<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.579> it

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
here and paste the address you get to it

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:25.520 
here and paste the address you get to it
straight<00:03:24.879> away

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
straight away

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.819 
straight away
there<00:03:26.530> we<00:03:26.590> go<00:03:28.049> that's<00:03:29.049> how<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.319> become<00:03:29.650> an

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
there we go that's how you become an

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.250 
there we go that's how you become an
occlusion
