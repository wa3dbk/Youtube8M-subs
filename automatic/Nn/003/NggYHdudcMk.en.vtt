00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:18.240
 frenchie tutorial i'll show you that the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:20.460
 freestyle ladies it's vince mara your 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.840
 pro riders if I'm here it's not for 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.730
 talk about me but to teach you to 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.920
 to do freestyle and today I 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.689
 will teach you the 104 hours for 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.420
 start you have to find your axis 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.189
 of rotation in what sense of the volume 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.829
 first of all we will name the areas of a 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.190
 squat freestyle so here we have the take 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.690
 momentum 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.329
 that's where you'll take your speed 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.670
 he we have the compression that's the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.379
 change between backswing and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.719
 your so click this as I am the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.760
 to say it's the trouble 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.879
 and then at the end of the kick they will find 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.340
 always the coping he had to theoretically 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.160
 must have trigger all rotations 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.020
 well bowed people well prepared in 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.170
 compression once I get on 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.870
 the clip I prepare my arms well and I 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.150
 must impulse went off well and 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.570
 sent my fixed to the end at the level of 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.090
 camping 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.390
 he must always keep his eyes on the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.390
 reception 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.679
 the best way to start is always to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.030
 take these figures are too stuck for 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:23.159
 have landmarks so you always have to 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.159
 trigger sent with the shoulders and 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.600
 arms but legs well there 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.469
 always am for the body they're me 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.469
 have to get there read 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.650
 you have to think about triggering and 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:46.060
 then we put my shoulder is always 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:49.479
 watch this is its trigger 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.080
 look how good it is to do them in 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.600
 trampoline 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.530
 but to prepare these figures before 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.780
 try them on the snow 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.610
 the top these late job laws you can 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.729
 try your figures without any risk 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.729
 security 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.180
 I
