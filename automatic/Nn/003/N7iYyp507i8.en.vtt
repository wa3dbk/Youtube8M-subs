from<00:01:50.660> some<00:01:50.870> of<00:01:50.960> these<00:01:51.050> action<00:01:51.410> of<00:01:51.500> poisons<00:01:52.040> I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.680 

think<00:01:59.479> just<00:01:59.660> by<00:01:59.780> pulling<00:02:00.080> on<00:02:00.910> on<00:02:01.910> that<00:02:02.180> will

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
think just by pulling on on that will

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.100 
think just by pulling on on that will
help<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:03.140> little<00:02:06.790> just<00:02:07.790> use<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.570> basic

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
help a little just use the the basic

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:17.830 
help a little just use the the basic
corner<00:02:09.920> tie<00:02:10.130> Ames<00:02:14.920> center<00:02:16.300> which<00:02:17.300> lights<00:02:17.570> are

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
corner tie Ames center which lights are

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.370 
corner tie Ames center which lights are
out<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:23.060> use<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.540> same<00:02:25.570> taut<00:02:26.570> line<00:02:26.780> hitch<00:02:26.840> up

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
out so use the same taut line hitch up

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:37.300 
out so use the same taut line hitch up
there<00:02:29.350> rest<00:02:30.350> still<00:02:30.560> interested<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:36.130> guess<00:02:37.130> in

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
there rest still interested I guess in

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.800 
there rest still interested I guess in
the<00:02:37.400> fact<00:02:37.640> we<00:02:37.820> need<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.150> be<00:02:38.239> made<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.420> little<00:02:38.720> bit

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
the fact we need to be made a little bit

00:02:38.810 --> 00:03:10.300 
the fact we need to be made a little bit
lower<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.830> second<00:02:52.220> time<00:02:52.400> I<00:03:08.950> mention<00:03:09.950> oral

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
lower the second time I mention oral

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:26.350 
lower the second time I mention oral
