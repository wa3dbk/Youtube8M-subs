00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.750
 Thank you good morning 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:12.500
 2nd a ride in that condition it is today 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:15.700
 Today I 'm a little older from Mitsubishi but I would like to introduce you to the ime section 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.960
 To ne This is Mitsubishi has issued long-awaited 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.669
 100% electric car 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.669
 Let's run 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.890
 I heard it was a sea ​​mappon pop sound here 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:47.580
 0 Although d of the lamp has been attached If this lamp is equipped with 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.580
 It will signal that you can start to it in starting 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.420
 It has a little up the steep hill 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.909
 Oh oh oh 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:15.530
 Well it's a motor, that 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.430
 It's a great nice acceleration 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:26.030
 Originally love is Lear to 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:32.120
 A rare rear drive with a turbo car loaded with that engine 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:37.740
 Odai also car is in the id part has formed a mechanism behind because Dale drew its flow 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:41.210
 Relationship on the very that Ru medium Busu there has been that handling lighter 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.210
 Originally pretty well that 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.610
 It seems that understeer tends to be strong in Mitsubishi cars, but my experience 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.770
 Though above 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.450
 a 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.799
 This car seems to be oversteer on the contrary 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:03.729
 Quite Mazda car also fine when you first transfer in Pounds bus tea 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.729
 It was a ball, but it feels like it's going to cut further 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.740
 It has back d Well pretty steep 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.990
 It runs 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.130
 Ri is fine to have just under now amazing speed 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.130
 Also I have gone out 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.020
 I will climb even on a good slope 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:34.720
 Yappa handling is still of Deer Drive minute 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.990
 Um of the head it is high light minute very turning of 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:43.319
 Oh 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:44.319
 I remember wearing a 15-inch tire in memory, so the lotto grip is also very 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.740
 Good 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.140
 Seems to be 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.700
 The 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:56.620
 Maris meter is increasing considerably, but this is not a speedometer 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.620
 There is not even in the course rotation system 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:07.980
 It will be in the status of what kind of situation it is running or what kind of situation it is running now 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:12.100
 Now this green mark 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:18.960
 I'm running in eco mode 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.960
 I place that climbed the hill quickly went up to the white line called power 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:37.880
 Hey not at all Oh But starting sound 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.560
 When I really steam it, I can hear the sound of the motor for a while 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.000
 It is- 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.070
 Well it is very date pattern 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.260
 If you mention one difficulty, people will not notice even if this approaches even if people approach after all 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:56.099
