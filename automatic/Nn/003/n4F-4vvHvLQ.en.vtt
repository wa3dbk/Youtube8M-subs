00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the yellow one the amber light flashes

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.249 
the yellow one the amber light flashes
to<00:01:18.030> tell<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.270> how<00:01:18.360> much<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.689> charge<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> God

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
to tell you how much of a charge of God

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.600 
to tell you how much of a charge of God
so<00:01:19.560> let's<00:01:19.740> do<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.890> again<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
so let's do that again so you can see it

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.410 
so let's do that again so you can see it
one<00:01:23.610> two<00:01:23.880> three<00:01:24.619> four<00:01:25.619> five<00:01:26.340> six<00:01:26.790> which<00:01:27.390> means

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
one two three four five six which means

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.990 
one two three four five six which means
this<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.960> fully<00:01:28.200> charged<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.549> charge<00:01:29.880> this

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
this is fully charged and I charge this

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.580 
this is fully charged and I charge this
up<00:01:30.180> several<00:01:30.420> days<00:01:30.720> ago<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.380> still

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
up several days ago and it still

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.630 
up several days ago and it still
maintained<00:01:31.979> its<00:01:32.159> charge

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
maintained its charge

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.770 
maintained its charge
these<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.479> lithium<00:01:33.689> polymer<00:01:34.140> battery<00:01:35.009> packs

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
these are lithium polymer battery packs

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.429 
these are lithium polymer battery packs
which<00:01:36.780> Sony<00:01:37.740> claims<00:01:38.130> will<00:01:38.520> maintain<00:01:39.439> their

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
which Sony claims will maintain their

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.200 
which Sony claims will maintain their
power<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:42.450> 90%<00:01:43.250> after<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> thousand<00:01:44.790> charges

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
power to 90% after a thousand charges

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.810 
power to 90% after a thousand charges
which<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.840> excellent<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.640> lithium

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
which is excellent so this is a lithium

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.289 
which is excellent so this is a lithium
polymer<00:01:48.119> gel<00:01:48.750> pack<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:51.000> could<00:01:51.149> actually

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
polymer gel pack so you could actually

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.660 
polymer gel pack so you could actually
go<00:01:51.720> you've<00:01:52.049> got<00:01:52.200> two<00:01:52.350> different<00:01:52.439> USB<00:01:52.799> outputs

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
go you've got two different USB outputs

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.910 
go you've got two different USB outputs
right<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.790> one<00:01:57.770> closest<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
right here so the one closest to the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.300 
right here so the one closest to the
power<00:01:59.250> button<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.790> believe<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.570> high<00:02:00.899> power

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
power button I believe is the high power

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.450 
power button I believe is the high power
high<00:02:02.310> current<00:02:02.729> touch<00:02:03.140> jack<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.469> then<00:02:05.310> you

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
high current touch jack and then you

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.069 
high current touch jack and then you
have<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.610> lower<00:02:05.850> current<00:02:06.270> one<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.780> then<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
have a lower current one and then the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.089 
have a lower current one and then the
one<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.439> right<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.860> smaller<00:02:08.539> microUSB<00:02:09.539> is

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
one on the right the smaller microUSB is

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.000 
one on the right the smaller microUSB is
for<00:02:11.099> charging<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.879> battery<00:02:12.180> pack<00:02:12.360> itself

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
for charging the battery pack itself

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.970 
for charging the battery pack itself
so<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.580> plug<00:02:16.879> this<00:02:17.879> into<00:02:18.180> here<00:02:18.599> like<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:19.739> and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
so you plug this into here like this and

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.130 
so you plug this into here like this and
then<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:22.170> plug<00:02:22.409> this<00:02:23.120> into<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.510> battery<00:02:24.810> pack

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
then you plug this into the battery pack

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.240 
then you plug this into the battery pack
just<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:26.780> that's<00:02:27.780> how<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.129> charge<00:02:29.129> up

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
just like that that's how you charge up

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.100 
just like that that's how you charge up
the<00:02:29.340> battery<00:02:29.700> pack<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:33.690> takes<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.080> while

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
the battery pack and so it takes a while

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.210 
the battery pack and so it takes a while
to<00:02:34.319> charge<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.860> up

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
to charge it up

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.949 
to charge it up
I'd<00:02:35.400> recommend<00:02:35.760> overnight<00:02:36.209> charging<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
I'd recommend overnight charging and

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.740 
I'd recommend overnight charging and
then<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.860> light<00:02:38.310> will<00:02:38.489> come<00:02:38.519> on<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.209> then

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
then the light will come on and then

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.780 
then the light will come on and then
when<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> light<00:02:40.379> comes<00:02:40.620> off<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.370> means<00:02:41.670> it's

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
when the light comes off it means it's

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.220 
when the light comes off it means it's
fully<00:02:41.970> charged<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.690> these<00:02:45.690> are<00:02:45.840> excellent<00:02:46.049> to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
fully charged so these are excellent to

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.699 
fully charged so these are excellent to
keep<00:02:46.349> around<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.860> emergencies<00:02:47.489> or<00:02:47.819> for<00:02:48.709> just

one two three four five actually I think

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.020 
one two three four five actually I think
in<00:04:16.260> flash<00:04:16.440> six<00:04:16.739> times<00:04:16.979> we<00:04:17.459> just<00:04:17.639> missed<00:04:17.940> the

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
in flash six times we just missed the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.640 
in flash six times we just missed the
first<00:04:18.239> one<00:04:18.329> let's<00:04:18.750> try<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:18.959> again<00:04:19.109> okay<00:04:21.650> here

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
first one let's try it again okay here

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.969 
first one let's try it again okay here
we<00:04:22.740> go

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
we go

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.320 
we go
two<00:04:23.849> three<00:04:24.479> yes<00:04:24.870> four<00:04:25.740> five<00:04:26.340> six<00:04:26.820> which<00:04:27.090> means

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
two three yes four five six which means

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.070 
two three yes four five six which means
it's<00:04:27.539> fully<00:04:27.750> charged

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
it's fully charged

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.920 
it's fully charged
as<00:04:28.259> well<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.900> they<00:04:31.259> for<00:04:31.650> compactness<00:04:32.930> they

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
as well so they for compactness they

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.240 
as well so they for compactness they
omitted<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.919> power<00:04:35.250> button<00:04:35.580> on<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:36.680> CP<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:40.020> v3

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.929 
omitted a power button on the CP and v3
but<00:04:41.250> it's<00:04:41.430> very<00:04:41.789> lightweight<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:43.939> easily

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939
