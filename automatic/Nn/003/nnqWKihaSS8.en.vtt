00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello to today's photoshop tutorials 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.919
 It is about how to shine more in the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.910
 eyes like you get on field and 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.910
 strengthened the contrast 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.210
 how do I get more gloss in the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.630
 eyes of a portrait that works 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.580
 Relatively easy with photoshop open to it 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.640
 just try the program and look for me 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.189
 the photo from what would like to edit 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.989
 I just take a portrait 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.930
 from the jane we were recently 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.399
 outside and have in daylight 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.079
 photographed and you see we had like that 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.160
 a reflector from below yes so 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.059
 a bit already 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.390
 a reflection in the eye like it brings 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.430
 but a bit too little and so on 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.809
 would have a bit of contrast enhancement 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.809
 I like to get in there 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.320
 how does the whole complicated 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.609
 First of all, the level with control 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:07.100
 will call that and the whole twice 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:13.049
 times down here you could see brighter and 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:18.630
 up here we say darker then 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.930
 I set the level brighter in the levels 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.210
 mode or the movie mode or negative 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.830
 multiply 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.280
 The whole thing when I look up here 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.810
 Hide you see, you keep the picture 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.799
 and the top level dark sits down 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.659
 in the mode then multiply once 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.360
 multiply negatively and once 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.130
 multiply 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.970
 now it just settles for one 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.760
 black mask so that I have the mode and 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.620
 the flat food has hidden press 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.869
 to the old button and then go here 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.020
 on the masks symbol 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.360
 you see now the plane is darker 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.490
 completely hidden in masks it is 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.009
 yes so black dazzles ID card dazzles 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.429
 I would just masquerade on one 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.200
 icon click became a white mask 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.450
 arise so is the default settings 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.620
 at photoshop 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.500
 I'll go back and if I have the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.900
 Keep old key pressed and then hold 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.060
 I get on masks symbolic pressures 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.100
 books have been on the wrong plane 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.870
 should of course activate the level 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.750
 and never click on it 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.300
 law wants to hold age down and 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.380
 so we have the black mask that 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.010
 means we have ours here now 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.780
 exit level and here two levels one 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.530
 bright once darker with black 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.330
 masks multiply negatively 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.299
 Multiply negative multiply 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.470
 are the set and now need 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.090
 I do nothing but one 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.920
 zoom little pure does it with 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:01.739
 control plus down here the navigator 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:07.440
 Ok, so I'll take one out 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:09.870
 brush with right click I watch the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.700
 hardness ok should be quite soft and 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:18.420
 the size I adapt to me 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:22.700
 painting so easily in the eye can be reduced 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.190
 The opacity with a little later like 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.560
 15 to 20 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.079
 and start now with the heroic level 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.600
 with a soft brush and lower 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:41.340
 covering power in the eye 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.579
 where I like the bright areas 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.579
 would have 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:52.110
 and I really just have the iris 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.319
 and the eyes inner because the eyes know 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.200
 I leave it as it is, it works too 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.470
 just very unnatural if you are 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.000
 that just makes too white and I have 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.159
 met anyone who said 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.150
 but you have a beautiful eyes white 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.239
 but against it 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.579
 you have beautiful eyes color or something of 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.909
 That's why I always leave it outside 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.450
 in front 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.829
 that would be the bright areas you get 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.220
 can do and here you can see if you 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.959
 new items, zooms each eye has indeed such a 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.960
 little structure and any 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.600
 pattern with in and also the edge of 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.669
 you can reinforce yours 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.800
 by now using the soft brush 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.600
 go darker on the upper level 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.419
 we still have to get one 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.889
 make it a little smaller 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.599
 i work with the mouse that 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.599
 works fine if you have one 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:45.150
 tablet or a pen still works 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:48.560
 a little bit easier but even with 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.240
 The mouse is no problem at all 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.190
 reinforce us here would have to pay attention 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.650
 that the brush also in the foreground 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.490
 white because only then can we get up 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.599
 paint and draw a black level 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.720
 here for me iris rand a bit 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:09.570
 get me the black ones or the ones here 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.030
 dark areas in the eye are still 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:17.250
 a bit out the pictures 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.800
 as such, the whole on the other 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:27.570
 of course, here we have too 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:31.919
 already quite dark line in the eye hand 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:36.360
 always her draw me I still such a 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:39.020
 the pupils here are the little ones 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.270
 reflection of the eyelashes 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:46.789
 so a bit out there and you can already see 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.970
 with two simple published levels 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:53.419
 levels in the right one at the right place 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.590
 film method is enough around the eyes 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.530
 to emphasize again 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:02.060
 as far as the first step I press times 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:04.039
 the old key and dazzle me all levels 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.009
 off to the background level so 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:09.440
 and you see that is already complete 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.690
 nice exaggerated but the advantage 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.250
 this method is because we stop that 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.009
 bright areas and the dark areas 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.500
 have worked separately from each other 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.610
 that we are using the opacity now every 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.530
 single the level again adapt 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.330
 can and that is always 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.639
 a matter of taste 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:33.560
 it looks good contrast 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:35.509
 amplification okay so maybe i would 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.370
 do not always let it out completely 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:39.740
 Control 0 gets here then you come 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.330
 the entire view and controlled 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.710
 again and again before after that press 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.840
 old button and click on the 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:49.819
 Background from each other in the eye 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:53.120
 and behold, it is minimal and it sees 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:55.690
 also not really extreme because it 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.219
 really with the opacity here 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.680
 is adjustable and does not work 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:03.229
 artificial and we have only so 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.349
 we have neither painted in the color 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:08.300
 still we have manipulated in the picture 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:10.190
 great style but we have that 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.979
 existing picture once taken brighter 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.889
 once made darker mask 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:18.080
 about a savings and then just out 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.849
 masked that's it 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.470
 really absurd so i would 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:26.780
 save and done 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.790
 that was the little tips to photoshop 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.200
 tutorial how do i get more shine and 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.580
 contrasts in the eyes 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.860
 maybe you have other tips 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.540
 how you work your eyes like you 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.100
 the still radiant power writes us 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.050
 just below in the comments with 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.760
 purely if you liked the video 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.650
 then give your thumb up 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.710
 the channel on the sides, the hunter left 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.730
 to the other channels and many infos 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.570
 also again below in the video 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.570
 description until then
