floating<00:01:28.770> ladders<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:31.070> Here<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.100> am<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
floating ladders and Here I am in the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.399 
floating ladders and Here I am in the
world<00:01:35.149> where<00:01:36.149> am<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.450> oh<00:01:38.060> okay

world where am i oh okay
there's<00:01:40.409> my<00:01:40.619> floating<00:01:40.920> ladder<00:01:41.189> because

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
there's my floating ladder because

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.389 
there's my floating ladder because

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
prismarine does not exist in 1.6 so my

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.440 
prismarine does not exist in 1.6 so my

ladder is there and I can go up the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.100 
ladder is there and I can go up the
ladder<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.009> if<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.220> break<00:01:53.430> any<00:01:53.729> block<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.869> is

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
ladder but if I break any block it is

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.960 
ladder but if I break any block it is
going<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.500> break<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.860> entire<00:01:56.159> ladder<00:01:56.580> because

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
going to break the entire ladder because

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.930 
going to break the entire ladder because
it's<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.299> glitch<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:58.280> if<00:01:59.280> you're<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.610> far

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.149 
it's a glitch and if you're like far
into<00:02:00.090> Minecraft<00:02:00.390> do<00:02:01.080> not<00:02:01.259> do<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
into Minecraft do not do this in the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.359 
into Minecraft do not do this in the
world<00:02:02.369> where<00:02:02.940> you<00:02:03.360> worked<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.780> long<00:02:03.990> time<00:02:04.020> on

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
because if I now I go back to 1.8 all

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.539 
because if I now I go back to 1.8 all
the<00:02:08.250> blocks<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.729> did<00:02:09.090> not<00:02:09.269> exist<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:10.100> 1.6<00:02:11.100> are

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
the blocks that did not exist in 1.6 are

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.490 
the blocks that did not exist in 1.6 are
going<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.090> disappear<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:13.019> just<00:02:13.200> make<00:02:13.470> sure

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
going to disappear so just make sure

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.620 
going to disappear so just make sure
that<00:02:13.739> you're<00:02:14.400> not<00:02:14.519> too<00:02:14.819> far<00:02:15.090> into<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.450> world

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
that you're not too far into the world

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.199 
that you're not too far into the world
and<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.530> prove<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.739> this<00:02:17.069> works<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.670> am<00:02:17.940> going

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
and to prove that this works I am going

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.059 
and to prove that this works I am going
to<00:02:18.360> go<00:02:18.480> back<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.900> minecraft<00:02:19.290> 1.8<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.650> I'll<00:02:22.799> do

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
to go back in minecraft 1.8 so I'll do

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.830 
to go back in minecraft 1.8 so I'll do
the<00:02:23.220> same<00:02:23.400> thing<00:02:23.459> I'll<00:02:23.760> go<00:02:23.910> an<00:02:23.970> edit<00:02:24.360> profile'

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
the same thing I'll go an edit profile'

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.309 
the same thing I'll go an edit profile'
use<00:02:25.739> version<00:02:26.100> then<00:02:26.549> instead<00:02:26.940> I'll<00:02:27.209> use<00:02:27.840> latest

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
use version then instead I'll use latest

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:38.020
