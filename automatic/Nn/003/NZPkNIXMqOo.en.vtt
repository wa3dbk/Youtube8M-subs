00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.659
 and me 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.260
 and what happens friends of jeta 5 I am estrado 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.030
 and I bring you boyfriend for the channel and good 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.410
 guys, let's go with the second 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.630
 today that is of this vehicle 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.520
 impressive as is that of Inca jester 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.050
 but in racing version the truth is 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.490
 that is very cool and good because 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.750
 if you do not know but if you have lost 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.039
 some video in the description you have 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.330
 all the videos that I'm uploading the 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.220
 dlc both of the tournaments of the 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.480
 new vehicles as teaching then 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.490
 all the new things that they have to take out 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.700
 the christmas dlc so good then 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.070
 let's start now with the link to 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.750
 hester the tournament and well imagine 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.300
 which will be practically the same as 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.010
 previous the massacre that has the same 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.020
 tournament than the normal vehicle without the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.879
 stickers but we're going to tune it now 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.350
 I'm excited to have it so 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.539
 well let's start by putting it 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.210
 typical the shielding to the maximum the brakes 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.520
 to the maximum the bumper we will see what 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.170
 bumper offers us pretty much like 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.300
 You see are the same as the other 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.730
 vehicle than what is the normal jester 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.920
 but we're going to let you see how 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.770
 is in plan racing version there is a 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.020
 today we can put the diffuser painted or 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.300
 of carbon I think here I'm going to 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.580
 play and I'll leave the diffuser painted 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.750
 ok I'm not going to put the carbon 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.520
 same as for example the front 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.830
 I put the carbon but clear 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.630
 because it has the fins but good not 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.430
 I'm going to change what I'm going to put this voucher 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.640
 that goes out here I dedicate it of masses and that 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.710
 stay a little more with more stickers 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.600
 so to speak we are going to put the level 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.580
 of the engine to the maximum the exhaust pipe 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.670
 Well, they offer us three types. 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.410
 put the racing and then the horn 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.300
 it gives me exactly the same lights 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.040
 let's put the scenes of all the 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.800
 life a neon 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.300
 of all the all areas forward 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.540
 back and to the sides 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.009
 the color of the lion well let's go to 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.979
 try to vary I'm going to put it this 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.330
 red time since good like this one 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.850
 sticker is a bit on red so 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.250
 let's leave it in red and well then 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.190
 now let's see what the theme would be 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.750
 of painting paint to see what thing 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.490
 change the color I think it will be all 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.009
 white is effectively everything white 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.500
 what is changing as there then the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.030
 truth is that black is cool and 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.770
 Well, let's go see more colors 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.780
 in gray also the truth that in the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.270
 color that is put in whole red 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.160
 It is also very cool how bad it is 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.810
 they lose some stickers like that 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.819
 although I do not know if that kind of 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.980
 Latinas as you can see is how it is red 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.870
 because you lose a little what are the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.580
 letters so the red then remains 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.500
 nice yes how is a whole car like that 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.239
 Red looks nice but you lose a 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.950
 little stickers here and front 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.890
 which is why we are going to look for another color 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.340
 that fits well the color came 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.800
 well it's not the one I like the pink not 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.180
 the truth is that 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.609
 it's a bit ugly 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.400
 a yellow maybe could come well 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:51.379
 because not a yellow like that 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.629
 fix a yellow you can have a 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.040
 little bit better but well there are more colors 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.870
 although good I think I'll end up 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.060
 cent on it from the other vehicle that 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.579
 is the lime green to see how the 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.409
 lime green, then note that I do not 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.409
 finishes convincing a lot the lime green 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.730
 in this car with red and so on and not 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.310
 I know the truth is that I am a little indecisive 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.139
 here with this the blue does not look bad 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.520
 that could make it pretty 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.610
 interesting 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.320
 I do not know in this one that I'm a little 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.220
 doubtful I do not know what color to put brown 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.170
 colour 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.480
 in these types of colors the truth is that 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.480
 I think that they are not put by anyone to see 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.090
 the purple the squeaky not the color 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.820
 good cream is that the white really 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.250
 It is the color that hits it is , is that it is 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.080
 the color black hits or that the 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.580
 Black may still be worth it even with a 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.550
 matte black I think it can be more 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.020
 nice as there yes I think good we go 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.610
 to change the color variously 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.080
 would leave the same color that comes or be 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.610
 blank but good lime green skin 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.540
 good in mate looks a little better on 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.490
 lime green the truth in yellow too 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.410
 I do not know I do not know I do not know what color to put the 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.120
 I'm really a little hard or we're going to 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.640
 leave it black I'm not going to play I'm going to 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.080
 put the black you can leave me in the 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.760
 comments what colors will you put 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.900
 you are worth what good color better 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.020
 said because you can only put 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.600
 one to see what tastes you have to notice that 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.340
 here the color of my crew does not hit 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.190
 with tail so we 're going to leave it like this 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.200
 we are going to put more leg and colors 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.270
 classics let's see what color is what 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.360
 that changes I imagine that it will be the part of 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.630
 here back then it does not change the part of 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.060
 back which is what changes color there 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.280
 It is worth as you see changes what is the 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.600
 sewing of the seats fixed the 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.900
 sewing of seats and 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.180
 dashboard itself and the mirrors that 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.870
 is what changes color worth 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.450
 interesting 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.880
 that we can put a green here 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.660
 that could be more or less decent 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.670
 a lime green headphones 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.130
 mirrors and the clip is not going to 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.690
 sometimes but not I'll leave 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.610
 white I like more white stitching 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.030
 you see a little bit more or a white 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.350
 ice is pretty cool then cage 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.360
 anti-roll the roll cage 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.220
 obviously it will be white with 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.990
 modifications that is to say so 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.410
 much better with a few tickets 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.870
 air of more perfect the roof we can 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.450
 put the back grid or leave it like this 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.920
 discovered that is already in function of 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.960
 your tastes the truth is that I 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.960
 I like the two ways I do not know which one to choose 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.760
 so it is a little more competitive but not 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.320
 I know but I also like the idea that 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.950
 see the engine and the character from behind 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.840
 so that 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.430
 I do not know we're going to put the grid 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.890
 posts has spent money let's throw 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.930
 the house through the window skirts let's 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.900
 put the sports skirts on 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.040
 which as you see have atomic mark 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.480
 I like them to wear as they wear 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.940
 stickers because they carry stickers by 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.680
 all sides the eaves we will put more 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.360
 expensive which is the biggest obviously 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.590
 we're going to go with man nonsense 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.240
 You can also put this one that has 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.470
 stickers but well I said before that 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.780
 I like the stickers but it's that 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.760
 I also like black eaves like that 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.340
 how good the musket air then 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.320
 suspension to the maximum transmission to 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.880
 maximum the turbo as I said in the 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.100
 previous video like I do not know if they have 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.560
 fixed the boom I'm not going to put 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.390
 at the moment and I'll check it and good 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.340
 Well, so it's settled for what 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.000
 I will warn and well, you can put it 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.860
 everything to the vehicles and other tires 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.630
 the tires the truth is that you have left 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.210
 pretty well the ones that it takes not me 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.330
 they wanted to enjoy but I also tell you 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.100
 that as always I like the 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.800
 solar coal so I'm going to 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.390
 put is worth the color of the tire what 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.620
 bancaja in red because the vehicle is good 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.780
 of red as you see 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.050
 red custom tires 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.910
 obviously bulletproof regulations and the 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.970
 smoke instead of putting it in the color 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.320
 of my crew sees it red because it's good 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.900
 vehicle as you have seen red then 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.060
 let's put it red everywhere 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:51.000
 here I will do the same to leave the windows 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:54.270
 unpainted perhaps a clear smoked nothing 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.160
 if I try like that bareback and I'll go we've already 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:02.160
 tuteado our link there is this version 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.530
 death races death races 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.300
 I will try to use it in many races 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.070
 because the truth is that cars are very, very 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.840
 pimps so well then simply 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.970
