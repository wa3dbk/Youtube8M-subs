Hi guys..today's dish is Scallops with asparagus

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:12.033
I've got some scallops here..I am going to use 6 of them

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.860
This is asparagus..I got 6 as well

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:21.115
peel the top bit off

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.548
sprinkle a bit of potato starch onto it

00:01:38.163 --> 00:01:39.443
I've got 6 scallops

00:01:39.443 --> 00:01:41.423
I've cut them into halves through the middle

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.280
about 6 strips of eh..

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.440
about 6 strips of asparagus

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.100
carrot is just for color...half a carrot

00:01:56.952 --> 00:02:01.192
2 cloves of garlic, I cut them into slices and some ginger as well

00:02:01.192 --> 00:02:04.811
this is going to be a clean dish, so I won't be using any soy sauce

00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:08.535
What I will be using is ..what we called fish sauce

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.780
It's got quite a strong smell..so you have to use just 1 or 2  drops

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.240
first of all we are going to blanch the asparagus and carrot for a bit

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.620
scallops..10 seconds OK

00:03:11.888 --> 00:03:14.048
tiny bit of fish sauce..see that
