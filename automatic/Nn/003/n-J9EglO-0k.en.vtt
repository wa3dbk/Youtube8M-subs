the head is too freakin wide too big it
just<00:03:24.160> looks<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:24.690> disproportionate<00:03:25.690> just

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
just looks so disproportionate just

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.490 
just looks so disproportionate just
looks<00:03:26.110> so<00:03:26.320> weird<00:03:26.650> like<00:03:27.400> this<00:03:27.580> figure<00:03:28.500> also

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
looks so weird like this figure also

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.740 
looks so weird like this figure also
it's<00:03:29.980> really<00:03:30.340> back<00:03:30.549> heavy<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.269> if<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.510> try<00:03:31.690> to

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
it's really back heavy so if you try to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.449 
it's really back heavy so if you try to
stand<00:03:32.019> it<00:03:32.170> up<00:03:32.290> straight<00:03:32.620> there's<00:03:33.070> him

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
stand it up straight there's him

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.940 
stand it up straight there's him
standing<00:03:33.820> straight<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.840> would<00:03:35.049> fall<00:03:35.709> behind

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
standing straight it would fall behind

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.000 
standing straight it would fall behind
because<00:03:36.489> if<00:03:36.820> his<00:03:36.970> hair<00:03:37.209> is<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:37.750> big<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.739> just

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
because if his hair is so big it just

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.820 
because if his hair is so big it just
falls<00:03:39.519> over<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:40.209> know<00:03:40.660> only<00:03:41.440> way<00:03:41.590> you<00:03:41.650> can

kind<00:04:32.440> of<00:04:32.500> ridiculous

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
kind of ridiculous

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.800 
kind of ridiculous
the<00:04:33.730> only<00:04:33.850> thing<00:04:34.030> that's<00:04:34.180> good<00:04:34.330> as<00:04:34.420> the<00:04:34.570> hair

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
the only thing that's good as the hair

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.770 
the only thing that's good as the hair
and<00:04:35.380> that's<00:04:36.220> you<00:04:36.880> know<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.270> best<00:04:37.450> you<00:04:37.510> can<00:04:37.660> do

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
and that's you know the best you can do

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.360 
and that's you know the best you can do
with<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.020> hair<00:04:38.290> I<00:04:38.320> mean<00:04:38.800> if<00:04:38.980> you<00:04:39.070> wanted<00:04:39.250> to

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
with the hair I mean if you wanted to

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.040 
with the hair I mean if you wanted to
make<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.490> custom<00:04:40.030> but<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.300> can't<00:04:40.480> even<00:04:40.630> do<00:04:40.840> that

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
make a custom but you can't even do that

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.740 
make a custom but you can't even do that
because<00:04:41.880> you<00:04:42.880> can't<00:04:43.060> even<00:04:43.150> make<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.390> custom

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
because you can't even make a custom

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.900 
because you can't even make a custom
with<00:04:43.900> it<00:04:44.050> because<00:04:44.290> his<00:04:44.500> head<00:04:44.770> is<00:04:44.800> pretty<00:04:45.490> wide

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
with it because his head is pretty wide

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.090 
with it because his head is pretty wide
so<00:04:46.420> it<00:04:46.570> doesn't<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.810> it's<00:04:47.500> wider<00:04:47.830> than<00:04:48.040> the

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
so it doesn't you it's wider than the

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.490 
so it doesn't you it's wider than the
standard<00:04:48.460> Goku's<00:04:48.850> head<00:04:49.120> so<00:04:49.930> if<00:04:50.200> you're<00:04:50.320> trying

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
standard Goku's head so if you're trying

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.440 
standard Goku's head so if you're trying
to<00:04:50.530> make<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.710> Super<00:04:51.010> Saiyan<00:04:51.040> Goku<00:04:51.370> Super<00:04:52.210> Saiyan

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
to make a Super Saiyan Goku Super Saiyan

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.180 
to make a Super Saiyan Goku Super Saiyan
3<00:04:52.510> Goku<00:04:52.990> or<00:04:53.110> something<00:04:53.410> in<00:04:53.470> custom<00:04:53.830> one

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
3 Goku or something in custom one

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.510 
3 Goku or something in custom one
it<00:04:54.580> probably<00:04:54.730> won't<00:04:55.000> work<00:04:55.060> very<00:04:55.450> well<00:04:56.520> because

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
it probably won't work very well because

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.580 
it probably won't work very well because
it's<00:04:57.970> just<00:04:58.150> it's<00:04:58.510> just<00:04:58.600> not<00:04:59.110> gonna<00:04:59.230> fit<00:04:59.440> his
