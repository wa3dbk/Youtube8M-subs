00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.460
 in this lesson 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.880
 the pauses related to the notes we have already seen and moreover we get one 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.119
 new value of the night 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:12.819
 let's start from the first one 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:17.029
 piper the first value we ask for medium and four quarters of which we had already seen 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.189
 but it's not playing 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.939
 now let's see at the break 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.789
 as you can see 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.619
 practically written 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.710
 like a little rectangle stuck to auricchio of our noses 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.100
 let's move on to that of the two quarters 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.160
 a note dense 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.980
 leather designed as more than boring instead facing upwards always 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.950
 attached 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.410
 event 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.110
 let's go instead it was the break of a quarter well the pause of a quarter 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.410
 it is a rather strange symbol if but almost 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.730
 a lightning bolt with a piece of bow 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.910
 under attacked 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.170
 hey there queen b invite us to your break blowjob toquem a trade 1 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.860
 beat on the spot 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.490
 for a quarter 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.490
 we add is the value of another praenotanda 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.320
 the avatar is the eighth 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.720
 the eighth 40 as the name implies 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.280
 air vallee an eighth of the time and therefore not compared to punches the fourth 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.480
 half launched 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.050
 mathematician one eighth plus vocal note and a fourth 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.440
 the single 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.370
 the analogous bellaria fourth 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.340
 but if you add a quotation mark 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.560
 attached to the shack 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.920
 via the murat the pause of the eighth instead 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.540
 which seems almost a sort of self 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.540
 without the spaienza on the coffin. 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.520
 let's move on to the exercise that will show you 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.020
 how to play 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.830
