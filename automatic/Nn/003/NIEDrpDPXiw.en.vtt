00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
with a pinnacle studio 11 and i just

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.220 
with a pinnacle studio 11 and i just
find<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.209> easier<00:03:36.569> because<00:03:36.720> it's<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.049> default

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
find it easier because it's the default

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.839 
find it easier because it's the default
software<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.950> get<00:03:38.159> with<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:39.720> dazzle<00:03:40.109> and

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
software you get with the dazzle and

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.849 
software you get with the dazzle and
capture<00:03:41.849> it<00:03:41.970> on<00:03:42.120> highest<00:03:42.480> quality<00:03:42.780> avi<00:03:43.049> but<00:03:43.829> I

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
capture it on highest quality avi but I

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.940 
capture it on highest quality avi but I
usually<00:03:44.099> save<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.670> as<00:03:44.760> an<00:03:44.819> mp4<00:03:45.390> because<00:03:45.950> it

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
usually save it as an mp4 because it

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.599 
usually save it as an mp4 because it
puts<00:03:47.250> down<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.430> file<00:03:47.670> size<00:03:47.909> and<00:03:48.659> so<00:03:48.870> let's<00:03:49.379> my

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
puts down the file size and so let's my

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.119 
puts down the file size and so let's my
uploads<00:03:50.609> go<00:03:51.060> quicker<00:03:51.329> on<00:03:51.480> YouTube<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.829> it

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
uploads go quicker on YouTube and it

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.160 
uploads go quicker on YouTube and it
still<00:03:53.340> decent<00:03:53.579> quality<00:03:53.909> if<00:03:54.359> you<00:03:54.690> look<00:03:54.930> at<00:03:55.049> my

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
still decent quality if you look at my

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.250 
still decent quality if you look at my
other<00:03:55.260> birds<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:56.030> any<00:03:57.030> questions<00:03:57.659> just<00:03:57.989> post
