drawing and get all three of these in at
the<00:00:56.329> same<00:00:56.510> time<00:00:56.750> so<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.350> first<00:00:57.680> thing<00:00:58.070> that

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
the same time so the first thing that

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.620 
the same time so the first thing that
you've<00:00:58.489> got<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:58.820> think<00:00:59.060> about<00:00:59.180> when<00:00:59.480> you're

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
you've got to think about when you're

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.710 
you've got to think about when you're
drawing<00:00:59.870> fabric<00:01:00.500> is<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:01.130> plains<00:01:01.550> alright<00:01:02.270> so

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
drawing fabric is the plains alright so

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.410 
drawing fabric is the plains alright so
you<00:01:02.780> got<00:01:02.930> to<00:01:03.079> think<00:01:03.230> about<00:01:03.350> backplane<00:01:04.280> kind<00:01:05.210> of

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
you got to think about backplane kind of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.499 
you got to think about backplane kind of
under<00:01:05.720> plane<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:06.350> side<00:01:06.979> plane<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.729> let's<00:01:08.329> go

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
under plane and side plane and let's go

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.239 
under plane and side plane and let's go
over<00:01:08.840> now<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.289> skirt<00:01:09.679> let's<00:01:09.889> zoom<00:01:10.039> in<00:01:10.219> a

across that's the back plane of her hip
okay<00:01:24.469> or<00:01:24.859> the<00:01:25.069> back<00:01:25.219> plane<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.639> her<00:01:25.759> but<00:01:25.969> let's

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
fabric now I know this planes drawing is

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.039 
fabric now I know this planes drawing is
not<00:01:43.340> going<00:01:43.609> to<00:01:43.670> help<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.060> draw<00:01:44.359> the<00:01:44.420> fabric

in a second but you got to think about

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.169 
in a second but you got to think about
the<00:01:49.130> planes<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.520> then<00:01:49.639> the<00:01:49.759> next<00:01:50.060> thing<00:01:50.119> you

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
the planes and then the next thing you

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.989 
the planes and then the next thing you
got<00:01:50.389> to<00:01:50.420> think<00:01:50.630> about<00:01:50.749> is<00:01:51.049> not<00:01:51.700> keeping<00:01:52.700> your

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 
got to think about is not keeping your

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.469 
got to think about is not keeping your
line<00:01:53.329> on<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:54.109> edge<00:01:54.319> and<00:01:54.829> just<00:01:55.189> focusing<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:56.270> on

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
line on the edge and just focusing in on

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.719 
line on the edge and just focusing in on
the<00:01:56.659> contour<00:01:57.200> because<00:01:57.649> if<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.039> do<00:01:58.279> you've<00:01:58.520> got

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
the contour because if you do you've got

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.300 
the contour because if you do you've got
nothing<00:01:59.359> that<00:01:59.569> rolls<00:01:59.869> in<00:02:00.169> so<00:02:00.679> you<00:02:00.740> need<00:02:01.130> to

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
nothing that rolls in so you need to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.599 
nothing that rolls in so you need to
roll<00:02:01.669> some<00:02:01.999> line<00:02:02.240> into<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.020> fabric<00:02:03.649> vertical

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
roll some line into the fabric vertical

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.209 
roll some line into the fabric vertical
and<00:02:04.819> horizontal<00:02:04.849> not<00:02:05.840> too<00:02:06.169> many<00:02:06.349> just<00:02:06.649> a<00:02:06.829> few

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
and horizontal not too many just a few

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.969 
and horizontal not too many just a few
to<00:02:07.880> describe<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.780> form<00:02:09.110> okay<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:09.649> let<00:02:09.860> me<00:02:09.920> show

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
to describe the form okay so let me show

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.500 
to describe the form okay so let me show
you<00:02:10.160> where<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.459> did<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.819> on<00:02:10.849> a<00:02:10.970> couple<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.360> them

here<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.530> comes<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:35.010> now<00:02:35.160> when<00:02:35.580> they<00:02:35.730> come<00:02:35.940> in

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
here that comes in now when they come in

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.460 
here that comes in now when they come in
you<00:02:36.300> just<00:02:36.480> want<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.690> bring<00:02:36.900> them<00:02:37.050> into<00:02:37.230> your

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
you just want to bring them into your

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.560 
you just want to bring them into your
Jorn<00:02:37.830> don't<00:02:38.550> leave<00:02:38.760> them<00:02:38.880> on<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.210> edge<00:02:39.330> don't

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
Jorn don't leave them on the edge don't

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.910 
Jorn don't leave them on the edge don't
leave<00:02:39.750> them<00:02:39.870> on<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.050> contour<00:02:40.410> bring<00:02:40.680> them<00:02:40.800> in

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
leave them on the contour bring them in

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.130 
leave them on the contour bring them in
and<00:02:41.070> then<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.250> make<00:02:41.700> them<00:02:41.820> disappear<00:02:42.180> okay

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
and then just make them disappear okay

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.840 
and then just make them disappear okay
so<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.590> immediately<00:02:44.400> going<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.700> give

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
so that is immediately going to give

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.430 
so that is immediately going to give
your<00:02:44.970> drawing<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.360> little<00:02:45.690> bit<00:02:45.810> more<00:02:46.020> character

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
your drawing a little bit more character

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.210 
your drawing a little bit more character
now

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
now

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.980 
now
again<00:02:47.550> pick<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.120> choose<00:02:48.270> your<00:02:48.450> battles<00:02:48.660> with

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
again pick and choose your battles with

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.680 
again pick and choose your battles with
that<00:02:49.170> because<00:02:49.350> on<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.860> top<00:02:50.190> plane<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.390> hem

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
that because on this top plane the hem

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.770 
that because on this top plane the hem
of<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.020> micro<00:02:52.740> mini<00:02:53.010> over<00:02:53.310> here<00:02:53.550> there's<00:02:54.450> none

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
of the micro mini over here there's none

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.600 
of the micro mini over here there's none
of<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:54.960> okay<00:02:55.380> maybe<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:55.980> could<00:02:56.220> do<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> lick<00:02:56.580> a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
of that okay maybe I could do a lick a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.450 
of that okay maybe I could do a lick a
little<00:02:56.880> bit<00:02:57.000> on<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.270> bill<00:02:57.540> hoop<00:02:58.290> but<00:02:59.160> just

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
little bit on that bill hoop but just

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.010 
little bit on that bill hoop but just
pick<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.090> choose<00:03:00.150> your<00:03:00.420> battles<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.750> then<00:03:00.900> we

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
pick and choose your battles and then we

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.570 
pick and choose your battles and then we
go<00:03:01.200> over<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.530> hard<00:03:01.770> top<00:03:01.980> which<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.280> really

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
go over to hard top which I really

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.630 
go over to hard top which I really
barely<00:03:02.970> finished<00:03:03.420> I've<00:03:03.900> got<00:03:04.230> one<00:03:04.590> convex<00:03:05.310> that

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
barely finished I've got one convex that

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.160 
barely finished I've got one convex that
comes<00:03:05.940> into<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.450> form<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.900> then<00:03:07.020> it

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
comes into the form and then it

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.080 
comes into the form and then it
disappears<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.010> then<00:03:08.430> I've<00:03:08.610> got<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> couple

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
disappears and then I've got a couple

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.780 
disappears and then I've got a couple
others<00:03:09.420> I've<00:03:09.660> got<00:03:09.840> one<00:03:10.110> over<00:03:10.500> here<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.010> comes

weird<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.850> got<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.210> bring<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.900> then

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
weird so you got to bring it in and then

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.270 
weird so you got to bring it in and then
just<00:03:28.260> have<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.440> disappear<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.070> talked

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
just have it disappear and I talked

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.820 
just have it disappear and I talked
about<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.820> every<00:03:30.420> drawing<00:03:30.720> okay<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.590> now

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
about that on every drawing okay so now

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.350 
about that on every drawing okay so now
the<00:03:31.890> third<00:03:32.340> thing<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.700> you've<00:03:33.000> got<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.330> think

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
the third thing that you've got to think

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.930 
the third thing that you've got to think
about<00:03:33.750> when<00:03:34.080> we<00:03:34.320> do<00:03:34.500> fabric<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.220> we<00:03:35.640> talked

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
about when we do fabric is we talked

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.020 
about when we do fabric is we talked
about<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.300> plains<00:03:36.980> we've<00:03:37.980> talked<00:03:38.280> about<00:03:38.430> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
about the plains we've talked about the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.050 
about the plains we've talked about the
convex<00:03:39.540> line<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.260> now<00:03:40.530> there's<00:03:41.010> cylinders<00:03:41.760> on

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
convex line and now there's cylinders on

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.500 
convex line and now there's cylinders on
top<00:03:42.600> of<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:42.990> stuff<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:44.010> each<00:03:44.310> fold<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.330> the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
top of that stuff so each fold in the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.540 
top of that stuff so each fold in the
fabric<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:46.140> got<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.530> think<00:03:46.800> of<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.070> either<00:03:47.280> as

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
fabric you got to think of it either as

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.750 
fabric you got to think of it either as
planes<00:03:48.120> or<00:03:48.510> as<00:03:49.230> these<00:03:49.500> little<00:03:49.800> mini<00:03:50.100> cylinders

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
planes or as these little mini cylinders

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.760 
planes or as these little mini cylinders
that<00:03:50.790> wrap<00:03:51.240> around<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.750> form<00:03:52.020> okay<00:03:52.709> so

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
that wrap around the form okay so

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.170 
that wrap around the form okay so
there's<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.130> little<00:03:53.250> cylinder<00:03:53.610> over<00:03:53.910> here<00:03:54.030> and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
there's a little cylinder over here and

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.240 
there's a little cylinder over here and
the<00:03:54.300> overall<00:03:54.690> thing<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.350> her<00:03:55.560> but<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.040> overall

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
the overall thing of her but the overall

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.040 
the overall thing of her but the overall
form<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:57.060> her<00:03:57.540> butt<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.440> big<00:03:58.890> kind<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.550> sphere

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
form of her butt is a big kind of sphere

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.860 
form of her butt is a big kind of sphere
now<00:04:01.250> let's<00:04:02.250> go<00:04:02.430> over<00:04:02.459> to<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.970> fabric<00:04:03.450> now<00:04:03.600> and

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
now let's go over to this fabric now and

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.350 
now let's go over to this fabric now and
this<00:04:04.350> is<00:04:04.650> my<00:04:04.950> first<00:04:05.400> cylinder<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:06.240> I'm

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
this is my first cylinder so I'm

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.140 
this is my first cylinder so I'm
actually<00:04:06.600> using<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.470> hem<00:04:07.740> to<00:04:08.010> wrap<00:04:08.760> around

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
actually using the hem to wrap around

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.970 
actually using the hem to wrap around
that<00:04:09.330> cylinder<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.050> then<00:04:10.260> I'm<00:04:10.500> just<00:04:10.770> gonna

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
that cylinder and then I'm just gonna

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.850 
that cylinder and then I'm just gonna
shade<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:12.420> under<00:04:12.810> plane<00:04:13.080> of<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:13.320> cylinder

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
shade the under plane of that cylinder

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.470 
shade the under plane of that cylinder
and<00:04:14.010> then<00:04:14.430> if<00:04:14.550> we<00:04:14.670> come<00:04:14.880> over<00:04:14.910> here<00:04:15.150> we've<00:04:15.450> got

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
and then if we come over here we've got

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.530 
and then if we come over here we've got
another<00:04:15.810> skinny<00:04:16.850> little<00:04:17.850> cylinder<00:04:18.330> this

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
another skinny little cylinder this

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.750 
another skinny little cylinder this
thing<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:18.959> cylinder<00:04:19.410> too<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.010> you've<00:04:20.520> got

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
thing is a cylinder too and you've got

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.610 
thing is a cylinder too and you've got
to<00:04:20.910> think<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.209> each<00:04:21.450> of<00:04:21.480> these<00:04:21.720> like<00:04:21.930> light<00:04:22.320> and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
to think of each of these like light and

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.440 
to think of each of these like light and
shadow<00:04:22.979> top<00:04:23.610> plane<00:04:23.910> light

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
shadow top plane light

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.840 
shadow top plane light
under<00:04:24.660> plane<00:04:24.870> shadow<00:04:25.170> top<00:04:25.890> plane<00:04:26.160> light<00:04:26.400> under

under plane shadow top plane light under

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.510 
under plane shadow top plane light under
plane<00:04:27.090> shadow<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.660> then<00:04:27.810> cast<00:04:28.320> shadow<00:04:28.650> but

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
plane shadow and then cast shadow but

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.510 
plane shadow and then cast shadow but
these<00:04:29.850> little<00:04:30.120> cylinders<00:04:30.630> are<00:04:31.520> subservient

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
these little cylinders are subservient

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.990 
these little cylinders are subservient
to<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:33.570> overall<00:04:34.080> picture<00:04:34.350> of<00:04:34.890> this<00:04:35.370> the

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
to the overall picture of this the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.480 
to the overall picture of this the
camera<00:04:36.360> lady<00:04:36.540> wants<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.870> come<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.140> over<00:04:37.260> here

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
camera lady wants to come on over here

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.570 
camera lady wants to come on over here
the<00:04:38.850> surface<00:04:39.360> planes<00:04:39.780> okay<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:40.920> now<00:04:41.100> you<00:04:41.160> just

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
the surface planes okay so now you just

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.250 
the surface planes okay so now you just
got<00:04:41.700> to<00:04:41.790> think<00:04:42.000> that<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.270> side<00:04:42.540> of<00:04:42.690> her<00:04:42.810> hip<00:04:43.050> is

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
got to think that the side of her hip is

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.620 
got to think that the side of her hip is
in<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.680> shadow<00:04:43.920> and<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.880> back<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.300> her<00:04:45.450> butt

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
in the shadow and the back of her butt

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.080 
in the shadow and the back of her butt
is<00:04:45.870> catching<00:04:46.290> light<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:46.980> if<00:04:47.100> I<00:04:47.220> wanted<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.820> to

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
is catching light so if I wanted to to

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.690 
is catching light so if I wanted to to
promote<00:04:48.540> this<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.810> little<00:04:49.080> bit<00:04:49.320> more<00:04:49.560> I<00:04:49.830> could

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
promote this a little bit more I could

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.680 
promote this a little bit more I could
just<00:04:51.740> shade<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.980> whole<00:04:53.250> side<00:04:53.670> plane<00:04:54.030> just<00:04:54.510> a

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
just shade the whole side plane just a

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.050 
just shade the whole side plane just a
little<00:04:55.050> bit<00:04:55.200> more<00:04:55.440> because<00:04:55.890> this<00:04:56.430> is<00:04:56.670> the<00:04:56.850> most

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
little bit more because this is the most

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.610 
little bit more because this is the most
important<00:04:57.600> thing<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:57.780> you've<00:04:58.050> got<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.410> think

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
important thing that you've got to think

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.100 
important thing that you've got to think
about<00:04:58.740> that<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.130> side<00:04:59.400> of<00:04:59.550> her<00:04:59.700> hip<00:04:59.940> this<00:05:00.930> is

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
about that the side of her hip this is

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.370 
about that the side of her hip this is
the<00:05:01.260> big<00:05:01.470> macro<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.730> the<00:05:03.420> cylinders<00:05:04.020> are<00:05:04.230> the

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
the big macro and the cylinders are the

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.130 
the big macro and the cylinders are the
small<00:05:04.770> micro<00:05:05.280> okay<00:05:05.940> so<00:05:06.000> now<00:05:06.330> when<00:05:06.570> we<00:05:06.600> get<00:05:06.930> down

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
small micro okay so now when we get down

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.140 
small micro okay so now when we get down
here<00:05:07.500> even<00:05:07.890> this<00:05:08.040> little<00:05:08.280> thing<00:05:08.460> over<00:05:08.580> here<00:05:08.730> is

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
here even this little thing over here is

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.590 
here even this little thing over here is
a<00:05:09.480> little<00:05:09.750> cylinder<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:11.010> then<00:05:11.730> this<00:05:12.060> shadow

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
a little cylinder and then this shadow

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.290 
a little cylinder and then this shadow
shape<00:05:13.050> this<00:05:14.010> abstract<00:05:14.580> shadow<00:05:14.790> shape<00:05:15.030> over

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
shape this abstract shadow shape over

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.300 
shape this abstract shadow shape over
here<00:05:15.450> it's<00:05:15.870> light<00:05:16.260> because<00:05:16.770> it's<00:05:16.920> in<00:05:17.130> the

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
here it's light because it's in the

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.690 
here it's light because it's in the
light<00:05:17.520> is<00:05:17.760> a<00:05:18.210> plane<00:05:18.750> so<00:05:19.530> this<00:05:20.040> does<00:05:20.370> get<00:05:20.670> a

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
light is a plane so this does get a

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.480 
light is a plane so this does get a
little<00:05:20.970> complicated<00:05:21.500> no<00:05:22.500> doubt<00:05:22.740> about<00:05:22.920> it<00:05:23.070> but

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
little complicated no doubt about it but

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.370 
little complicated no doubt about it but
you're<00:05:23.880> thinking<00:05:24.300> about<00:05:24.390> each<00:05:24.840> like<00:05:25.080> a<00:05:25.110> little

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
you're thinking about each like a little

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.920 
you're thinking about each like a little
individual<00:05:25.890> fold<00:05:26.340> this<00:05:26.970> fold<00:05:27.330> over<00:05:27.510> here<00:05:27.750> now

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
individual fold this fold over here now

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.290 
individual fold this fold over here now
what<00:05:28.230> is<00:05:28.350> the<00:05:28.590> value<00:05:29.010> I'm<00:05:29.220> not<00:05:29.610> gonna<00:05:29.880> make<00:05:30.150> it

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
what is the value I'm not gonna make it

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.110 
what is the value I'm not gonna make it
black<00:05:30.680> like<00:05:31.680> that<00:05:31.710> because<00:05:32.370> that's<00:05:32.640> in<00:05:33.000> the

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
black like that because that's in the

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.550 
black like that because that's in the
shadow<00:05:33.390> and<00:05:33.780> that's<00:05:33.990> in<00:05:34.200> the<00:05:34.260> shadow<00:05:34.470> and

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
shadow and that's in the shadow and

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.100 
shadow and that's in the shadow and
that's<00:05:34.890> on<00:05:35.040> a<00:05:35.100> shadow<00:05:35.340> this<00:05:35.880> is<00:05:36.120> primarily<00:05:36.750> in

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
that's on a shadow this is primarily in

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.050 
that's on a shadow this is primarily in
the<00:05:37.320> light<00:05:37.590> so<00:05:38.190> I'm<00:05:38.370> not<00:05:38.580> gonna<00:05:38.790> make<00:05:38.880> that

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
the light so I'm not gonna make that

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.860 
the light so I'm not gonna make that
shadow<00:05:39.510> shape<00:05:40.550> my<00:05:41.550> darkest<00:05:41.940> dark<00:05:42.210> so<00:05:42.720> now

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
shadow shape my darkest dark so now

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.840 
shadow shape my darkest dark so now
that's<00:05:43.080> a<00:05:43.290> top<00:05:43.530> plane<00:05:43.830> okay<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.640> that's

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
that's a top plane okay and that's

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.610 
that's a top plane okay and that's
catching<00:05:45.090> light<00:05:45.330> that's<00:05:45.510> a<00:05:45.660> semi<00:05:46.080> under<00:05:46.410> plane

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
catching light that's a semi under plane

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.650 
catching light that's a semi under plane
that's<00:05:46.860> catching<00:05:47.100> shadow<00:05:47.490> and<00:05:47.790> then<00:05:48.210> we<00:05:48.420> go<00:05:48.630> to

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
that's catching shadow and then we go to

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.320 
that's catching shadow and then we go to
like<00:05:49.080> another<00:05:49.320> kind<00:05:49.920> of<00:05:50.010> plane<00:05:50.550> right<00:05:51.300> over

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
like another kind of plane right over

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.280 
like another kind of plane right over
here<00:05:51.780> so<00:05:51.960> just<00:05:52.290> think<00:05:53.040> about<00:05:53.160> that<00:05:53.490> and

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
here so just think about that and

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.600 
here so just think about that and
sometimes<00:05:55.290> it's<00:05:55.530> also<00:05:55.740> helpful<00:05:56.190> when<00:05:56.340> you're

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
sometimes it's also helpful when you're

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.740 
sometimes it's also helpful when you're
drawing<00:05:56.850> fabric<00:05:57.450> to<00:05:58.080> draw<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.800> little<00:05:59.250> hem<00:05:59.820> or

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
drawing fabric to draw the little hem or

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.540 
drawing fabric to draw the little hem or
where<00:06:01.050> they<00:06:01.200> stitch<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.950> fabric<00:06:02.370> together

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
where they stitch the fabric together

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.280 
where they stitch the fabric together
let's<00:06:02.940> just<00:06:03.090> call<00:06:03.270> it<00:06:03.300> that<00:06:03.420> and<00:06:03.810> where

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
let's just call it that and where

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.570 
let's just call it that and where
they're<00:06:04.440> stitching<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:04.950> fabric<00:06:05.280> together

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
they're stitching the fabric together

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.160 
they're stitching the fabric together
right<00:06:05.820> over<00:06:06.000> here<00:06:06.120> I'm<00:06:06.300> drawing<00:06:06.540> those<00:06:06.900> things

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
right over here I'm drawing those things

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.800 
right over here I'm drawing those things
and<00:06:07.380> as<00:06:07.830> I<00:06:08.100> draw<00:06:08.400> them<00:06:08.640> I<00:06:08.790> have<00:06:09.150> no<00:06:09.450> straight

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
and as I draw them I have no straight

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.870 
and as I draw them I have no straight
lines<00:06:10.050> like<00:06:10.260> it's<00:06:10.410> wrapping<00:06:10.890> around<00:06:11.010> and<00:06:11.460> it's

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
lines like it's wrapping around and it's

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.820 
lines like it's wrapping around and it's
going<00:06:12.150> with<00:06:12.390> the<00:06:12.600> lay<00:06:12.810> of<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.080> land<00:06:13.170> in<00:06:13.620> this

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
going with the lay of the land in this

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.100 
going with the lay of the land in this
particular<00:06:14.460> case<00:06:14.730> it's<00:06:15.210> going<00:06:15.480> with<00:06:15.630> a<00:06:15.690> lay<00:06:15.930> of

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
particular case it's going with a lay of

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.100 
particular case it's going with a lay of
the<00:06:16.260> way<00:06:16.350> that<00:06:16.560> her<00:06:16.740> butt<00:06:17.010> is<00:06:17.160> wrapping<00:06:17.580> around

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
the way that her butt is wrapping around

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.770 
the way that her butt is wrapping around
okay<00:06:19.110> so<00:06:19.400> just<00:06:20.400> if<00:06:20.640> you<00:06:20.850> can<00:06:21.060> follow<00:06:21.270> this<00:06:21.480> like

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
okay so just if you can follow this like

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.450 
okay so just if you can follow this like
little<00:06:21.900> shadow<00:06:22.290> thing<00:06:22.530> over<00:06:22.770> here<00:06:22.800> now<00:06:23.100> so<00:06:23.310> now

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
little shadow thing over here now so now

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.950 
little shadow thing over here now so now
I'm<00:06:23.610> going<00:06:23.820> with<00:06:24.030> this<00:06:24.120> shadow<00:06:24.420> and<00:06:24.690> it's

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
I'm going with this shadow and it's

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.350 
I'm going with this shadow and it's
going<00:06:25.140> right<00:06:25.590> into<00:06:25.890> the<00:06:26.310> side<00:06:26.610> plane<00:06:26.940> of<00:06:27.210> the

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
going right into the side plane of the

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.380 
going right into the side plane of the
cylinder<00:06:27.900> of<00:06:28.050> her<00:06:28.230> leg<00:06:28.440> so<00:06:28.710> I<00:06:29.340> know<00:06:29.820> some<00:06:30.300> of

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
cylinder of her leg so I know some of

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.750 
cylinder of her leg so I know some of
this<00:06:30.480> stuff<00:06:30.750> is<00:06:30.900> very<00:06:31.710> repetitious<00:06:32.340> and<00:06:32.640> I've

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
this stuff is very repetitious and I've

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.130 
this stuff is very repetitious and I've
talked<00:06:33.030> about<00:06:33.180> planes<00:06:33.660> and<00:06:33.870> I've<00:06:33.960> talked

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
talked about planes and I've talked

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.600 
talked about planes and I've talked
about<00:06:34.320> cylinders<00:06:34.830> and<00:06:35.010> all<00:06:35.100> that<00:06:35.250> Ellen<00:06:35.520> just

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
about cylinders and all that Ellen just

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.670 
about cylinders and all that Ellen just
about<00:06:35.820> every<00:06:36.120> single<00:06:36.270> one<00:06:36.480> of<00:06:36.510> my<00:06:36.600> DVDs<00:06:37.110> and<00:06:37.320> I

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
about every single one of my DVDs and I

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.999 
about every single one of my DVDs and I
all

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
all

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:39.679 
all
so<00:06:38.099> talk<00:06:38.279> about<00:06:38.309> the<00:06:38.580> convex<00:06:38.999> line<00:06:39.210> is<00:06:39.419> one<00:06:39.599> of

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:39.689 
so talk about the convex line is one of

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:41.089 
so talk about the convex line is one of
the<00:06:39.779> biggest<00:06:39.990> things<00:06:40.319> like<00:06:40.619> what<00:06:40.770> I'm<00:06:40.860> doing

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:41.099 
the biggest things like what I'm doing

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.659 
the biggest things like what I'm doing
right<00:06:41.249> now<00:06:41.309> I<00:06:41.639> talk<00:06:42.180> about<00:06:42.449> that<00:06:42.629> a<00:06:42.839> lot<00:06:43.080> but<00:06:43.800> in

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
right now I talk about that a lot but in

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.239 
right now I talk about that a lot but in
drawing<00:06:45.449> there's<00:06:45.779> only<00:06:45.960> like<00:06:46.259> maybe<00:06:46.559> ten

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:47.249 
drawing there's only like maybe ten

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:49.790 
drawing there's only like maybe ten
things<00:06:47.639> that<00:06:47.819> you<00:06:48.089> need<00:06:48.389> to<00:06:48.599> master<00:06:48.899> you<00:06:49.589> do

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
things that you need to master you do

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.070 
things that you need to master you do
not<00:06:50.069> need<00:06:50.369> to<00:06:50.580> master<00:06:50.999> a<00:06:51.029> thousand<00:06:51.719> things<00:06:51.930> you

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
not need to master a thousand things you

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.529 
not need to master a thousand things you
need<00:06:52.229> to<00:06:52.259> master<00:06:52.649> about<00:06:53.009> ten<00:06:53.399> to<00:06:53.999> twelve<00:06:54.330> and

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 
need to master about ten to twelve and

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.139 
need to master about ten to twelve and
they<00:06:55.169> recur<00:06:55.830> in<00:06:56.129> every<00:06:56.580> single<00:06:56.909> thing<00:06:57.119> that

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:57.149 
they recur in every single thing that

00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:00.049 
they recur in every single thing that
you<00:06:57.360> draw<00:06:57.809> so<00:06:58.469> yes<00:06:59.369> this<00:06:59.580> is<00:06:59.639> a<00:06:59.789> little
