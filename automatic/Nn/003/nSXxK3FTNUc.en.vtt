00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.800
 remember marti macfly from back to the future 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.179
 and its hoverboard flying analogue of the skateboard 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.889
 nice to watch him deftly slip 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.350
 above the surface maneuvering circling 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.150
 various obstacles the hoverboard became 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.310
 one of the most important hotelok who 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.980
 appeared thanks to a fantasy for some reason 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.600
 it seemed pretty simple to make 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 according to the film, the flying board should 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.619
 will appear in 2015 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.660
 and I have good news for you 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.969
 really appeared and released 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.680
 flying board suddenly company lexus 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.380
 expensive car manufacturer 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.969
 At first, lexus long attracted attention to 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.890
 releasing a lot of your product 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.239
 commercials which was bad 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.370
 can you see anything but nonetheless 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.079
 it turned out that here it is a real hoverboard 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.530
 advertising company lexus lasted so 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.969
 long 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.620
 that many began to say that 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.329
 no hoverboard really 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.430
 exists and all this is some kind of advertising 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.590
 a trick but a few days ago it turned out 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.050
 that lexus is not deceiving and hoverboard 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.120
 really built true he's great 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.949
 different from its prototype hoverboard 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.539
 from back to the future could fly almost over 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.220
 any surfaces cool 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.810
 maneuvered but climb different 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.640
 height and did not require recharging 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.229
 lexus hoverboard 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.299
 flies only in strictly allocated 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.060
 space at a certain height and 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.340
 needs recharging every 20 minutes well then 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.170
 eat like recharge every 20 minutes in 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.790
 lexus hoverboard need to fill 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.470
 liquid nitrogen to cool it down 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.720
 temperature minus one hundred ninety five 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.549
 degrees celsius otherwise from flying 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.770
 the board it turns just into a board 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.479
 which lies on the ground below hoverboard 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.520
 covered with tiles of special composition 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.680
 which works at low temperatures 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.450
 as a superconductor under the track above 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.159
 which moves hoverboard stacked 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.470
 powerful magnets that create magnetic 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.689
 field cooled board levitates 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.610
 magnetic field but only cooled as 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.590
 only the hoverboard heats up the tiles 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.750
 lose superconducting properties and board 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.189
 falls to the ground as the difficulty with 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.229
 using a new hoverboard 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.360
 plenty of specially created 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.219
 space liquid nitrogen emergency 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.869
 difficulty in managing and finally that 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.430
 the sad fact is that lexus is not at all 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.320
 going to put the boards in massive 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.210
 production company made them like 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.520
 advertising campaign and there are only two 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.780
 hoverboard one works second to this 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.239
 time, well that is recharged 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.610
 cools generally speaking situations when 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.770
 science fiction spurs appearance 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.720
 either the product is extremely rare all 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.610
 it happens quite the opposite namely scientists 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.210
 coming up with something fiction even 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.310
 didn't dream 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.840
 just a hoverboard seemed so very 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.520
 nice idea but alas 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.500
 well it works so far only 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.090
 cinema is nothing to be upset 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.880
 it is better to wait so interesting 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.800
 real scientists invent read this and
