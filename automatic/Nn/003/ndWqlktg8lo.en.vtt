there<00:01:15.780> are<00:01:15.869> two<00:01:16.080> things<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.560> are<00:01:16.680> round<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
there are two things that are round and

there are two things that are round and
the<00:01:17.460> interior<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.450> during<00:01:18.750> roll<00:01:18.930> and

one<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.189> analog<00:01:20.700> clock<00:01:21.119> which<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.840> struck

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
one is this analog clock which we struck

one is this analog clock which we struck
at<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> Maserati<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.950> seems<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.430> some<00:01:23.640> sort

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
at the Maserati it seems to be some sort

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.580 
at the Maserati it seems to be some sort
of<00:01:23.880> symbol<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.780> tradition<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.500> an

of symbol of tradition to have an

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.740

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
analogue clock in the middle just got a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.969 
analogue clock in the middle just got a
lazy<00:01:28.110> v8<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.950> v8<00:01:29.310> will<00:01:29.490> go<00:01:29.700> forever<00:01:30.680> it's<00:01:31.680> so

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
lazy v8 the v8 will go forever it's so

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.580 
lazy v8 the v8 will go forever it's so
under<00:01:32.369> stressed<00:01:32.720> it's<00:01:33.720> got<00:01:33.930> lovely<00:01:34.079> balance

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
under stressed it's got lovely balance

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.260 
under stressed it's got lovely balance
it's<00:01:34.829> roughly<00:01:35.310> 50/50<00:01:35.970> weight<00:01:36.090> distribution

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.400 
but the transmissions a little bit
primitive<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.590> have<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.860> say<00:01:46.040> it's<00:01:46.240> old-school

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
primitive I have to say it's old-school

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.830 
primitive I have to say it's old-school
and<00:01:48.410> I<00:01:48.560> mean<00:01:48.710> old<00:01:49.010> school<00:01:49.370> tie<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.510> it

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
and I mean old school tie and that it

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.650 
and I mean old school tie and that it
doesn't<00:01:51.320> have<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.500> Tiptronic<00:01:52.180> override<00:01:53.180> which

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
doesn't have a Tiptronic override which

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.630 
doesn't have a Tiptronic override which
I<00:01:53.780> think<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.020> should<00:01:54.200> here<00:01:54.440> because<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.220> limits

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
I think it should here because it limits

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.340 
I think it should here because it limits

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
what you can actually do dynamically

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.460 
what you can actually do dynamically
