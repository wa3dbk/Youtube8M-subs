00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.750
 hello then let's draw a princess 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.280
 very easy for when your children 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.860
 Your daughters are good 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.660
 fast as you can see I made a scheme 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.330
 first that is the little head a little 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.920
 tilted an oval with a slanted line 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.140
 to the right short that would be the 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.260
 body and another to the left that 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.119
 would be the dress now as you see I am 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.590
 tracing an inverted triangle that does not 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.619
 ends in a tip but ends with the 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.469
 waist of the princess and from here I open 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.109
 the arches that will be the dress and the one 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.040
 below you have this on the website 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.650
 I leave the link below 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.730
 if you do not want to repeat the video and now 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.730
 let's make the arms 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.010
 so we mark the volume we will achieve 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.260
 the lines is to mark where you're going 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.360
 all body parts here would go the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.250
 crown 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.860
 Well, this would be the first part 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.630
 As you can see, there is the trace that is going to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.870
 guide with the movement lines of the 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.870
 body 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.519
 now we are going to review and we will go 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.140
 adding the details 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.610
 we are going to outline and draw a 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.980
 a little bit better 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.190
 we see the little ear we mark a little the 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.250
 chin we join the neck as you see 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.260
 Unite with your arms and let's unite all 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.860
 the parts then we will erase the lines 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.630
 that do not take us 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.630
 we are a little more waist 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.880
 we left the dress so it has not 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.680
 it went wrong 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.750
 and let's add the details I'll 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.100
 make a lace underneath as you see with 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.100
 Arquitos with the pen 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.650
 I frame the belt, I'm going to 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.710
 add a puntillitas 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.590
 and now he scored two points down where I'm going 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.530
 to join the central part of the dress and 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.630
 I add as you see more little points or 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.020
 details of the dress as if it 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.030
 another under another layer of something different 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.130
 you can do it in triangles also or 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.229
 straight but good this way is very easy 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.909
 this is a very fast and simple drawing 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.679
 so that you get out of the way when you 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.539
 they ask to draw a princess 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.239
 well then we continue a little bit with the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.650
 head we mark the crown that yes already with 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.829
 the little triangles 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.230
 profile of the face and a long mane that 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:24.500
 they love girls long hair like 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.190
 you see done so beige waves that go 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.410
 to the back of the dress 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.840
 it's behind 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.400
 and this is what there are 12 we are going to erase 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.120
 the guidelines that we had made to the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.590
 principle the lines that do not serve us and 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.360
 we are going to add a little more 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.420
 hair 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.240
 we draw a little better the crown with 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.040
 your little gems above 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.330
 and we will also draw the face 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.860
 the princess the two little eyes 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.860
 the nose and a little mouth 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.600
 you see 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.870
 I am now using a pencil or a 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.670
 little softer so that I frame a 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.769
 well, you can do it well with 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.769
 marker and the last final line 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.530
 hands towards the five crimes 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.570
 perhaps the hardest part of the hands are always 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.140
 is what it costs a little more than 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.140
 look real 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.120
 Well then it's a matter of taste 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.160
 part of here you can add to 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.780
 Dress all the details and ornaments 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.310
 what you want puts a little more 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.930
 fast I will draw a little more the 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.930
 hair strands I put a necklace 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.350
 I'm going to shade a bit too for 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.600
 give it a little volume I frame the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.590
 lips a little eyes add some 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.590
 details in the crown 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.420
 and I'm going to mark the hair of this maybe not 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.190
 it is necessary because normally once 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.230
 drawn to children usually color the 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.730
 but good since I am here I encourage 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.769
 I love doing these things 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.610
 I'm putting different shades of gray more 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.610
 clear and darker 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.690
 the body of the dress 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:10.440
 I will also color the dress and 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:13.960
 add a few bows on these two sides 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.970
 what will I also shade gray 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.910
 and now one if I do not tip 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.750
 also to mark to give more detail 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.750
 to the dress 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.490
 sorry that it is from the first videos 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.800
 of drawing and I'm putting here the 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.300
 head 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.409
 to see how he placed the camera 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.089
 next times I will do better 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.399
 good or whether they have the lacitos in 

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:40.009
 central part increased a little the 

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:43.819
 shadow and good more or less here the 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:46.939
 we would see pretty easy fast and 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:48.800
 you will be great with your daughters and 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:51.739
 here I leave you another couple of ideas a cake 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.569
 fake and how to dye cupcake capsules 

00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:55.789
 to do crafts or to do 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.239
 cupcakes also do not forget to subscribe 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.239
 bye
