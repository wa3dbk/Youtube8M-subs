system that about Us page as well which

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.390 
system that about Us page as well which
I<00:02:43.360> would<00:02:43.570> suggest<00:02:43.780> because<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.470> have<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.920> lot

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
I would suggest because you have a lot

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.720 
I would suggest because you have a lot
more<00:02:45.430> text<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.680> would<00:02:47.800> be<00:02:48.010> easier<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.370> find

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
more text and it would be easier to find

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.120 
more text and it would be easier to find
on<00:02:48.970> search<00:02:49.510> engines<00:02:50.020> like<00:02:50.230> Google<00:02:50.290> because

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
on search engines like Google because

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.610 
on search engines like Google because
they<00:02:51.790> love<00:02:52.030> text<00:02:52.450> they<00:02:52.600> don't<00:02:52.840> like<00:02:53.080> pictures

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
they love text they don't like pictures

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.790 
they love text they don't like pictures
