00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 I inform you that this year four courses will open: the first course ... 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 it is an advanced course for The Silent Beat that you already know well 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 the second course is for deaf children that I care a lot about 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.000
 I explain how rhythm relates to music, 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.000
 plus I give them the rules, they learn to look inward 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 and to increase self-esteem, it is very important. Their reference point 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.500
 they are the deaf boys of the dance class, they look at them with admiration, this is very important! 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.300
 New children who want to enroll, the first trial lesson is free is: 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 The third and fourth courses are new: the third is 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.000
 The last quarter is a course of salsa that will be alone 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 I welcome everyone of any age, there is no problem. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.500
 Have you never danced? Don't worry, I will explain everything clearly. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.500
 Dancing is important because the negative emotions derived from heavy days, work, stress, annoyances and more, 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.500
 enrolling in the dance, they dissolve, it's like feeling free inside, 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.500
 it is also important to have fun, let off steam, it is very beautiful. 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.000
