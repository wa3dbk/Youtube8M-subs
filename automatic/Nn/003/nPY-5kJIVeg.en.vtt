Oh<00:00:31.870> II<00:00:32.380> am<00:00:32.590> dampers<00:00:33.010> are<00:00:33.190> good<00:00:33.370> but<00:00:33.820> they're

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
Oh II am dampers are good but they're

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.530 
Oh II am dampers are good but they're
kind<00:00:34.900> of<00:00:34.990> stiff<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.730> I<00:00:36.880> was<00:00:37.000> able<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.300> dial

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
kind of stiff and I was able to dial

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.000 
kind of stiff and I was able to dial
down<00:00:37.720> the<00:00:37.980> damping<00:00:39.180> with<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:41.350> these<00:00:41.530> to<00:00:41.860> make

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
down the damping with with these to make

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.760 
down the damping with with these to make
it<00:00:42.160> ride<00:00:42.630> actually<00:00:43.630> in<00:00:43.870> my<00:00:44.140> opinion<00:00:44.170> better

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
it ride actually in my opinion better

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.810 
it ride actually in my opinion better
than<00:00:44.980> stock<00:00:46.380> which<00:00:47.380> is<00:00:47.560> which<00:00:48.340> is<00:00:48.520> I<00:00:48.730> think

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
than stock which is which is I think

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.299 
than stock which is which is I think
pretty<00:00:49.120> good<00:00:49.559> considering<00:00:51.420> I've<00:00:52.420> got<00:00:52.570> about

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
the power to make is what the powers

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.520 
the power to make is what the powers
would<00:02:49.760> be<00:02:49.850> may<00:02:50.030> say

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530

the<00:02:57.800> driver<00:02:58.070> I<00:02:58.220> could<00:02:58.490> modulate<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.090> throttle

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
the driver I could modulate the throttle

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.370 
the driver I could modulate the throttle
right<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.520> tires<00:03:00.760> lose<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.090> point<00:03:01.780> it'll<00:03:02.020> do<00:03:02.230> it
