and<00:00:46.670> let's<00:00:47.359> see<00:00:47.570> if<00:00:47.600> we<00:00:47.809> can<00:00:48.019> detonate<00:00:48.289> on<00:00:48.760> coal

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
and let's see if we can detonate on coal

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.720 
and let's see if we can detonate on coal
and<00:00:51.769> see<00:00:52.010> if<00:00:52.129> it<00:00:52.249> explodes<00:00:53.350> and<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.620> did<00:00:54.859> and<00:00:55.100> it

and see if it explodes and it did and it

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.569 
and see if it explodes and it did and it
seems<00:00:56.089> like<00:00:56.239> we<00:00:56.539> get<00:00:56.719> all<00:00:56.839> the<00:00:57.019> drops<00:00:57.370> which<00:00:58.370> is

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
seems like we get all the drops which is

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.520 
seems like we get all the drops which is
a<00:00:58.780> quite<00:00:59.780> good<00:01:00.230> thing<00:01:00.980> because<00:01:01.870> regular<00:01:02.870> TNT

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
a quite good thing because regular TNT

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.399 
a quite good thing because regular TNT
just<00:01:04.040> destroys<00:01:04.489> two<00:01:04.699> o'clock<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:06.079> never

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
just destroys two o'clock and you never

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.859 
just destroys two o'clock and you never
get<00:01:06.619> it<00:01:06.740> back<00:01:06.820> now<00:01:07.820> let's<00:01:08.090> see<00:01:08.210> we<00:01:08.420> can<00:01:08.600> get<00:01:08.840> a

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
get awesome iron which I hope now let's

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.649 
get awesome iron which I hope now let's
get<00:01:14.960> up<00:01:15.189> eat<00:01:16.189> trigger<00:01:17.500> do<00:01:18.500> we<00:01:18.680> get<00:01:18.890> iron<00:01:19.659> we

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
get up eat trigger do we get iron we

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.620 
get up eat trigger do we get iron we
probably<00:01:21.110> didn't<00:01:21.710> but<00:01:22.430> let's<00:01:22.820> see<00:01:24.939> nope<00:01:25.939> it

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
probably didn't but let's see nope it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.899 
probably didn't but let's see nope it
actually<00:01:26.780> destroys<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:27.860> block<00:01:28.040> as<00:01:28.280> well<00:01:28.310> so

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
actually destroys the block as well so

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.969 
actually destroys the block as well so
anyways<00:01:29.530> this<00:01:30.530> is<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.740> quite<00:01:31.549> a<00:01:31.579> neat<00:01:31.909> mod<00:01:32.979> in

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
anyways this is a quite a neat mod in

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.389 
anyways this is a quite a neat mod in

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
we make all this and I hope it detonates

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.719 
we make all this and I hope it detonates
out<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.130> area<00:01:49.430> if<00:01:50.000> not<00:01:50.689> just<00:01:51.350> one<00:01:51.680> size<00:01:51.979> on

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
part and yeah it only detonates one part

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.819 
part and yeah it only detonates one part
it<00:01:57.079> looks<00:01:57.289> like<00:01:57.969> but<00:01:58.969> anyways<00:01:59.780> this<00:02:00.079> is<00:02:00.140> pretty
