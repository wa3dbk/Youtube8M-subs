it's very important to know it and it
does<00:00:08.730> occur<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.480> almost<00:00:10.050> every<00:00:10.620> game<00:00:10.650> and

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
does occur in almost every game and

does occur in almost every game and
castling<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.349> basically<00:00:14.360> moving<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.929> king<00:00:16.260> in

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
castling is basically moving the king in

castling is basically moving the king in
202<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.900> one<00:00:19.140> move<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.920> done<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.250> one<00:00:20.460> move

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
202 in one move this is done in one move

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.370 
202 in one move this is done in one move
the<00:00:21.480> king<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.779> moved<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.439> 2.2<00:00:23.250> squares<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.380> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the king is moved in 2.2 squares and the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.370 
the king is moved in 2.2 squares and the
rook<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.539> also<00:00:27.539> moved<00:00:27.900> two<00:00:28.439> squares<00:00:28.859> that

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
rook is also moved two squares that

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.389 
rook is also moved two squares that
represents<00:00:31.380> one<00:00:31.769> move<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.989> castling

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
represents one move that is castling

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.940 
represents one move that is castling
castling<00:00:35.399> can<00:00:35.880> be<00:00:36.090> done<00:00:36.329> either<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.649> Kings

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
castling can be done either on the Kings

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.060 
castling can be done either on the Kings
side<00:00:38.250> as<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.760> just<00:00:39.000> demonstrated<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.770> also

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
side as I just demonstrated it can also

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.000 
side as I just demonstrated it can also
be<00:00:41.520> done<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.360> Queen<00:00:42.660> side<00:00:42.710> although<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.860> is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
be done on the Queen side although it is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.750 
be done on the Queen side although it is
done<00:00:44.280> less<00:00:44.579> often<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.390> side<00:00:46.760> queenside

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
done less often on that side queenside

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.020 
done less often on that side queenside
castling<00:00:48.570> again<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.649> King<00:00:49.980> moves<00:00:50.430> two

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
castling again the King moves two

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.139 
castling again the King moves two
squares<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:54.530> rook<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.610> instance

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
squares and the rook in this instance

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.310 
squares and the rook in this instance
moves<00:00:57.750> three<00:00:58.559> squares<00:01:02.570> that<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.780> an<00:01:03.930> example

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
moves three squares that is an example

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.539 
moves three squares that is an example
of<00:01:04.790> queenside<00:01:05.810> castling<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.830> thing<00:01:08.280> where

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
of queenside castling the thing where

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.570 
of queenside castling the thing where
people<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.060> confused<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.830> they<00:01:10.979> tend<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
people get confused is that they tend to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.270 
people get confused is that they tend to
with<00:01:12.240> queenside<00:01:12.869> castling<00:01:13.710> remember<00:01:14.159> that

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
with queenside castling remember that

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.580 
with queenside castling remember that
the<00:01:14.340> King<00:01:14.640> starts<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.390> square<00:01:15.780> further<00:01:16.080> away

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the King starts one square further away

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.429 
the King starts one square further away
they<00:01:17.490> tend<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.030> move<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.450> King<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.900> here<00:01:19.170> that

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
they tend to move the King to here that

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.460 
they tend to move the King to here that
is<00:01:19.500> incorrect<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.939> King<00:01:21.270> always<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:22.229> all

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
is incorrect the King always in all

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.429 
is incorrect the King always in all
castling<00:01:23.189> moves<00:01:23.490> two<00:01:24.030> squares<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.869> this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
castling moves two squares in this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
castling moves two squares in this
instance<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.220> rook<00:01:26.460> does<00:01:26.790> move<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.420> three

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
instance the rook does move the three

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.109 
instance the rook does move the three
squares<00:01:28.100> there<00:01:29.100> are<00:01:29.220> certain<00:01:29.549> rules<00:01:29.790> about

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
squares there are certain rules about

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.910 
squares there are certain rules about
when<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.570> when<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.930> cannot<00:01:31.290> castle

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
when and when you cannot castle

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.270 
when and when you cannot castle
basically<00:01:32.670> they<00:01:33.060> are<00:01:33.090> these<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:34.619> cannot

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
basically they are these you cannot

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.590 
basically they are these you cannot
castle<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.409> check<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:39.180> let's<00:01:39.210> put

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
castle if you are in check so let's put

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.780 
castle if you are in check so let's put
a<00:01:39.630> black<00:01:39.900> queen<00:01:40.229> there<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.979> white<00:01:41.159> king<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.640> in

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
a black queen there the white king is in

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.080 
a black queen there the white king is in
check

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
check

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.319 
check
he<00:01:42.360> cannot<00:01:42.689> castle<00:01:43.520> similarly<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.850> cannot

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
he cannot castle similarly you cannot

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.740 
he cannot castle similarly you cannot
castle<00:01:45.960> into<00:01:46.530> check<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.850> let's<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
castle into check so let's have the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.789 
castle into check so let's have the
white<00:01:49.500> queen<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.430> time<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:52.049> again<00:01:52.439> why

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
white queen here this time and again why

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.370 
white queen here this time and again why
cannot<00:01:53.280> castle<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.780> he<00:01:55.079> would<00:01:55.229> be

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
cannot castle because he would be

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.420 
cannot castle because he would be
castling<00:01:56.040> into<00:01:56.490> check<00:01:57.079> you<00:01:58.079> also<00:01:58.430> cannot

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
castling into check you also cannot

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.260 
castling into check you also cannot
castle<00:02:00.119> through<00:02:00.899> check<00:02:01.909> castling<00:02:02.909> through

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
castle through check castling through

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.969 
castle through check castling through
check<00:02:03.630> would<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:05.750> because<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.350> white

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
check would be this because the white

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.270 
check would be this because the white
King<00:02:08.399> actually<00:02:08.759> crossed<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.750> square

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
King actually crossed the square

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.800 
King actually crossed the square
controlled<00:02:11.280> by<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.580> black<00:02:11.910> queen<00:02:12.239> where<00:02:12.629> he

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
controlled by the black queen where he

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.830 
controlled by the black queen where he
would<00:02:12.989> have<00:02:13.110> been<00:02:13.290> checked

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
would have been checked

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.930 
would have been checked
and<00:02:13.930> therefore<00:02:14.800> he<00:02:14.950> cannot<00:02:15.250> play<00:02:15.459> he<00:02:15.730> cannot

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
and therefore he cannot play he cannot

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.420 
and therefore he cannot play he cannot
castle<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:17.290> other<00:02:17.500> mu<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.250> other

castle the other mu the other

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.650 
castle the other mu the other
requirements<00:02:19.330> are<00:02:19.569> that<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.980> King<00:02:21.550> must<00:02:22.300> not
