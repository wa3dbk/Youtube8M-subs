interior<00:03:36.709> is<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.130> nice<00:03:37.370> red<00:03:37.700> color<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.330> find<00:03:39.320> that

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
interior is a nice red color I find that

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.190 
interior is a nice red color I find that
this<00:03:39.650> is<00:03:39.790> ideal<00:03:40.850> rather<00:03:41.420> than<00:03:41.630> having<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.959> dark

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
this is ideal rather than having a dark

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.510 
this is ideal rather than having a dark
interior<00:03:42.530> when<00:03:42.890> you're<00:03:43.010> trying<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.310> find
