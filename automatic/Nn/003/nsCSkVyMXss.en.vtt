00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.619
 restoring the best photograph you can 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.670
 note that this photograph is 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.750
 Live better 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.310
 these photographs are usually 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.980
 old photos 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.880
 Let's learn how to let her in color 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.970
 original 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:35.760
 first let's add a layer of 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.629
 the levels adjustments for us to take this 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.379
 red 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:45.360
 we need to get each channel every color 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.449
 and we choose red and pull here 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.510
 aa handle until it starts to undine 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.659
 the color begins you can see that it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.190
 It has improved a lot and we do to 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:01.440
 everyone also takes care because at 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:08.670
 Sometimes you will not get very green and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:12.890
 by blue also looks at the difference of what 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.890
 What was that for? 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.930
 we will also add a layer of 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:25.829
 curve fittings 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:35.429
 let's make a curve without further damage 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:37.740
 alive and we will add a balance of 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:41.520
 colors here too in layers of settings 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.799
 of the color balance in the balance of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.609
 colors we'll take a little more 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.679
 red 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.619
 So we go in each one of them in the 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:53.310
 shade medium shades and do not highlight and let's 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.659
 take some of the red out and add 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.659
 some of the other colors 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.460
 so we'll start with the tones 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.100
 and we will decrease here so let's 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.840
 a little more of this year are less 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.569
 12 do not raise a schedule for 3 in 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.180
 little more yellow then at least three 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.379
 that he goes there and I'm going to do it for the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.870
 others then I go to the shade I will do - 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:26.319
 12 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:31.470
 two and four, it can be observed that 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:35.220
 It will change colors to and highlight 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.209
 three for him in general as well 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.440
 add more green 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:47.940
 about four cool and also least three 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.940
 to get some more yellow 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.870
 careful not to let too forced 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.450
 So we already added 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.600
 all these layers of sometimes 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:03.580
 for us to get a better result 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.099
 we will now generate a layer of 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.360
 all the layers that we took to 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.590
 do that, we hold the key 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.680
 control the alt key and the shift key and the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.950
 people press on and once it will create 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.799
 a layer with all these other 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.769
 layers will add here nor 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:33.970
 bit of sharpness then we go there in 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:37.600
 makes the filter clear and we 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.470
 choose mask here sharpness mask 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:45.579
 of clarity, we will define 64 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:49.109
 intensity 13.4 for ohio and we will not 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:54.160
 rock on the threshold you can observe 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:57.730
 that he is more alive alone than this 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:03.430
 will show him highlights these matches 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:05.920
 here we are going to duplicate the layer let's 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:15.900
 rename this first community call 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:18.820
 the second layer with sharpness 2 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.560
 organize from and here we go 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.310
 add a high frequency then the 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.330
 People go there on other high filter 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.289
 frequency 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.110
 frequency, it emphasizes the 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.580
 edges leaves it and more flashy then 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.620
 people will leave it in the beam 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:42.219
 10 and we'll give you an okay now just see the 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.900
 merging mode to override and 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:46.449
 look at the result 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.759
 it will also leave these sharper 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.250
 and will draw more attention if you think 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:55.090
 What a long time you could come here. 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:58.569
 to put about 80 or depends a lot on the taste 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:05.020
 another - then ah have photo 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:07.449
 restored with the original colors and is 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.129
 a very interesting way of having a 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.129
 very cool result
