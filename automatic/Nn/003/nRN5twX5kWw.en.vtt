00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.940 
thing and you know overall I like it but
like<00:04:24.910> I<00:04:25.030> said<00:04:25.090> I<00:04:25.240> do<00:04:25.390> think<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:25.900> runs<00:04:26.229> quite

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
like I said I do think it runs quite

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.120 
like I said I do think it runs quite
dark<00:04:27.510> on<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.690> shades<00:04:28.960> so<00:04:29.350> just<00:04:29.590> be<00:04:29.919> aware<00:04:30.070> of

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
dark on the shades so just be aware of

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.860 
dark on the shades so just be aware of
that<00:04:30.340> I<00:04:30.580> don't<00:04:30.760> really<00:04:30.970> know<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.450> whole<00:04:31.570> range

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
that I don't really know the whole range

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.409 
that I don't really know the whole range
of<00:04:32.080> shades<00:04:32.320> but<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.760> might<00:04:34.000> want<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.240> take<00:04:34.390> a

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
of shades but you might want to take a

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.480 
of shades but you might want to take a
look<00:04:34.630> at<00:04:34.750> that<00:04:34.900> when<00:04:35.229> you're<00:04:35.350> looking<00:04:35.680> for<00:04:35.950> for

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
look at that when you're looking for for

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.250 
look at that when you're looking for for
your<00:04:36.669> brow<00:04:37.950> color<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:40.330> overall<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:40.810> think<00:04:41.169> I

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
your brow color and overall I think I

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.170 
your brow color and overall I think I
like<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:42.010> only<00:04:42.159> issue<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.550> have<00:04:42.820> is<00:04:42.849> with

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
like it the only issue I have is with

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.070 
like it the only issue I have is with
the<00:04:43.240> brush<00:04:43.539> because<00:04:43.690> I<00:04:43.810> do<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.080> think<00:04:44.320> it<00:04:44.440> Paul

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
the brush because I do you think it Paul

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.140 
the brush because I do you think it Paul
up<00:04:45.169> too<00:04:45.379> much<00:04:45.500> product<00:04:45.860> like<00:04:46.610> if<00:04:46.759> I<00:04:46.909> were<00:04:47.030> to

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
up too much product like if I were to

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.399 
up too much product like if I were to
take<00:04:47.330> straight<00:04:47.720> out<00:04:47.870> of<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.080> tube<00:04:48.259> and

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:48.409 
take straight out of the tube and

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.140 
take straight out of the tube and
actually<00:04:48.740> apply<00:04:49.009> this<00:04:49.069> on<00:04:49.430> my<00:04:49.550> brows<00:04:49.789> it<00:04:50.030> would

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
actually apply this on my brows it would

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.050 
actually apply this on my brows it would
look<00:04:50.360> way<00:04:50.599> too<00:04:50.629> heavy<00:04:51.259> so<00:04:51.979> I<00:04:52.009> do<00:04:52.159> feel<00:04:52.699> like<00:04:52.729> the

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
look way too heavy so I do feel like the

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.089 
look way too heavy so I do feel like the
need<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.479> just<00:04:53.719> scrape<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.289> off<00:04:54.469> to<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.860> side

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
need to just scrape it off to the side

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.159 
need to just scrape it off to the side
so<00:04:55.370> I<00:04:55.400> think<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:56.270> little<00:04:56.509> stopper<00:04:56.840> in<00:04:57.139> the

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
so I think the little stopper in the

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.339 
so I think the little stopper in the
bottle<00:04:57.259> could<00:04:57.740> be<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.889> little<00:04:58.129> better<00:04:58.370> in<00:04:59.360> kind

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
bottle could be a little better in kind

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:01.990 
bottle could be a little better in kind
of<00:05:00.469> sucking<00:05:00.740> out<00:05:00.949> the<00:05:01.099> product<00:05:01.520> a<00:05:01.610> little<00:05:01.699> more

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
of sucking out the product a little more

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.149 
of sucking out the product a little more
but<00:05:02.300> other<00:05:02.629> than<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:03.319> think<00:05:03.710> it's<00:05:03.979> a<00:05:04.069> great

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
but other than that I think it's a great

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.070 
but other than that I think it's a great
product<00:05:04.490> thank<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.300> so<00:05:05.419> much<00:05:05.539> for<00:05:05.780> watching
