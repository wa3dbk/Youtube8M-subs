00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.910
 for constipation not to be due 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.130
 get not very thermally treated not 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.530
 very twisted not very soft and 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.369
 it is very important that while in the body 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.710
 there was no shortage of fluid then there will be 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.250
 volume before in order to ride 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.230
 need volume and here i would like you to 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.890
 much to illustrate so that we are with you 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.539
 understand how it generally arises 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.460
 the mechanism itself 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.370
 here let's look at it look 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.550
 carefully imagine this 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.329
 very easy to see here is the tube 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.670
 the rectum ends with a rectum 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.620
 gut well technically here is mom 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.409
 which is waiting to come out of here 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.530
 I understood it all right here right here in 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:56.829
 rectum accumulate fecal masses 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.969
 and that's when they accumulate they 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:04.750
 begin to put pressure on the walls of the rectum and 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:07.900
 that's when they put pressure on it 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.870
 the urge to defecate is clear to all that 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.000
 eat if there is something to strangle the child 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.830
 run to the toilet now imagine 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.370
 the situation 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.730
 the child has the urge to crap but the child 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.970
 as now, well, I don't want to be more precise than dot 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.410
 yep that's an interesting game or lesson 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.320
 some yes now 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.170
 or is it just disgusting to go into this 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.090
 the school toilet he wants to dober up 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.430
 at home yes if here poop becomes 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.360
 lots and lots then the rectum that 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.860
 does stretch up and now if 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.370
 this system 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.240
 the system then you need a lot now big 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.590
 efforts to put pressure on this one 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.430
 stretched wall 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.080
 that is, if the child is systematically 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.229
 restrained correctly that's all now 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.530
 it is clear who then treat it is already very 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.739
 difficult therefore it is impossible to relax 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.269
 if you see a baby poop 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:12.819
 untimely if he is restrained then 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.319
 then he should be treated immediately and in 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.209
 flow 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.939
 long time sometimes drugs 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.420
 need at least a year for what 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:24.569
 to gradually decrease the number 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.299
 fecal masses and gut sizes came in 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.129
