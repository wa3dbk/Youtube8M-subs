 there is too much of everything 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.199
 on the map and there is nothing more to lose 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.300
 these people in the poorest bedrooms 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.250

 bodies left playing without work for a long time 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.539
 but the most humiliating that my country with 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.190
 millennial history 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.649
 run by some people from brussels 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.090
 emails these people about my 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.640
 problems and do not want to hear 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.350
 it is a pity that we do not have such as Putin 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.510
 only he can talk to merkel 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 equal after introduction once 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.900
 non-food embark in response to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.119
 European sanctions become unemployed 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.619
 thousands more farmers because pre-election 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.369
 new ruling party promise 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.710
 democracy 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.420
 no one believes after greece 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.909
 economic growth begins 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.439
 unemployment will soon decline 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.890
 we have a hard road ahead 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.570
 indicators grow every month this background 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.159
 statements by the radical left that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.509
 Greece is not obliged to give any 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.420
 loans sounded like the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.920
 demanded election program we 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.590
 will not adhere to those commitments 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.810
 who took over the former rulers 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.509
 Greece has the right to take leadership in 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.970
 no crisis 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.890
 more blackmail if europe is in no hurry 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.869
 Greece debt Athens will leave the euro area 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.829
 then from the European Union promised 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.720
 Alexis Cipras 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.710
 and on this his party immediately earned 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.180
 support 25 percent of the population of cars 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.040
 Popularity is gaining left parties by 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.799
 all of europe in the same portugal and 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.869
 Spain Italy it is a protest of people who 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.520
 disappointed in the democrats because of them 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.490
 the board brought only deterioration 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.500
 same level 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.780
 of which brexit canon and of course not 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.739
 eliminate the Greek exit this 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.080
 unlikely 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.120
 eurozone countries want to greece 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.340
 remained single currency after all those 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.000
 reform assistance programs that were 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.730
 are held 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.190
 and here are the details of the latest party mirrors 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.900
 Syriza is already gaining 35 percent of the vote. 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.060
 she broke away from the Democrats by 10 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.220
 percent it means that the left will get 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.170
 additional 50 parliamentary seats 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.489
 the main question remains will they go up 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.530
 end and will be able to fulfill their 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.120
 election promises without parliamentary 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.410
 most are not yet able 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.239
 form your government and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.640
 to appoint the prime minister that is to conduct external 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.049
 politics so what's the talk of leaving 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.239
 if the abolition of anti-Russian sanctions 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.610
 It may well just stay program and 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.680
 Means further from 5 political bargaining 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.989
 however, one thing is clear after these elections 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.970
 greece the whole european union will never be 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.709
 same point passed 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.810
 no return after which the weight is either 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.620
 change or cease to exist in 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.569
 present form 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.090
 willingness to follow suit one already 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.280
 stated in lisbon and madrid after these 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.049
 elections of greece and the whole europe never 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.970
 will not be the same according to analysts 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.950
 this is the point of no return after 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.810
 which if would change either 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.120
 will cease to exist in its current form 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.040
 willingness to follow the example of athens already 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.739
 stated in lisbon and madrid 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.019
 domino effect this will affect europe 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.989
 and therefore it holds it by all means 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.540
 by crook greece within eurozone 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.760
 can't stand no more days if 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.739
 the elections will focus and the color will not climb us 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.510
 we will take to the streets and we will be at the rally 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.340
 demand justice and 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.200
 it sounds convincing because the electorate 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.150
 left has grown very lately it 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.280
 and farmers and retirees impoverished 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.690
 middle class and most importantly youth 60 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.030
 percent which for several months 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.980
 can not find work in their home country and 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.959
 how can the Greeks protest even 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.799
 little things the whole world sees practically 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.840
 every month
