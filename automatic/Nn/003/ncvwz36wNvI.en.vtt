00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
and I just have a comparison here with

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.000 
and I just have a comparison here with
the<00:01:33.500> tag<00:01:33.920> silver<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:35.750> five<00:01:36.170> silver<00:01:36.770> and

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
the tag silver and the five silver and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.630 
the tag silver and the five silver and
the<00:01:37.550> still<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.120> file<00:01:38.360> server<00:01:38.660> is<00:01:38.990> really

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
the still the file server is really

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.350 
the still the file server is really
sparkling<00:01:40.640> shiny<00:01:41.180> too<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:42.530> think<00:01:43.340> they<00:01:44.180> are

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
sparkling shiny too I think they are

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.130 
sparkling shiny too I think they are
good<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.630> use<00:01:45.020> with<00:01:45.520> brushes<00:01:46.870> better<00:01:47.870> than

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
good to use with brushes better than

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
good to use with brushes better than
with<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:48.560> print<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:50.410> they<00:01:51.410> really<00:01:51.770> blend

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.780 
with this print and they really blend
well<00:01:53.120> like<00:01:53.450> we<00:01:53.870> have<00:01:54.230> made<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.530> cake<00:01:55.010> with<00:01:55.610> these

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.360 
light green and the paradise the price
is<00:02:48.020> really<00:02:48.170> creamy<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.980> texture<00:02:49.340> is

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
is really creamy and the texture is

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.570 
is really creamy and the texture is
really<00:02:49.610> claimed<00:02:50.000> pretty<00:02:50.930> well<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:52.010> wall<00:02:52.250> now

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
really claimed pretty well the wall now

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.550 
really claimed pretty well the wall now
I<00:02:52.610> think<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.510> kind<00:02:53.870> of<00:02:53.930> strikes<00:02:54.380> a

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
I think it like it kind of strikes a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.440 
I think it like it kind of strikes a
little<00:02:54.830> bit<00:02:54.950> if<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.940> don't<00:02:55.970> apply<00:02:56.330> it

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
little bit if you don't apply it

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.350 
little bit if you don't apply it
smoothly<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:57.500> go<00:02:57.740> to<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:58.100> same<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:59.000> kind<00:02:59.300> of

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
smoothly and go to the same it kind of

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.420 
smoothly and go to the same it kind of
strikes<00:02:59.690> but<00:03:00.410> we're<00:03:00.680> all<00:03:00.800> I<00:03:00.830> think<00:03:01.250> they're

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
strikes but we're all I think they're

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.070 
strikes but we're all I think they're
