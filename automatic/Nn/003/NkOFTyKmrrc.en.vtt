00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
show them the like in in this case we

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.920 
show them the like in in this case we
are<00:03:44.340> having<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.670> six<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:45.000> diamonds<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.420> we

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
are having the six of diamonds so we

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.840 
are having the six of diamonds so we
don't<00:03:46.140> have<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.410> flash<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:46.830> six<00:03:47.220> six<00:03:47.640> of

don't have to flash a six six of
diamonds<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.330> make<00:03:48.510> sure<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:48.840> okay<00:03:49.860> so<00:03:50.240> just

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
diamonds to make sure that okay so just

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.280 
diamonds to make sure that okay so just
take<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.810> top<00:03:52.850> deck<00:03:53.850> over<00:03:54.810> six<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.200> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
take the top deck over six of the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.080 
take the top deck over six of the
diamonds<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.100> spread<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.090> like<00:03:57.240> this<00:03:57.420> like<00:03:58.200> so

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
diamonds and spread it like this like so

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.180 
diamonds and spread it like this like so
okay<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.450> they<00:04:01.080> don't<00:04:01.320> see<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.830> six<00:04:02.040> of

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
okay so they don't see the six of

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.790 
okay so they don't see the six of
diamonds<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:02.700> like<00:04:02.880> this<00:04:03.120> tell<00:04:04.050> them<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.440> we

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
diamonds so like this tell them that we

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.630 
diamonds so like this tell them that we
roughly<00:04:05.730> cut<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.120> back<00:04:06.360> in<00:04:06.510> half<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.640> then

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
roughly cut this back in half and then

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.000 
roughly cut this back in half and then
what<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:08.940> have<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.060> do<00:04:09.300> is<00:04:09.770> inverse<00:04:10.770> this

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
what you have to do is inverse this

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.370 
what you have to do is inverse this
bottom<00:04:11.580> back<00:04:11.760> but<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.990> have<00:04:13.110> to<00:04:13.260> do

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
bottom back but this you have to do

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
bottom back but this you have to do
under<00:04:13.560> this<00:04:13.890> fan<00:04:14.190> spread<00:04:14.700> friend<00:04:15.320> so<00:04:16.400> spread

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
under this fan spread friend so spread

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.190 
under this fan spread friend so spread
this<00:04:17.580> cards<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.799> inverse<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.950> back<00:04:20.130> like<00:04:20.459> so

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
this cards and inverse the back like so

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.350 
this cards and inverse the back like so
you<00:04:22.200> put<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.530> here<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:23.040> then<00:04:23.210> ask<00:04:24.210> the

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
you put it here and then ask the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.820 
you put it here and then ask the
spectator<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:24.870> what<00:04:25.229> is<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.440> probability

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
spectator that what is the probability

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.990 
spectator that what is the probability
of<00:04:26.010> getting<00:04:26.100> four

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
of getting four

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.290 
of getting four
means<00:04:27.150> from<00:04:27.360> this<00:04:27.510> many<00:04:27.720> cards<00:04:28.080> okay<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.670> why

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
means from this many cards okay and why

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.360 
means from this many cards okay and why
you<00:04:30.360> are<00:04:30.480> doing<00:04:30.570> this<00:04:30.810> make<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.680> break<00:04:32.130> under

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
you are doing this make a break under

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.010 
you are doing this make a break under
the<00:04:32.430> top<00:04:32.640> four<00:04:32.880> cards<00:04:33.090> which<00:04:33.600> are<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.810> 4

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020

like so then what you have to do is take

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.790 
like so then what you have to do is take
a<00:04:47.610> small<00:04:47.850> portion<00:04:48.510> of<00:04:48.750> cards<00:04:49.200> below<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.560> break

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
a small portion of cards below the break

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.020 
a small portion of cards below the break
half<00:04:51.080> roughly<00:04:52.080> half<00:04:52.410> you<00:04:52.620> will<00:04:52.770> take<00:04:52.920> half<00:04:53.160> put

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
half roughly half you will take half put

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.890 
half roughly half you will take half put
it<00:04:54.150> on<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.360> top<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:55.850> then<00:04:56.850> take<00:04:57.120> all<00:04:57.420> the
