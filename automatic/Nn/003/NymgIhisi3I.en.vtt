00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:04.069 
right here your sinus communis okay

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.380 
right here your sinus communis okay
these<00:00:05.069> are<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.279> leaves<00:00:05.520> that<00:00:05.790> come<00:00:06.000> up<00:00:06.210> the

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
these are the leaves that come up the

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.480 
these are the leaves that come up the
first<00:00:06.600> so<00:00:07.020> they<00:00:07.109> have<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.319> seed<00:00:07.560> leaves<00:00:07.799> and

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
first so they have the seed leaves and

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.830 
first so they have the seed leaves and
then<00:00:08.639> once<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.000> other<00:00:09.120> leaves<00:00:09.389> begin<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
then once the other leaves begin the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.959 
then once the other leaves begin the
true<00:00:10.019> leaves<00:00:10.200> begin<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.530> pop<00:00:10.769> out<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.219> began

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
true leaves begin to pop out you began

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.240 
true leaves begin to pop out you began
to<00:00:12.120> see<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.450> real<00:00:14.269> distinct<00:00:15.269> palmate<00:00:16.220> lobing

sorry yes so the five to eleven and then
you<00:00:55.440> notice<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:59.280> plant<00:00:59.579> will

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you notice that the the plant will

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.220 
you notice that the the plant will
actually<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.510> somewhere<00:01:01.050> between

fertilization okay
then<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.869> notice<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.630> actual<00:01:16.439> stem<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
then you notice that the actual stem is

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.060 
then you notice that the actual stem is
sort<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.640> reddish<00:01:17.909> pinkish<00:01:18.689> color<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
sort of a reddish pinkish color and the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.350 
sort of a reddish pinkish color and the
petioles<00:01:21.000> are<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> same<00:01:21.450> way<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:23.360> venation

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
petioles are the same way the venation

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.310 
petioles are the same way the venation
in<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> actual<00:01:26.060> leaf<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.509> same<00:01:27.750> wing<00:01:28.049> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
in the actual leaf is the same wing and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.780 
in the actual leaf is the same wing and
in<00:01:28.920> fact<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.369> fly<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.880> leaves<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.790> castor

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
in fact the fly the leaves on the castor

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.219 
in fact the fly the leaves on the castor
bean<00:01:32.939> will<00:01:33.090> eventually<00:01:33.509> become<00:01:33.689> sort<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
bean will eventually become sort of a

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.660 
bean will eventually become sort of a
reddish<00:01:34.409> color<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.860> entire<00:01:35.100> plant<00:01:35.400> will<00:01:35.549> be

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
reddish color the entire plant will be

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.440 
reddish color the entire plant will be
basically<00:01:36.060> our<00:01:36.299> radish<00:01:36.600> cast<00:01:37.520> all<00:01:38.520> right<00:01:38.670> once

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
basically our radish cast all right once

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.149 
basically our radish cast all right once
you<00:01:39.540> get<00:01:39.659> done<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.740> flower

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you get done with that you have a flower

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.080 
you get done with that you have a flower
structure<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.790> will<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.000> sort<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
structure that will be sort of a a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.840 
structure that will be sort of a a
terminal<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.240> flowers<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.350> where<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> male

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
terminal of flowers that where the male

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.450 
terminal of flowers that where the male
flowers<00:01:48.360> will

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
flowers will

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.890 
flowers will
form<00:01:51.460> on<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.729> bottom<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.240> particular

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
form on the bottom of that particular

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.899 
form on the bottom of that particular
terminal<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.920> female<00:01:54.310> flowers<00:01:54.729> will

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
terminal and the female flowers will

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.550 
terminal and the female flowers will
form<00:01:55.180> at<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.420> top<00:01:56.400> which<00:01:57.400> helps<00:01:58.090> in

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
form at the top which helps in

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.020 
form at the top which helps in
cross-pollination<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.860> then<00:02:00.520> also<00:02:00.700> we

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
cross-pollination and then also we

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.990 
cross-pollination and then also we
notice<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:02.049> after<00:02:02.890> that<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.460> seed<00:02:03.759> are

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
notice that after that the seed are

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.660 
notice that after that the seed are
created<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:04.930> they'll<00:02:05.080> be<00:02:05.229> about<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:06.460> bit

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
created and they'll be about that bit

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.219 
created and they'll be about that bit
the<00:02:06.850> pod<00:02:07.060> about<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.540> big<00:02:07.720> around

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
the pod about that big around

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.960 
the pod about that big around
that's<00:02:08.470> real<00:02:08.770> prickly<00:02:09.190> it's<00:02:09.369> got<00:02:09.520> prickles

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
that's real prickly it's got prickles

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.540 
that's real prickly it's got prickles
all<00:02:10.090> over<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:11.500> will<00:02:11.739> start<00:02:12.160> out<00:02:12.280> sort

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
all over it and it will start out sort

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.460 
all over it and it will start out sort
of<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.700> greenish<00:02:12.970> color<00:02:13.140> ending<00:02:14.140> up<00:02:14.290> at<00:02:14.440> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
same color red as the rest of the plant

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.580 
same color red as the rest of the plant
castor<00:02:18.700> beans<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.930> entire<00:02:20.200> plant

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
castor beans and the entire plant

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.190 
castor beans and the entire plant
basically<00:02:21.069> is<00:02:21.160> poisonous<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.360> in<00:02:22.810> fact<00:02:22.870> if

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
basically is poisonous and it in fact if

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.080 
basically is poisonous and it in fact if
you<00:02:23.320> eat<00:02:23.620> maybe<00:02:24.280> through<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.580> couple<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
you eat maybe through a couple of the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.530 
you eat maybe through a couple of the
seed<00:02:25.330> your<00:02:25.570> odds<00:02:26.380> are<00:02:26.620> good<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:26.950> you'll<00:02:27.540> pass

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
seed your odds are good that you'll pass

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.949 
seed your odds are good that you'll pass
away<00:02:28.840> from<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:30.209> nipple<00:02:31.209> arise<00:02:31.600> in<00:02:31.840> this

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
away from this nipple arise in this

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.460 
away from this nipple arise in this
manner<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.590> believe<00:02:33.489> that's<00:02:33.640> correct

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.140 

well<00:02:38.470> no<00:02:38.680> it'll<00:02:39.100> eventually<00:02:39.340> become<00:02:39.790> darker

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
well no it'll eventually become darker

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.630 
well no it'll eventually become darker
than<00:02:40.300> this<00:02:40.420> yeah<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.680> much<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:42.250> little<00:02:42.550> bit

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
than this yeah so much a little bit

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.690 
than this yeah so much a little bit
darker<00:02:42.940> red<00:02:43.150> okay
