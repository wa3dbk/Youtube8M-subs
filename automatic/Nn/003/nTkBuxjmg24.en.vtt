privatization of state education but

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.260 
privatization of state education but
also<00:01:06.970> be<00:01:07.540> much<00:01:08.140> more<00:01:08.290> soon<00:01:08.760> cynically<00:01:09.760> i<00:01:09.909> think

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
also be much more soon cynically i think

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.830 
also be much more soon cynically i think

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
is to create social segregation i think

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.289 
is to create social segregation i think
it's<00:01:13.960> an<00:01:14.049> explicit<00:01:14.530> policy<00:01:14.680> in<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.340> Academy's

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
it's an explicit policy in the Academy's

it's an explicit policy in the Academy's
bill<00:01:16.540> is<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.200> create<00:01:17.590> this<00:01:17.680> notion<00:01:18.009> of<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.729> you

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
bill is to create this notion of the you

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.700 
bill is to create this notion of the you
know<00:01:19.329> there<00:01:19.659> are<00:01:19.689> the<00:01:20.020> best<00:01:20.200> schools<00:01:20.530> which

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710

are the academies and the rest and that

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.529 
are the academies and the rest and that
is<00:01:23.229> serious<00:01:24.219> social<00:01:24.609> segregation<00:01:24.759> as<00:01:25.420> the

system that's why there's a long tail of

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.630 
system that's why there's a long tail of
underachievement<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:42.130> these<00:01:42.280> proposals

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640
