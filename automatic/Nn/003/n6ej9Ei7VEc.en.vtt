 thousands of young nayaritas 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.660
 seek to enter the universities of the state autonomous nayarit 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.039
 and the technological institute of tepic 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.340
 they are the schools with the highest demand 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.720
 because of its prestige and above all 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.140
 because offer not a greater number of careers that interest young people 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.469
 in the tec for example 1500 young people took out a file to present their 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:34.900
 entrance examination 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.100
 of which 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.050
 only 1200 came to do it 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.760
 so that finally only 900 have the opportunity to enter this 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.800
 institution 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 considered one of the best in the whole country in educational quality press 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 pure life that a soccer player has 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.450
 that fame of being the educational association of the highest academic level in the 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.580
 state 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.100
 the federal judge kevin his students the transmitter this institution we are 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.910
 talking about 75% income to the institution and 25% that will remain 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:08.390
 outside 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.540
 lawns this percentage 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.570
 we're talking about the whole race in general 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.590
 Yesterday, however, José Carreras who have 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.490
 an acceptance index of a neighborhood default of 95% for sale 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.290
 8% that almost 100% of the students who take the exam enter 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.300
 this because they are races put around finally have a lot of demand 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.560
 the middle reinsurer of the most federal crying one out are civil engineering 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.690
 and architecture 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.690
 it was a normal technological side race and if we're talking 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.980
 pd2 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.520
 since all of them keep 30% of the students 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.249
 in the case of the autonomous university in them 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:53.259
 of the 7 thousand young aspirants to enter this year to the various 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.440
 faculties 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.000
 only 40% manage to do so, said the federation leader 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.270
 of students of the uaem angel aldrete lamas in mexico only 30% of 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.520
 young people who aspire to enter the months of July and achieve income 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:14.319
 the medium is a different case nayarit we managed peter a coverage of 40% by 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.049
 the autonomous in adhering 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.659
 these young people wait for the facilities of the waters to be 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.259
 received by the leader 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.660
 two universities one public and one private 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.529
 offer their careers 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.749
 but it is an option that sometimes 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.749
 their families can not afford 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.659
 that is terrible done 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.949
 communication and media 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.899
 sometimes as it is a saturated race because yes 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:45.129
 It was complicated 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.459
 Well yes it is very requested and 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.109
 there were very few spaces 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.369
 not enough 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:53.909
 it will not be better 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.639
 unfold another year because it is very serious 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.209
 he parked the plan 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.979
 in the bread circuit 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.979
 the private one and after the publication the mind 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.389
 9 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.089
 look for any university that was to reach me 6 continue to work and 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.089
 and that of walking 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.069
 have put and why then it almost reaches the goal in sixth 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.699
 days 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.209
 then you can go locke in elda and present it 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:26.749
 the impossibility of power 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:30.679
 accommodate me to the university that you are public and you will not like 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:33.959
 lacking money that says exam in the autonomous university of madrid 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.859
 we should not also see the Cuban woman seek support 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.489
 additional that are giving dividends not 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.009
 the institution 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:44.349
 for the students 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.289
 from the precedent 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:48.749
 consists in 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:49.909
 in seeing 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.179
 how many points stand in the last third 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:04:00.509
 i can say that the return to some achieve is more expensive to the second and if 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:09.729
 you are in a blue stripe, kings jealousy can give themselves water 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.489
 is because they do not reach the level of knowledge required by both 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.799
 institutions 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.019
 at the technological institute of tepic the expectations of your health 2 of 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.129
 get a job 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:22.439
 once they graduate they are great 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:24.999
 Well, of every ten engineers in Mexico 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:28.059
 four are graduates of the country's technological institutes 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.639
 when the mills a month the most morbid despite the shortcomings that 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.370
 we have 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.970
 because we really are a system that has a little dot left for us 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.080
 system where we have many needs 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.949
 we have many needs 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.969
 p however I think that he engineers that 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.879
 we wish you of these institutions we have very bad situation of the field 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:51.819
 labor 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.940
 shortage of economic resources 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.370
 sometimes 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.790
 is another of the obstacles that young people have to face 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.280
 the inscription in the technological of tepic for those of new entrance is of 2 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:06.020
 thousand 400 pesos 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.689
 and decreases its cost 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.029
 up to 2 thousand pesos as the semesters progress 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.970
 the high cost is due to the lack of support from the federal government that last year 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.870
 contributed a single peso to this institute 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.889
 the one despite being a public school charges new students 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.560
 a registration fee of 904 pesos 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.639
 without the possibility of cancellation the most demanded faculties 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.650
 are the medicine and law is good the most demanded careers are the 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.550
 school of medicine school of nursing in school 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.039
 odontology 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.830
 the skeletal pharmacobiologist the area of ​​health 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.340
 but in the area of ​​social and humanities in law school it is 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.750
 a career that also have a certain volume how much of 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.750
 rejected education sciences psychology 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.999
 practically in the area of ​​social and humanities we have a diversity of 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:04.220
 races that are very sought after by young nayarites in the public 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:08.300
 administrative we have a great capacity to accept boys for that and 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.110
 not in tehran problematic are more those who enter the air with a permit 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.550
 active because the capacity of the largest each year the institutions of 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.780
 upper and upper middle level 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.010
 face this problem of lack of space 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.759
 thousands of young people are left literally flying 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:29.969
 discouraged by the lack of opportunities and without life project 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:33.080
 some become in the already famous ninis 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.249
 by not studying or working 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:38.740
 being thus easy prey of organized crime 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.430
 of vices such as drug addiction and alcohol 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.150
 and gangs is why both the autonomous university of 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.869
 nayarit 

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:49.609
 as the technological institute of tepic seek ways to support the 

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:53.839
 young people as well as stimulating those who are already part of their 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:57.949
 rows is really a much thinner problem this situation 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.419
 pd however here our institute 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.169
 we have a system 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:07.870
 of that percentage of students who remain who enters the first semester on 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.110
 technological has a program 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.370
 in which would be more in the third in just one month you will enter semester zero if 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.849
 the state is due to the high academic level because under that they do not give good 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:22.449
 academic performance however in that semester zero we entered instead of 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:26.129
 zero are helped to level themselves and subsequently the semester will be 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:30.080
 Begin to speak semester if they meet the requirements set by the semester 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.520
 zero 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.469
 there are very low income students additional institution 

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:37.169
 we have a stimulus to an agreement for your health to promote a 

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:39.129
 deep do not abandon their studies 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:40.669
 this does not deserve it 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.740
 erviti took the request 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.449
 that did last week 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:47.820
 it is during this week the results were delivered and the 

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:51.279
 ball for the week people anticipated those banks get 

00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:55.059
 at 25 '50% discount 

00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:57.949
 a value on whether I did not want to make the selection according to a study 

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:00.719
 socioeconomic we are right now she 

00:08:00.719 --> 00:08:05.599
 seeking to respect the increase at least high inflation by 

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:07.229
 course our university 

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:11.490
 the one that maintains that upward rhythm that has been performing in the 

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.110
 college
