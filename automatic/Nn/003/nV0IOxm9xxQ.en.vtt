00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.620
 Well look what we said simple 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:10.150
 nice good cheap see nothing else 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.769
 We will give the list of materials for 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.900
 the first craft is nothing that does not 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.900
 have at home 6 that we are going to hear them 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.279
 for recyclable napkin holders 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.140
 we need toilet paper roll 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.580
 rope 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.960
 colored beads 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.609
 gun and silicon bars 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.230
 notice that now I understand why the other 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.199
 day you are so kind by letting 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.649
 all to the harm is that in a series of 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.940
 guest charges napkin rings and or 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.040
 truth is that they surprised me 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.190
 super good so I go by the 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.309
 scissors yes the truth that these 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.829
 underpants that are often 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.949
 waste you know which ones of the 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.649
 usual in the kitchen with those we kill 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.720
 taking his 34 paper roll 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.980
 bath is flat on occasion 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.259
 small but it's basically cut it 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.560
 the size of a napkin holder with a 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.420
 cutter so that it looks similar and 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.160
 what we are going to do is cover it with 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.160
 we can put a little bit 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.490
 and from there we start with silicone 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.540
 long because it's going to go like 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.540
 I thought you wanted nothing more 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.740
 and I do not know anymore 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.600
 I think it's best that we cut 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.830
 little he 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.190
 for the goal of not to not be 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.920
 so that we are not entangled 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.120
 and I really think it's already 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.320
 finished this does not seem to have been 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.670
 before point toilet paper 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.560
 and what we are going to do is once 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.300
 is finished let's go decorating with 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.150
 the accounts that we have what yes 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.350
 convenient because sometimes we are 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.480
 outside that they can also be like 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.370
 no different to me but I can think 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.220
 that we can also paint the cardboard 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.010
 so that there is a gap we those 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.930
 Hollow said that they are the same 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.530
 Lifting designs created by the box 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.420
 it was red if you find one more 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.569
 interesting the box that made us please 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.319
 to bring viviano 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.319
 the truth 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:30.240
 and notice that when I though because if 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.240
 woman 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.450
 online 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.220
 notice that I'm given that and then the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:46.180
 charged not much and that's a typical there 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:50.140
 I know where it is marta turn colorless pol 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.110
 where the twist twisted the tail 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.880
 sow lucybell ravolamanana direct 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.570
 loose also clariant not good 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.239
 numbers in red with says and not maybe 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.700
 some more color nobody with highlight look 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.670
 while you decide the menu that bo 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.560
 that suggestions are accepted and what kind of 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.140
 angel kitchen and it's not going to stay 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.370
 this would be the game for our dinner 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.430
 be a prey in the romantic essay 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.280
 very well I'm going to diets have a lot 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.490
 they gave check nothing more 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.920
 little by little not the last thing you would think is that 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.440
 This is made with a small carton of 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.810
 toilet paper 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.090
 and let's go back to something in the world of what 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.890
 gives us the truth is that we are already very 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.670
 polluted by that climate change 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.670
 because 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.990
 like Friday of fortnight and the traffic 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.890
 already with that pollution 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.890
 we have 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.380
 we can go hitting this to give us a 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.840
 idea 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.080
 you like the design you choose, you prefer 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.820
 put something else like that 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.110
 contrast in the colors of those two me 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.630
 like 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.170
 with your we could put say to the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:09.700
 center to which we put a 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.550
 little bit more silicon silicon 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.830
 it's like that i would say it 's ours 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.579
 ally an ally of truth that for almost 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:21.359
 we all need is part of the space 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.359
 creative already 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:26.080
 we are placing a little and so we are going 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:27.939
 making the decoration 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.560
 It's like a little flower, not what you did 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:32.169
 well speaking this seems like a whole 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.620
 and this is over but I think that 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:38.020
 this is going to look like a flower like 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.490
 it was a kind of sunflower and it serves 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.490
 to give the contrast of the colors 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.680
 you can again use the material that 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.810
 have at hand or the accounts that you 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.780
 have the colors that you like or 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:55.350
 that also combine that you agree 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.919
 to the table or it occurs to me that I also 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:03.120
 they can put seeds 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:07.850
 little seeds I put some coffee seeds 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.850
 etcetera is super nice 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.639
 so while we follow them 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.720
 because we are not going step by step 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.930
 I like how everything is 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.940
 processing mode cut the roll by 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.560
 half and begins to entangle the rope 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.140
 in the roll so as to cover it 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.870
 completely ending with a little bit of 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.880
 silicon to hold the beads 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.500
 giving the figure of your choice and your 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.770
 Napkin holder will be ready 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.060
 so do you think yes while 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.700
 we are here organizing already what 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.010
 from the table while I'm going to do anything 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:50.760
 more and from there I ordered a pizza or I ordered some 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.760
 tacos to the corner does not merit a sand 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.700
 let's go a short cut back with more 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.700
 of creative space
