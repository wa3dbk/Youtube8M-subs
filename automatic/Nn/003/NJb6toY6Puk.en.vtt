00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:15.309
 Hello in the parish show how they are the 30 days of sparing Windows Vista 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.429
 and Windows 7 on 7 can not be that you on the basis of Windows 7 the 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.099
 Worth the evaluation phase 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.300
 The clock entering a correct key is only 30 days workable 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.329
 It is the same with Windows Vista, and so it probably will be 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.609
 with the finished version of Windows Vista 7 so this is mine 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.340
 Windows 7 and which subject very briefly in the control panel 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.400
 Bernhard who and fence Tan voters next 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.900
 System and 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.900
 security 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.010
 Sacramento here normal system 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.080
 Konami rounds out the information Windows activation Mira currently remain 30 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.080
 Days for activation 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.370
 now it is relatively logical that any Sabers and citizens and which 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.330
 files 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.290
 waking up over this period of time so far they just want to locate that 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.040
 We have to switch off the service and rename or delete the files 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.090
 Let's take a look at the SpVgg first, then worry about it 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.410
 the consequences 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.180
 Finally, that their reputation replace 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.010
 through the Control Panel the Serviced it is out of that 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.110
 system and safety 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 administration 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.290
 services 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.710
 Here we are still looking for a service called 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.610
 it is 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.780
 PP 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.780
 notification service 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.010
 Dittmann Prof SPP notification service in the 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.960
 Description stands 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.809
 Zoff provides license activation and notification 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.809
 the state should practice putting us in the activated 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.949
 and then we end the service here too 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.799
 by the click 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.679
 wait on the walls after this is done the service ever 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:23.029
 disabled 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:25.969
 Now we just have to take care of the appropriate files 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.879
 Of course you can not support this with Windows 7 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.329
 or Windows Vista do we need a boot cd I'm taking here now 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.159
 simply an oboe concert epd which is in the drive in and in the bodhran full 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.159
 is that set? 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.200
 So for the boys, I will restart Windows 7 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.829
 so now the destination around drive can choose 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.249
 TISPOL percent 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.249
 Live version of Ubuntu 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:16.039
 under Ubuntu who succeeded directly on and percent 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:21.399
 then here we have our medion that is my hard drive is of course one 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.399
 small hard drive is here but only a virtual machine 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.919
 if it is on it will not be integrated here I have now 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.209
 Structure of windows users can be sure this time in the windows folder 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:39.609
 Practitioner one we also need new system 32 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.449
 the animal 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.999
 and from this directory we are now looking for three very specific files 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.999
 out and that is the first file 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.649
 July point AXA for lead to accomplish accomplish 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:59.109
 User interface, then 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.109
 SN 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.019
 SL Uli point AXA 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:15.139
 Zurich Mischa we are here now 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.139
 Of course you can only rename them 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.130
 next we need the file SPP same 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.499
 SPP 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.529
 SPP SV c-point witch 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:47.650
 we push 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.710
 and will come next 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.860
 SPP User Interface notified points increased 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300
 this is the third and last party 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:02.349
 People 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.360
 can shoot here in the timeline 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.360
 unmount the volume 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.979
 restart the computer 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.039
 lure you so fast 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.360
 why and turn off the power 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.139
 mystery 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.119
 system 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:04.899
 and here and there Mesa Windows activation status is not available 

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:10.689
 Windows 7 can not detect whether it has already been registered or not
