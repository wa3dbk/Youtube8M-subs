damage to their pair in their cherries

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.730 
damage to their pair in their cherries
and<00:00:08.019> from<00:00:09.019> what<00:00:09.169> they've<00:00:09.289> told<00:00:09.499> me<00:00:09.650> it<00:00:09.709> sounds

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
and from what they've told me it sounds

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.560 
and from what they've told me it sounds
like<00:00:09.950> pear<00:00:10.190> and<00:00:10.339> cherry<00:00:10.549> slug<00:00:10.849> which<00:00:11.419> will

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
like pear and cherry slug which will

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.730 
like pear and cherry slug which will
generally<00:00:11.990> get<00:00:12.309> I<00:00:13.309> could<00:00:14.199> start<00:00:15.199> a<00:00:15.289> January

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
generally get I could start a January

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.860 
generally get I could start a January
now<00:00:15.980> you'll<00:00:16.880> usually<00:00:17.150> get<00:00:17.480> it<00:00:17.630> they<00:00:17.810> will

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:17.870 
now you'll usually get it they will

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.890 
now you'll usually get it they will
probably<00:00:18.290> pop<00:00:18.440> up<00:00:18.620> in<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:20.450> southern

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
probably pop up in the southern

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.170 
probably pop up in the southern
hemisphere<00:00:21.350> anyway<00:00:22.040> they'll<00:00:22.610> generally<00:00:22.910> pop

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
hemisphere anyway they'll generally pop

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.090 
hemisphere anyway they'll generally pop
up<00:00:23.300> about<00:00:23.540> November<00:00:24.170> you'll<00:00:24.620> see<00:00:24.830> them<00:00:24.950> you'll

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
up about November you'll see them you'll

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.530 
up about November you'll see them you'll
get<00:00:25.190> that<00:00:25.340> damage<00:00:25.700> and<00:00:25.880> then<00:00:26.240> they<00:00:26.330> might

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
get that damage and then they might

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.210 
get that damage and then they might
continue<00:00:26.900> on<00:00:27.200> if<00:00:27.350> you<00:00:27.470> spray<00:00:27.740> em<00:00:27.890> they'll<00:00:28.040> go

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
continue on if you spray em they'll go

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.920 
continue on if you spray em they'll go
but<00:00:28.490> they'll<00:00:28.640> generally<00:00:29.060> come<00:00:29.240> back<00:00:29.390> January

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
but they'll generally come back January

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.990 
but they'll generally come back January
February<00:00:30.140> to<00:00:30.620> have<00:00:30.740> a<00:00:30.770> bit<00:00:30.950> of<00:00:30.980> a<00:00:31.100> double<00:00:31.520> cycle

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
February to have a bit of a double cycle

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.720 
February to have a bit of a double cycle
so<00:00:32.230> what<00:00:33.230> you<00:00:33.350> can<00:00:33.530> do<00:00:33.740> is<00:00:33.890> make<00:00:34.130> up<00:00:34.160> a<00:00:34.370> mix<00:00:34.579> of

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
so what you can do is make up a mix of

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.340 
so what you can do is make up a mix of
lime<00:00:34.970> and<00:00:35.000> water<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:35.750> paint<00:00:35.930> then<00:00:36.140> around

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
lime and water and paint then around

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.290 
lime and water and paint then around
trunks<00:00:36.860> of<00:00:36.980> trees<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.670> I'll<00:00:37.790> great<00:00:38.060> guide

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
trunks of trees and I'll great guide

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.030 
trunks of trees and I'll great guide
told<00:00:38.600> me<00:00:38.750> about<00:00:38.840> that<00:00:38.989> once<00:00:39.320> I've<00:00:39.500> never<00:00:39.770> tried

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
told me about that once I've never tried

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.530 
told me about that once I've never tried
it<00:00:40.100> but<00:00:40.370> apparently<00:00:40.489> it<00:00:40.910> works<00:00:41.090> because<00:00:41.390> they

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
it but apparently it works because they

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.319 
it but apparently it works because they
do<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:42.620> larvae<00:00:43.280> lives<00:00:43.520> in<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.760> ground<00:00:44.000> and

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
do the larvae lives in the ground and

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:45.610 
do the larvae lives in the ground and
when<00:00:44.420> they<00:00:44.570> come<00:00:44.750> up<00:00:44.899> and<00:00:45.020> climb<00:00:45.200> up<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.470> tree

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
when they come up and climb up the tree

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.080 
when they come up and climb up the tree
they<00:00:45.739> can't<00:00:45.980> get<00:00:46.160> over<00:00:46.399> the<00:00:46.489> line<00:00:46.670> for<00:00:46.940> some

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
they can't get over the line for some

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.760 
they can't get over the line for some
reason<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:47.570> I'll<00:00:47.750> give<00:00:47.930> that<00:00:47.960> a<00:00:48.110> go<00:00:48.350> one<00:00:48.560> day

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
reason so I'll give that a go one day

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.420 
reason so I'll give that a go one day
but<00:00:49.579> this<00:00:50.120> is<00:00:50.180> a<00:00:50.329> tree<00:00:50.600> that's<00:00:50.750> been<00:00:50.960> damaged

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
but this is a tree that's been damaged

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.870 
but this is a tree that's been damaged
by<00:00:52.430> parent<00:00:52.910> cherry<00:00:53.120> slug<00:00:53.390> now<00:00:54.020> you<00:00:54.140> can<00:00:54.380> see

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
by parent cherry slug now you can see

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.420 
by parent cherry slug now you can see
how<00:00:55.880> to<00:00:55.940> leave<00:00:56.290> almost<00:00:57.290> vein<00:00:57.680> like<00:00:57.980> they'll

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
how to leave almost vein like they'll

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.180 
how to leave almost vein like they'll
brown<00:00:58.760> off<00:00:59.000> because<00:00:59.239> they<00:00:59.420> basically<00:00:59.930> eat<00:01:00.290> the

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
brown off because they basically eat the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.670 
brown off because they basically eat the
top<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:01.670> bottom<00:01:02.239> layer<00:01:02.630> of<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.989> lease<00:01:03.230> so

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
top and bottom layer of the lease so

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.930 
top and bottom layer of the lease so
it's<00:01:03.860> like<00:01:04.040> if<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.309> was<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.460> same<00:01:04.729> which

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
it's like if it was the same which

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.430 
it's like if it was the same which
they're<00:01:05.150> basically<00:01:05.449> eating<00:01:05.870> the<00:01:05.960> bread<00:01:06.200> and

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
they're basically eating the bread and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.560 
they're basically eating the bread and
leaving<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.799> filling<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:07.940> I<00:01:08.030> can<00:01:08.210> show<00:01:08.510> you

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
leaving the filling and I can show you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:16.149 
leaving the filling and I can show you
one<00:01:08.900> here<00:01:10.060> if<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.210> can<00:01:11.360> see<00:01:12.020> it<00:01:14.830> France<00:01:15.830> like

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
one here if you can see it France like

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.870 
one here if you can see it France like
there

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
there

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.980 
there
appear<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.840> cherry<00:01:19.079> slow<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.780> that's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
appear in a cherry slow you go so that's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.660 
appear in a cherry slow you go so that's
basically<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:22.740> will<00:01:22.829> happen<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.399> you'll<00:01:23.549> get

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
basically what will happen so you'll get

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.899 
basically what will happen so you'll get
all<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:23.969> kind<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.299> damage<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:26.009> leaf<00:01:26.220> brown

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
all this kind of damage the leaf brown

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.010 
all this kind of damage the leaf brown
off<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.210> come<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> tree<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.390> even<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.810> drop

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
off we come on a tree and even just drop

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.550 
off we come on a tree and even just drop
off<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:32.310> that's<00:01:32.429> when<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.729> need<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.909> spray<00:01:33.299> on

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
off so that's when you need to spray on

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.249 
off so that's when you need to spray on
you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.770> use<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:36.000> you're<00:01:36.210> inclined<00:01:36.929> to<00:01:37.200> use

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you can use if you're inclined to use

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.529 
you can use if you're inclined to use
commercial<00:01:38.130> sprays<00:01:38.429> carbaryl<00:01:38.970> stuff<00:01:39.360> like

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
commercial sprays carbaryl stuff like

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.529 
commercial sprays carbaryl stuff like
that<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.369> don't<00:01:41.369> use<00:01:41.520> them<00:01:41.640> myself<00:01:41.819> try<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> keep

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
that I don't use them myself try to keep

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.389 
that I don't use them myself try to keep
everything<00:01:42.840> organic<00:01:43.439> see<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.860> make<00:01:44.100> up<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
everything organic see and make up the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.460 
everything organic see and make up the
spray<00:01:45.619> generally<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:47.130> soap<00:01:47.729> spray<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.990> garlic

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
spray generally a soap spray with garlic

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
and things like that will work it can be

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.520 
and things like that will work it can be
