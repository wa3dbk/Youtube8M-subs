It's time to do something about that nonsense.
Lets see what I have over here in my scrap

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.650
bin. This might work. A half inch piece of
ply. Not sure where it came from or why it's

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.650
here, but I'll certainly put it to use. This
project was actually a design plan that I

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.390
had posted on my website a few months back.
Head over there for a complete list of cuts, measurements and materials needed.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.660
I'm going to make this a little easier on the knuckles by rounding over the edges with a round over
bit.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.080
There is the backer board. Alright lets see what else I need.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.760
Couple of these.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.479
This
board here looks like it'll do.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.000
Lets rip that to the same width as the pieces that I just
cut.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.120
Then a couple of pieces to length.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.160
There are those, whatever, those are. Lets do some
shaping. Band saw. Your up.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.440
Smooth it out a little bit.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.880
The same round over bit that
I used earlier. I'll use again.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.100
Now we'll glue these together.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.820
And clamp. Can't forget
about that.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.400
A little saw dust to remove the glue squeeze out.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.080
If you haven't figured
it out yet. I'm just eyeballing this.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.140
Some screws from the backside for added security.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.460
Other side.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.100
I've decided to mount my DIY extension

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.120
cord holder to the back of my workstation.
But I could have just hung it on a nail on

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.040
the wall. It's your shop. Do what you want.
