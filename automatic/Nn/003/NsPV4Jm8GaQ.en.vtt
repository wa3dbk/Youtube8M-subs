00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
signals that went for like 98 I think a

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.690 
signals that went for like 98 I think a
while<00:01:43.820> back<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.330> sold<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.960> rear<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.400> site

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
while back I sold the rear of a site

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.120 
while back I sold the rear of a site
number<00:01:47.030> plates<00:01:47.270> therefore<00:01:48.049> anything<00:01:48.920> went

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
number plates therefore anything went

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.750 
number plates therefore anything went
490<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:49.960> basically<00:01:50.960> those<00:01:51.799> three<00:01:52.040> parts<00:01:52.460> paid

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
490 so basically those three parts paid

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.020 
490 so basically those three parts paid
for<00:01:53.000> this<00:01:53.119> entire<00:01:53.420> bike<00:01:54.490> so<00:01:55.490> that<00:01:55.700> gives<00:01:55.880> me

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
for this entire bike so that gives me

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.580 
for this entire bike so that gives me
more<00:01:56.180> leeway<00:01:56.420> when<00:01:56.869> building<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.320> so

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
more leeway when building this so

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.490 
more leeway when building this so
starting<00:01:58.430> from<00:01:58.490> 0<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:58.939> if<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.299> put<00:01:59.479> 1500<00:02:00.229> in<00:02:00.380> it

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
starting from 0 so if I put 1500 in it

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.770 
starting from 0 so if I put 1500 in it
that's<00:02:00.710> all<00:02:00.830> I<00:02:00.860> got

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
that's all I got

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.219 
that's all I got
I<00:02:01.840> don't<00:02:02.290> have<00:02:02.409> mm<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.220> or<00:02:03.490> whatever<00:02:04.229> and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
I don't have mm and or whatever and

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.969 
I don't have mm and or whatever and
hopefully<00:02:05.619> I<00:02:05.680> don't<00:02:05.860> like<00:02:06.100> 1500<00:02:06.970> in<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.240> but<00:02:07.979> if

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
hopefully I don't like 1500 in it but if

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.370 
hopefully I don't like 1500 in it but if
you<00:02:09.190> watch<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.369> 250f<00:02:10.119> videos<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.840> know<00:02:11.020> how

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
you watch the 250f videos you know how

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.250 
you watch the 250f videos you know how
that<00:02:11.440> goes<00:02:12.390> yeah<00:02:13.500> we'll<00:02:14.500> talk<00:02:14.680> about<00:02:14.740> that<00:02:16.260> so

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
that goes yeah we'll talk about that so

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.470 
that goes yeah we'll talk about that so
I'm<00:02:17.530> kind<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.800> waiting<00:02:17.950> on<00:02:18.160> all<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:19.540> dtae

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
I'm kind of waiting on all that the dtae

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.059 
I'm kind of waiting on all that the dtae
gonna<00:02:22.480> write<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:22.750> today<00:02:22.870> but<00:02:23.020> like<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.010> said

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.180 
fuel petcock but none of the repaint and
I<00:02:38.440> did<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.709> about<00:02:38.890> three<00:02:39.220> weeks<00:02:39.400> ago<00:02:39.519> and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
I did that about three weeks ago and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.280 
I did that about three weeks ago and
it's<00:02:42.190> fine<00:02:43.000> now<00:02:43.330> obviously<00:02:44.019> that's<00:02:44.200> not

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
it's fine now obviously that's not

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.050 
it's fine now obviously that's not
leaking<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.040> pain<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.430> fully<00:02:45.670> fully

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
leaking and that pain is fully fully

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.650 
leaking and that pain is fully fully
cured<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.620> looks<00:02:47.739> great<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.390> don't<00:02:49.390> want<00:02:49.600> to

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
cured so it looks great I don't want to

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.410 
cured so it looks great I don't want to
take<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.840> out<00:02:50.050> again<00:02:50.580> soon<00:02:51.640> it's<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.209> blast
