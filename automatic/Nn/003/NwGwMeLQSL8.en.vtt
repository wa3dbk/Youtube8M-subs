that<00:03:35.040> okay<00:03:36.040> well<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.400> thought<00:03:36.580> that<00:03:36.640> one<00:03:36.940> wasn't

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
that okay well I thought that one wasn't

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.900 
that okay well I thought that one wasn't
but<00:03:37.780> when<00:03:38.050> I<00:03:38.080> first<00:03:38.290> got<00:03:38.560> this<00:03:38.770> these<00:03:39.520> discs

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
but when I first got this these discs

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.380 
but when I first got this these discs
were<00:03:40.030> really<00:03:40.630> really<00:03:40.810> hard<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.260> get<00:03:41.380> out<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:43.330> I

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
were really really hard to get out and I

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.910 
were really really hard to get out and I
think<00:03:43.570> I<00:03:43.630> think<00:03:44.170> because<00:03:44.440> I've<00:03:44.560> taken<00:03:44.740> them

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
think I think because I've taken them

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.320 
think I think because I've taken them
out<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.070> few<00:03:45.130> times<00:03:45.400> they've<00:03:45.700> kind<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:45.940> worn<00:03:46.150> in

out a few times they've kind of worn in

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.210 
out a few times they've kind of worn in
which<00:03:46.960> is<00:03:47.170> good<00:03:47.380> but<00:03:47.620> I'm<00:03:47.830> when<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:47.980> first
