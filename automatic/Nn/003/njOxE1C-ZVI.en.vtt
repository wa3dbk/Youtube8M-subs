00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:07.360
 hello welcome saun and before today you 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:09.430
 I want to talk about the cache health node 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.490
 until now until now when we 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.410
 we wanted 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.120
 when we wanted now I would say 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.880
 integrate an object a scene 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.510
 we took the background image one 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.020
 video sequence as we would like 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:30.080
 and we give the floor 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.080
 and we apply the image in French mode 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.160
 and is activated to see the background 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:51.340
 good and now according to the hotel what 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:54.250
 we had already given it to render 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.110
 and we always had to match with the 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.110
 horizon the line of the object 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.690
 we give him 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.400
 baldwin de r 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.790
 we're going it this way with a 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.550
 very simple lighting was always 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.370
 pretty simple 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.550
 but at the moment we caught 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.800
 and we changed anything already 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.660
 I always went 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.510
 and then we had the problem that the 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.820
 because shadows were not made softer or 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.530
 darker and we always had to go 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.530
 playing with these parameters 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:46.310
 saying this now we have 12 the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.310
 tool is educated h 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.420
 which simply by adding the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.420
 material 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.240
 we have solved that next 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.660
 the import of enlighten us already 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.660
 respect the line 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.070
 if we remove in the nodes it is worth 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.170
 when rendering let's say when 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:23.590
 we want to render this automatically 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:29.410
 in the alpha triple we did all this 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:33.760
 cut to go to the ground and we had 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.159
 than mark the shadow density 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.629
 for simply in the render we 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:41.519
 will save the alpha channel if in the 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.519
 composition and let's do the rest 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.730
 now I do not know if with this node in 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.900
 concrete already directly when when 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.900
 the render 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.440
 and you automatically matches it 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.319
 and demand as if it were already on Saturday one 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.319
 density has mounted 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.400
 I've gone into the subject a lot with him 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.560
 this node but I think it's a great 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.240
 breakthrough when it comes to composition 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.240
 for video and such 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.270
 and good and you can change the type of 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.270
 light 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.940
 and always have 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.769
 this part already generated is an advance 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.260
 very good I hope you liked it 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:49.400
 this oral statut that a greeting to all 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.400
 from san mill√°n 3
