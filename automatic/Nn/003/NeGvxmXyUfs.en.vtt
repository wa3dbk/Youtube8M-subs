 Marechal Hermes line 261 to the square 15 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.460
 anderson luÃ­s who got in touch with 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.170
 our production and sent the videos there 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.949
 that we are seeing in the air in this 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.600
 time 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.460
 talking about problems in this 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.990
 line anderson picking up this bus 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.550
 almost every day to work in the center 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.160
 the city means you started to see 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.260
 these problems solved is to film 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.450
 register and sent us some 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.059
 time you've come to realize that this 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.050
 line is in trouble, boy, look there 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.660
 more than four years the company flood 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.420
 has been treating our passengers that you 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.160
 Do you have this unique link in the region that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.230
 follows the case of the people 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.090
 so what happens is that the years do not 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.100
 are adapted for wheelchair users with 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.570
 women can always say that it is one of the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.980
 problems that you noticed right away 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.510
 or by provocation if it shows a 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.309
 The bus here is already leaving. 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.189
 really what we can perceive 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.920
 this with the course of the report to 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.430
 people will show the buses do not have 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.290
 adaptation for the wheelchair that door 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.490
 book-object ricardo salvou showed 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.500
 has lift 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.990
 so we can observe there in those 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.950
 videos is the bus behaves that does not close 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.159
 vehicle panel is totally broken 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.409
 missing a piece and even made a 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.939
 recording a bank tied with wire 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.400
 end of line computer computer 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.799
 it is not because of the number 17 route of the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.240
 net bridge collector and you 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.220
 you may also notice that these 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.799
 historic setting of 101 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.970
 if there is a law that requires all 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.439
 years will run in the city of River 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.610
 January must have the seal of inspection 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.470
 of smtu 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.360
 many companies do not have is the only one that 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.869
 there are no people can see the panel as 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 the complaint by Anderson that he 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.509
 contact with the balance sheet of the situation 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.299
 panel that set of seven mistakes to 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.030
 If you do not think so, even a risk 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.670
 only to users as well as to 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.790
 bus person picks up the entire bus 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.790
 money 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.720
 he and so the basic problems of 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.240
 hygiene that I basically already got 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.230
 a beautiful road even to the bus station with 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.990
 my family 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.120
 the bus several times full of cockroaches 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.890
 full of cockroaches 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.480
 that of small ones coming out 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.730
 so much that once it has interrupted the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.340
 trip for exactly that I was very 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.620
 and we boarded one of the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.570
 line 261 to hear here very closely 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.060
 passengers on the complaint 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.250
 in this line but we left shortly after 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.740
 The final point we paid for now is 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.960
 hear the scolding of passengers to 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.260
 not one is not many fights 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.610
 passengers of line 261 is this 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.530
 It 's complicated here, let's sit there until 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.180
 for safety reasons not to 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.250
 disrupt the trip and also to 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.800
 get to talk to these passengers 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.780
 Come on, let's go, maria rosane, they're engaged. 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.720
 I always get this bus to talk 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.180
 first with a principal's gilmar 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.490
 problem for you here in the collective month 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.680
 on this bus line and the banks 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.600
 broken and right now and then 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.790
 late for work until you wake up 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.360
 early the buses break in the middle of the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.760
 way 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.640
 windows with all recorded we try 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.420
 open starts here looks and can not 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.690
 adjust in the heat even beating the sun and 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.550
 these exits of eight months do not 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.350
 they open it's kind of complicated 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.360
 one of the problems you always notice 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.910
 that the question of the door what happens is 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.550
 there are some conditions of this 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.810
 he had to push the copel with his own 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.430
 mother to get off the bus that 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.030
 they lock up we can not get down 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.650
 One moment the donut goes from her to 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.940
 bank situation here and we're done 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.680
 to catch a bus until now was 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.090
 speaking cent did not even realize it goes 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.150
 jumping now means almost takes the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.360
 bank was not me and bonet cent had not 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.070
 perceived how it was to jump to get the 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.980
 train, she said she was going to take 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.300
