00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
deck and let's say I cut it up and we

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.529 
deck and let's say I cut it up and we
can<00:00:44.219> mix<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.850> up<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:45.059> well<00:00:46.550> just<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
can mix it up as well just like that so

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.029 
can mix it up as well just like that so
your<00:00:48.840> cards<00:00:49.200> lost<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.710> deck

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
your cards lost in the deck

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.529 
your cards lost in the deck
I'm<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.280> exactly<00:00:50.550> sure<00:00:50.730> where<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.329> I'm

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
I'm not exactly sure where it is I'm

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.090 
I'm not exactly sure where it is I'm
going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> find<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.469> about<00:00:52.739> two

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
going to have to find it in about two

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.119 
going to have to find it in about two
seconds<00:00:53.579> but<00:00:54.360> before<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.079> let's<00:00:55.949> go

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
seconds but before I do that let's go

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.799 
seconds but before I do that let's go
ahead<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.520> use<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> rubber<00:00:56.940> band<00:00:57.090> since<00:00:57.690> I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
ahead and use a rubber band since I

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.630 
ahead and use a rubber band since I
don't<00:00:58.109> usually<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.829> use<00:00:59.010> these<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.340> any<00:00:59.489> of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
don't usually get to use these in any of

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.849 
don't usually get to use these in any of
my<00:00:59.789> tricks<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:01.020> rubber<00:01:01.199> band<00:01:01.379> trick<00:01:01.680> has

been requested so this is probably the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.929 
been requested so this is probably the
main<00:01:03.449> reason<00:01:03.480> why<00:01:03.960> I'm<00:01:04.140> doing<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.939> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.990 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut
the<00:01:25.350> deck<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.400> rubber<00:01:26.670> band<00:01:26.880> around

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the deck with the rubber band around

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.399 
the deck with the rubber band around
it's<00:01:27.360> something<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> don't<00:01:27.960> normally<00:01:28.049> do

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
it's something that I don't normally do

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.899 
it's something that I don't normally do

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.429 
so you can see the deck is getting cut
and<00:01:31.850> this<00:01:32.850> rubber<00:01:33.210> band<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> help<00:01:34.350> me

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.730 
think your card is just jump to the top
now<00:04:36.270> from<00:04:36.479> here<00:04:36.900> you're<00:04:37.409> going<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.620> do<00:04:37.710> a

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
now from here you're going to do a

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.320 
now from here you're going to do a
double<00:04:37.949> lift<00:04:38.219> because<00:04:38.430> their<00:04:38.729> card<00:04:38.939> really<00:04:39.180> is

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
double lift because their card really is

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330 
double lift because their card really is
on<00:04:39.509> top<00:04:39.719> so<00:04:40.379> all<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:40.710> do<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:40.919> you<00:04:40.979> bevel<00:04:41.310> the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
on top so all you do is you bevel the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.740 
on top so all you do is you bevel the
cards<00:04:41.870> riffle<00:04:42.870> down<00:04:42.900> until<00:04:43.259> you<00:04:43.349> have<00:04:43.469> two<00:04:44.750> so

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
cards riffle down until you have two so

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.909 
cards riffle down until you have two so
I<00:04:45.780> have<00:04:45.930> two<00:04:46.080> cards<00:04:46.289> over<00:04:46.469> there<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.770> all<00:04:46.830> you

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
I have two cards over there and all you

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.110 
I have two cards over there and all you
can<00:04:46.979> do<00:04:47.069> is<00:04:47.159> you're<00:04:47.280> going<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.460> slide<00:04:47.819> it<00:04:47.849> out

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
can do is you're going to slide it out

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.240 
can do is you're going to slide it out
like<00:04:48.990> this<00:04:49.199> instead<00:04:49.530> look<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:49.889> think<00:04:49.949> your

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
like this instead look so I think your

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.610 
like this instead look so I think your
cards<00:04:50.520> on<00:04:50.639> top<00:04:50.789> of<00:04:50.909> the<00:04:50.969> deck<00:04:51.199> flip<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:52.349> double

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
cards on top of the deck flip the double

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.580 
cards on top of the deck flip the double
over<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:53.750> then<00:04:54.750> you<00:04:54.810> say<00:04:54.930> look<00:04:55.110> so<00:04:55.319> this<00:04:55.469> is

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
over and then you say look so this is

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.080 
over and then you say look so this is
your<00:04:55.740> card<00:04:55.949> right<00:04:56.159> and<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.610> spectator<00:04:57.030> is

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
your card right and the spectator is

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.850 
your card right and the spectator is
obviously<00:04:57.389> going<00:04:57.539> to<00:04:57.599> say<00:04:57.719> no<00:04:57.900> so<00:04:58.650> then<00:04:58.770> you're

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
obviously going to say no so then you're

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.559 
obviously going to say no so then you're
going<00:04:58.949> to<00:04:59.009> tell<00:04:59.159> them<00:04:59.310> well<00:05:00.180> you<00:05:00.270> know<00:05:00.360> what

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
face up right hand face down and then

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.399 
face up right hand face down and then
you're<00:06:28.710> going<00:06:28.830> to<00:06:28.949> fold<00:06:29.639> it<00:06:29.909> like<00:06:30.120> this<00:06:30.409> and

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
at this point there's going to be a lot

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.300 
at this point there's going to be a lot
of<00:06:36.899> tension<00:06:37.409> going<00:06:37.440> on<00:06:37.830> with<00:06:37.949> this<00:06:38.039> rubber

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
of tension going on with this rubber

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.680 
of tension going on with this rubber
band

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
band

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.210

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810 
say like six inches maybe the card is

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.510 
say like six inches maybe the card is
going<00:07:20.900> to<00:07:20.960> really<00:07:21.560> shoot<00:07:21.980> out<00:07:22.160> of<00:07:22.250> there<00:07:22.370> so
