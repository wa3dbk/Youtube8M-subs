00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
you won't go in too far because you also

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.270 
you won't go in too far because you also
have<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.110> make<00:01:40.229> sure<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> still<00:01:40.950> fit

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
have to make sure that you can still fit

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.780 
have to make sure that you can still fit
into<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:42.180> direction<00:01:42.619> okay<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.610> we're<00:01:44.759> just

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
into this direction okay so we're just

00:01:44.790 --> 00:02:04.440 
into this direction okay so we're just
going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> cut<00:01:45.329> slits<00:01:45.689> here

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.780 

also<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.720> would<00:02:05.780> be<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.990> good<00:02:06.170> idea<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:07.520> measure

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
also it would be a good idea to measure

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.850 
also it would be a good idea to measure
make<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.270> line<00:02:08.540> down<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:09.320> you<00:02:09.380> know<00:02:09.590> where<00:02:09.770> to

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
make a line down so you know where to

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.330 
make a line down so you know where to
stop<00:02:10.100> cutting<00:02:10.910> inward<00:02:11.390> okay<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:11.900> now<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.340> you

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
stop cutting inward okay so now that you

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.880 
stop cutting inward okay so now that you
have<00:02:13.520> cut<00:02:13.820> slits<00:02:14.450> on<00:02:15.760> both<00:02:17.590> sides<00:02:19.750> right<00:02:20.750> here

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
have cut slits on both sides right here

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.430 
have cut slits on both sides right here
and<00:02:21.890> are<00:02:22.100> here<00:02:22.400> all<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.570> need<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.810> do<00:02:23.930> now<00:02:24.110> is

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
and are here all you need to do now is

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.730 
and are here all you need to do now is
take<00:02:25.190> each<00:02:25.460> slit<00:02:26.030> like<00:02:26.330> this<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:26.960> cut<00:02:27.620> it

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
take each slit like this and just cut it

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.280 
take each slit like this and just cut it
in<00:02:27.920> half<00:02:28.190> snip<00:02:28.970> like<00:02:29.570> I've<00:02:29.720> done<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.110> right

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
in half snip like I've done so right

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.950 
in half snip like I've done so right
