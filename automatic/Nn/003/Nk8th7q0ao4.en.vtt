now one of the really good things about
OneNote<00:00:02.909> is<00:00:03.179> that<00:00:03.389> you<00:00:03.480> can<00:00:03.689> draw<00:00:04.020> all<00:00:04.290> over

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
OneNote is that you can draw all over

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.909 
OneNote is that you can draw all over
the<00:00:04.710> top<00:00:04.920> of<00:00:05.069> stuff<00:00:05.420> so<00:00:06.420> across<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.560> ribbon

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
the top of stuff so across the ribbon

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.770 
the top of stuff so across the ribbon
and<00:00:08.189> that's<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.730> section<00:00:08.970> at<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.360> top<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.690> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
of them is called the draw tab so what

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.269 
of them is called the draw tab so what
you<00:00:15.330> can<00:00:15.540> do<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.320> can<00:00:16.470> use<00:00:16.770> your<00:00:16.980> stylus

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
you can do and you can use your stylus

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.050 
you can do and you can use your stylus
for<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:19.010> you<00:00:20.010> come<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.820> if<00:00:20.939> you

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
for this is you come in and if you

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the cool things about the pen is if you

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.889 
the cool things about the pen is if you
grab<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.879> rub<00:00:39.210> backwards<00:00:39.750> and

grab it and you rub backwards and
forwards<00:00:40.530> over<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.460> same<00:00:41.700> thing<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.540> like

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
forwards over the same thing it's like

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.440 
forwards over the same thing it's like
scratching<00:00:43.649> something<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.850> erase<00:00:45.180> it

highlighting there's also some other

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.670 
highlighting there's also some other
very<00:00:53.309> basic<00:00:53.910> drawing<00:00:54.329> tools<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.590> you've

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
very basic drawing tools here so you've

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.310 
very basic drawing tools here so you've
got<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:55.949> basic<00:00:56.160> drawing<00:00:56.789> shapes<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:58.140> one

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
got your basic drawing shapes the one

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.220 
got your basic drawing shapes the one
that's<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:59.129> interesting<00:00:59.550> is<00:01:00.230> you've

that's really interesting is you've

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.270 
that's really interesting is you've
actually<00:01:01.440> got<00:01:01.920> some<00:01:02.550> graphs<00:01:03.559> some<00:01:04.559> axes<00:01:05.010> you

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
actually got some graphs some axes you

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.789 
actually got some graphs some axes you
can<00:01:05.460> do<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.820> graphing<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.140> click<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
can do for graphing so you click and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.940 
can do for graphing so you click and
drag<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.750> put<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.229> set<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.590> axes

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
drag and you can put in a set of axes

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.080 
drag and you can put in a set of axes
like<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.430> or<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:13.560> could<00:01:15.049> put<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.350> a

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
like that or you could put in a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.530 
like that or you could put in a
four-quadrant

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
four-quadrant

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.050 
four-quadrant
so<00:01:18.930> click<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.640> then<00:01:20.640> drag

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.090 

so<00:01:23.570> if<00:01:23.750> you're<00:01:23.900> interested<00:01:24.350> in<00:01:24.650> doing<00:01:24.830> any

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
so if you're interested in doing any

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.820 
so if you're interested in doing any
graphing<00:01:25.729> or<00:01:25.909> this<00:01:26.869> one<00:01:27.110> here<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:27.530> could<00:01:27.680> do<00:01:27.799> a

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
graphing or this one here you could do a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.850 
graphing or this one here you could do a
SWOT<00:01:28.190> analysis<00:01:28.850> with<00:01:29.350> have<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.380> look<00:01:30.590> at<00:01:30.680> these

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
SWOT analysis with have a look at these

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.609 
SWOT analysis with have a look at these
tools<00:01:31.220> because<00:01:32.000> it's<00:01:32.210> much<00:01:32.900> easier<00:01:33.350> then<00:01:33.470> you

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
tools because it's much easier then you

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.980 
tools because it's much easier then you
can<00:01:33.770> just<00:01:33.920> use<00:01:34.130> your<00:01:34.159> pens<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:35.659> draw<00:01:35.930> you

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
can just use your pens to draw you

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.260 
can just use your pens to draw you
graphs<00:01:36.500> or<00:01:36.830> your<00:01:36.979> lines<00:01:37.280> or<00:01:37.610> things<00:01:37.820> over<00:01:38.150> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
graphs or your lines or things over the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.260 
graphs or your lines or things over the
top<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.509> them<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.100> can<00:01:40.100> adjust<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.610> color<00:01:40.940> and

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
top of them you can adjust the color and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.719 
top of them you can adjust the color and
the<00:01:42.110> thickness<00:01:42.409> of<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.979> lines<00:01:43.190> that<00:01:43.580> you're

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
the thickness of the lines that you're

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.030 
the thickness of the lines that you're
drawing<00:01:45.280> so<00:01:46.280> you<00:01:46.310> know<00:01:49.180> didn't<00:01:50.180> work<00:01:50.360> did<00:01:50.570> it

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
drawing so you know didn't work did it

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.130 
drawing so you know didn't work did it
but<00:01:52.040> if<00:01:52.159> I<00:01:52.280> draw<00:01:52.520> that

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.180 

that's<00:01:58.590> shape<00:01:58.860> there<00:01:59.130> adjusts<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:01.190> you

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
that's shape there adjusts for that you

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.650 
that's shape there adjusts for that you
can<00:02:02.370> arrange<00:02:02.700> them<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.150> you<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.540> actually

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
can arrange them so you can actually

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.760 
can arrange them so you can actually
layer<00:02:04.080> them<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:06.380> you've<00:02:07.380> got<00:02:07.500> your<00:02:07.620> different

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
layer them and you've got your different

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.690 
layer them and you've got your different
pens<00:02:08.220> here<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:08.700> well<00:02:10.009> one<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.220> things<00:02:11.460> is

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
pens here as well one of the things is

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.950 
pens here as well one of the things is
if<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.150> do<00:02:12.660> some<00:02:12.930> writing<00:02:14.090> I'm<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.570> using<00:02:15.780> a

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
if you do some writing I'm not using a

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.470 
if you do some writing I'm not using a
stylus<00:02:16.440> at<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.680> moment<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:18.000> then

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.680 

use<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.690> right-click<00:02:22.350> on<00:02:22.590> your<00:02:22.830> pen<00:02:23.690> to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
use the right-click on your pen to
