00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.870
 hello, how do you say hello educational and 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:07.209
 I bring a news today I do not know 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.950
 if with this they are going to shit with laughter or 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:12.010
 they will bother sorry for the bad 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.019
 word but it is true if this is going to 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.990
 pass in missouri 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.689
 they want it to happen they do not want to put a 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.050
 tax on a balance in English for the 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.970
 work this would be called the syntax a 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.130
 I dance in video game which means being 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.290
 Spanish want to put a tax on 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.989
 sin and sintax won without tacc s &amp; n publishes 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:38.289
 in a Spanish English translator and without 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.690
 sin sintax is a sin tax 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.969
 in violent video games and a 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.510
 Missouri representative wants 1% 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.310
 of video game sales obviously 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.890
 the state talking about missouri and 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:55.110
 that 1% goes to mental programs 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.210
 for example test mental I do not know what 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.730
 refers will refer to that but 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.870
 wants to do that because the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.610
 video games sell a lot 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.710
 especially the violent ones and I 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.950
 it would seem fair that 1 percent 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.500
 of those sales go to this kind of 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.500
 programs or is what this says 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.299
 or Mr. die in franklin 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.299
 is what he said 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.740
 obviously this seems like they are going to 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.840
 try not know yet nothing is not 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.150
 approved I repeat it but they want to put 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.520
 that tax and if they put the tax that 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.140
 what happens in Missouri will raise the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.690
 sale of video games also this 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.460
 candidate wants to put the same tax 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.270
 good games but you REITs 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.040
 previously there are some reiter 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.530
 that is to matthew law another cheese for 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.670
 young who is not but who wants 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.670
 raise 1% 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.970
 I do not know what's wrong with the government 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.090
 actively is that they do everything 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.360
 but one thing is for sure we all know 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.710
 that the church and politics are 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.010
 separated but I do not know why they put him 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.750
 the sin tax I think that 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.870
 they should put taxes rather to the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.820
 sale of weapons that is the most dangerous 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.130
 be a video game can not kill you but 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.180
 a weapon if we all know that the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.400
 people who have mental problems 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.290
 are the people who kill people or 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.640
 be I can not kill someone you do not 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.770
 you can kill someone because you're fine 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.050
 if you have mental problems obviously 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.180
 you are going to let yourself be guided by a videogame 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.850
 or even for a movie and kill 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.530
 people or do harm or do something that 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.450
 have nothing to do with violence but 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.510
 it's completely illogical in this 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.400
 world but good does not change the subject anymore 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.870
 the missouri wants to put the tax on 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.420
 sin to videogames what do you think 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.080
 about this I honestly say that no 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.760
 they should put 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.920
 is imposed on the video game and not on 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.810
 Weapons Video games do not kill you 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.730
 you come out with a playstation 3 disc or 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.820
 xbox to kill people you come out with a gun 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.130
 to kill and point so I say goodbye fi 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.480
