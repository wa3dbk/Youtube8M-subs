00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.780
 speak up 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.750
 This is the first video of the channel and I 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.059
 I will bring here the focus of the fox channel 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.660
 our channel will help you with your 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.090
 skills and tricks and why not 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.340
 start as the best 'champions' 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.300
 to meet so much the release of 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.490
 troops 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.950
 one of the best starts tomorrow 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.360
 workshop that has march with gate art 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:38.760
 I hung up much more exciting than 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.359
 here with how this need is going to be 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.579
 I need 14 in a new ed chan that is the 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.579
 amulets to thinkit ne 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.519
 a tip that had where to leave you 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:56.550
 Leave your varzim and you start with 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:59.519
 A cool you I am but matsushita is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.449
 cool you leave the amulet on being you 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:06.240
 It would be that we left here for 14 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.900
 It's set up but you would be 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.400
 here I do not hear here so that's why I 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.700
 I took and left here as you left the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.850
 standard here of the items with whom I will go 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 spine because I want to be I think well 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:31.880
 best of us and it's like as I ard 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.070
 already had more space for 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.320
 to use the cm ow not left with doh 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.720
 other buttons I get used to so I 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.170
 I think it's much better than using one or two or 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.820
 three 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.170
 That's what we should do here. 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.130
 when you are training with a lease 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.130
 that way you kick at least 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.780
 stipulated 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.979
 You jump you throw the latch off and use the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.039
 it w 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.049
 this is the ifet scheme ne 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.289
 that's how the three do 2011 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.260
 train 70 any side is 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.489
 but there you are like I do not have 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.720
 interrupted vision here I did four 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.760
 on here 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.380
 Good guys, now you do not have to do 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.840
 I keep that as I put it 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.500
 here at 30 and after the date 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.140
 burial of the vision I pulled into the 6 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.890
 I leave here as being and of people like 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:38.140
 You guys, where should I go like this ? 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.090
 use ardis not to be part of the review and 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.470
 leaves 30 larger silver of the dinha so 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.380
 on the map to help the team is over 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.140
 here I have here I end up using 6 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.930
 same is this pipe arm hamas is just us 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.120
 wait when it happened when you stayed there and 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:02.920
 I get django when it's just training 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.790
 and kicks at least even the squid already uses the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.410
 30 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.720
 doing it faster than the trick 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.670
 Are you talking in surprise? 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.660
 he had a humble break of surprise and 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.959
 There is no way to close or any jana. 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.790
 someone from anyone of you plays for 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.190
 other side or out and could not 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.870
 kick your futile foe 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.359
 we do the same as I have vision I 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:38.350
 I can keep complaining 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:40.209
 this is the attempt to leave the area of 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.269
 escape can be at least do this 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.139
 for you know the enemy 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.139
 This is the ard trick. 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:58.600
 ian thorpe 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.540
 this is an exceptional tactic next 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.730
 it is just the type as good without training 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.350
 this is a guy who has a lot like woody 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.620
 mobility in science 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.300
 if you were almost that 's gg dude going 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.770
 get a lot more matches 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.540
 It is with this trick that not many 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.270
 people use it 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.940
 we are not going here as in an Argentinean one 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.190
 baby should I install if caught in the 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.400
 django is the wedding of you do you 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.540
 leaves 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.370
 if we had achieved our not stolen 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.270
 has flow in we will take whatever is more 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.770
 that 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.250
 This is what I wanted to show you. 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.240
 galera is the trick that gives the air of 25 years and is 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.190
 much better started than training 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.520
 normal someone has no easy cursam 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.500

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.580

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:20.350
