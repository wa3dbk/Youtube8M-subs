00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
Fett's antenna kind of skews to the side

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.660 
Fett's antenna kind of skews to the side
a<00:01:23.580> bit<00:01:25.310> be<00:01:26.310> sure<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:27.740> put<00:01:28.740> your<00:01:28.770> Wookiee<00:01:29.189> scalps

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
a bit be sure to put your Wookiee scalps

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.460 
a bit be sure to put your Wookiee scalps
really<00:01:30.240> good<00:01:30.479> over<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> shoulder<00:01:31.259> because

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
really good over the shoulder because

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.770 
really good over the shoulder because
they<00:01:31.680> tend<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> pinch<00:01:33.439> into<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:36.090> arm<00:01:36.299> socket

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
they tend to pinch into the arm socket

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.649 
they tend to pinch into the arm socket
quite<00:01:37.140> easily<00:01:37.490> like<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.119> dropped<00:01:39.450> in

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
quite easily like one just dropped in

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.469 
quite easily like one just dropped in
right<00:01:39.869> now<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.460> once<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> got<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> popped<00:01:42.210> in

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
right now and once you got it popped in

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.109 
right now and once you got it popped in
be<00:01:42.689> sure<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.490> spin<00:01:44.490> them<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.700> little<00:01:44.909> bit<00:01:45.000> to

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
be sure to spin them a little bit to

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.940 
be sure to spin them a little bit to
make<00:01:45.240> sure<00:01:45.270> they're<00:01:45.540> not<00:01:45.689> stuck<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.350> there<00:01:46.649> yep

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
make sure they're not stuck in there yep

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.330 
make sure they're not stuck in there yep
mine<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.460> pretty<00:01:47.640> good

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.770 

so<00:01:51.939> here<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.149> have<00:01:52.180> one<00:01:52.479> configuration

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
so here you have one configuration

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:06.300 
so here you have one configuration
because<00:01:53.439> it<00:01:53.799> comes<00:01:54.009> with<00:01:54.189> two<00:02:04.470> now<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.740> lot<00:02:06.280> of

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
because it comes with two now a lot of

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.820 
because it comes with two now a lot of
the<00:02:06.460> figures<00:02:06.820> in<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.390> series<00:02:08.050> come<00:02:08.679> with

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
the figures in this series come with

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.850 
the figures in this series come with
multiple<00:02:09.099> arms<00:02:09.819> or<00:02:10.420> heads<00:02:11.349> or<00:02:11.769> legs<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:14.560> clone

on<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.370> shelf<00:04:17.640> I<00:04:18.049> like<00:04:19.049> what<00:04:19.230> could<00:04:19.380> have<00:04:19.470> the

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
on the shelf I like what could have the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.900 
on the shelf I like what could have the
key<00:04:19.680> has<00:04:19.770> been<00:04:19.799> doing<00:04:20.040> with<00:04:20.190> this<00:04:20.370> series<00:04:20.700> and

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
key has been doing with this series and

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.000 
key has been doing with this series and
having<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.810> interchangeable<00:04:22.350> parts<00:04:22.530> on<00:04:22.890> all

having the interchangeable parts on all
their<00:04:23.160> figures<00:04:23.490> allows<00:04:23.940> for<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.330> lot<00:04:24.450> of

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
their figures allows for a lot of

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.570 
their figures allows for a lot of
creative<00:04:24.900> poses<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.620> this<00:04:26.070> figure<00:04:26.250> is<00:04:26.430> no

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
creative poses and this figure is no
