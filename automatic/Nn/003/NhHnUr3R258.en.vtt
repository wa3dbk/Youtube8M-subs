00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.060

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.210
 well I'm spending some big tooth cure 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.840
 but as I do not have it, it's the same 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.240
 I took mikados and then I took the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.800
 tape to stick and that's two I 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.340
 know them all the challenges plays 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.970
 then my style more stickers 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.420
 high yeah that's all it is you 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:08.040
 need as material so take your 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:13.140
 good box mine is good a little dirty 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:16.490
 the run was in a room where there are 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.630
 present all the things that I judge 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.560
 sorry for the noise still behind 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:27.060
 so you take from your sheet of 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.280
 color or your tapestry then bah 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.620
 already stopped and tapestries and cut 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:41.870
 there to start then a shoe the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:44.790
 tooth in the box like this here 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.010
 for the background so that it is very pretty 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.480
 it shows that it's my star 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:56.840
 is there put a sticker my style 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:03.540
 like this or white to cream this so 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.940
 here and then make two holes in the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.940
 box 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.940
 are you going 6 to the museum down like world 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.989
 cornered insert the two losers or 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:24.200
 then pass water meters take 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:32.209
 the voice body and so the elected in the 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:34.010
 hole here if you too have put you 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.989
 brown scotch and that you find that 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.299
 it's not very pretty but you're scotch 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.760
 transparent is because we had done 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.140
 this cabinet for a long time you 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.819
 want to redo it and so we have 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.640
 took the opportunity to show you how in 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:53.079
 run away from cut and tapestry 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.079
 or your cool in chilly leaves 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:00.709
 but before cutting look well if 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:14.810
 if the tapestry and the size of the 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:17.799
 box me it's good I have small 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.799
 scissors it's not easy 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:38.950
 to cut a right but then 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:42.940
 pick up your box he was checking the 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.280
 length and then check the width as 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.980
 that's it like that but it's a lot 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:55.300
 longer than the box is the box that 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:58.720
 give it so cut off the edge so like 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.890
 that then you cut the mc2 the boot 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.460
 placed by reed 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.810
 That's what happens 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.850
 good it's a little bigger but we're going 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:13.540
 keep the length to stick it 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:17.530
 then that's so you normally have 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:23.800
 well I had to fold the tapestry so 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:27.910
 giving bah it after so I'll 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:35.400
 enjoy to cut in half and it goes 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:39.340
 become anti see what we do not know 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.350
 like these with your scratch so 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.120
 me an iron romance with a big scotch 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.510
 but as legs full of people come 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.370
 as I took my pardon and then eh ben 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.470
 I take my little transparent tape 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.050
 I recognize there because it pollutes 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.780
 here it is so san jose coach that I have 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.150
 still here and I will do you 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.120
 same with the other pushes them 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.410
 particles 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.789
 so I took a little time to stick 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.669
 it keeps coming off at each 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.390
 time it is in soule 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.920
 good here 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.530
 so to stick to it just now 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.820
 no problem here is how to do it 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.330
 a wardrobe but it's not terrible 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.980
 terrible 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.600
 good after for a boy's body 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.970
 removed because there is the scotch that is 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.340
 trying to plug the holes but 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:31.520
 otherwise I'll give the strings 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:33.890

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.850

 Saturday 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:41.320
 it's not very fast to do that but 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.320
 that's at least it makes you a 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.720

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.540
