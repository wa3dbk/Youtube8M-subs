00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:06.170
 today 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.170
 ah 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.719
 i 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:14.870
 nothing that is enjoyed more than eating a 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.790
 delicious dessert without remorse today 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.369
 julián álvarez will teach us to 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:23.739
 prepare a dessert of the three milks 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:27.290
 see light ingredients 10 eggs 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:30.770
 250 grams of flour a cup of 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:34.100
 substitute sugar for soaking 300 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.739
 grams of cream light milk 300 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.600
 grams of half-skimmed milk a cup 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.530
 from arequipe light then I'll start 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.530
 breaking the eggs 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.660
 whenever they go for recipes 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.440
 pastry the ideal is to use egg 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.440
 white or lion 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.460
 Here I have the can where I'm going to put 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.870
 the biscuit can in the house in 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.870
 the butter or the flour 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.040
 the secret of the sponge cake is the shake if 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.740
 they do not do it well 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.950
 after that they have left 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.140
 like a cookie does not rise because that 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.320
 you do not have this you can not add powder 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.320
 to bake 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.530
 we do not put the speed of more 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.420
 I'm going to mix 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.920
 the cream of milk with the arequipe for 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.409
 that we are not leaving groups 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.850
 because if I throw all the fluids 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.850
 all of them are here 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.340
 the shake can be done in the blender 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.439
 but you have to be careful not to beat it 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.719
 a lot because when they beat it in excess they leave 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.340
 forming those bubbles that later on 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.860
 added in the sponge cake is like 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.410
 all the techniques 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.180
 we have by now we have the soaking and 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.420
 I'm beating the eggs with the penalties 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.250
 to paste the flour and make the disc 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.920
 Silence that the bid is changing 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.510
 color is already getting easier 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.880
 error that many know is that the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.630
 flour is added to the blender 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.030
 and so it lowers me all the game then 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.690
 we put cream and wrap and 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.690
 walking 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.480
 while we are adding flour we are going 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.480
 mixing 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.860
 we have to go mixing the flour in 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.390
 but not enveloping shape right there 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.459
 they can let the flour stand 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.780
 when they are added to the mix because 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.780
 they are forming lumps 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.099
 the secret the sponge cake is the smoothie 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.440
 many people believe what to do 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.810
 very difficult sponge cake apparently from 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.310
 easy but they have to take into account 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.819
 all these tricks because if not 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.819
 it goes up 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.930
 you 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.750
 yes in which the texture is already becoming 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.940
 more heavy 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.250
 but it must be that fluffy 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.260
 I water the temperature for the sponge cake 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.990
 of 180 degrees centigrade because what 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.150
 we are doing thick if they were to 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.370
 be short as a guy to make roll 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.370
 200 degrees until golden 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.880
 it's so hot we started to soak it 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.620
 we go 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.280
 this area of ​​braids is usually 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.810
 decorate with meringue 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.090
 in this case we will decorate it with 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.799
 cream two days without sugar so you do not 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.799
 we remain as a flat cake 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.430
 it's a recipe to finish meals 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.250
 with the sweet moment a delicious dessert 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:35.229
 but light we see with many more
