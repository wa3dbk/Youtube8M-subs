00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
actually go through probably four or

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.080 
actually go through probably four or
five<00:01:55.840> pairs<00:01:56.229> of<00:01:56.380> lenses<00:01:56.470> in<00:01:56.770> game<00:01:56.979> just<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:57.910> be

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
five pairs of lenses in game just to be

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.060 
five pairs of lenses in game just to be
able<00:01:58.150> to<00:01:58.270> function<00:01:58.540> in<00:01:58.810> my<00:01:58.990> job<00:01:59.229> I<00:01:59.560> had<00:01:59.890> just

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
able to function in my job I had just

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.340 
able to function in my job I had just
returned<00:02:00.430> from<00:02:00.490> China<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:01.240> in<00:02:01.360> China<00:02:01.390> glasses

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
returned from China and in China glasses

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.810 
returned from China and in China glasses
are<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.530> lot<00:02:02.710> cheaper<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.190> had<00:02:03.369> three<00:02:03.640> pairs

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
are a lot cheaper and I had three pairs

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.670 
are a lot cheaper and I had three pairs
made

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
made

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.820 
made
and<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.100> turns<00:02:05.370> out<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:07.080> atomic<00:02:07.410> rest's

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
and it turns out that the atomic rest's

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.740 
and it turns out that the atomic rest's
over<00:02:08.040> there<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.520> China<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:09.030> had<00:02:09.180> sludged<00:02:09.600> my

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
over there in China they had sludged my

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.360 
over there in China they had sludged my
prescription<00:02:10.470> that's<00:02:10.680> when<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> just<00:02:11.130> threw<00:02:11.340> up

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
prescription that's when I just threw up

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.220 
prescription that's when I just threw up
my<00:02:11.460> hands<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> said<00:02:12.090> oh<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.630> just<00:02:12.810> too

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
my hands and I said oh this is just too

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.870 
my hands and I said oh this is just too
much<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:13.620> me<00:02:13.680> I'd<00:02:14.310> rather<00:02:14.490> have<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
much for me I'd rather have the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.500 
much for me I'd rather have the
procedure<00:02:15.360> done

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.260 

the<00:02:19.510> first<00:02:19.750> time<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.020> heard<00:02:20.590> about<00:02:20.760> LASIK<00:02:21.760> and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
the first time I heard about LASIK and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.940 
the first time I heard about LASIK and
it<00:02:22.569> was<00:02:22.750> one<00:02:23.020> of<00:02:23.140> my<00:02:23.230> first<00:02:23.470> jobs<00:02:23.709> out<00:02:23.860> of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
it was one of my first jobs out of

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.860 
it was one of my first jobs out of
college<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.490> my<00:02:24.610> boss<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:24.790> Adina<00:02:25.270> Lauren<00:02:25.630> you

college and my boss is Adina Lauren you
should<00:02:26.140> have<00:02:26.490> LASIK<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.610> should<00:02:27.700> have<00:02:27.790> laser

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
should have LASIK you should have laser

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.710 
should have LASIK you should have laser
eye<00:02:28.090> surgery<00:02:28.890> because<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.310> you'll<00:02:30.880> you'll<00:02:31.600> be

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
eye surgery because it you'll you'll be

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.090 
eye surgery because it you'll you'll be
free<00:02:31.959> you'll<00:02:32.170> be<00:02:32.290> able<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.590> do<00:02:32.709> things<00:02:32.980> you

want to do

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.760 
want to do
finally<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.540> new<00:02:34.810> generation<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.410> lasers

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
finally this new generation of lasers

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.460 
finally this new generation of lasers
came<00:02:35.980> out<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.520> you<00:02:37.239> know<00:02:37.360> I'm<00:02:37.420> not<00:02:37.569> not

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
came out and you know I'm not not

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.290 
came out and you know I'm not not
exaggerating<00:02:39.160> when<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.310> say<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.610> was<00:02:39.880> like<00:02:40.000> this

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
exaggerating when I say I was like this

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.330 
exaggerating when I say I was like this
is<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.540> they've<00:02:40.989> got<00:02:41.020> it<00:02:41.500> figured<00:02:41.800> out<00:02:42.040> it's

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
is it they've got it figured out it's

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.270 
is it they've got it figured out it's
time<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.790> do<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.090> quite<00:02:43.540> frankly<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.080> was<00:02:44.319> I<00:02:44.860> was

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
time to do it quite frankly I was I was

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.010 
time to do it quite frankly I was I was
a<00:02:45.310> little<00:02:45.550> nervous<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:46.090> even<00:02:46.270> consider<00:02:46.930> it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
a little nervous to even consider it

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.510 
a little nervous to even consider it
because<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.709> your<00:02:47.860> eyes<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.370> your<00:02:48.489> eyes

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
because it is your eyes and your eyes

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.090 
because it is your eyes and your eyes
are<00:02:48.640> all<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.030> have<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.690> as<00:02:50.260> time<00:02:50.500> went<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.800> I

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.590 
are all you have and as time went on I
knew<00:02:51.280> technology<00:02:51.880> was<00:02:52.030> getting<00:02:52.300> better<00:02:52.480> I

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
knew technology was getting better I

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.900 
knew technology was getting better I
knew<00:02:53.459> doctors<00:02:54.459> are<00:02:54.580> getting<00:02:54.790> more

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910

doctor told me this was the latest you
know<00:03:10.090> most<00:03:10.330> advanced<00:03:10.720> technology<00:03:11.230> he

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
know most advanced technology he

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.680 
know most advanced technology he
explained<00:03:11.800> how<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:13.209> little<00:03:13.450> thoughts

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
explained how the the little thoughts

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.090 
explained how the the little thoughts
that<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.050> laser<00:03:14.230> will<00:03:14.470> make<00:03:14.650> were<00:03:14.860> going<00:03:15.040> to

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
that the laser will make were going to

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.890 
that the laser will make were going to
be<00:03:15.220> much<00:03:15.430> much<00:03:15.610> smaller<00:03:15.940> than<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.360> dots<00:03:16.660> that

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
be much much smaller than the dots that

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.290 
be much much smaller than the dots that
the<00:03:17.319> older<00:03:17.620> generations<00:03:18.580> of<00:03:18.730> lasers<00:03:19.060> made

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
the older generations of lasers made

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.809 
the older generations of lasers made
said<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.019> it<00:03:20.140> would<00:03:20.230> do<00:03:20.380> less<00:03:20.650> damage<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:21.459> my

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
said that it would do less damage to my

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.370 
said that it would do less damage to my
cornea<00:03:22.239> or<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.690> my<00:03:22.810> eye<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:22.989> would<00:03:23.200> require

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
cornea or to my eye it would require

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.530 
cornea or to my eye it would require
less<00:03:23.590> time<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.190> heal<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.730> know<00:03:24.820> everyone's

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
less time to heal you know everyone's

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.690 
less time to heal you know everyone's
eyes<00:03:25.750> are<00:03:25.959> different<00:03:26.079> everyone's<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:27.489> shape

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
eyes are different everyone's the shape

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.220 
eyes are different everyone's the shape
of<00:03:27.730> everybody's<00:03:28.209> eyeballs<00:03:28.540> are<00:03:28.690> different<00:03:29.019> so

all kinds of weird bumps on it and they

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.380 
all kinds of weird bumps on it and they
were<00:03:39.410> gonna<00:03:39.530> actually<00:03:40.240> customize<00:03:41.240> the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
were gonna actually customize the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.020 
were gonna actually customize the
procedure<00:03:41.750> specifically<00:03:42.730> address<00:03:43.730> the

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
procedure specifically address the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
imperfections on my eye a lot of people

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.400 
imperfections on my eye a lot of people
believe<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.459> when<00:03:47.120> they<00:03:47.300> go<00:03:47.480> get<00:03:47.690> LASIK<00:03:47.930> it's

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
believe that when they go get LASIK it's

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.680 
believe that when they go get LASIK it's
just<00:03:48.709> one<00:03:48.950> procedure<00:03:49.340> fits<00:03:49.670> all<00:03:49.880> but<00:03:50.239> from

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
just one procedure fits all but from

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.900 
just one procedure fits all but from
what<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:50.930> discovered<00:03:51.500> every<00:03:52.069> single<00:03:52.550> LASIK

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
what I discovered every single LASIK

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.020 
what I discovered every single LASIK
procedure<00:03:53.330> is<00:03:54.110> a<00:03:54.170> custom<00:03:54.770> correction<00:03:55.459> this<00:03:55.880> is

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
procedure is a custom correction this is

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.809 
procedure is a custom correction this is
something<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.750> for<00:03:57.530> you<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:01.130> they<00:04:01.489> use<00:04:01.790> a

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
something that is for you and they use a

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.460 
something that is for you and they use a
computer<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.420> take<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.600> picture<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:02.959> my<00:04:03.140> eye<00:04:03.170> you

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
computer to take a picture of my eye you

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.990 
computer to take a picture of my eye you
could<00:04:03.590> actually<00:04:03.739> see<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.250> three-dimensional

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
could actually see a three-dimensional

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.790 
could actually see a three-dimensional
map<00:04:05.180> of<00:04:05.239> where<00:04:05.930> all<00:04:06.050> these<00:04:06.170> little<00:04:06.410> bumps<00:04:06.590> and

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
map of where all these little bumps and

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.110 
map of where all these little bumps and
things<00:04:06.950> were<00:04:07.190> they're<00:04:07.640> like<00:04:07.760> oh<00:04:07.850> yeah<00:04:08.000> we're

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
things were they're like oh yeah we're

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.590 
things were they're like oh yeah we're
going<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.300> get<00:04:08.390> this<00:04:08.570> one<00:04:08.750> about<00:04:09.040> just<00:04:10.040> Florida

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
going to get this one about just Florida

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.240 
going to get this one about just Florida
they<00:04:11.600> take<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:12.170> surface<00:04:12.590> measurement<00:04:13.190> of

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
they take the surface measurement of

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.539 
they take the surface measurement of
your<00:04:13.400> eye<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.900> they<00:04:14.900> create<00:04:15.410> a<00:04:15.680> type<00:04:16.519> of

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
your eye and they create a type of

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.420 
your eye and they create a type of
equation<00:04:17.390> or<00:04:18.079> program<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:18.829> they<00:04:19.100> put<00:04:19.340> into

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
equation or program that they put into

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.060 
equation or program that they put into
the<00:04:19.579> laser<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.299> a<00:04:20.390> laser<00:04:20.419> uses<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.829> shape

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
tissue the flap is lowered and heals

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.719 
tissue the flap is lowered and heals
itself<00:04:37.509> without<00:04:37.870> stitches

put me underneath the laser and it was
only<00:05:11.120> eight<00:05:11.300> seconds<00:05:11.749> for<00:05:11.930> this<00:05:12.050> eye<00:05:12.229> and<00:05:12.650> ten

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
only eight seconds for this eye and ten

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.799 
only eight seconds for this eye and ten
seconds<00:05:13.279> for<00:05:13.460> this<00:05:13.610> knife<00:05:13.819> the<00:05:14.120> precision<00:05:14.689> is

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:14.809 
seconds for this knife the precision is

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:17.649 
seconds for this knife the precision is
so<00:05:15.409> sharp<00:05:15.830> it's<00:05:16.129> so<00:05:16.309> fine<00:05:16.610> you<00:05:17.240> know<00:05:17.330> I<00:05:17.360> didn't

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
so sharp it's so fine you know I didn't

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:19.600 
so sharp it's so fine you know I didn't
feel<00:05:17.899> anything<00:05:18.169> it<00:05:18.889> was<00:05:19.069> actually<00:05:19.430> pretty

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
feel anything it was actually pretty

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.989 
feel anything it was actually pretty
cool<00:05:19.939> it<00:05:20.149> was<00:05:20.240> like<00:05:20.419> looking<00:05:20.749> at<00:05:20.870> a<00:05:20.930> light<00:05:21.199> show
