nice and people are gonna wonder how you
did<00:05:05.210> that<00:05:05.530> but<00:05:06.530> yeah<00:05:06.980> there's<00:05:07.460> other<00:05:07.640> ways<00:05:07.910> you

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
did that but yeah there's other ways you

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.000 
did that but yeah there's other ways you
don't<00:05:08.210> always<00:05:08.450> have<00:05:08.660> to<00:05:08.750> have<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:08.990> loop<00:05:09.230> but<00:05:09.860> I

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
don't always have to have the loop but I

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.190 
don't always have to have the loop but I
just<00:05:10.340> like<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.790> loop<00:05:10.970> because<00:05:11.300> it<00:05:11.540> just<00:05:11.750> hides

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
just like the loop because it just hides

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.810 
just like the loop because it just hides
the<00:05:12.860> rest<00:05:13.040> of<00:05:13.130> the<00:05:13.190> hair<00:05:13.370> really<00:05:13.610> really

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820
