comfortable<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.640> them<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.420> leather<00:01:39.540> is

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
comfortable in them and the leather is

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.270 
comfortable in them and the leather is
very<00:01:39.780> soft<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.619> able<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.890> kind<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.159> move

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
very soft and was able to kind of move

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.770 
very soft and was able to kind of move
around<00:01:41.310> pretty<00:01:41.820> pretty<00:01:42.150> freely<00:01:42.450> pretty

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
around pretty pretty freely pretty

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.960 
around pretty pretty freely pretty
nicely<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.950> far<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.310> one's<00:01:44.490> concerned

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
nicely as far as this one's concerned

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.580 
nicely as far as this one's concerned
they<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.450> give<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.950> as<00:01:46.950> far<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> plate

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
they do give you a as far as the plate

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.100 
they do give you a as far as the plate
what<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:49.680> called<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.310> TPU<00:01:50.670> plate<00:01:51.110> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
what they called the the TPU plate and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.539 
what they called the the TPU plate and
basically<00:01:52.560> all<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.920> supposed<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.399> is

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
basically all it's supposed to do is

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.969 
basically all it's supposed to do is
give<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.119> kind<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.479> smooth<00:01:55.110> transition

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
give you kind of a smooth transition

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.539 
give you kind of a smooth transition
from<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.810> forefoot<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.250> way<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
from the forefoot all the way to the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.940 
from the forefoot all the way to the
heel<00:01:59.759> all<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.329> way<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.899> front<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
heel all the way to the front of the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.459 
heel all the way to the front of the
kind<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.430> tip<00:02:02.670> tip<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.930> foot<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.200> it's

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
kind of tip tip of the foot so it's

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.420 
kind of tip tip of the foot so it's
supposed<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.740> kind<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.100> give<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.399> a

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
supposed to kind of just give you a

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.429 
supposed to kind of just give you a
smoother<00:02:06.000> transition<00:02:06.540> than<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:07.020> lot<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.200> boots

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
smoother transition than a lot of boots

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.910 
smoother transition than a lot of boots
like<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.979> with<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.250> conical

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
like this with that conical

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.430 
like this with that conical
pattern<00:02:09.220> throughout<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.450> do<00:02:10.630> get<00:02:10.840> kind<00:02:11.380> of

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
pattern throughout so you do get kind of

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.309 
pattern throughout so you do get kind of
that<00:02:11.590> flatter<00:02:11.890> soleplate<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:13.420> TPU<00:02:13.750> plate<00:02:14.110> on

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
that flatter soleplate the TPU plate on

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.680 
that flatter soleplate the TPU plate on
this<00:02:14.440> guy<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:15.220> it's<00:02:15.489> kind<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.060> conical<00:02:16.450> sled

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
this guy but it's kind of a conical sled

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.260 
this guy but it's kind of a conical sled
pattern<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.230> got<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.160> little<00:02:18.310> kind<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.700> got

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
pattern and got this little kind of got

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.880 
pattern and got this little kind of got
in<00:02:19.420> here<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:19.840> then<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.410> way<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.800> way

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
in here and then and the way the way

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.080 
in here and then and the way the way
it's<00:02:21.010> designed<00:02:21.130> on<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.430> outer<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.849> supposed

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
it's designed on the outer is supposed

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.309 
it's designed on the outer is supposed
to<00:02:22.150> really<00:02:22.330> kind<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.630> make<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.959> little<00:02:22.989> bit

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
to really kind of make it a little bit

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.870 
to really kind of make it a little bit
easier<00:02:23.560> transition<00:02:23.830> when<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.430> kind<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.730> move

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
easier transition when you kind of move

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.729 
easier transition when you kind of move
up<00:02:25.120> when<00:02:26.050> you're<00:02:26.140> kind<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.350> bending<00:02:26.650> and

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
up when you're kind of bending and

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.080 
up when you're kind of bending and
breaking<00:02:26.920> at<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.400> point<00:02:27.670> it's<00:02:27.819> supposed<00:02:28.030> to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
breaking at that point it's supposed to

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.550 
breaking at that point it's supposed to
make<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.330> little<00:02:28.510> bit<00:02:28.720> easier<00:02:28.930> weight

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
make a little bit easier weight

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.590 
make a little bit easier weight
distribution<00:02:29.860> between<00:02:30.489> between<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.360> entire

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
distribution between between the entire

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.449 
distribution between between the entire
boot<00:02:31.840> whereas<00:02:32.170> boots<00:02:32.739> on<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.890> path<00:02:33.069> like<00:02:33.430> this

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
boot whereas boots on the path like this

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.580 
boot whereas boots on the path like this
with<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.450> conical<00:02:34.810> studs<00:02:34.959> pattern<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:35.500> that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
with the conical studs pattern and that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.040 
with the conical studs pattern and that
really<00:02:35.769> flat<00:02:36.040> soleplate<00:02:36.459> have<00:02:37.300> kind<00:02:37.569> of<00:02:37.660> had

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
really flat soleplate have kind of had

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.040 
really flat soleplate have kind of had
any<00:02:38.410> issues<00:02:38.860> with<00:02:39.099> them<00:02:39.450> just<00:02:40.450> being<00:02:40.660> too<00:02:40.810> flat

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
any issues with them just being too flat

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.059 
any issues with them just being too flat
not<00:02:41.260> really<00:02:41.470> distributing<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:41.980> weight

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
not really distributing the weight

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.440 
not really distributing the weight
equally<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.489> that's<00:02:42.700> kind<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.209> what<00:02:43.330> it's
