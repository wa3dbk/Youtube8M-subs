00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
sprinkle little by little when you see

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330 
sprinkle little by little when you see
the<00:02:07.479> water<00:02:07.660> filled<00:02:08.050> up<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.410> just<00:02:08.590> wait<00:02:08.830> until

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
the water filled up you just wait until

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.700 
the water filled up you just wait until
the<00:02:09.550> cement<00:02:10.030> absorbs<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.780> water<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.410> then

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
the cement absorbs the water and then

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.770 
the cement absorbs the water and then
you<00:02:11.860> do<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.070> again

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.270 

over<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.620> over

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.940 

often<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.300> see<00:02:22.540> like<00:02:22.840> it's<00:02:23.020> not<00:02:23.230> absorbing

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
often you see like it's not absorbing

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.190 
often you see like it's not absorbing
anymore<00:02:24.370> try<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.510> you're<00:02:25.690> gonna<00:02:25.870> like

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
anymore try this and you're gonna like

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.970 
anymore try this and you're gonna like
it

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.440 

the<00:02:29.980> hard<00:02:30.190> part<00:02:30.460> is<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.670> bring<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.210> home<00:02:31.390> to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
the hard part is to bring it home to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.200 
the hard part is to bring it home to
bricks<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.200> cement<00:02:32.610> that's<00:02:33.610> all<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.030> rest

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
bricks and a cement that's all the rest

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.010 
bricks and a cement that's all the rest
is<00:02:34.390> very<00:02:34.690> simple<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.380> very<00:02:35.410> easy
