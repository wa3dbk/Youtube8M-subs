00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
rate it a five out of ten and that is

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.320 
rate it a five out of ten and that is
strictly<00:02:04.620> because<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.940> achievement

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
strictly because of the one achievement

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.710 
strictly because of the one achievement
related<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> flappy<00:02:07.800> bird<00:02:07.980> minigame

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
related to the flappy bird minigame

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.840

otherwise<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:10.140> game<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.650> two<00:02:10.920> out<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.430> ten

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
otherwise this game is a two out of ten

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.010 
otherwise this game is a two out of ten
so<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.020> very<00:02:13.320> easy<00:02:13.620> all<00:02:14.600> 29<00:02:15.600> out<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.900> 30

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
so it is very easy all 29 out of 30

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.170 
so it is very easy all 29 out of 30
achievements<00:02:16.920> will<00:02:17.040> be<00:02:17.160> extremely<00:02:17.550> easy<00:02:17.730> for
