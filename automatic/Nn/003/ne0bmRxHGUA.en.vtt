through now we should easily be able to
take<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.430> out<00:03:06.530> even<00:03:07.530> though<00:03:07.590> it's<00:03:07.740> bubbling

are we going to try to tank this one I

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:32.810 
are we going to try to tank this one I
don't<00:03:19.530> think<00:03:19.710> so<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:30.950> got<00:03:31.950> new<00:03:32.130> new<00:03:32.310> chasing<00:03:32.700> me

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
don't think so I got new new chasing me

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.110 
don't think so I got new new chasing me
I<00:03:34.250> don't<00:03:35.250> think<00:03:35.400> he'll<00:03:35.490> be<00:03:35.640> able<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.820> keep<00:03:35.970> up

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
I don't think he'll be able to keep up

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.750 
I don't think he'll be able to keep up
that's<00:03:36.300> why<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.510> get<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.870> boots<00:03:37.110> three<00:03:37.760> because

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
that's why I get the boots three because

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.570 
that's why I get the boots three because
I<00:03:38.790> think<00:03:39.290> heimer<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.470> too<00:03:40.650> weak<00:03:40.890> overall<00:03:41.220> to

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
I think heimer is too weak overall to

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.150 
I think heimer is too weak overall to
basically<00:03:42.290> run<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.440> on<00:03:43.560> his<00:03:43.740> own<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.980> now<00:03:46.980> I'm

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
basically run it on his own and now I'm

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.440 
basically run it on his own and now I'm
just<00:03:47.310> going<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.550> come<00:03:47.730> over<00:03:47.760> here<00:03:48.000> by<00:03:48.390> these
