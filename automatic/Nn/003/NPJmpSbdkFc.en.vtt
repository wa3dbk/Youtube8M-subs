00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
setter you're going to want to serve

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.480 
setter you're going to want to serve
their<00:01:14.080> partners<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:14.800> they<00:01:14.979> have<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.250> set

their partners so that they have to set
the<00:01:15.640> ball<00:01:15.759> and<00:01:16.090> then<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:17.110> hitter<00:01:17.350> has<00:01:17.560> less

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
the ball and then the hitter has less

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.350 
the ball and then the hitter has less
options<00:01:18.430> because<00:01:18.700> it's<00:01:18.820> that's<00:01:19.000> not<00:01:19.180> going<00:01:19.270> to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.660 
options because it's that's not going to
be<00:01:19.390> as<00:01:19.509> good<00:01:19.800> again<00:01:20.800> you<00:01:21.130> need<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.310> look<00:01:21.490> at<00:01:21.580> the

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
be as good again you need to look at the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.850 
be as good again you need to look at the
wind<00:01:21.909> for<00:01:22.300> this<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.930> determine<00:01:23.470> which<00:01:23.619> is<00:01:23.740> the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
wind for this to determine which is the

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.980 
wind for this to determine which is the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
tougher set setting into the wind is

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.260 
tougher set setting into the wind is
generally<00:01:26.560> tougher<00:01:26.950> than<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.850> opposite

generally tougher than the opposite

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.760 
generally tougher than the opposite
direction<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:31.000> finally<00:01:31.660> look<00:01:32.320> at<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.560> hitter

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
direction and finally look at the hitter

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.910 
direction and finally look at the hitter
who<00:01:33.340> is<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.520> stronger<00:01:33.850> hitter<00:01:34.410> again<00:01:35.410> the<00:01:35.710> wind

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
who is a stronger hitter again the wind

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.330 
who is a stronger hitter again the wind
comes<00:01:36.070> into<00:01:36.340> play<00:01:36.550> here<00:01:36.580> if<00:01:37.030> there's<00:01:37.479> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
comes into play here if there's a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.680 
comes into play here if there's a
