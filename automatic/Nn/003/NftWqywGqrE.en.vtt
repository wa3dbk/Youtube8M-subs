00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
everything else is pretty cheap so you

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.460

done for less than 150 k which is
actually<00:06:44.660> good<00:06:45.020> because<00:06:45.050> you<00:06:45.440> get<00:06:45.560> 150<00:06:46.160> k

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510

and<00:06:49.320> Tim<00:06:50.320> Jennings<00:06:50.740> so<00:06:51.430> honestly<00:06:51.820> I<00:06:51.910> would

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
and Tim Jennings so honestly I would

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.670 
and Tim Jennings so honestly I would
probably<00:06:52.180> do<00:06:52.420> it<00:06:54.030> um<00:06:55.030> and<00:06:55.720> I<00:06:56.200> mean<00:06:56.410> it<00:06:56.530> just

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
probably do it um and I mean it just

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.170 
probably do it um and I mean it just
takes<00:06:57.040> a<00:06:57.190> long<00:06:57.370> time<00:06:57.430> that's<00:06:57.970> the<00:06:58.030> only

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
takes a long time that's the only

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.810 
takes a long time that's the only
problem<00:06:58.750> and<00:06:58.930> Tim<00:06:59.650> Jennings<00:06:59.890> is<00:07:00.010> only<00:07:00.130> 15<00:07:00.550> k<00:07:00.760> so

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:00.820 
problem and Tim Jennings is only 15 k so

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.310 
problem and Tim Jennings is only 15 k so
some<00:07:01.090> people<00:07:01.360> might<00:07:01.600> not<00:07:01.780> think<00:07:01.840> it's<00:07:02.170> worth

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
some people might not think it's worth

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.110 
some people might not think it's worth
it<00:07:02.500> just<00:07:02.740> to<00:07:02.860> spy<00:07:03.430> the<00:07:03.490> card<00:07:03.820> out<00:07:03.970> it's<00:07:04.570> easier

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 
it just to spy the card out it's easier

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.250
