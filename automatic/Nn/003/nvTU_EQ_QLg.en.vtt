00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
not naive enough to think that as my

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.669 
not naive enough to think that as my
teenagers<00:00:22.210> get<00:00:22.390> older<00:00:22.810> they're<00:00:23.349> not<00:00:23.560> gonna

and I know that finding that perfect

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.519 
and I know that finding that perfect
balance<00:00:26.589> can<00:00:27.099> be<00:00:27.130> very<00:00:27.609> very<00:00:27.999> difficult<00:00:28.529> so
