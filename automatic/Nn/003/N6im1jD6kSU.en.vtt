00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.209
 older friends invite you 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.509
 that is, trainings and seminars of the center 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.650
 reasonable way 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.449
 something sensible way is the frame of reference 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.500
 which says that every person 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.019
 is born 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.730
 for true style for development 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.710
 initially side 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.030
 live life we ​​will gladly say 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.820
 huge opportunities remain 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.270
 to 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.160
 almost all the goals we can 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.560
 set ourselves but we ourselves do not 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.300
 let what prices because inside 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.800
 our head 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.060
 there are a lot of barriers and which we 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.900
 cannot overcome and so may 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.370
 spoke bad everything around by the way what 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.980
 bad country bad protest bad sign 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.130
 about paying what is 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.750
 something makes me feel bad i am great 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.880
 this is mistake 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.480
 in these same layer for the same country 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.860
 percentage tens of thousands and millions 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.930
 other people even in this 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.650
 that is not so bad the country means 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.360
 something inside of me does not allow 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.120
 the result is 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.280
 technologists the collapse of the way allows 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.200
 figure out how I myself always 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.560
 there is also a problem on the way to the gsu guc 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.810
 so the technique which is called reasonable 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.270
 way killed barriers 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.390
 ships in their way barrier 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.000
 ideals barrier 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.460
 if new programs 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.260
