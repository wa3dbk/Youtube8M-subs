tip<00:01:50.970> wave<00:01:51.270> tic<00:01:51.990> tic<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.860> know<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.220> yeah

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
tip wave tic tic you know and just yeah

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.969 
tip wave tic tic you know and just yeah
so<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.200> kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.500> pattern<00:01:55.680> you

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
so that's just a kind of a pattern you

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.730 
so that's just a kind of a pattern you
can<00:01:56.100> use<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.689> play<00:01:57.899> around<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.469> start

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
can use to to just play around and start

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.700 
can use to to just play around and start
manipulating<00:01:58.920> beats<00:01:59.610> your<00:02:00.180> whole<00:02:00.360> freestyle

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
manipulating beats your whole freestyle

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.649 
manipulating beats your whole freestyle
consists<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.250> speed<00:02:02.580> changes<00:02:03.000> or<00:02:03.180> also<00:02:03.420> just

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
consists of speed changes or also just

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.380 
consists of speed changes or also just
look<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:05.460> you'll<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.850> be<00:02:06.000> going

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
look like this and you'll just be going

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.059 
look like this and you'll just be going
like<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:08.600> matrix<00:02:09.600> mode<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> technique

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
like a matrix mode this is a technique

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.820 
like a matrix mode this is a technique
you<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.400> use<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:12.810> make<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.050> easier<00:02:13.350> for<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.709> to

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you can use to make it easier for you to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.320 
you can use to make it easier for you to
ride<00:02:14.220> beats<00:02:14.520> because<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.940> know<00:02:15.000> some<00:02:15.300> people

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
ride beats because I know some people

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.420 
ride beats because I know some people
stack<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> lot<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.230> moves<00:02:16.440> one<00:02:16.800> over<00:02:17.040> after<00:02:17.340> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
stack a lot of moves one over after the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.920 
stack a lot of moves one over after the
other<00:02:17.580> they<00:02:18.090> start<00:02:18.270> running<00:02:18.569> out<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.690> moves

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
other they start running out of moves

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.780 
other they start running out of moves
and<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.290> really<00:02:19.590> don't<00:02:19.739> get<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.130> chance<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.640> get

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
and you really don't get a chance to get

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.910 
and you really don't get a chance to get
into<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.270> song<00:02:21.450> as<00:02:21.630> much<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.170> reason<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.500> like

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
into the song as much the reason I like

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.820 
into the song as much the reason I like
so<00:02:22.980> much<00:02:23.100> free<00:02:23.370> style<00:02:23.610> dancers<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.150> because

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
so much free style dancers is because

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
so much free style dancers is because
you<00:02:25.830> don't<00:02:25.980> know<00:02:26.100> what<00:02:26.250> kind<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.459> technique

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
you don't know what kind of technique

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.940 
you don't know what kind of technique
they<00:02:27.000> have<00:02:27.180> behind<00:02:27.540> their<00:02:27.780> dancing<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.800> know

they give me a popper you have popping
techniques<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:31.500> then<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:31.800> little<00:02:31.920> baby

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
techniques and then have a little baby

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.100 
techniques and then have a little baby
boy<00:02:32.400> techniques<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.300> when<00:02:33.420> they<00:02:33.540> freestyle

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
boy techniques and when they freestyle

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.509 
boy techniques and when they freestyle
and<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.410> mesh<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.800> all<00:02:34.950> together<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.400> see

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
and just mesh that all together and see

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.150 
and just mesh that all together and see
what<00:02:35.670> comes<00:02:35.820> out<00:02:36.140> that's<00:02:37.140> when<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.980> know<00:02:38.100> you

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
what comes out that's when you know you

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.620 
what comes out that's when you know you
can<00:02:38.400> see<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.580> whole<00:02:38.820> different<00:02:39.150> flavor<00:02:39.269> you

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
can see a whole different flavor you

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.890 
can see a whole different flavor you
know<00:02:39.720> da<00:02:40.050> da<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.800> least<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:42.420> hopefully<00:02:42.750> what

know da da the least so hopefully what

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.270 
know da da the least so hopefully what

that's my three styles beautiful because
it's<00:03:06.900> off<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.140> top<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.530> dome<00:03:07.739> well<00:03:08.100> it

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
it's off the top of the dome well it

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.509 
it's off the top of the dome well it
should<00:03:08.400> be<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.650> yeah<00:03:10.829> you<00:03:11.100> just<00:03:11.220> kind<00:03:11.459> of

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
should be and and yeah you just kind of

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.729 
should be and and yeah you just kind of
see<00:03:11.670> what<00:03:11.790> flows<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.510> moment<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.470> let's<00:03:13.650> go

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
see what flows in the moment so let's go

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.400 
see what flows in the moment so let's go
back<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.950> speed<00:03:14.280> changes<00:03:14.700> okay<00:03:15.079> say<00:03:16.079> I<00:03:16.110> do<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
back to speed changes okay say I do a

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.390 
back to speed changes okay say I do a
speech<00:03:16.739> in<00:03:16.980> speed<00:03:17.489> change<00:03:17.820> milk<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:19.400> maybe

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
speech in speed change milk and maybe

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.920 
speech in speed change milk and maybe
I'm<00:03:20.730> using<00:03:20.910> too<00:03:21.120> much<00:03:21.239> about<00:03:21.450> upper<00:03:21.660> body<00:03:21.690> I
