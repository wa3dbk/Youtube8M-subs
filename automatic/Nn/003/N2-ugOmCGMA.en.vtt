00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
chapters or something like that because

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.319

you can find that some of the book will
cost<00:01:00.629> less<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.140> way<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.520> you're<00:01:02.699> not

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920 
able to do this I know that a lot of
students<00:01:05.519> can't<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.970> because<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.720> lot<00:01:06.900> of

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
students can't do this because a lot of

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.300 
students can't do this because a lot of
professors<00:01:07.200> don't<00:01:07.530> decide<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.979> book<00:01:08.100> list
