can

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.390 

well<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.990> decision<00:00:52.500> tree<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.890> looked<00:00:53.220> at

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
well a decision tree can be looked at

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.760 
well a decision tree can be looked at
either<00:00:53.670> micro<00:00:54.270> Lee<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.540> macro<00:00:54.780> Lee<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.320> macro

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
either micro Lee or macro Lee and macro

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.680 
either micro Lee or macro Lee and macro
is<00:00:55.950> a<00:00:55.980> lot<00:00:56.220> easier<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.610> understand<00:00:57.000> macro<00:00:57.540> Lee

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
is a lot easier to understand macro Lee

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.350 
is a lot easier to understand macro Lee
you<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.410> say<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.980> want<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.280> throw<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.790> left

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
you can say do I want to throw a left

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.390 
you can say do I want to throw a left
punch<00:01:00.720> or<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.050> Right<00:01:01.410> punch<00:01:01.440> that's<00:01:02.070> called<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
punch or a Right punch that's called a

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.640 
punch or a Right punch that's called a
cluster<00:01:02.880> will<00:01:03.270> imagine<00:01:03.720> if<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.989> could<00:01:04.170> do

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
cluster will imagine if you could do

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.219 
cluster will imagine if you could do
certain<00:01:05.070> movement<00:01:05.640> patterns<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.660> make<00:01:06.990> that

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
certain movement patterns to make that

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.620 
certain movement patterns to make that
fight<00:01:07.590> predictable<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.550> say<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.910> am<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
fight predictable so say I am going to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.030 
fight predictable so say I am going to
move<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.960> place<00:01:10.200> where<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:10.560> he<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.010> is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
move in a place where all he can do is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.040 
move in a place where all he can do is
hit<00:01:11.340> me<00:01:11.430> with<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.670> right<00:01:11.880> hand<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.840> then<00:01:12.960> I'm

hit me with this right hand so then I'm

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.780 
hit me with this right hand so then I'm
just<00:01:13.170> waiting<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.800> as<00:01:14.369> soon<00:01:14.430> as<00:01:14.670> that

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
many shots to the head that set up

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
many shots to the head that set up
predictability<00:02:04.289> in<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> system<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.369> that's

predictability in the system and that's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.850 
predictability in the system and that's
a<00:02:05.640> lot<00:02:05.970> of<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.179> clustering<00:02:06.599> is<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.259> makes

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
a lot of a clustering is it makes

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.339 
a lot of a clustering is it makes
fighting<00:02:08.789> predictable<00:02:09.330> having<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:10.080> mind

fighting predictable having that in mind
all<00:02:10.740> you're<00:02:11.039> doing<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.400> clustering<00:02:11.880> over<00:02:12.030> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
all you're doing is clustering over and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.910 
all you're doing is clustering over and
over<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.780> over<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.170> putting<00:02:13.470> yourself<00:02:13.800> in

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
over and over is putting yourself in

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.860 
over and over is putting yourself in
these<00:02:14.010> positions<00:02:14.220> where<00:02:14.760> no<00:02:15.360> matter<00:02:15.540> what

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
they do they're gonna get naked

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.580 
they do they're gonna get naked
the<00:02:20.150> process<00:02:20.599> is<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.780> only<00:02:20.959> thing<00:02:21.200> that<00:02:21.319> I<00:02:21.349> own

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
the process is the only thing that I own

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.530 
the process is the only thing that I own
I<00:02:21.620> don't<00:02:21.950> own<00:02:22.099> that<00:02:22.310> victory<00:02:22.700> like<00:02:23.420> the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
I don't own that victory like the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.149 
I don't own that victory like the
victory<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.079> theirs<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.650> process<00:02:24.890> is

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
victory is theirs but the process is

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.830 
victory is theirs but the process is
mine<00:02:25.579> and<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.879> fighters<00:02:26.209> together<00:02:26.569> like

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
mine and the fighters together like

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.599 
mine and the fighters together like
that's<00:02:27.049> we<00:02:27.290> share<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.560> every<00:02:28.069> day<00:02:28.189> we<00:02:28.219> share
