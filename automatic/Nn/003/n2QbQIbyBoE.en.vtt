00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.066
- [Donnie] Hey this is Donnie
Smith and I just wanted

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.643
to reach out to the
people in Moore, Oklahoma.

00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:09.590
I know you got hit with a
really big tornado yesterday,

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.763
it did a lot of damage.

00:00:10.763 --> 00:00:13.747
I know there's gonna be
a lot of rebuilding and

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:17.159
I know that it hit some
schools and things like that

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:19.351
now I know it's very
terrible and a very hard time

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:21.655
for you but I just wanted
to let you know that I'm

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:22.804
praying for you,

00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:25.856
let you know that there's
other people praying for you.

00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:28.929
Hey this is Donnie Smith
and welcome to this lesson.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.893
This lesson we're gonna show
you how to prep a fender

00:00:31.893 --> 00:00:33.143
before priming.

00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:38.020
Well it's summer time and
for us that means trips

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.010
to the ballpark,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.843
water skiing,

00:00:39.843 --> 00:00:43.213
and other fun activities we
have planned this summer.

00:00:43.213 --> 00:00:44.695
But we're also gonna be
in this garage working on

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:47.157
the Mustang and doing
other car projects and

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:49.551
showing you step by step
how to do these things.

00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:50.617
- [Young Boy] Hey dad,

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.757
why don't we show them
how to build something.

00:00:52.757 --> 00:00:54.104
- [Donnie] Build something?

00:00:54.104 --> 00:00:56.496
You mean like a shed or something?

00:00:56.496 --> 00:00:58.407
- [Young Boy] Well you showed
us how to do some things

00:00:58.407 --> 00:00:59.679
they might wanna know too.

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.046
- [Donnie] Yeah but we've
just done some things

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:01.915
around the house.

00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:03.924
I mean I don't really
know nothin much about

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:05.329
building things.

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.245
- [Boy] Aren't you an instructor?

00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:08.558
- [Donnie] Well yeah I'm an instructor,

00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:10.519
but I teach auto body and paint you know,

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:13.906
I teach people how to paint
cars you know at school

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.674
and in videos.

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:17.799
Construction and building things,

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.447
I don't know anything about that.

00:01:19.447 --> 00:01:20.748
But I'll tell you what I'll do

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:22.873
(mumbles) and woodwork.

00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:25.900
I mean he's they guy that knows
all about that sorta thing

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.282
I mean whether you're looking
to build a deck or a shed

00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:30.394
or a chair or table,

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:31.227
I mean he's got plans and

00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:32.060
blueprints trade all that you need.

00:01:35.097 --> 00:01:38.937
He's got over 16,000 plans
and you click the link right

00:01:38.937 --> 00:01:42.280
here CollisionBlast.com/WoodWorking,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.111
you can save 20 dollars.

00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:47.438
Now I may do this a little
bit different than what you've

00:01:47.438 --> 00:01:48.361
seen cause I,

00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:50.729
I actually prepped the
entire fender you know for

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.885
primer paint and clear
if it's a blend panel.

00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:58.000
I go ahead and do all my
prepping before I ever prime

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.565
now I do this for a reason,

00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:03.476
cause a common mistake I see
with students and beginners

00:02:03.476 --> 00:02:07.610
is that they prime out further
than they're intending to

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.025
and maybe where is
wasn't scuffed real good

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:13.242
and the primer gets on
top of that and then that

00:02:13.242 --> 00:02:15.159
has a chance of peeling later.

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.605
Or when you're sanding it
there's always a glossy ring

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:21.856
around where you're sanding
cause that's where it's not

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:23.309
sanded well.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.268
And the primer doesn't
feather well like that either,

00:02:26.268 --> 00:02:29.191
you'll keep on havin that
ring till you get back to

00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:31.376
the area od where it's sanded.

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:32.699
So if you follow the
steps that I'm gonna show

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.127
you in this video,

00:02:34.127 --> 00:02:35.415
you won't have that problem.

00:02:35.415 --> 00:02:37.170
Now I'm not saying this
is the only way to do it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.995
if you're an experienced
painter you probably are

00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:41.720
pretty good at getting the
primer exactly where you want it

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.509
and even though the whole panels prepped,

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:45.342
this is not sayin that

00:02:45.342 --> 00:02:48.074
you wanna get primer everywhere either,

00:02:48.074 --> 00:02:50.300
This is just a way to be safe.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.447
Now in previous videos in this series,

00:02:52.447 --> 00:02:53.973
we've already done the bodywork,

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:55.384
we've applied the body filler,

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:56.975
finished it out with 80.

00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:58.484
We've applied putty,

00:02:58.484 --> 00:03:00.670
finished it out with
150 hammering everything

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.040
feathering nice.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.276
Now we're gonna go ahead and
prep it anywhere the paints

00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:08.822
gonna get primer or paint
needs to be sanded with 500.

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:13.072
Anywhere from 150 to 500
primer will stick to that,

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.909
so we've got some of the 150
grit scratches in the putty

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.782
and then it will blend into the 500.

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:21.089
Now where the clear coats
at we don't wanna sand

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:22.819
that with 500 cause the clear coat won't

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.042
cover those scratches,

00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:26.929
you'll see through the clear
and see those scratches.

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:28.542
So we're gonna sand
anywhere that's gonna be

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.736
clear coat only with 800.

00:03:30.736 --> 00:03:33.013
Now we're gonna do all of
this before we ever prime,

00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:34.559
and we'll show you how.

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:37.736
First thing you wanna do is
protect your adjacent panels,

00:03:37.736 --> 00:03:41.289
now on this door I'm using a
inch and a half making tape

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:44.286
and that way scuff pad hits
it or DA slips a little bit

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:46.525
it's gonna hit that
tape and not the panel,

00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:48.548
won't damage it that way.

00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:51.738
And on the hood I just have it raised and

00:03:51.738 --> 00:03:54.738
notice I'm also using that interface pad.

00:03:54.738 --> 00:03:56.336
You should always do that
whenever you're final

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.367
sanding with these finer grits,

00:03:58.367 --> 00:04:01.478
cause I'm gonna go ahead
and sand this entire panel

00:04:01.478 --> 00:04:02.920
what's gonna be painted and what's gonna

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.242
be clear coated.

00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:07.170
And I wanna do all of this
before I ever start the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.503
priming process.

00:04:10.096 --> 00:04:12.637
So first I'm gonna start with my 500,

00:04:12.637 --> 00:04:16.188
and this is just gonna be
used where paint is gonna

00:04:16.188 --> 00:04:20.090
where the paint's gonna be applied to.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.736
So I go back past my repair area,

00:04:22.736 --> 00:04:27.509
using this 500 grit and I'm
gonna leave a little room

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.865
in the back for blending.

00:04:29.865 --> 00:04:31.029
And when we get to that step,

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:34.323
I'm gonna switch to the 800
grit because clear doesn't

00:04:34.323 --> 00:04:35.787
really cover the 500.

00:04:35.787 --> 00:04:37.869
If you tried to clear with 500,

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:40.407
you'd be able to see those
scratches through it.

00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:44.924
So anywhere 500 is applied
you want to make sure

00:04:44.924 --> 00:04:46.729
that that is painted.

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.416
Okay now I have switched
the 800 and I'm gonna

00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:52.085
do just this back area.

00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:54.570
And you need to be careful
not to burn through any edges

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.403
or anything,

00:04:55.403 --> 00:04:58.018
cause if you do you're gonna
have to paint that spot.

00:04:58.018 --> 00:05:02.268
You just wanna scuff up
the clear coat so I'm going

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.590
over that area and if
you're not comfortable

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.703
with the DA,

00:05:06.703 --> 00:05:08.551
afraid you might burn through,

00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:10.528
You can wet sand it with 800.

00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:13.028
You could get the same results

00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:17.112
it will just take a little bit longer.

00:05:17.112 --> 00:05:20.300
I've got all the areas with 800,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.227
then I'm gonna get a gray scuff pad.

00:05:22.227 --> 00:05:26.830
You wanna use gray because
it's finer than the red one.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.064
And it's really good for
your edges your hard to get

00:05:30.064 --> 00:05:32.840
places cause sometimes the DA doesn't get

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.124
in the hard to get areas
like a scuff pad can.

00:05:36.124 --> 00:05:38.714
And I like to get the edges
extra good because the

00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:42.336
paint's gonna peel from the edges.

00:05:42.336 --> 00:05:44.820
So I'm gonna go round
the edges really good

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.201
with this scuff pad,

00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:50.031
and I'm also just gonna go
ahead and go over the entire

00:05:50.031 --> 00:05:51.948
fender with it as well.

00:05:54.944 --> 00:05:58.985
Once I've got this entire fender scuffed,

00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:02.112
I can blow it off make sure
there's no glossy spots.

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:02.945
If there is ,

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.411
I can go ahead and scuff it up.

00:06:04.411 --> 00:06:06.669
So I'm kinda looking at
it and once you have it

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.891
scuffed basically you
have it ready for primer.

00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:13.763
Now if any primer gets over
further than you's intending,

00:06:13.763 --> 00:06:15.668
you're not gonna have that peeling problem

00:06:15.668 --> 00:06:18.918
It is gonna be applied on sanded paint.

00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:23.759
Now we're ready to blow it off,

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:24.592
wipe it down,

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:25.425
clean it up,

00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:27.670
and get it ready for the booth to apply

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.902
some Epoxy primer cause we've got some

00:06:29.902 --> 00:06:33.471
metal showing or we could
use self edge primer.

00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:37.233
And then we're gonna apply
some primer surfacer.

00:06:37.233 --> 00:06:38.515
