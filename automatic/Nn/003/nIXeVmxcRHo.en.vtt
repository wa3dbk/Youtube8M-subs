00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
warping and stretching out too bad so to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.500 
warping and stretching out too bad so to
dry<00:00:31.830> perfectly<00:00:32.460> flat<00:00:32.669> no<00:00:32.910> matter<00:00:33.090> how<00:00:33.300> wet<00:00:33.480> you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
dry perfectly flat no matter how wet you

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.350 
dry perfectly flat no matter how wet you
get<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:35.219> what<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.430> need<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.090> start

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
get it so what you need to do to start

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.940 
get it so what you need to do to start
first<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.930> need<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.110> draw<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.410> clouds<00:00:37.710> and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
first is you need to draw the clouds and

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.680 
first is you need to draw the clouds and
how<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> do<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.910> make<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.270> light<00:00:39.480> wash

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
how you do that is you make a light wash

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.080 
how you do that is you make a light wash
of<00:00:40.110> India<00:00:40.920> ink<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.579> little<00:00:41.790> bit<00:00:41.910> goes<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
of India ink and a little bit goes a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.760 
of India ink and a little bit goes a
long<00:00:42.270> way<00:00:42.510> because<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.379> really

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
long way because it's really really

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.600 
long way because it's really really
thick<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> use<00:00:44.340> Higgins<00:00:45.000> black<00:00:45.300> ink<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
thick and I use Higgins black ink and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
thick and I use Higgins black ink and
you<00:00:47.610> need<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.850> wet<00:00:48.090> down<00:00:48.120> your<00:00:48.420> paper<00:00:48.629> with

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
you need to wet down your paper with

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.850 
you need to wet down your paper with
clean<00:00:49.590> water<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.850> use<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.500> staple<00:00:52.500> brush

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
clean water and then use a staple brush

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
clean water and then use a staple brush
to<00:00:53.100> lay<00:00:53.250> down<00:00:53.280> some<00:00:53.489> blobs<00:00:54.149> that'll<00:00:54.570> be<00:00:54.690> your

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
to lay down some blobs that'll be your

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.020 
to lay down some blobs that'll be your
clouds<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.440> make<00:00:55.620> sure<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> leave<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.850> leave

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
clouds and make sure you leave you leave

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.869 
clouds and make sure you leave you leave
some<00:00:57.270> white<00:00:57.660> spaces<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:59.840> the<00:01:01.460> most<00:01:02.460> my<00:01:02.699> rule

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
some white spaces and the most my rule

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.429 
some white spaces and the most my rule
of<00:01:02.969> thumb<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.180> drawing<00:01:03.600> skies<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
of thumb for drawing skies is that you

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.580 
of thumb for drawing skies is that you
have<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.430> higher<00:01:06.090> clouds<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.840> little

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
have to do the higher clouds a little

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.320 
have to do the higher clouds a little
darker<00:01:07.920> because<00:01:08.070> they're<00:01:08.310> closer<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.090> and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
darker because they're closer to you and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.840 
darker because they're closer to you and
as<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.229> down<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> bottom<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.610> clouds

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
as you get down at the bottom the clouds

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.550 
as you get down at the bottom the clouds
are<00:01:12.030> much<00:01:12.210> much<00:01:12.450> smaller<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.140> much<00:01:13.290> much

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
are much much smaller and much much

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.060 
are much much smaller and much much
lighter<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.900> ever<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.200> pretty<00:01:16.770> much<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
lighter and ever and pretty much the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.410 
lighter and ever and pretty much the
rule<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.310> thumb<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.610> watercolor<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.240> that

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
rule of thumb with watercolor is that

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.910 
rule of thumb with watercolor is that
you<00:01:18.540> make<00:01:18.750> everything<00:01:19.170> closest<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.770> you

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you make everything closest to you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.219 
you make everything closest to you
darker<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.610> everything<00:01:21.240> farthest<00:01:21.659> lighter

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
darker and everything farthest lighter

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.859 
darker and everything farthest lighter
and<00:01:22.500> now<00:01:23.220> I'm<00:01:23.490> using<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:24.030> fountain<00:01:24.450> pen<00:01:24.479> filled

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
and now I'm using a fountain pen filled

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.780 
and now I'm using a fountain pen filled
with<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.080> same<00:01:25.290> ink<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.189> draw<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> basic

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
with the same ink to draw a basic

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.730 
with the same ink to draw a basic
outline<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:27.420> treat<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:29.630> now<00:01:30.630> I'm<00:01:30.900> using<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
outline of my treat and now I'm using a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.789 
outline of my treat and now I'm using a
colored<00:01:32.400> pencil<00:01:32.579> made<00:01:33.150> into<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> dip<00:01:34.259> pen<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
colored pencil made into a dip pen to

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.010 
colored pencil made into a dip pen to
draw<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:35.310> leaves<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.570> sort<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
draw some leaves and it's sort of a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.810 
draw some leaves and it's sort of a
stipple<00:01:37.409> effect<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.189> don't<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> go<00:01:38.729> in

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
stipple effect you don't have to go in

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.160 
stipple effect you don't have to go in
too<00:01:38.939> much<00:01:39.060> detail<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.570> don't<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
too much detail you don't have to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.950 
too much detail you don't have to
address<00:01:40.950> every<00:01:41.430> single<00:01:41.479> leaf<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.720> the

address every single leaf on the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.770 
address every single leaf on the
branches<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.520> should<00:01:44.790> make<00:01:45.060> sort<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
branches but you should make sort of a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.039 
branches but you should make sort of a
rough<00:01:46.710> outline<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.490> it'll<00:01:48.000> make<00:01:48.450> any<00:01:48.810> look

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
rough outline and it'll make any look

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.969 
rough outline and it'll make any look
like<00:01:49.200> right<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.590> our<00:01:49.950> leaves<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.710> now<00:01:52.860> I'm

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
like right like our leaves so now I'm

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.969 
like right like our leaves so now I'm
using<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.460> size<00:01:54.329> zero<00:01:54.630> sable<00:01:55.350> brush<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.770> blend

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
using a size zero sable brush to blend

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.569 
using a size zero sable brush to blend
and<00:01:56.570> now<00:01:57.570> I'm<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:58.110> over<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.250> ink

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and now I'm going over that with the ink

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.929 
and now I'm going over that with the ink
and<00:01:59.850> sort<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.390> use<00:02:01.310> don't--don't<00:02:02.310> stipple<00:02:02.790> as

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and sort of use don't--don't stipple as

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.389 
and sort of use don't--don't stipple as
much<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.479> lay<00:02:04.320> down<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> few<00:02:04.860> blobs<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
much as lay down a few blobs of

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.539 
much as lay down a few blobs of
different<00:02:05.850> different<00:02:06.180> sizes

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
different different sizes

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.800 
different different sizes
and<00:02:07.909> uh<00:02:08.649> as<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:10.190> can<00:02:10.369> see<00:02:10.580> now<00:02:11.209> there's<00:02:11.569> some

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
and uh as you can see now there's some

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.660 
and uh as you can see now there's some
there's<00:02:12.260> some<00:02:12.470> holes<00:02:12.680> with<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.040> sky<00:02:13.310> showing

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
there's some holes with the sky showing

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.699 
there's some holes with the sky showing
in<00:02:13.910> my<00:02:14.060> tree<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.540> what<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.110> want<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.379> do<00:02:15.530> is

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
in my tree and what you want to do is

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.190 
in my tree and what you want to do is
you<00:02:15.890> want<00:02:16.069> to<00:02:16.129> do<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.060> top<00:02:17.239> of<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.540> sky<00:02:17.870> holes

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
you want to do the top of the sky holes

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.130 
you want to do the top of the sky holes
darker<00:02:18.769> than<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.099> bottom<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.930> everything<00:02:20.930> and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
darker than the bottom so everything and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.440 
darker than the bottom so everything and
in<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.890> sky<00:02:22.340> hole<00:02:22.519> is<00:02:22.610> getting<00:02:22.879> light<00:02:23.060> but<00:02:23.330> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
in the sky hole is getting light but the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.790 
in the sky hole is getting light but the
top

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.310 

now<00:02:32.400> go<00:02:33.030> over<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.630> blend<00:02:33.900> it's<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.200> good

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
now go over it and blend it's a good

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.100 
now go over it and blend it's a good
idea<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.590> have<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:35.100> paper<00:02:35.910> towel<00:02:36.180> or<00:02:36.450> some<00:02:36.660> or<00:02:37.080> a

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
idea to have a paper towel or some or a

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:47.770 
idea to have a paper towel or some or a
tissue<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.770> blob<00:02:38.700> out<00:02:38.850> some<00:02:39.030> extra<00:02:39.360> ink

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.660 

so<00:02:48.350> now<00:02:48.470> I'm<00:02:48.530> moving<00:02:48.800> on<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.130> background

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
so now I'm moving on to the background

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.640 
so now I'm moving on to the background
and<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.240> background<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:51.380> don't<00:02:51.530> want

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
and in the background you you don't want

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.800 
and in the background you you don't want
to<00:02:51.740> go<00:02:51.890> into<00:02:52.100> as<00:02:52.220> much<00:02:52.250> detail<00:02:52.670> because<00:02:53.510> it

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
to go into as much detail because it

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.660 
to go into as much detail because it
will<00:02:53.930> distract<00:02:54.290> your<00:02:54.890> attention<00:02:55.340> from<00:02:55.460> your

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
will distract your attention from your

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.280 
will distract your attention from your
main<00:02:55.790> subject<00:02:56.090> but<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:56.750> want<00:02:56.990> to<00:02:57.050> address

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
main subject but you want to address

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.040 
main subject but you want to address
things<00:02:58.090> just<00:02:59.090> making<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.540> clouds<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.990> little

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
things just making the clouds a little

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.440 
things just making the clouds a little
darker<00:03:00.590> apply<00:03:01.250> some<00:03:01.460> color<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.940> then<00:03:02.060> blob<00:03:02.300> up

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
darker apply some color and then blob up

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.030 
darker apply some color and then blob up
the<00:03:02.630> extra<00:03:03.020> with<00:03:03.200> with<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.680> bigger<00:03:03.890> towel

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
the extra with with the bigger towel

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.180 
the extra with with the bigger towel
this<00:03:07.040> for<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.580> small<00:03:07.820> details<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.330> when<00:03:08.510> the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
this for the small details is when the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.890 
this for the small details is when the
small<00:03:10.190> brush<00:03:10.370> really<00:03:10.700> comes<00:03:10.910> in<00:03:11.060> handy<00:03:11.240> and

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
small brush really comes in handy and

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.380 
small brush really comes in handy and
now<00:03:12.140> I'm<00:03:12.290> drawing<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.340> grass<00:03:13.550> friend<00:03:14.270> of

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
now I'm drawing the the grass friend of

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.300 
now I'm drawing the the grass friend of
the<00:03:14.480> tree<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:14.930> I'm<00:03:15.050> using<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.410> fan<00:03:15.709> brush<00:03:15.740> I

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
the tree and I'm using a fan brush I

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.260 
the tree and I'm using a fan brush I
think<00:03:16.940> it's<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.090> size<00:03:17.300> 4<00:03:17.660> but<00:03:18.850> how<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:19.910> do<00:03:20.150> this

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
think it's a size 4 but how you do this

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.530 
think it's a size 4 but how you do this
is<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.600> you<00:03:21.520> you<00:03:22.520> make<00:03:22.700> sure<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.239> don't

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
is that you you make sure that you don't

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.510 
is that you you make sure that you don't
go<00:03:23.720> into<00:03:23.870> as<00:03:24.050> much<00:03:24.200> detail<00:03:24.410> as<00:03:24.739> well<00:03:24.950> as<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.220> tree

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
go into as much detail as well as a tree

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.550 
go into as much detail as well as a tree
because<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:26.000> will<00:03:26.090> sort<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.540> look<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.989> little

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
because it will sort of look a little

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.729 
because it will sort of look a little
overdone<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:29.180> good<00:03:29.510> rule<00:03:30.140> for<00:03:30.410> doing<00:03:30.650> this

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
overdone and a good rule for doing this

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.160 
overdone and a good rule for doing this
is<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.370> address<00:03:32.330> only<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.690> blades<00:03:33.020> of

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
is that you address only the blades of

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.229 
is that you address only the blades of
grass<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.650> are<00:03:33.770> in<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.160> in<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.850> shadow<00:03:35.120> of

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
grass that are in the in the shadow of

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.030 
grass that are in the in the shadow of
the<00:03:35.450> tree<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.989> rest<00:03:36.230> is<00:03:36.440> just<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.770> wash

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
the tree and the rest is just the wash

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.710 
the tree and the rest is just the wash
and<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:37.760> will<00:03:38.030> make<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.239> look<00:03:38.480> like<00:03:38.600> the

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
and that will make it look like the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.670 
and that will make it look like the
entire<00:03:39.020> hill<00:03:39.350> is<00:03:39.500> filled<00:03:39.800> with<00:03:39.950> grass<00:03:41.680> do

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
entire hill is filled with grass do

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.330 
entire hill is filled with grass do
small<00:03:43.070> strokes<00:03:43.700> sort<00:03:44.270> of<00:03:44.360> stippling<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:45.340> don't

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
small strokes sort of stippling it don't

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.380 
small strokes sort of stippling it don't
do<00:03:46.459> long<00:03:46.670> strokes<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:48.700> in<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.820> background<00:03:50.270> as

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
do long strokes and in the background as

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.240 
do long strokes and in the background as
I<00:03:50.480> said<00:03:50.750> you<00:03:51.170> don't<00:03:51.290> go<00:03:51.470> into<00:03:51.650> as<00:03:51.830> much<00:03:51.860> detail

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
I said you don't go into as much detail

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:03.229 
I said you don't go into as much detail
but<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:52.670> do<00:03:52.880> address<00:03:53.209> things

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.179 

when<00:04:03.810> selecting<00:04:04.260> brushes<00:04:04.650> make<00:04:04.890> sure<00:04:05.069> you

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
when selecting brushes make sure you

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.880 
when selecting brushes make sure you
select<00:04:05.549> sable<00:04:06.420> or<00:04:06.599> at<00:04:07.409> least<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.769> good

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
select sable or at least a good

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.119 
select sable or at least a good
synthetic<00:04:08.129> because<00:04:09.200> they<00:04:10.200> hold<00:04:10.469> color<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.859> lot

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
synthetic because they hold color a lot

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.530 
synthetic because they hold color a lot
better<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:11.849> don't<00:04:12.000> have<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.239> read<00:04:12.390> it

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
better and you don't have to read it

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.390 
better and you don't have to read it
them<00:04:12.780> as<00:04:12.959> much<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.500> if<00:04:13.799> you<00:04:13.890> don't<00:04:14.069> have<00:04:14.250> to

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
them as much and if you don't have to

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.470 
them as much and if you don't have to
read<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:14.640> them<00:04:14.849> then<00:04:15.000> they<00:04:15.150> will<00:04:15.269> make<00:04:15.420> a

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
read it them then they will make a

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.249 
read it them then they will make a
smooth<00:04:15.900> watercolor<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.829> I<00:04:18.109> from<00:04:19.109> my

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
smooth watercolor and I from my

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.640 
smooth watercolor and I from my
experience<00:04:20.000> synthetic<00:04:21.000> brushes<00:04:21.269> make<00:04:22.199> things

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
experience synthetic brushes make things

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.340 
experience synthetic brushes make things
a<00:04:22.889> little<00:04:23.009> blotchy<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.789> you<00:04:24.570> can<00:04:24.750> see<00:04:24.930> strokes

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
a little blotchy and you can see strokes

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.270 
a little blotchy and you can see strokes
and<00:04:26.630> sable<00:04:27.630> brushes<00:04:27.870> have<00:04:28.199> a<00:04:28.259> much<00:04:28.919> smoother

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
and sable brushes have a much smoother

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.640 
and sable brushes have a much smoother
lay<00:04:29.789> down<00:04:31.580> so<00:04:32.580> I've<00:04:32.699> selected<00:04:32.880> my<00:04:33.650> light

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
lay down so I've selected my light

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.650 
lay down so I've selected my light
source<00:04:34.860> from<00:04:35.370> coming<00:04:35.820> from<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.210> back<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:36.630> that

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
source from coming from the back so that

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.120 
source from coming from the back so that
means<00:04:37.020> almost<00:04:37.860> all<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.280> tree<00:04:38.520> will<00:04:38.699> be<00:04:38.729> dark

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
means almost all the tree will be dark

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.680 
means almost all the tree will be dark
it's<00:04:41.130> not<00:04:41.250> coming<00:04:41.639> from<00:04:41.729> any<00:04:41.970> particular<00:04:42.150> side

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
it's not coming from any particular side

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:52.920 
it's not coming from any particular side
just<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.740> back<00:04:43.919> of<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.660> background

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.790 

but<00:04:53.930> it<00:04:54.080> is<00:04:54.230> geared<00:04:54.620> towards<00:04:55.100> serve<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.210> right

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
but it is geared towards serve the right

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.140 
but it is geared towards serve the right
so<00:04:57.800> back<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:58.430> can<00:04:58.610> see<00:04:58.790> that<00:04:58.970> in<00:04:59.090> the

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
so back you can see that in the

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.920 
so back you can see that in the
background<00:04:59.360> trees<00:05:00.580> so<00:05:01.580> now<00:05:01.730> I'm<00:05:01.850> laying<00:05:02.810> down

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
background trees so now I'm laying down

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.260 
background trees so now I'm laying down
as<00:05:03.170> I<00:05:03.320> set<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:03.740> top<00:05:04.010> of<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.730> clouds<00:05:04.970> it's<00:05:05.210> a

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
as I set the top of the clouds it's a

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.870 
as I set the top of the clouds it's a
little<00:05:05.510> darker<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:06.620> don't<00:05:07.310> be<00:05:07.550> afraid<00:05:07.730> to

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
little darker so don't be afraid to

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.930 
little darker so don't be afraid to
really<00:05:08.060> get<00:05:08.330> a<00:05:08.480> lot<00:05:08.870> of<00:05:09.020> paint<00:05:09.230> on<00:05:09.320> there

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
really get a lot of paint on there

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.220 
really get a lot of paint on there
because<00:05:10.940> since<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:11.720> stretch<00:05:11.960> out<00:05:12.110> your

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
because since you stretch out your

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.960 
because since you stretch out your
watercolor<00:05:12.740> paper<00:05:13.010> then<00:05:13.370> it's<00:05:13.610> I'm<00:05:13.760> going<00:05:13.910> to

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
watercolor paper then it's I'm going to

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.890 
watercolor paper then it's I'm going to
bend<00:05:14.180> or<00:05:14.360> wood<00:05:18.010> and<00:05:19.330> when<00:05:20.330> drawing<00:05:20.540> clouds

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
bend or wood and when drawing clouds

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.660 
bend or wood and when drawing clouds
it's<00:05:21.230> good<00:05:21.500> that<00:05:21.680> ink<00:05:21.860> runs<00:05:22.100> because<00:05:22.310> it'll

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
it's good that ink runs because it'll

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.790 
it's good that ink runs because it'll
create<00:05:22.910> a<00:05:23.030> really<00:05:23.570> really<00:05:23.870> soft<00:05:24.110> feel<00:05:24.470> and

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
create a really really soft feel and

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.430 
create a really really soft feel and
it'll<00:05:25.760> make<00:05:25.910> them<00:05:26.120> a<00:05:26.240> lot<00:05:26.300> more<00:05:26.390> realistic

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440
