00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.160 

my<00:02:04.170> mark<00:02:04.500> what's<00:02:04.770> up<00:02:07.130> there<00:02:08.130> is<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> problem

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
my mark what's up there is a problem

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.080 
my mark what's up there is a problem
this<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.680> problem<00:02:10.710> but<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:11.940> steal

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
this is a problem but we can just steal

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.030 
this is a problem but we can just steal
if<00:02:12.300> he<00:02:12.420> doesn't<00:02:12.810> kill<00:02:13.050> my<00:02:13.230> mark<00:02:13.440> which<00:02:13.620> don't

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
if he doesn't kill my mark which don't

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.910 
if he doesn't kill my mark which don't
seem<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.400> that's<00:02:14.790> gonna<00:02:14.970> be<00:02:15.060> very<00:02:15.150> likely

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
seem like that's gonna be very likely

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.040 
seem like that's gonna be very likely
and<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.460> copy<00:02:17.760> member<00:02:18.300> with<00:02:18.450> shock<00:02:18.690> Ashima

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
and we can copy member with shock Ashima

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.680 
and we can copy member with shock Ashima
and<00:02:19.890> have<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.370> memorize<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.330> then<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.510> guess

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
and have to memorize and then I guess

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.420
