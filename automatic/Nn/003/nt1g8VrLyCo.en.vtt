difference<00:01:32.819> in<00:01:33.630> between<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.469> many<00:01:34.710> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
difference in between just so many of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.399 
difference in between just so many of
these<00:01:35.069> shows<00:01:35.490> myself<00:01:36.479> included<00:01:36.630> honestly<00:01:37.259> can

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.010 
these shows myself included honestly can
come<00:01:37.590> off<00:01:37.710> sounding<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.280> lecture<00:01:38.759> and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
come off sounding like a lecture and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.719 
come off sounding like a lecture and
extra<00:01:40.020> credits<00:01:40.319> very<00:01:40.590> seldom<00:01:40.950> does<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.399> I
