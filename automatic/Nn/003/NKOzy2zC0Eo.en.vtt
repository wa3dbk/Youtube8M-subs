constellations is to know where to look
we<00:00:24.119> need<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.359> go<00:00:24.480> outside<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> star

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
we need to go outside and have a star

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.759 
we need to go outside and have a star
map<00:00:26.760> or<00:00:27.000> planisphere<00:00:27.869> such<00:00:28.199> as<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.500> one

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
map or planisphere such as this one

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.740 
map or planisphere such as this one
which<00:00:28.980> allows<00:00:29.340> us<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.699> set<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.150> date<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
which allows us to set the date and the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.930 
which allows us to set the date and the
time<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.439> determine<00:00:32.040> what<00:00:32.070> objects<00:00:32.700> are<00:00:32.790> up

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
