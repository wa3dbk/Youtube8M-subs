loving this film but as a Disney film
it's<00:01:41.610> pretty<00:01:41.880> strong<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.630> big<00:01:42.780> scene<00:01:42.990> after

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
it's pretty strong the big scene after

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.260 
it's pretty strong the big scene after
the<00:01:43.380> climax<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> very<00:01:44.369> good<00:01:44.579> payoff<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the climax is a very good payoff and you

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.969 
the climax is a very good payoff and you
didn't<00:01:45.420> find<00:01:45.630> yourself<00:01:45.960> very<00:01:46.110> invested<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.829> it

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
didn't find yourself very invested in it

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.859 
didn't find yourself very invested in it
I<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.700> said<00:01:47.880> some<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.270> cutesy<00:01:48.630> teens

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869

drag<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.280> allowed<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.820> drag

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
drag but I think it's allowed to drag

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.700 
drag but I think it's allowed to drag
sort<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.659> same<00:01:51.810> way<00:01:51.869> Bambi<00:01:52.530> was

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
sort of in the same way Bambi was

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.050 
sort of in the same way Bambi was
allowed<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.189> drag<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.670> know<00:01:53.700> you're<00:01:53.970> gonna

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
allowed to drag you know you're gonna

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.999 
allowed to drag you know you're gonna
get<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> harder<00:01:54.780> stuff<00:01:54.840> later<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.590> just

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
get to the harder stuff later I just

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.250 
get to the harder stuff later I just
wish<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.189> was<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> little

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
wish it was a little

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.140 
wish it was a little
harder<00:01:57.650> I<00:01:57.830> don't<00:01:58.250> know<00:01:58.340> maybe<00:01:58.580> it's<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.880> sick

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.270 
harder I don't know maybe it's the sick
bastard<00:01:59.360> in<00:01:59.840> me<00:02:00.020> but<00:02:00.320> I<00:02:00.530> think<00:02:00.620> this<00:02:00.980> could

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
bastard in me but I think this could

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.310 
bastard in me but I think this could
have<00:02:01.400> been<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.550> little<00:02:01.760> bit<00:02:01.970> more<00:02:02.000> adult<00:02:02.420> but<00:02:03.050> as

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
have been a little bit more adult but as

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.620 
have been a little bit more adult but as
is<00:02:03.620> it's<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.130> decent<00:02:04.520> movie<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:05.180> songs<00:02:05.420> aren't

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
is it's a decent movie the songs aren't

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
is it's a decent movie the songs aren't
really<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:05.990> memorable<00:02:06.260> and<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.590> don't

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
really that memorable and I don't

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.469 
really that memorable and I don't
remember<00:02:06.890> too<00:02:07.340> many<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.730> side<00:02:08.000> characters

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
remember too many of the side characters

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.120 
remember too many of the side characters
either<00:02:08.780> but<00:02:09.200> it's<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.619> friendship<00:02:10.040> between

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
either but it's the friendship between

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.430 
either but it's the friendship between
the<00:02:10.460> two<00:02:10.490> of<00:02:10.700> them<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:10.850> really<00:02:11.450> holds<00:02:11.780> up<00:02:11.900> I'd

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
the two of them that really holds up I'd

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.600 
the two of them that really holds up I'd
say<00:02:12.500> it's<00:02:12.800> definitely<00:02:12.860> worth<00:02:13.280> your<00:02:13.430> time

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
say it's definitely worth your time

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.400 
say it's definitely worth your time
taking<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.030> watch
