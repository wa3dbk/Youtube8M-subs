00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:04.279
 in this video it wants to explain about two things that the eye can do 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.149
 pupils flex and accommodating are two duties of togo animal for 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.149
 intended to be able to overlook such a group 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.699
 this video library is used as a poland by the people point 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.699
 but you can also find further information about bar counter 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.199
 let three places in a row that all three years the eye and its environment 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.689
 viewer left in the front of the eye with the erection with the pill 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.000
 in the afternoon in the side of the eye and in this ioc and on the left is the irish and the 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:34.230
 pupil 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.910
 on the far right please a brain supplement and a walking one 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.070
 two nerves whistles the brain to the eye then 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.830
 if everything is a name giver you see that mainly because there will be one 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.020
 different names got the band from outside the optic nerve loop the sensory 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.420
 nerve cells to the brain 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.110
 they give a signal of learning to the brain 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.200
 there are the motor nerve cells that come from the brain 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.380
 muscle gain in the pupil 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.660
 and in the repar also have the term chess players who take care of the processing 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.110
 of the signal 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.670
 how does it work the pupils flex 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.720
 we see here that sitting in a room of the athlete actually lies 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.590
 slowly 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.730
 goes on and off and you also see changes occurring with the pupil as 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.060
 it depends more 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.340
 from the dark 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.930
 with a good look of the dark when it becomes light 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.140
 then the amount of light for the club becomes more 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.490
 and then the orbicular muscle will close with the pupil minor 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.859
 how does an ailment de peelse work 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.100
 the light goes to 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.830
 md his store in cozy justice to happiness 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.870
 that there is too much light the holes signal to the brain and a stem and 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.920
 the brainstem that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.100
 decide directly and then I don't think about it and it is a flex decision and 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.360
 directly to close the circle muscle 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.640
 as soon as the amount of light decreases 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.320
 then I will not get the pills large automatically either 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.730
 practice all the time 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.810
 you can do it yourself when your eyes are closed and you get a mirror 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.020
 opened according to brio through automatic pupil 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.560
 accommodating is a what 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.900
 more complex principle 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.239
 accommodating actually serves to get the picture sharp 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.370
 as soon as we want to see something from a distance and then we want it 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.149
 seeing it up close has to get used to focusing 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:18.649
 That has to do with how the lens talent works in front of you 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:19.529
 eye 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:23.049
 You can see an image of an apple 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.059
 the direction the eye was closer and the apple closer with guests as guests 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:27.959
 have to adjust lessons themselves to the image 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.639
 being able to stay on the retina keeps projecting 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.779
 where the lens normally has a fixed focal point 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:34.850
 and so it doesn't 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.729
 convex or can be heard 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.749
 is that with and the people after all the lens can change the eye of the ford and 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.419
 therefore a focal point can also be used for the 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:44.470
 also change 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.950
 as soon as the ash tree comes closer 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.020
 harvesting need to change focal point to get the picture 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.069
 the primal does that to the eye 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.950
 to muscle around spring 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.819
 in the speakers can cause the lens bulbs 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.079
 or being flat 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.849
 As the lens relaxation is the most desired 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.980
 and so you can see objects well from afar 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.980
 as soon as you have to be able to look up close, the muscle says it will make an effort 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.509
 and that also the lens will both change shape and become so convex 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.989
 so the muscle london lens ensures that the lens becomes convex 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.010
 and yet always changed that was still sharp 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.849
 in neighborhood by itself also look quietly in the distance according to looking at a finger 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.049
 close to your eye 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.809
 And then you immediately notice that it takes effort to make the image as still 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:30.989
 to get sharp 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.180
 and then you cannot look sharp in the meantime 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:36.809
 call this principle accommodation
