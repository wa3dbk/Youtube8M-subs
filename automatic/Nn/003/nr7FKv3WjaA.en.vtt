yellow fleet command thing so let's see

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.440 
yellow fleet command thing so let's see
how<00:01:14.710> main<00:01:15.070> planet<00:01:15.460> down<00:01:15.610> there<00:01:15.850> is<00:01:15.970> completely

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
how main planet down there is completely

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.310 
how main planet down there is completely
surrounded<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.890> not<00:01:18.100> a<00:01:18.130> good<00:01:18.369> thing<00:01:19.320> the
