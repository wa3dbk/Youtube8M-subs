the front ones are monsters so I'm kind

just<00:03:50.790> be<00:03:50.970> asking<00:03:51.120> too<00:03:51.510> much<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.900> power

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
just be asking too much the power

just be asking too much the power
steering<00:03:52.349> pump<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:53.069> again<00:03:53.400> I'd<00:03:53.519> have<00:03:53.639> to

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
steering pump so again I'd have to

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.120 
steering pump so again I'd have to
upgrade<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.180> something<00:03:54.739> we'll<00:03:55.739> see<00:03:55.889> how<00:03:55.980> it

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
upgrade to something we'll see how it

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.190

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
why it's laying on the ground it's going

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.520 
why it's laying on the ground it's going
to<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.169> driveshaft<00:05:50.620> shop<00:05:50.740> here<00:05:51.100> pretty<00:05:51.250> soon

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.490 

look<00:05:56.530> at<00:05:56.650> those<00:05:56.770> giant<00:05:57.690> twin<00:05:58.690> piston<00:05:59.050> calipers

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
look at those giant twin piston calipers

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.810 
look at those giant twin piston calipers
up<00:05:59.740> front<00:06:00.180> there's<00:06:01.180> absolute<00:06:01.810> monsters<00:06:02.820> and

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
up front there's absolute monsters and

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.040 
up front there's absolute monsters and
you<00:06:03.940> see<00:06:04.150> there<00:06:04.330> that's<00:06:04.510> why<00:06:04.660> I<00:06:04.690> gotta<00:06:04.900> run

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
you see there that's why I gotta run

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.600 
you see there that's why I gotta run
17-inch<00:06:05.560> wheels<00:06:05.710> on<00:06:06.039> this<00:06:06.130> truck<00:06:06.400> because

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
17-inch wheels on this truck because

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.409 
17-inch wheels on this truck because
there<00:06:06.910> is<00:06:07.060> no<00:06:07.270> clearance<00:06:07.900> between<00:06:08.860> the<00:06:09.130> rotor

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
there is no clearance between the rotor

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.860 
there is no clearance between the rotor
I'm<00:06:10.419> sorry<00:06:10.660> the<00:06:10.870> caliper<00:06:11.470> in<00:06:11.710> the<00:06:12.070> wheel<00:06:12.220> I<00:06:12.870> got

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
I'm sorry the caliper in the wheel I got

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.420 
I'm sorry the caliper in the wheel I got
the<00:06:13.960> front<00:06:14.139> just<00:06:14.470> about<00:06:14.650> buttoned<00:06:15.039> up<00:06:15.099> I<00:06:15.250> still

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
the front just about buttoned up I still

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.310 
the front just about buttoned up I still
have<00:06:15.550> to<00:06:15.610> get<00:06:15.700> that<00:06:15.849> nut<00:06:16.450> for<00:06:16.750> the<00:06:16.840> track<00:06:17.080> bar

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
have to get that nut for the track bar

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.990 
have to get that nut for the track bar
but<00:06:17.530> I<00:06:17.560> get<00:06:17.680> all<00:06:17.710> the<00:06:17.889> shock<00:06:18.099> mounts<00:06:18.460> dialed<00:06:18.849> in

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
but I get all the shock mounts dialed in

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.270 
but I get all the shock mounts dialed in
I<00:06:19.180> got<00:06:19.300> all<00:06:19.419> that<00:06:19.510> stuff

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
I got all that stuff

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:28.469 
I got all that stuff
squared<00:06:21.280> away<00:06:21.430> so<00:06:24.870> front<00:06:25.870> here<00:06:27.479> eventually

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
squared away so front here eventually

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:29.940 
squared away so front here eventually
gonna<00:06:28.720> probably<00:06:28.960> end<00:06:29.229> up<00:06:29.380> replacing<00:06:29.620> this

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
gonna probably end up replacing this

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.089 
gonna probably end up replacing this
winch<00:06:30.389> because<00:06:31.389> I<00:06:31.630> think<00:06:31.990> the<00:06:32.139> motors<00:06:32.440> fried

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
winch because I think the motors fried

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.379 
winch because I think the motors fried
on<00:06:33.310> it<00:06:33.460> still<00:06:33.700> annoyed<00:06:33.880> actually<00:06:34.060> it's

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 
on it still annoyed actually it's

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.680 
on it still annoyed actually it's
anything<00:06:34.690> but<00:06:34.840> it<00:06:35.650> don't<00:06:35.860> turn<00:06:36.099> so<00:06:36.460> I<00:06:36.700> got<00:06:37.330> it

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
anything but it don't turn so I got it

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.390 
anything but it don't turn so I got it
changed<00:06:38.380> around<00:06:38.500> I<00:06:38.710> got<00:06:38.860> it<00:06:38.979> sitting<00:06:39.250> where<00:06:39.370> I

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
changed around I got it sitting where I

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.550 
changed around I got it sitting where I
want<00:06:39.700> it<00:06:39.820> you<00:06:40.630> see<00:06:40.840> I<00:06:40.870> came<00:06:40.990> out<00:06:41.260> here<00:06:41.410> and<00:06:41.440> I

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
cut the front face out to make her into

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.490 
cut the front face out to make her into
the<00:06:44.889> winch<00:06:45.070> got<00:06:45.550> it<00:06:45.669> pushed<00:06:45.880> back<00:06:46.180> as<00:06:46.990> far<00:06:47.380> up

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
the winch got it pushed back as far up

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.950 
the winch got it pushed back as far up
as<00:06:47.620> I<00:06:47.740> can<00:06:48.270> because<00:06:49.270> I'm<00:06:49.360> gonna<00:06:49.479> keep<00:06:49.690> this

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
this winch plate with this little

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.330 
this winch plate with this little
bar<00:06:53.620> here<00:06:54.090> and<00:06:55.090> I<00:06:55.240> run<00:06:55.420> my<00:06:55.600> bumper<00:06:55.990> off<00:06:56.950> of<00:06:57.220> this

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
bar here and I run my bumper off of this

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:39.880 
bit of a rake in the front and still had

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.640 
bit of a rake in the front and still had
plans<00:07:40.120> and<00:07:40.300> swapping<00:07:40.930> out<00:07:40.990> the<00:07:41.110> front<00:07:41.320> spring

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:41.650 
plans and swapping out the front spring

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.090 
plans and swapping out the front spring
so<00:07:41.860> I<00:07:41.890> match<00:07:42.160> everything<00:07:42.700> and<00:07:43.630> get<00:07:43.810> it<00:07:44.100> leveled

so I match everything and get it leveled

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.850 
so I match everything and get it leveled
