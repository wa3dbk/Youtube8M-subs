a concave through that you can see I
don't<00:01:01.129> know<00:01:01.250> if<00:01:01.339> it<00:01:01.489> can<00:01:01.839> but<00:01:02.839> anyway<00:01:04.150> and<00:01:05.150> and

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
so yeah that's that's the the deck I've

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.060 
so yeah that's that's the the deck I've
got<00:01:08.630> still<00:01:08.870> are<00:01:08.960> three<00:01:09.200> pinstripes<00:01:09.770> going

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
got still are three pinstripes going

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.410 
got still are three pinstripes going
down<00:01:10.250> which<00:01:10.430> your<00:01:10.580> carbonized<00:01:12.040> so<00:01:13.330> it's<00:01:14.330> a

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
down which your carbonized so it's a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.390 
down which your carbonized so it's a
quality<00:01:14.660> product<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.350> has<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.500> nice<00:01:15.890> amount<00:01:16.220> of

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400

to<00:01:21.470> our<00:01:21.710> skateboard<00:01:22.190> wheels<00:01:22.960> we're<00:01:23.960> using<00:01:24.140> 83

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
to our skateboard wheels we're using 83

polyurethane<00:01:30.220> there<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.610> size<00:01:31.880> is<00:01:31.909> 83<00:01:32.720> x<00:01:32.870> 52mm

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
polyurethane there the size is 83 x 52mm

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.970 
polyurethane there the size is 83 x 52mm
so<00:01:34.580> we<00:01:35.210> have<00:01:35.390> two<00:01:35.630> two<00:01:36.140> types<00:01:36.380> we've<00:01:36.740> got<00:01:36.950> a

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
so we have two two types we've got a

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.470 
so we have two two types we've got a
more<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.700> harder<00:01:38.170> 8080<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.320> durometer<00:01:40.480> and

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
more of a harder 8080 a durometer and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.620 
more of a harder 8080 a durometer and
then<00:01:41.810> we<00:01:41.900> also<00:01:42.050> have<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.320> more<00:01:42.680> of<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.800> softer

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
then we also have a more of a softer

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.719 
then we also have a more of a softer
softer<00:01:44.630> buttery<00:01:44.930> riding<00:01:45.440> wheel<00:01:46.430> which<00:01:46.700> is

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
softer buttery riding wheel which is

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.810 
softer buttery riding wheel which is
more<00:01:47.060> like<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.300> 70<00:01:47.750> 68<00:01:48.260> so<00:01:49.250> we<00:01:49.370> haven't<00:01:49.670> had<00:01:49.790> a

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
more like a 70 68 so we haven't had a

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.200 
more like a 70 68 so we haven't had a
choice<00:01:50.470> so<00:01:51.470> these<00:01:51.620> wheels<00:01:51.920> 83<00:01:52.520> they're<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:52.700> bit

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
choice so these wheels 83 they're a bit

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.270 
choice so these wheels 83 they're a bit
more<00:01:53.390> on<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.510> largest<00:01:53.930> size<00:01:54.140> but<00:01:54.530> fantastic

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
more on the largest size but fantastic

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.820 
more on the largest size but fantastic
for<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:56.120> know<00:01:56.210> for<00:01:56.390> stability<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.960> writing

for you know for stability and writing

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.880 
for you know for stability and writing
performance<00:01:58.720> so<00:01:59.720> these<00:01:59.960> these<00:02:00.260> just<00:02:00.560> go<00:02:00.710> over

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
so we're not compromising on any quality

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.650 
so we're not compromising on any quality
there<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:23.190> wheels<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.700> spin<00:02:24.030> they

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
there so the the wheels just spin they

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.570 
there so the the wheels just spin they
quite<00:02:25.080> as<00:02:25.440> smooth<00:02:26.630> they're<00:02:27.630> awesome<00:02:27.810> really

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
quite as smooth they're awesome really

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.900 
quite as smooth they're awesome really
now<00:02:29.580> down<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.320> truck<00:02:31.710> now<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.790> where

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
now down to the truck now this is where

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.220 
now down to the truck now this is where
it's<00:02:33.060> at<00:02:34.610> really<00:02:35.610> proud<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.120> truck<00:02:36.450> it's

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
it's at really proud of this truck it's

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.150 
it's at really proud of this truck it's
it's<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.580> double<00:02:38.970> truck<00:02:39.180> system<00:02:39.860> if<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.010> can

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
it's a double truck system if you can

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.880 
it's a double truck system if you can
see<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.460> closely<00:02:42.180> here<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:43.140> there's<00:02:43.710> three

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
see it closely here but there's three

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.800 
see it closely here but there's three
components<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.640> truck<00:02:44.940> I've<00:02:45.600> got<00:02:45.780> a

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
components to the truck I've got a

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.230 
components to the truck I've got a
hanger<00:02:46.230> we've<00:02:46.680> got<00:02:46.890> an<00:02:47.190> arm<00:02:47.460> through<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.000> guts

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
hanger we've got an arm through the guts

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.770 
hanger we've got an arm through the guts
and<00:02:48.480> then<00:02:48.570> we<00:02:48.630> have<00:02:48.780> our<00:02:48.900> base<00:02:49.110> plate<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:51.330> a

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
and then we have our base plate and a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.960 
and then we have our base plate and a
double<00:02:52.110> bushing<00:02:52.440> system<00:02:52.920> at<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.550> moment<00:02:53.730> i'm

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
double bushing system at the moment i'm

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.610 
double bushing system at the moment i'm
using<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.540> Evolve<00:02:55.310> 95<00:02:56.310> a's<00:02:56.580> at<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.970> bottom

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
using the Evolve 95 a's at the bottom

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.990 
using the Evolve 95 a's at the bottom
making<00:02:58.620> them<00:02:58.830> super<00:02:59.220> super<00:02:59.580> hard<00:02:59.610> for

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
making them super super hard for

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.570 
making them super super hard for
stability<00:03:00.210> and<00:03:00.720> then<00:03:01.410> i'm<00:03:01.500> using<00:03:01.650> soft<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.340> 90

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
stability and then i'm using soft and 90

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.410 
stability and then i'm using soft and 90
a's<00:03:02.730> up<00:03:02.970> top<00:03:03.710> so<00:03:04.710> you<00:03:04.740> can<00:03:05.430> mix<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.850> match<00:03:05.910> your

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
a's up top so you can mix and match your

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.420 
a's up top so you can mix and match your
combinations<00:03:06.990> here<00:03:07.170> but<00:03:07.620> with<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.100> double

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
combinations here but with this double

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.570 
combinations here but with this double
truck<00:03:08.610> system<00:03:09.030> you've<00:03:09.840> got<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:11.130> turning

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
truck system you've got to turning

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.560 
truck system you've got to turning
capabilities<00:03:12.480> here<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:14.790> know<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.000> can

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
capabilities here the you know you can

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.250 
capabilities here the you know you can
just<00:03:15.600> turn<00:03:15.990> on<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.320> dime<00:03:16.850> but<00:03:17.850> yet<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.150> can<00:03:18.900> it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
just turn on a dime but yet you can it

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.100 
just turn on a dime but yet you can it
has<00:03:19.500> major<00:03:19.860> stability<00:03:20.460> so<00:03:20.670> it's<00:03:21.270> so<00:03:21.750> much<00:03:21.930> like

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
has major stability so it's so much like

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.630 
has major stability so it's so much like
a<00:03:22.170> surf<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.770> feel<00:03:24.140> now<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:26.250> good<00:03:26.430> thing<00:03:26.490> about

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
a surf you feel now the good thing about

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.430 
a surf you feel now the good thing about
these<00:03:27.000> trucks<00:03:27.300> also<00:03:27.630> because<00:03:28.050> there's<00:03:28.260> two

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
these trucks also because there's two

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.600 
these trucks also because there's two
kingpins<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:30.390> can<00:03:30.600> adjust<00:03:30.780> each<00:03:31.560> one<00:03:32.040> to

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
kingpins you can adjust each one to

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.120 
kingpins you can adjust each one to
however<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.150> want<00:03:33.330> to<00:03:33.390> ride<00:03:33.570> so<00:03:34.170> let<00:03:34.560> the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
however you want to ride so let the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.790 
however you want to ride so let the
finer<00:03:35.910> tweaks<00:03:36.680> changes<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.770> whole

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
finer tweaks changes the whole

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.580 
finer tweaks changes the whole
performance<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.490> the<00:03:38.550> board<00:03:39.230> that's<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.350> best

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
performance of the board that's the best

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.800 
performance of the board that's the best
thing<00:03:40.770> about<00:03:40.890> you<00:03:41.459> know<00:03:41.490> this<00:03:41.970> skateboard<00:03:42.600> and

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
thing about you know this skateboard and

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.190 
thing about you know this skateboard and
the<00:03:43.290> electric<00:03:43.650> longboard<00:03:43.830> is<00:03:44.510> just<00:03:45.510> how<00:03:45.660> these

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
the electric longboard is just how these

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.110 
the electric longboard is just how these
trucks<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.709> wheels<00:03:46.830> handle<00:03:47.340> as<00:03:48.020> a<00:03:49.020> longboard

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
trucks and wheels handle as a longboard

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.210 
trucks and wheels handle as a longboard
so<00:03:51.120> basically<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:52.560> know<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.740> can<00:03:52.980> tighten

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
so basically you know you can tighten

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.220 
so basically you know you can tighten
them<00:03:53.430> up<00:03:53.550> for<00:03:53.850> stability<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.420> all<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.050> all

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
them up for stability and all that all

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.660 
them up for stability and all that all
you<00:03:55.350> can<00:03:55.500> just<00:03:55.650> loosen<00:03:56.040> them<00:03:56.130> up<00:03:56.250> for<00:03:56.459> like

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
you can just loosen them up for like

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.330 
you can just loosen them up for like
full-on<00:03:57.090> side<00:03:57.630> sidewalk<00:03:58.410> surfin<00:03:58.920> kind<00:03:59.250> of

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
full-on side sidewalk surfin kind of

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.640 
full-on side sidewalk surfin kind of
stuff<00:03:59.610> but<00:04:00.270> this<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.810> evolved<00:04:01.140> super<00:04:01.440> car

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650

it's only lithium now it's super thin
and<00:05:33.550> because<00:05:34.240> it's<00:05:34.450> so<00:05:34.600> thin<00:05:34.930> and<00:05:34.960> light<00:05:35.490> it

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
and because it's so thin and light it

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.960

perfectly with each other and not to

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.390 
perfectly with each other and not to
mention<00:06:32.000> we've<00:06:32.360> got<00:06:32.569> these<00:06:32.830> great<00:06:33.830> wheels<00:06:34.130> and

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
mention we've got these great wheels and

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.749 
mention we've got these great wheels and
bearings<00:06:35.470> this<00:06:36.470> also<00:06:36.800> enables<00:06:37.250> the<00:06:37.520> board

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 
bearings this also enables the board

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.240 
bearings this also enables the board
just<00:06:37.880> to<00:06:38.120> just<00:06:38.660> keep<00:06:38.810> going<00:06:39.110> it<00:06:39.650> just<00:06:39.889> rolls

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
just to just keep going it just rolls

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.430 
just to just keep going it just rolls
and<00:06:40.819> rolls<00:06:40.849> like<00:06:41.300> a<00:06:41.360> normal<00:06:41.720> skateboard<00:06:42.199> even

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
and rolls like a normal skateboard even

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.480 
and rolls like a normal skateboard even
in<00:06:42.560> neutral<00:06:43.160> neutral<00:06:44.000> mode<00:06:44.360> but<00:06:45.340> so<00:06:46.340> this

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490 
in neutral neutral mode but so this

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.350 
in neutral neutral mode but so this
enables<00:06:46.970> to<00:06:47.720> get<00:06:47.870> a<00:06:47.900> great<00:06:48.729> longevity<00:06:49.729> out<00:06:50.270> of

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
enables to get a great longevity out of

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.950 
enables to get a great longevity out of
the<00:06:50.449> battery<00:06:50.810> I<00:06:51.409> reckon<00:06:52.810> depending<00:06:53.810> on<00:06:53.870> how

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
the battery I reckon depending on how

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.990 
the battery I reckon depending on how
you<00:06:54.020> write<00:06:54.319> it<00:06:54.560> some<00:06:54.919> no<00:06:55.370> problems<00:06:55.789> you<00:06:55.970> should

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
you write it some no problems you should

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.399 
you write it some no problems you should
get<00:06:56.360> two<00:06:56.599> hours<00:06:57.190> for<00:06:58.190> one<00:06:58.370> charge<00:06:58.699> so<00:06:59.569> really

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:00.409 
get two hours for one charge so really
