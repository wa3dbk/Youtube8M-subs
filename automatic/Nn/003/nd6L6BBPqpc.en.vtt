00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.040
 This remote controlled model is one 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.660
 Vertical starter design on which I have since 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.780
 some years in warm and also 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.119
 private working basis is a center 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.770
 placed lifting engine and a plane 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.570
 such mass engine as well 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.980
 different steering devices to bug 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.330
 and at the stern for the hover and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.010
 Conversion phase for transport and 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.090
 Storage purposes are the wings 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.760
 decreasing the wings become 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.219
 plugged in and then with a small one 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:49.469
 bolt fastened stabilized the whole 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:51.360
 by means of an aluminum rod the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.520
 plane flies around five kilos 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.960
 it will be remotely controlled like any other 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.670
 model is handled and exists 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.129
 exclusively from commercial ones 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.530
 items it does not contain specifically 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.940
 made here in the nose 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.930
 is the majority of the fans 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.519
 tax equipment 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.130
 Here we have the fuel for the measure 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.229
 engine here we still have one each 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.119
 additional tank in both sides share with it 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.770
 the lever rotor while floating the fuel 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.659
 gets at the transition of the mars engine 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.250
 then to full power the per 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.380
 Operation will be high performance for as long as possible 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.659
 brings up the wings 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.270
 is connected as soon as this is done 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.009
 the lifting engine is idle on 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.630
 belly of the plane you also see 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.130
 some slats with which roll 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.340
 controlled during the snowplow 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.340
 becomes 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.500
 while floating and the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.390
 transition phase, the vehicle is using 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.710
 different flaps controls the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.720
 on the nose behind the new one 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.370
 I move the engine 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.230
 right remote control lever to the rear 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.870
 tilts the flap behind the engine like that 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.580
 I'm moving the plane 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.790
 The lever tilts forward in such a way 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.320
 that the airplane goes into descent 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.300
 under the vehicle is a 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.130
 another flap that regulates the shearing 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.380
 So the movement of the plane after 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.720
 I move the left or right 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.970
 lever to the left flap pressed the nose 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.710
 the machine to the left , I move to 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.630
 right, the nose turns right 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.130
 depressed 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.070
 he approaches his newest model 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.080
 Drafted designed and built that 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.990
 model of another perpendicular and short 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.300
 starters this model from the country it the 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.430
 Vertigo used one in the middle 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.220
 placed rotors of 90 degrees 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.930
 Panning allowed only one engine 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.270
 of course, had the advantage of the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.280
 simplicity but for what tom 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.400
 it was not the ideal one 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.400
 solution 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.420
 the old problem with the design of 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.280
 vertical and short is the start 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.560
 immense benefits for the life of the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.350
 plane is required around the 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.530
 to move forward by far 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.030
 less energy the engines use for 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.280
 used this type of vehicles 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.540
 are extremely long because you have 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.700
 fuel consumption and thus their 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.220
 efficiency at one-tenth power 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.780
 leave a lot to be desired 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.640
 the problem is that you have to 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.350
 start a lot of energy needs the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.480
 then far too much for the forward flight 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.310
 leaves except you want in the supersonic 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.780
 flying area 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.150
 but what i am here in modellbauer 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.870
 planes with 150 350 at most 650 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.150
 hours to fly 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.100
 So it's only reasonably separate 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.870
 lifting and marching engines to use 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.489
 just before their respective purpose 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.480
 be used and thereby essential 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.480
 are more economical 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.260
 The most important thing for every model maker is 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.590
 that plane actually does 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.569
 one never flies up like the model 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.880
 the signals will react to him 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.470
 only sent the feeling for the 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.430
 to get remote control checks 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.430
 requires highest concentration 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.970
 if it's outdoors or in the outdoors 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.560
 hall ans fly goes a few minutes 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.670
 with the transmitter in hand like one 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.770
 eternity occur 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.630
 one has to make with all 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.310
 be so fast at the same time 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.239
 completed piano study for sure 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.640
 would be beneficial 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.590
 the mental tension throughout the room 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.570
 flight tests can take you pretty much 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.950
 after a few minutes is the pilot 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.570
 already spiritually drained 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.210
 soon afterwards, the physical 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.100
 exhaustion a test pilot the one 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.820
 new aircraft will not be rehearsed 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.530
 to go differently 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.480
 every time a new feature 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.900
 Being flown is a lot of fear 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.900
 determine 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.350
 earlier than I studied and money 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.220
 if I had flown correctly 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.590
 now that I am there for my sake 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.240
 work and a house has to pay off and 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.940
 so on I can fly that 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.960
 actually can not afford anymore 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.540
 instead I am in the model 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.160
 Area dedicated to design in construction and 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.419
 im flying 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.990
 That's how I still get that way 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.669
 model pilots fell too cool 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.960
 They confirm that they are doing it 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.840
 actually in the cockpit 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.540
 put in a good model pilot 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.040
 does not stay on the ground in thought 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.790
 mentally he sits in the plane he is 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.790
 just controls 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.930
 the vertigo does not have it over the model 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.060
 Stadium brought out like all 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.610
 vertical and short start designs before 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.779
 she was abandoned to tom 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.779
 could accomplish 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:36.939
 in the late 80's and early 90's 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:39.279
 years we have a lot about it 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:40.959
 learned how perpendicular or short starter 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:43.449
 during the hover and transition phases 

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:45.399
 but to handle are due to 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.779
 budget cuts by the government 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:49.149
 are most of these programs 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.279
 abandoned what I started 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:53.349
 I also want to finish 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:55.209
 that 's why i work with this in 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.129
 my free time ahead and a 

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:59.199
 very good single-engine vertical starter 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.629
 concept developed i would like too 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.830
 others less elaborate and lighter 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.639
 to fly the designs on 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.129
 advance 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.830
 that's just the driving force 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.990
 every aircraft manufacturer feels no matter if he 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.389
 now his room flight models board or 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.399
 larger models remote-controlled aircraft 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:18.009
 manned planes or whatever 

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:19.059
 he just wants to know how it is 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.339
 is better to do 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:24.809
 he wants better materials better 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:27.669
 designs better performance 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:29.229
 Tom has the burning desire his idea 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:31.269
 to become reality 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.249
 with a new and improved model 

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:35.369
 he makes his unique plane 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:35.369
 continue 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.330
 maybe it will be the next one 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.790
 successful vertical and short starter 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.650
 not from the design office of his 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.080
 large aircraft construction company come 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.950
 but from the cellar workshop 1 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.950
 enthusiastic model builder
