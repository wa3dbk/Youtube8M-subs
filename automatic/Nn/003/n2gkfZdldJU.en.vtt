00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.220
 ah 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.770
 all foods change with the step 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.050
 of time when we talk about lifespan 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.150
 we refer to the period of time 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.970
 during which they maintain a quality 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.369
 adequate 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.009
 this quality is related to three 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.950
 Aspects fundamentally aspects 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.910
 sensory as they can be color color 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.820
 and taste the nutritional aspects like 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.040
 may be the presence of vitamins and 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.420
 those aspects related to the 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.480
 food safety 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.399
 before launching a product for sale 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.750
 we need to make the calls 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.210
 life-time studies 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.600
 These studies are aimed at 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.610
 one side fix what are called dates 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.489
 of preferential consumption and date of 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.190
 expiration and on the other to make sure that 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.010
 They maintain a high quality during their 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.620
 lifetime 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.960
 the preferred consumption date also 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.730
 call date of minimum duration we 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.350
 indicates the period of time during the 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.020
 which the food maintains a quality 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.240
 adequate in the conditions of 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.180
 conservation that are normally indicated 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.450
 in the labeling how it can be to maintain 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.520
 the cool and dry place this is indicated in 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.420
 the label how to consume 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.210
 preferably before however in 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.150
 the foods whose consumption has elapsed 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.580
 Some time may pose a risk in 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.800
 place of preferential use date that 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.320
 we use expiration date 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.210
 The shelf life of a food depends 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.300
 both of the characteristics of the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.440
 obviously the food is not the same 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.000
 a salt or a sugar that a yogurt like 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.300
 of the conservation techniques that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.880
 have used in it 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.400
 more and more we demand food that at 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.980
 same time they are safe to maintain 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.320
 the sensory characteristics 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.560
 originals such as smell can be 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.450
 texture for it nowadays the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.490
 research efforts are being 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.800
 focusing on the use of preservatives 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.569
 natural and in processing techniques 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.659
 minimum 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.659
 to 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.989
 ah
