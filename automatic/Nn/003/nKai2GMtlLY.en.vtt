00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.229
 I get modified as you see and they are 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.930
 It's going to be a little spring once 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.970
 it is installed what we have to do is 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.040
 go to configure it for that we have to 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.040
 go to what is the settings menu 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.460
 in settings let's go to the option let's 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.120
 to look for better the trick okay city 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.210
 and by default it comes to us ok if I have 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.080
 changed and I've put him or the city 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.670
 out and then we will go to 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.860
 activator now if they do not have the shooter 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.410
 at the time of installing this tweet also 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.610
 activate activator if I already know what 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.190
 I have other tweets 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:24.530
 we go in we go anywhere and 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.390
 let's choose how we want to activate it 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.220
 for example I have it with a touch here 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.750
 well I have it there activated ok city 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.270
 now after this we have to go to 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.720
 the bottom part we will search for 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.320
 activate also another option let's see 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.320
 why is he 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:54.019
 here you see this option from here we are going to 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:57.230
 enter and we will put him in assistant 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.569
 virtual ok as you see I have it that has 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.579
 selected you also have to 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.819
 select it and that would simply be 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.819
 all 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.260
 Now I have it activated with only one 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.850
 tap in the status bar remember 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.150
 so let's give it a twist 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.340
 let's wait and see if it comes out 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.840
 as you can see me came a microphone 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.750
 the upper right against the 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.030
 side of the bar not of what is the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.110
 battery and that means that this one that 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.810
 is activated is working 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.130

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.150

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.390
