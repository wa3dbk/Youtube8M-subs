00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
biological foundations of what makes us

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.709 
biological foundations of what makes us
all<00:00:46.589> tech<00:00:46.859> so<00:00:47.159> all<00:00:47.399> genomes<00:00:47.879> are<00:00:48.059> constantly

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
all tech so all genomes are constantly

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.660 
all tech so all genomes are constantly
changing<00:00:49.319> and<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:49.859> are<00:00:49.979> two<00:00:50.190> types<00:00:50.429> of

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
changing and there are two types of

mutations that can be compared to

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.059 
mutations that can be compared to
erosion<00:00:56.339> by<00:00:57.149> wind<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.809> water<00:00:57.929> but<00:00:58.829> they're

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
erosion by wind and water but they're

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:01.549 
erosion by wind and water but they're
also<00:00:59.249> dramatic<00:00:59.999> changes<00:01:00.479> when<00:01:01.049> the<00:01:01.229> whole

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
also dramatic changes when the whole

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.649 
also dramatic changes when the whole
regions<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.429> genome<00:01:02.579> move<00:01:03.089> from<00:01:03.329> one

regions of the genome move from one
place<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.049> another<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.920> would<00:01:05.729> call<00:01:05.969> them

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
place to another I would call them

genomic<00:01:06.899> earthquakes<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.280> I've<00:01:08.490> been

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
genomic earthquakes so I've been

genomic earthquakes so I've been
studying<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.180> question<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.659> more<00:01:10.079> than<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
studying this question for more than a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.630 
studying this question for more than a
decade<00:01:10.770> now<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.840> recently<00:01:13.070> we<00:01:14.070> came<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
decade now and recently we came to the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.480 
decade now and recently we came to the
conclusion<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:16.200> previous<00:01:16.740> hypothesis

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
conclusion that the previous hypothesis

that there are no rearrangement falls in
human<00:01:20.850> genome<00:01:21.149> is<00:01:21.299> incorrect<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.170> we

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
human genome is incorrect and we

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.999 
human genome is incorrect and we
essentially<00:01:23.100> refuted<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.119> 30s<00:01:25.020> also<00:01:25.680> called

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
essentially refuted the 30s also called

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.789 
essentially refuted the 30s also called
random<00:01:26.729> breakage<00:01:26.969> theory<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.799> substituted

random breakage theory and substituted
it<00:01:28.920> will<00:01:29.100> use<00:01:29.250> fragile<00:01:29.789> breakage<00:01:30.210> searing<00:01:30.570> I

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719
