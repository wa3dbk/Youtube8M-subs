users what does that look like so we
have<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.270> new<00:02:18.450> feature<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.870> version<00:02:19.170> 5<00:02:19.380> where<00:02:19.710> we

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
have a new feature in version 5 where we

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.980 
have a new feature in version 5 where we
can<00:02:19.980> remove<00:02:20.760> dust<00:02:21.000> spots<00:02:21.240> so

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
can remove dust spots so

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.020 
can remove dust spots so

batch<00:03:18.630> process<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.590> remove<00:03:19.740> that<00:03:19.860> dust<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.670> we

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
batch process to remove that dust so we

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.000 
batch process to remove that dust so we
completely<00:03:21.210> rewrote<00:03:21.600> our<00:03:21.840> Rock<00:03:22.560> conversion

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
completely rewrote our Rock conversion

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.350 
completely rewrote our Rock conversion
software<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.520> our<00:03:23.610> noise<00:03:23.820> removal<00:03:24.000> software

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
software and our noise removal software

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.600 
software and our noise removal software
we<00:03:25.320> really<00:03:25.530> encourage<00:03:25.680> people<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.160> shoot<00:03:26.430> raw

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
we really encourage people to shoot raw

we really encourage people to shoot raw
you<00:03:26.820> get<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.000> lot<00:03:27.390> more<00:03:27.420> options<00:03:28.020> a<00:03:28.080> lot<00:03:28.230> more

it you actually do differently about
rock<00:03:31.890> conversion<00:03:32.400> what's<00:03:32.550> you<00:03:32.970> have<00:03:33.120> a

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
rock conversion what's you have a

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.040 
rock conversion what's you have a

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
people are using and with noise

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.280 
people are using and with noise
reduction<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:36.210> new<00:03:36.360> approach<00:03:36.690> with<00:03:36.930> version

reduction the new approach with version
5<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.830> we've<00:03:38.430> actually<00:03:38.670> figured<00:03:39.150> out<00:03:39.300> that<00:03:39.570> we

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
5 is we've actually figured out that we

5 is we've actually figured out that we
can<00:03:39.840> get<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.990> lot<00:03:40.170> more<00:03:40.230> detail<00:03:40.770> and<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:40.980> lot

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
can get a lot more detail and a lot

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.640 
can get a lot more detail and a lot
better<00:03:41.190> results<00:03:41.730> by<00:03:42.050> looking<00:03:43.050> further<00:03:43.350> afield

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
better results by looking further afield

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.110 
better results by looking further afield
in<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.190> image<00:03:44.490> when<00:03:44.700> we're<00:03:44.850> recreating

approach<00:03:47.580> would<00:03:47.790> be<00:03:47.820> well<00:03:48.420> if<00:03:48.600> I'm<00:03:48.720> on<00:03:48.870> one

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.690 
approach would be well if I'm on one
pixel<00:03:49.410> I'll<00:03:49.560> go<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:49.770> look<00:03:49.860> at<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.100> next

several pixels just next door and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.770 
several pixels just next door and
they'll<00:03:52.830> help<00:03:53.040> me<00:03:53.130> get<00:03:54.060> some<00:03:54.210> information<00:03:54.420> as

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
they'll help me get some information as

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.750 
they'll help me get some information as
to<00:03:54.810> how<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.560> should<00:03:55.710> be<00:03:55.920> recreating<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.460> image

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
to how I should be recreating the image

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.630 
to how I should be recreating the image
we<00:03:57.570> found<00:03:57.750> out<00:03:57.990> that<00:03:58.020> we<00:03:58.500> could<00:03:58.920> get<00:03:59.070> more

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
we found out that we could get more

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.910 
we found out that we could get more
detail<00:04:00.030> less<00:04:00.540> artifacts<00:04:01.050> less<00:04:01.290> mistakes<00:04:01.650> if

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
detail less artifacts less mistakes if

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.310 
detail less artifacts less mistakes if
we<00:04:02.370> went<00:04:02.550> out<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.850> look<00:04:03.750> much<00:04:03.930> further<00:04:04.110> afield

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
we went out and look much further afield

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.020 
we went out and look much further afield
now<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.010> could<00:04:05.220> take<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.400> hit<00:04:05.610> in<00:04:05.730> terms<00:04:05.910> of

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
now you could take a hit in terms of

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.240 
now you could take a hit in terms of
processing<00:04:06.930> time<00:04:07.260> for<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:07.800> we<00:04:07.920> also<00:04:08.040> have

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
processing time for that so we also have

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.610 
processing time for that so we also have
to<00:04:08.280> optimize<00:04:08.640> those<00:04:09.000> algorithms<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:10.470> as<00:04:10.530> to

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
to optimize those algorithms so as to

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.840 
to optimize those algorithms so as to
not<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.890> penalize<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.430> terms<00:04:11.610> of<00:04:11.700> rock

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
not to penalize in terms of rock

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.700 
not to penalize in terms of rock
conversion<00:04:12.300> time<00:04:12.450> so<00:04:12.990> now<00:04:13.140> let's<00:04:13.470> talk<00:04:13.650> about

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
conversion time so now let's talk about

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.440 
conversion time so now let's talk about
the<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.520> noise<00:04:14.700> reduction<00:04:14.970> because<00:04:15.240> that's

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
the the noise reduction because that's

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.090 
the the noise reduction because that's
another<00:04:15.630> area<00:04:15.840> where<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.410> really<00:04:16.680> achieved<00:04:16.980> a

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
another area where you really achieved a

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.970 
another area where you really achieved a
breakthrough<00:04:17.630> really<00:04:18.630> in<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:19.200> both<00:04:19.739> in<00:04:19.859> how

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
breakthrough really in in both in how

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.380 
breakthrough really in in both in how
your<00:04:20.130> processing<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.700> what<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.880> results<00:04:21.270> are

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
your processing and what the results are

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.150 
your processing and what the results are
so<00:04:21.930> what's<00:04:22.170> different<00:04:22.350> with<00:04:22.590> your<00:04:22.740> approach

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
so what's different with your approach

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.550 
so what's different with your approach
to<00:04:23.190> noise<00:04:23.490> reduction<00:04:23.760> ok<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:24.420> in<00:04:24.900> version<00:04:25.230> 5<00:04:25.410> we

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
to noise reduction ok so in version 5 we

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.080 
to noise reduction ok so in version 5 we
also<00:04:25.680> took<00:04:25.860> advantage<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.610> rewrite<00:04:27.060> of

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
also took advantage of the rewrite of

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.540 
also took advantage of the rewrite of
the<00:04:27.270> software<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.840> redo<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.230> noise<00:04:28.550> reduction

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
the software to redo the noise reduction

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.300 
the software to redo the noise reduction
for<00:04:30.419> raw<00:04:30.540> images<00:04:30.990> ok<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.410> once<00:04:31.650> again<00:04:31.800> you

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
for raw images ok and once again you

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.500 
for raw images ok and once again you
know<00:04:32.430> encourage<00:04:32.820> people<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.090> shoot<00:04:33.360> raw

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
know encourage people to shoot raw

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.070 
know encourage people to shoot raw
because<00:04:33.690> we<00:04:33.870> can<00:04:33.990> get<00:04:34.110> much<00:04:34.260> better<00:04:34.440> results

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
because we can get much better results

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.020 
because we can get much better results
so<00:04:35.500> what<00:04:35.620> we're<00:04:35.770> doing<00:04:36.009> here<00:04:36.189> now<00:04:36.340> is<00:04:36.520> removing

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
so what we're doing here now is removing

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.300 
so what we're doing here now is removing
the<00:04:37.150> noise<00:04:37.330> before<00:04:38.139> the<00:04:38.590> raw<00:04:38.740> conversion

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
the noise before the raw conversion

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.710 
the noise before the raw conversion
traditionally<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.000> lot<00:04:40.180> of<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.449> noise

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
traditionally a lot of the noise

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.749 
traditionally a lot of the noise
reduction<00:04:41.020> has<00:04:41.289> been<00:04:41.439> done<00:04:41.620> after<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.430> rockin

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
reduction has been done after the rockin

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.369 
reduction has been done after the rockin
version<00:04:43.030> of<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.210> image<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.659> what<00:04:44.199> we've

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.379 
version of the image and what we've

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.140 
version of the image and what we've
studied<00:04:44.680> and<00:04:45.129> noticed<00:04:45.520> is<00:04:45.639> that<00:04:45.669> if<00:04:45.879> you<00:04:46.000> do

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
studied and noticed is that if you do

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.480 
studied and noticed is that if you do
that<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.840> noise<00:04:47.020> actually<00:04:47.439> gets<00:04:47.620> worsened

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
that the noise actually gets worsened

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.850 
that the noise actually gets worsened
and<00:04:48.669> gets<00:04:48.939> made<00:04:49.810> more<00:04:50.020> difficult<00:04:50.199> to<00:04:50.560> remove

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
and gets made more difficult to remove

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.409 
and gets made more difficult to remove
as<00:04:51.069> part<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.490> raw<00:04:51.639> conversion<00:04:52.120> okay<00:04:52.360> so

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
as part of the raw conversion okay so

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.209 
as part of the raw conversion okay so
what<00:04:53.139> we're<00:04:53.259> doing<00:04:53.289> now<00:04:53.530> is<00:04:53.620> we're<00:04:53.919> measuring

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:54.219 
what we're doing now is we're measuring

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.369 
what we're doing now is we're measuring
the<00:04:54.490> noise<00:04:54.639> on<00:04:54.939> raw<00:04:55.180> files<00:04:55.479> and<00:04:55.750> removing<00:04:56.259> it

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:56.379 
the noise on raw files and removing it

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.010 
the noise on raw files and removing it
on<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:57.099> raw<00:04:57.250> file<00:04:57.550> before<00:04:57.789> we<00:04:58.060> do<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.479> rock

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
on the raw file before we do the rock

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.959 
on the raw file before we do the rock
conversion<00:04:59.500> and<00:04:59.770> that<00:05:00.069> allows<00:05:00.430> us<00:05:00.460> to<00:05:00.789> have

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 
conversion and that allows us to have

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.719 
conversion and that allows us to have
much<00:05:01.539> more<00:05:01.569> natural<00:05:02.169> look<00:05:02.349> much<00:05:03.039> finer<00:05:03.340> grain

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
much more natural look much finer grain

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.249 
much more natural look much finer grain
in<00:05:03.879> the<00:05:03.969> image<00:05:04.240> that<00:05:04.270> almost<00:05:04.689> has<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:04.930> kind<00:05:05.139> of

in the image that almost has a kind of

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.659 
in the image that almost has a kind of
film<00:05:05.530> like<00:05:05.710> quality<00:05:06.129> to<00:05:06.280> it<00:05:06.310> and<00:05:07.210> much<00:05:07.780> less
