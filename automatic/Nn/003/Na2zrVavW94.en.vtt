00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.450
 not lie chrome 11:10 I hope that 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.500
 you always have good 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.790

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.650
 last in view of the day that of 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.350
 eden hazard team version of the season 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.720
 so the rush of this day is coming to an end 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.039
 on eden hazard so the little prince of 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.510
 belgium you see that the pebbles in 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.439
 a premier league team this is the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.130
 even so she is still so 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.840
 competitive 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.010
 you have stats in game that are in 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.179
 scroll down I invite you to put 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.410
 on break rare masters in early arts 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.610
 is observed for those who wish 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.110
 buy credits oued souf a point 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.160
 as 5% translation with fatwa code 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.550
 of true credit within five minutes which 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.050
 follow the purchase 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.730
 according to available stocks 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.930
 information in the description so 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.820
 using a chance thot I'm going 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.500
 start talking about the price as I 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.850
 the habit of doing now so at 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.350
 the moment I'm doing the review we're 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.570
 Thursday we are always Thursday morning 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.460
 it's 9 o'clock this time we have a 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.199
 little bit advanced young is still sleeping 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.640
 besides, I do not intend to sleep 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.140
 the little anecdote so its price is from 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.460
 1 million nine hundred thousand credit is 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.289
 true that it's very high still a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.680
 time that it's not at all accessible to 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.840
 everybody 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.670
 does it bother me to put this 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.559
 price there on that kind yes in the sense that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.630
 on the left you have cristiano ronaldo who 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.060
 remains for me really the top of the top at 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.890
 at this post and the regular version of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.890
 ronaldo remains for me always at 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.810
 above chance totti even if chance 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.280
 tots earlier even if the chance toth is 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.710
 really very good I find that the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.880
 ronaldo it remains the safe bet even if 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.100
 this is again the stroke of luck 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.479
 will go down because you still have this 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.280
 happy hour system that will arrive 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.320
 so in the weekend the prices have when 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.180
 even quite a bit down so that was for 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.590
 the price side we go now to 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.540
 negative point so at the points level 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.130
 negatives the eden hazard I put two 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.259
 I put two of the negative points 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.090
 rather picky in the sense that I 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.880
 put his stats stats in jump and stats in 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.350
 head game that for me my ask some 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.270
 problems in the sense that he does not hesitate 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.430
 to bed a lot in the hair and suddenly 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.409
 when you center your head he takes 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.130
 no balloon so that's more 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.689
 problematic 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.220
 even though it's true that a crime is not 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.200
 necessarily brought 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.570
 to put the head but me the way 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.800
 I play wingers sometimes when they 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.990
 are in lax you need them 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.580
 whether they are there to put 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.810
 the head and the eden hazard it's not the 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.320
 all the case so I stood by the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.730
 specify 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.410
 even if this is still a 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.520
 secondary negative point then in 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.840
 good positive kicking 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.700
 arrested rather well draws the corners and 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.590
 the free kicks I got but this 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.060
 was not very well drawn as a date of 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.140
 when I actually have the problem it's 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.120
 when I have it I can not get too much 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.340
 the propeller very good he still has 1 99 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.770
 years precious box set only 99 indeed and 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.270
 1.99 in striking power so 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.500
 necessarily if you know how to draw them 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.020
 a lot of movement there will be no 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.430
 concern for that side but penalty one 99 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.930
 years penalties besides jura penalties 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.720
 in this review is jelly mark but 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.010
 it'll happen soon after 99 in 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.600
 finish it's still very 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.370
 interesting for a left winger in 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.650
 the meaning where on a right foot and for 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.260
 to strike the flat of the foot rest remains 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.180
 always always cool longshot I have 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.640
 I tried a few times the ball 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.290
 by the balloon goes pretty well but it 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.280
 always remains limited even though he has when 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.740
 even really very stats 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.230
 interesting in hot water 99 in cat 97 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.150
 in hitting power where he is 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.519
 interesting this at the physical level 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.610
 he certainly has a 72 in strength what can 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.100
 look small a little stat for a 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.380
 player who closed 72 but here it is 1.99 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.330
 in balance that compensates enormously and 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.680
 suddenly bah it's really not bad 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.739
 very good on his legs 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.780
 compared to the backs that 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.470
 are who rather have a good speed a 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.060
 good physical 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.260
 he seeks without problem and even 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.780
 time when he brought in 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.700
 the axÃ© he holds to the shoulder facing 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.140
 some defenders rather physical 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.150
 again the same example a the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.700
 david luiz and it's after technically 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.590
 really very very good 99 in dribble 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.090
 not even unfit for 99 years says that 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.890
 she just 97 years dream but 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.900
 I really felt like he was 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.400
 thoroughly because there was such ease 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.140
 technical to his impressions notes with 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.730
 him four floors technical gesture that 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.019
 for me I wanted to put it in 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.120
 the negative points in the direction 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.770
 where eden hazard in real life 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.000
 Verry much 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.650
 bah saint-jean kiss kill still not 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.180
 wrong even if he does not either 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.650
 crazy gestures but I tell myself that they 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.850
 could have he still could have him 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.070
 put the 5 stars technical gesture and 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.120
 it bothers me but now I have 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.890
 still put in the positives 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.090
 the four-star technical gesture but 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.440
 I wish I would have liked 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.580
 on the facsimiles of the five stars 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.260
 because it's still a player who 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.390
 dribble rather a lot of hours tired 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.920
 of a balance a clip in mode what they 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.600
 learn to the four bad tomes 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.760
 foot so that's always cool and more 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.680
 a winger who was going both cases 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.840
 feet so you can without left tripod 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.700
 with no problem the ball will be good 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.410
 then he has a pass quality really 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.270
 interesting even if it's still true 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.370
 once with the wingers the way I 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.590
 plays a lot with this type of liela 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.300
 the winged right if left side I play 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.210
 enormously low to score goals in 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.040
 made ultra offensive way with so 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.150
 the eden hazard todd you see the balance sheet 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.520
 another 20 out of 20 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.140
 so we finish the first four have 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.940
 seen of the day and finally 4 in view of 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.110
 this day that happened on wind but 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.120
 it is true that here is the level is 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.640
 really very very high and suddenly bah 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.130
 I can not I can not m below me 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.600
 can not follow to nibble and suddenly 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.980
 down 20 of 20 what for the eden hazard 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.270
 at the level of the positive points so shots 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.280
 of arrested feet as I said corner 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.780
 kick penalty very really 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.740
 interesting even though again the 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.270
 free corps there is always this little 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.470
 problem in my review I'm not coming 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.470
 Too much to illustrate 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.630
 after stolen effects technically brilliant 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.560
 very impressive finish 99 in 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.260
 finishing is still enough 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.790
 interesting goes for a winger to be down 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.600
 competitors to hit it's 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.120
 pretty cool 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.490
 the flat of the foot or the striking force 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.380
 it remains devastating what's left 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.060
 it's devastating strikes its 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.740
 speed goes very fast without eden 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.720
 hazard on that side there's no problem 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.430
 he's going really fast his physique really 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.740
 very interesting so as I said 72 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.810
 in strength with 1.99 in balance 99 in 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.580
 agility he really holds very very well 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.960
 on his legs and it happened rather 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.450
 cool long hot 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.010
 I tried I put them in the most 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.230
 even though I tested some of them 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.910
 ball goes well but that's it 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.400
 pretty random positioning always 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.990
 well placed really very very offensive 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.280
 as she and her contributions 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.080
 offensive strong defensive contribution 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.240
 lens is sure after a remission 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.400
 weak defensive so he's really 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.900
 always there to mark and that's 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.010
 a lot of calls in the province and 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.230
 a lot of calls in the depth 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.930
 but towards the accent does it really 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.070
 there to plant what simply 4 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.450
 and a bad foot so both feet 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.610
 Quality goes really 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.740
 interesting even if it's true 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.150
 you see the balance the stats with that 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.710
 I have almost no passes 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.480
 decisive and that the passes were not 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.100
 too much of what i was concerned with i 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.510
 did prawn 4 stars gesture 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.190
 very good technique very good 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.630
 technically but I would have liked 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.430
 who has the 5 stars gesture 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.110
 technique this is my little side a 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.570
 little purists side then after in the 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.030
 negatives so jump and I head that 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.500
 that's the picky side I decided to 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.300
 to put it it's true that it's still 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.980
 secondary but still I held 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.260
 to specify it is so see the stats 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.270
 with seven games 12 goals and two assists 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.370
 decisive factors, including a very 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.870
 very good for a winger what makes 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.669
 I really like it because it's 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.690
 remains a very very good winger so here we go 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.140
 that's all for the eden hazard review 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.820
 toth 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.350
 that's it for this day of review 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.330
 fourth review of the day is that 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.710
 the same it was a pretty rush 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.180
 interesting me I think that at the moment 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.320
 where you will look at the magazine would 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.270
 almost on the verge of falling asleep 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.860
 and so here is so do not hesitate to me 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.560
 bomb blue thumb this review has 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.840

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.940

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.590

 so find again tomorrow there will surely 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.220
 lesser goal will not have 4th seen from me but 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.200
 there will always be reviews of the tops 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.550
 I think there will be two months I can 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.010
 announce you there will surely be two 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.570
 it will be steven gerrard tox and daniel 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.370
 sturridge stoxx so it's still 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.570
