00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 and there beyond the channel everything beauty everything 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.049
 Calm down, everything's cool here is the tweet with 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.240
 Another video on the channel here and today. 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.370
 talk about industries 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.679
 This is it, is it to sell the title of the video? 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.440
 I do not know what number of video and but 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.720
 so you could hear the video about 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.510
 industries and today we will talk about this 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.939
 little beauty that is coming out here to smoke 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.269
 the heart of the city ​​because without it the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.890
 trade does not work right and without 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.840
 trade it also works the way 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.450
 So it's an exchange of things, but it's the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.570
 heart of the city really and let's go there 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.950
 oh what do you what to ask me 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.020
 the question appears the guy was not 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.149
 exactly he asked I 'm not going 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.870
 respond exactly but the 'global' 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.280
 general context of the industry because I 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.930
 I did not quite understand his question 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.000
 but I will encompass the general industry 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.730
 they are there in the data neither as always 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.329
 view data beauty found zones here 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.489
 and let's see where the industries are 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.250
 the denunciations are all in 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.739
 area here up here and just start to 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.010
 Can you see the time it starts here? 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.229
 to change to type there was an airplane the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.990
 markets around the city 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.090
 inside the residential area and is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.790
 basically so let's take care of the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.189
 swim here industrial let's go 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.729
 I did not come here in zones industrial zone 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.090
 agricultural 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.979
 I have tried three types of industrial zone 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.229
 of the agricultural area also well industrial 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.540
 but it is the development of farms 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.540
 You are welcome to start with it. 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.930
 put her right there in the corner and in this one 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.420
 there are residential areas and starts with 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.640
 it is to generate the development 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.710
 of the legal population generating this 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.600
 population because there will be food in 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.680
 having food will bring population 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.860
 so that's it 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.530
 cheap food after a while when 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.180
 you see that in 2000 when the city is 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.280
 very large is with a population 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.890
 More or less, like everything else. 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.939
 occupied but not necessarily with 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.360
 buildings and such 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.610
 You can start trading for real is 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.259
 industries of the medium and 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.500
 Before you do that you have to come 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.300
 in a monthly budget I'm saying 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.770
 The way to play guys if you have one 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.320
 different way as I always say 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.360
 strong in the comments but come on you 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.080
 Come here on my buck budget 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.640
 monthly 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.310
 and let's go and tax the taxes and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.980
 increases everything and increase of 11 in the pollutant 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.870
 to 20 percent increasing adilson 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.940
 still polluting to 20% will prevent 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.420
 she comes to the city and if she comes 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.100
 will pay a lot then it's a good one if you come 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.230
 she will pay a lot with him and see that I 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.810
 I have not yet polluted and the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.250
 manufacturing and high technology I 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.850
 I recommend that you left high-tech 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.420
 one or two I like to leave a regret 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.770
 to generate little money but it 's to pull 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.959
 industries for your city can see 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.060
 which is yielding less than I expect 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.780
 here is why I was arranging the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.690
 City 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.580
 I took some street and such I changed 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.680
 so whenever you clean up the city 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.260
 Your revenue will fall. 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.120
 so leave two here one or two 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.890
 depends on how your money is 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.760
 society the number of high-tech industries 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.380
 technology 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.260
 after a while you give a 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.760
 A little bit more than at the time 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.410
 blip is a blip I say 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.230
 This is the point that does not 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.519
 too much regret will not amaze the 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.019
 sales increase slightly in 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.600
 bit is putting tax 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.570
 then a 9% step from 9% 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.549
 they will leave out beauty put 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:46.530
 accept here and we will explain about 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.450
 beginning with the ally and channel in the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.500
 facebook and twitter 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.209
 the hu and he said that he talked about 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.980
 manufactures it said they generate 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.930
 pollution they generate pollution 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.549
 just the same, not the same way anymore 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.209
 was a population lets show 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.299
 you 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.250
 and this popular pollution that it generates only 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.100
 that you have seen pollution of the hands and 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.040
 pollutant and it is red dwarf is 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.019
 yellow and the public right in the center 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.060
 so to solve this problem and 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.019
 put therein is very yellow pollution 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.570
 easy to solve 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.340
 just put green parks and trees at all 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.930
 more when she was the red 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.760
 pollution has to be you have to 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.979
 destroy the entire area and wait for a 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.850
 time until the pollution is then a 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.520
 different thing 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.190
 and manufactures because it has to leave more 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.140
 a fact of not only the high technology 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.690
 because manufacturing will generate products 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.550
 society by generating products for the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.770
 population and will become the 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.750
 products for high technology will generate 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.450
 medical protocol products and without 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.660
 manufacturing does not work very 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.640
 well a city and then manufactures generate 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.330
 employment has left open a 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.910
 year 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.090
 I think this one is manufacturing is the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.670
 hour was 3031 job can only see each 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.800
 building that will generate 40 30 then he 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.860
 generates a lot of work for the population to avoid 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.210
 that the population is unemployed 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.910
 manufactures as it already says the name and 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.710
 move your hands and it's creation if you already 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.870
 Did you take this at the school? 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:18.510
 started there at the time of the revolution 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:21.180
 when the English created 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.730
 in manufactures and such to be able to sell 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.920
 create or sell products and it is 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.570
 basically this is the 3rd show of 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:33.660
 high technology that this is high 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:35.520
 high technology technology to 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.350
 technology has a little bit here high 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.040
 technology was already enough. 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:44.190
 only that it draws a lot of energy and 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.920
 she comes little quantity to the city 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.380
 so it's ok, that's right, right? 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.120
 the game is the game it is a game 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.190
 he was created to be a 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.990
 smart game you 're not 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.850
 accustomed to silly games, right? 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.210
 only that this game is a game that was 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.970
 thought it is a complicated game and 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.950
 a hint that the one that Wilson's ally 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.650
 Sorry, I know you are very little 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.290
 time will not remember his name but he and 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.990
 and that's exactly what it is. 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.630
 with problem of trash pollution 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.540
 put itself does not know to celebrate 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:22.710
 waste manager 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:25.020
 trash here put it around you do 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:29.430
 water biome of this type without 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:31.050
 this litter and tree manager and the 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.140
 prevents pollution from coming out of it 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.510
 exactly and leave your feedback button 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.400
 enjoyed boxing your comments if you 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.230
 you have a different way of doing 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.890
 take care of the industries tell me there 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.890
 I want to know and that's it, personal beauty and 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.890
 went
