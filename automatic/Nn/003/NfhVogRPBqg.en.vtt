is anyway let's start it off work to
rule<00:00:52.969> starts<00:00:53.969> off<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> simple<00:00:55.020> pitch

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
rule starts off with a simple pitch

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.160 
rule starts off with a simple pitch
harmonic<00:00:55.710> above<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.699> fifth<00:00:56.940> fret<00:00:59.390> so<00:01:00.390> there

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
harmonic above the fifth fret so there

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.340 
harmonic above the fifth fret so there

bang<00:01:07.580> goes

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.140 

which<00:01:10.600> is<00:01:10.810> nine<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:12.030> nine<00:01:13.030> ten<00:01:13.330> six<00:01:14.230> nine<00:01:14.650> ten

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and then the fun way the fun rip palm

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:09.320 
and then the fun way the fun rip palm
muting<00:01:58.910> pull<00:01:59.910> offs<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:01.010> a<00:02:02.010> little<00:02:02.580> building

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.360 

okay<00:02:10.170> let's<00:02:10.530> see<00:02:10.650> if<00:02:10.740> i<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.040> a<00:02:11.100> close-up

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
okay let's see if i can get a close-up

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.930 
okay let's see if i can get a close-up
of<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.730> one<00:02:14.240> basically<00:02:15.240> what<00:02:15.420> you're<00:02:15.540> doing

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
of that one basically what you're doing

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.760 
of that one basically what you're doing
you<00:02:17.940> know<00:02:18.030> Paul<00:02:18.330> mute<00:02:18.570> on<00:02:18.810> whatever<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.410> big

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
you know Paul mute on whatever the big

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.180 
you know Paul mute on whatever the big
string<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.340> guess<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.520> E<00:02:20.670> string<00:02:20.940> whatever

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
string is I guess the E string whatever

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.630 
string is I guess the E string whatever
then<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.220> hit<00:02:23.580> three<00:02:23.990> on<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.110> next<00:02:25.410> string

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
then you hit three on the next string

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.220 
then you hit three on the next string
but<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.700> gotta<00:02:26.850> pull<00:02:27.030> off<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:29.840> pull<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:30.990> and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
but you gotta pull off so pull up and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:44.510 
but you gotta pull off so pull up and
then<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.160> hit<00:02:32.610> five<00:02:32.910> six

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.160 

okay<00:02:45.520> you<00:02:45.790> do<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.180> couple<00:02:46.240> times<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:47.020> you

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
okay you do that a couple times and you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.250 
okay you do that a couple times and you
move<00:02:47.500> down<00:02:47.730> do<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.970> exact<00:02:49.390> same<00:02:49.420> pattern<00:02:49.930> and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
move down do the exact same pattern and

00:02:50.260 --> 00:03:00.740 
move down do the exact same pattern and
accept<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.680> do<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:51.010> with<00:02:53.940> 134

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:13.460 

there<00:03:01.710> yeah<00:03:02.420> there's<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.510> one<00:03:03.780> so

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.010 

and<00:03:14.470> then<00:03:14.670> what<00:03:15.670> you'll<00:03:15.820> do<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.210> that<00:03:16.390> instead

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
and then what you'll do is that instead

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.520 
and then what you'll do is that instead
of<00:03:17.170> playing<00:03:17.440> five<00:03:17.860> six<00:03:17.890> on<00:03:18.490> the<00:03:19.300> on<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:19.990> D

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
of playing five six on the on the D

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.940 
of playing five six on the on the D
string<00:03:20.580> you<00:03:21.580> move<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:22.260> switch<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.410> over<00:03:23.500> flip

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
string you move that switch it over flip

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.670
