time to time but that's kind of like the
basis<00:01:24.920> of<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.579> left<00:01:25.820> hand<00:01:26.090> kind<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.619> baseline

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
right hand is just kind of following the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.730 
right hand is just kind of following the
left<00:01:31.789> so<00:01:32.210> it'll<00:01:32.360> be<00:01:32.390> like<00:01:32.479> hitting<00:01:33.320> these<00:01:33.560> at

just use the melody just sounds a little
bit<00:03:09.670> cooler<00:03:09.880> if<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.090> can<00:03:10.300> only<00:03:10.450> have<00:03:10.660> the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
bit cooler if you can only have the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:48.960 
bit cooler if you can only have the
repeating<00:03:11.230> note<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.980> um<00:03:13.260> here<00:03:14.260> goes

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.060 

yeah<00:03:49.970> come<00:03:50.360> like<00:03:50.570> that<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.290> with<00:03:51.710> that<00:03:51.740> I<00:03:51.920> can

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
yeah come like that and with that I can

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.230 
yeah come like that and with that I can
get<00:03:52.160> through<00:03:52.280> pretty<00:03:52.520> much<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.850> whole<00:03:52.880> song

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
get through pretty much the whole song

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.850 
get through pretty much the whole song
probably<00:03:53.960> if<00:03:54.020> I<00:03:54.050> was<00:03:54.170> singing<00:03:54.350> it<00:03:54.500> I<00:03:54.590> wouldn't

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
probably if I was singing it I wouldn't

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.110 
probably if I was singing it I wouldn't
be<00:03:55.120> playing<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.360> same<00:03:56.570> melody<00:03:56.960> that<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:58.120> the

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
be playing the same melody that the the

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.760 
be playing the same melody that the the
singers<00:03:59.600> singing<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:00.080> I<00:04:00.140> probably<00:04:00.350> just<00:04:00.650> be

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
singers singing so I probably just be

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:09.490
