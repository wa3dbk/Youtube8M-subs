00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.200 

was<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.920> stapled<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.430> middle<00:01:54.760> of<00:01:54.970> those

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
was I stapled in the middle of those

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.289 
was I stapled in the middle of those
eight<00:01:55.570> layers<00:01:55.930> then<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.740> simply<00:01:57.460> just<00:01:57.790> pulled

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
eight layers then I simply just pulled

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.580 
eight layers then I simply just pulled
them<00:01:58.840> apart<00:01:59.140> and<00:02:00.210> its<00:02:01.210> finer<00:02:01.659> paper<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.560> is

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
them apart and its finer paper it is

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.630 
them apart and its finer paper it is
definitely<00:02:03.479> heavier<00:02:04.479> than<00:02:04.750> tissue<00:02:05.440> paper<00:02:05.920> but

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
definitely heavier than tissue paper but

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.529 
definitely heavier than tissue paper but
not<00:02:06.909> as<00:02:07.210> heavy<00:02:07.570> as<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:07.960> coffee<00:02:08.409> filter<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:10.060> um

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
not as heavy as a coffee filter so um

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.360 
not as heavy as a coffee filter so um
this<00:02:11.110> paper<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.860> very<00:02:12.360> inexpensive<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:14.370> you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
this paper is very inexpensive and you

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.840 
this paper is very inexpensive and you
can<00:02:15.549> get<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.760> lot<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.209> flowers<00:02:16.659> out<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.769> one<00:02:18.129> path

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
can get a lot of flowers out of one path

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.630 
can get a lot of flowers out of one path
so<00:02:19.600> I'm<00:02:19.840> going<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.140> pull<00:02:20.500> those<00:02:20.800> all<00:02:21.070> apart

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
so I'm going to pull those all apart

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.390 
so I'm going to pull those all apart
then<00:02:22.480> what<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.810> did<00:02:23.170> was<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.740> brought<00:02:23.800> in<00:02:24.340> my

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
twist that down into that hole like so I

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.940 
twist that down into that hole like so I
don't<00:05:17.000> think<00:05:17.330> I'm<00:05:17.600> getting<00:05:17.810> it<00:05:18.050> exactly<00:05:18.680> in

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
don't think I'm getting it exactly in

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.520 
don't think I'm getting it exactly in
the<00:05:19.100> fall<00:05:22.180> let's<00:05:23.180> see<00:05:23.630> if<00:05:23.780> I<00:05:23.900> can<00:05:23.930> do<00:05:24.260> that<00:05:24.290> a

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
the fall let's see if I can do that a

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.060 
the fall let's see if I can do that a
little<00:05:25.070> bit<00:05:25.370> better<00:05:26.410> that's<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.620> easiest

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
little bit better that's the easiest

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.100 
little bit better that's the easiest
part<00:05:28.490> is<00:05:28.640> going<00:05:28.850> through<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.360> hole<00:05:29.600> but<00:05:29.930> I've

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
part is going through the hole but I've

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.050 
part is going through the hole but I've
missed<00:05:30.440> it<00:05:30.650> so<00:05:30.710> I'm<00:05:31.310> just<00:05:31.460> going<00:05:31.640> to<00:05:31.730> poke

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
missed it so I'm just going to poke

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.650 
missed it so I'm just going to poke
another<00:05:32.270> hole<00:05:33.610> make<00:05:34.610> sure<00:05:34.640> it's<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.150> little<00:05:35.510> bit

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
another hole make sure it's a little bit

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.980 
another hole make sure it's a little bit
bigger<00:05:35.930> so<00:05:36.080> that<00:05:36.260> I<00:05:36.410> can<00:05:36.470> see<00:05:36.830> it<00:05:36.980> there<00:05:37.010> we<00:05:37.310> go

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
bigger so that I can see it there we go

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.760
