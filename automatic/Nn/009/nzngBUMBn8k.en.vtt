Hi, I'm Alex González (#Maná #De La Tierra)
and I'm here to talk to you about the new Paiste

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.700
Signature &lt;&lt;Precision&gt;&gt; cymbals.

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.450
The purpose in creating the Signature Precision
line was precisely to give drummers access to a more affordable cymbal.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.450
In other words,
to create a line of cymbals for someone who wants to play Signatures but who until now,
may not have been able to afford it.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.520
These cymbals are made from the same alloy used
in the classic Signature line, but at the same time offer a range of different sounds. Paiste specifically researched and designed the manufacturing process to achieve that goal.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.280
The sonic characteristics of these cymbals are: clarity, brilliance, they project and they can be used in many different genres of music, like Pop, Rock/Alternative Rock, Hard Rock, Funk, Rhythm &amp; Blues and Latin music. They are incredibly versatile and they can be used in the studio and in live playing situations.
