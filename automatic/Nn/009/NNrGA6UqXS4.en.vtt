 [LIMA, PERU] 

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:21.103
 Let's go. 

00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:25.776
 The individual adapts to the economic possibilities. 

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:29.778
 Unfortunately, our economy allows us to offer only counterfeit goods. 

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:32.616
 Yes, piracy is illegal. 

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:35.663
 But in a country that is eager to gain access to knowledge 

00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:39.743
 [SANTOS DEMONIOS, DVD SELLER PIRATES] - which is a form of development - it must go through illegality. 

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:44.668
 [THE PARADISE OF PIRATE DVDS] 

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:57.141
 [THE PIRACY OF FILMS IS VERY WIDEN IN LIMA, PERU.] 

00:00:57.183 --> 00:01:06.398
 [AS INTERNET ACCESS IS SLOW AND EXPENSIVE AND THE LEGAL VERSIONS OF FILMS ARE RARELY AVAILABLE, PIRATE DVDS REMAIN THE PREFERRED METHOD OF PERUVIANS TO WATCH MOVIES.] 

00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:09.445
 Let's see what we have here. 

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:15.200
 I must have about 4,200 films. 

00:01:17.036 --> 00:01:17.870
 I have "Submarino", 

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.331
 Nolan's first film, "Following" ... 

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:25.668
 In fact, I collected the films before I started selling copies. 

00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:30.216
 At first, I was a collector, I bought movies. 

00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:34.178
 I found myself unemployed, and I thought it was an alternative. 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.598
 I am the dealer. I deliver pirate movies. 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.723
 Your visual drug. 

00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:47.565
 [POLVOS AZULES SHOPPING CENTER] 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.325
 [SANTOS BUYS THE MAJORITY OF ITS COPIES IN THE STORE OF HIS FRIEND CHINO IN "PASAJE 18", ONE OF THE MOST KNOWN PLACES TO OBTAIN PIRATE DVDS IN LIMA.] 

00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:03.835
 [EL CHINO, DVD SELLER PIRATES] I work here. I sell independent or specialized cinema. 

00:02:03.876 --> 00:02:06.876
 [EL CHINO, PIRATES DVD SELLER] It's a genre that few people know. 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.551
 I will say that today we have about 4800 titles. 

00:02:13.593 --> 00:02:15.386
 I really like classical cinema. 

00:02:15.428 --> 00:02:17.930
 I had a lot of movies. 

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.975
 One day, I had the idea to bring them back here. 

00:02:20.016 --> 00:02:22.560
 It all started with Alfred Hitchcock. 

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:26.230
 We rarely saw his films here. 

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:30.818
 And I continued with directors like Godard, Truffaut or Rohmer, 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.738
 trying to collect them little by little. 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.990
 And with the requests of the customers. 

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:40.620
 Sometimes we interact with collectors or strangers. 

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:46.333
 They bring back their films and we do some exchanges. 

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:51.296
 We can find a lot of movies online 

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.383
 but a lot of customers say that 

00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:58.721
 it's very slow to download. They prefer to buy a copy. 

00:02:58.763 --> 00:03:00.723
 The films must be of very good quality 

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:05.061
 and well subtitled, otherwise my clients do not take them. 

00:03:05.103 --> 00:03:08.690
 A jacket can validate or cancel a case. 

00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:11.693
 It's all another work. 

00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:15.738
 Sometimes the covers come in English, 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:26.706
 but a lot of customers do not speak English. We must translate them into Spanish. 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.546
 Many of my clients are directors, 

00:03:32.588 --> 00:03:36.550
 film critics and other important figures in the film industry - 

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.593
 not only from Peru, but also from other countries. 

00:03:39.013 --> 00:03:40.973
 [EL CHATO, PIRATES DVD SELLER] Some people do not have access to these movies 

00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:42.681
 [EL CHATO, DVD SELLER PIRATES] in their countries and come to buy them here. 

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:46.726
 "The life of Adele" is selling very well right now! 

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:48.730
 It's only 4 Soles [1,20 â‚¬]. 

00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:53.566
 This documentary is also in great demand. 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.945
 Good cinema is culture. 

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:57.905
 All knowledge is good 

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.491
 and it is important to access knowledge. 

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:03.076
 "Pasaje 18" specialized there. 

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:09.083
 There are even films that have been left by the directors themselves for broadcast. 

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:14.380
 One of the best known to have been here is Apichatpong Weerasethakul, 

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:24.556
 well known in the independent cinema since he won Cannes in 2010. 

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:30.063
 When he came, he was surprised to see that we knew him. 

00:04:30.105 --> 00:04:32.940
 He was even very happy because, 

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:37.610
 in many other countries it is not known. 

00:04:39.155 --> 00:04:41.323
 The police are also buying us pirate movies. 

00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:42.866
 It's more like before. 

00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:46.370
 I had problems with the law about ten years ago. 

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:50.248
 They came and confiscated all my films. 

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.293
 But they do it more 

00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:54.668
 because it has become a very important sector. 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.758
 Knowledge is made to be shared and shared 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.551
 and not kept by the elites. 

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:07.100
 When elites have the monopoly of knowledge, they become corrupt. 

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:13.230
 And an average consumer from a third world country, with an emerging market 

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:17.860
 and a great thirst for knowledge, can not access it. 

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:21.780
 It is the power of the one who knows about the one who does not know. 

00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:28.913
 So in the end, I am a cultural broadcaster. 

00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:33.708
 This is the idea. Disseminate culture and democratize knowledge. 

00:05:36.838 --> 00:05:40.341
 Chato, my friend wants the VICE series on HBO 

00:05:40.383 --> 00:05:41.926
 and I think it's in your documentary catalog. 

00:05:41.968 --> 00:05:42.510
 Yes I have it. 

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:43.551
 Cool, give it to me. 

00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.681
 I told you he had it!
