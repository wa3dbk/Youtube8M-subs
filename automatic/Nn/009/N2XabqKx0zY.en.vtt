00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.969
 This is a personal quick reaction to 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.460
 people now can close the cart 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.890
 with accent is a new wedge model 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.770
 I'll show you how it works. 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.440
 so let's go to start everything 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.699
 cart is huge he is very big he 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.250
 protects the baby well 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.320
 You can close that it comes in here 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.529
 front is also well covered people 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.629
 can see the baby around here is just fine 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.070
 We want the time that we try. 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.230
 see the baby have to try to adjust 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.180
 to see the baby would be 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.339
 cooler was a little bigger 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.559
 This part is plastic for us to see 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.809
 baby but the head is happening 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.790
 and this lateral opening also facilitates 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.930
 rather they looked to what is 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.659
 happening on the street 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.299
 the part that drives the cart does not 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.760
 adjust the height so you'll have that is 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:58.979
 cool for anyone who has a high test 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.690
 but if you are comfortable in time 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.190
 push the cart but here he 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.110
 do not have bullet then we will not 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.270
 get kicked by the cart that 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.580
 we will hardly stumble 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.380
 so this is really cool from the wedge the brake 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.170
 of the cart is also very practical people 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.930
 Squeeze here, I'm training here. 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.479
 cart is released for touring 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.939
 This shopping cart is a shopping cart. 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.950
 considered Czech and show here in 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.679
 United States what's this? 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.170
 It is a cart that is lighter and does not 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.450
 is to consider a complete cart but 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.140
 he has all of the baby's needs 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.210
 one advantage of it is the weight it tests only 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.909
 nine kilos so it's cool for us 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.640
 walk with him he is very practical ok the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.560
 His accent is very big and very wide. 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.469
 how to understand a little more here 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.140
 It has three heights of belts the belt 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:52.399
 is five points like belts to cni 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.020
 we have to do that again 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.090
 The puzzle has to fit the parts 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.310
 Lips to close the belt 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.679
 But that's all the carts here and 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.630
 going to have is something that would be cooler 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.219
 if you were independent maybe but it's a 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.499
 Model wedge us settles with 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.970
 ease at the time of doing does not have 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:11.910
 that front plate 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.909
 ok but it's also easy to put and 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.670
 take the baby to and the part of the hotel support 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.160
 foot does not have adjustment ok then when 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.680
 children 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.810
 the biggest of them I support here the cable 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.670
 supporting the drawing many times here ok 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.460
 so this here we can not 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.260
 going down to refine the seat is 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.920
 It's a cool thing, same model, because 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.260
 he rests a hand, it's only one 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.060
 position and comes down here by 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.040
 super comfortable for petrolina is 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.690
 completely lying down for a cart 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.190
 practice is narrow people can 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.140
 stroll the mall we can 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.490
 to walk in the airport tam for the day to day 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.340
 also the legal cart 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.870
 ok to go up again super practical 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.870
 to another position here in the middle of the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.320
 path and the highest position for the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.810
 drink 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.030
 Okay again, everything is closed. 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.530
 for you to have a better idea of â€‹â€‹how 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.450
 does the law work 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.810
 How did I say this cart and is it indicated? 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.210
 for children up to 22 pounds he weighs 9 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.450
 pounds and take it to finish I go 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.490
 show you how he closes the one 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.010
 Missing thing I 'll take advantage of. 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.230
 it's the basket again it did not exist 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.420
 very compact not know much but 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.680
 for a cart of these compact up to 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.570
 considered to be 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.070
 we have a lateral access that 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.050
 space that we can put 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.390
 little things baby a little blanket 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.360
 a bag changer but your bag 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.730
 diapers will not go here either but like me 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.250
 I told the type of cart is a 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.270
 bag is a right up to great hockey 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.280
 always close the cart with the accent 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.110
 facing the front and you accept people 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.270
 face can fit to us and 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.220
 people prefer or we can also 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.970
 use this frame to put the baby 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.950
 comfort 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.170
 What do I recommend the baby maxi comfort 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.739
 that will fit directly into your 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.900
 reason 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.520
 so to close the cart you will have 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.160
 whenever I had the car in that 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.950
 position the accent facing forward 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.510
 okay here and will help us in the footsteps of 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.580
 and I already have to have the little 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.720
 so we squeeze the first one and 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.780
 second button that will fold the frame 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.870
 ok, we'll bend the accent later 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.500
 Let's put the accent on it already. 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.079
 it's getting little 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.799
 and to finish we will push 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.070
 down here 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.400
 Ok and ready here it is closed 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.650
 here we have the cone sa action ok 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.590
 closed with the subject for you to see 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.830
 as is tiny leaves us until 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.830
 more 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.660
 ah
