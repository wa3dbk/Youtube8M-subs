00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:55.279 
know I'm so capable of and you there's a
review<00:00:48.819> totally<00:00:49.690> for<00:00:49.929> deaf<00:00:50.170> chimney<00:00:52.649> yeah

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
review totally for deaf chimney yeah

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.139 
review totally for deaf chimney yeah
yeah<00:00:56.289> this<00:00:56.979> place<00:00:57.159> is<00:00:57.249> better<00:00:57.579> for<00:00:57.850> sniping

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
yeah this place is better for sniping

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:59.879 
yeah this place is better for sniping
it's<00:00:58.420> bit<00:00:58.629> closer<00:00:58.899> but<00:00:59.319> for<00:00:59.499> some<00:00:59.620> reason

00:00:59.879 --> 00:00:59.889 
it's bit closer but for some reason

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:02.309 
it's bit closer but for some reason
every<00:01:00.249> time<00:01:00.280> i<00:01:00.639> go<00:01:00.819> here<00:01:01.030> i<00:01:01.089> just<00:01:01.510> get<00:01:01.719> nailed

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:02.319 
every time i go here i just get nailed

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.840 
every time i go here i just get nailed
with<00:01:02.639> crapload<00:01:03.639> of<00:01:03.879> gunfire<00:01:04.540> from<00:01:04.930> everywhere

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
with crapload of gunfire from everywhere

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.730 
with crapload of gunfire from everywhere
so<00:01:06.850> i'd<00:01:07.119> actually<00:01:07.450> recommend<00:01:08.140> not<00:01:08.290> using<00:01:08.350> this

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
so i'd actually recommend not using this

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.179 
so i'd actually recommend not using this
place<00:01:08.950> of<00:01:09.159> snipe<00:01:10.259> but<00:01:11.259> you<00:01:11.710> know<00:01:11.829> it's<00:01:12.009> another

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
place of snipe but you know it's another

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:18.420 
place of snipe but you know it's another
glitch<00:01:12.520> kind<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.860> hey<00:01:15.219> I'll<00:01:15.850> take<00:01:16.030> it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.000 

it's<00:01:19.030> next<00:01:19.240> one<00:01:19.390> though<00:01:19.540> this<00:01:19.660> is<00:01:19.870> the<00:01:20.010> coolest

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
it's next one though this is the coolest

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.780 
it's next one though this is the coolest
one<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:22.450> is<00:01:22.510> kind<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.230> a<00:01:23.410> skywalk<00:01:24.190> really<00:01:24.670> i'm

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
one this is kind of a skywalk really i'm

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.460 
one this is kind of a skywalk really i'm
just<00:01:24.820> going<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.240> be<00:01:25.330> walking<00:01:25.510> on<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.960> ceiling

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
just going to be walking on the ceiling

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.990 
just going to be walking on the ceiling
above<00:01:26.770> me<00:01:27.310> right<00:01:27.550> now<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:29.500> keep<00:01:29.740> jumping<00:01:30.400> and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
above me right now just keep jumping and

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.469 
above me right now just keep jumping and
you'll<00:01:31.120> get<00:01:31.300> it<00:01:31.450> eventually<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.390> little

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
you'll get it eventually it's a little

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.870 
you'll get it eventually it's a little
nakki<00:01:34.810> but<00:01:35.260> it's<00:01:35.620> cool<00:01:35.860> if<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.310> walk<00:01:36.580> on<00:01:36.760> the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
nakki but it's cool if you walk on the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.020 
nakki but it's cool if you walk on the
perimeter<00:01:37.090> of<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.420> building<00:01:37.570> then<00:01:38.580> you<00:01:39.580> won't

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
perimeter of the building then you won't

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.030 
perimeter of the building then you won't
fall<00:01:40.330> through<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:42.340> can<00:01:42.490> snipe<00:01:42.729> come<00:01:43.150> here

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
fall through and you can snipe come here

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.740 
fall through and you can snipe come here
but<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.130> main<00:01:45.310> point<00:01:45.550> is<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:45.880> fall<00:01:46.510> through

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
but the main point is to fall through

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.850 
but the main point is to fall through
the<00:01:47.110> center<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.820> roof<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.560> you're<00:01:50.770> down

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
the center of the roof and you're down

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.230 
the center of the roof and you're down
here<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:52.509> is<00:01:52.660> what<00:01:52.750> i<00:01:52.780> mean<00:01:52.960> by<00:01:53.320> sort<00:01:53.890> of

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
here this is what i mean by sort of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.070 
here this is what i mean by sort of
really<00:01:55.240> just<00:01:55.270> on<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.660> ceiling<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.700> hey<00:01:58.119> take

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
really just on the ceiling but hey take

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.990 
really just on the ceiling but hey take
what<00:01:59.259> life<00:01:59.710> gives<00:01:59.740> you<00:02:02.399> toss<00:02:03.399> a<00:02:03.580> couple<00:02:03.729> you

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
what life gives you toss a couple you

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.360 
what life gives you toss a couple you
nades<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:10.959> can<00:02:11.080> kind<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.500> snipe<00:02:11.739> from<00:02:12.040> here

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
nades so you can kind of snipe from here

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.250 
nades so you can kind of snipe from here
don't<00:02:13.060> snipe<00:02:13.390> through<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:13.750> window<00:02:13.900> doesn't

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
don't snipe through that window doesn't

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.190 
don't snipe through that window doesn't
work<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:18.310> can't<00:02:18.520> get<00:02:18.790> back<00:02:19.060> up<00:02:19.120> at<00:02:19.989> all

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
work but you can't get back up at all

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.789 
work but you can't get back up at all
not<00:02:20.950> through<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.250> roof<00:02:21.540> but<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.750> wall<00:02:23.140> can

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
not through that roof but this wall can

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.800 
not through that roof but this wall can
walk<00:02:24.070> through<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:24.910> might<00:02:25.570> want<00:02:25.780> to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
walk through it so you might want to

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.420 
walk through it so you might want to
figure<00:02:26.140> out<00:02:26.350> some<00:02:26.590> kind<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.799> place<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:27.190> can<00:02:27.340> do

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
figure out some kind of place you can do

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.400 
figure out some kind of place you can do
with<00:02:27.549> that<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:28.000> don't<00:02:28.540> know<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.840> haven't<00:02:29.140> tried

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
with that I don't know I haven't tried

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.280 
with that I don't know I haven't tried
and<00:02:30.120> also<00:02:31.120> if<00:02:31.330> there's<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.570> couple<00:02:31.720> guys<00:02:31.840> back

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290
