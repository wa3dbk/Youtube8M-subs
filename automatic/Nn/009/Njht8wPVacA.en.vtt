a good-sized puddle and as you see it's
nice<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.490> square<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:21.270> you're<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.560> to

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
nice and square now you're not going to

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.630 
nice and square now you're not going to
get<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.920> you're<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.460> that

big<00:01:23.820> puddling<00:01:24.240> something<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.229> watch<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:29.509> a

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
big puddling something to watch for a

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.289 
big puddling something to watch for a
little<00:01:32.159> bit<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.340> an<00:01:32.430> angle<00:01:33.320> like<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:35.210> I'm<00:01:36.210> not

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
little bit of an angle like this I'm not

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.980 
little bit of an angle like this I'm not
taking<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> machine<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.619> doing<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
taking the machine in doing this with it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.289 
taking the machine in doing this with it
because<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.350> go<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.920> motion<00:01:41.430> you'll

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
because if you go in this motion you'll

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.630 
because if you go in this motion you'll
actually<00:01:42.509> cut<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> skin<00:01:43.350> wide<00:01:43.619> open<00:01:44.040> if

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
doing this a little bit of a circular

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.490 
doing this a little bit of a circular
motion<00:01:50.299> but<00:01:51.299> enough<00:01:51.570> where<00:01:51.840> I'm<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.110> coming

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500

spray<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.849> tissue<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.840> leave<00:02:19.080> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
spray the tissue and you leave the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.410 
spray the tissue and you leave the
liquid<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.890> surface<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.239> actually

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
liquid on the surface you can actually

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.690 
liquid on the surface you can actually
go<00:02:21.690> back<00:02:21.900> through<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.530> check<00:02:22.770> what<00:02:23.550> is

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
go back through and check what is

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.520 
go back through and check what is
actually<00:02:24.090> into<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.510> skin<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:24.900> what<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.260> it

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
actually into the skin and what is it

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.140 
actually into the skin and what is it
and<00:02:25.680> we'll<00:02:25.800> show<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.069> different<00:02:26.610> spots<00:02:26.910> that

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
and we'll show you different spots that

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.580 
and we'll show you different spots that
you<00:02:27.300> need<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.569> put<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> little<00:02:28.020> touch<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.290> ink

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
you need to put a little touch of ink

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:42.309 
you need to put a little touch of ink
into<00:02:30.680> up<00:02:31.680> when<00:02:32.220> I'm<00:02:32.340> shading<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:34.099> pick<00:02:35.099> it<00:02:35.250> up

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.050 

when<00:02:43.319> shading<00:02:43.680> try<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.250> get<00:02:44.460> in<00:02:44.550> as<00:02:44.790> close<00:02:45.030> as

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
when shading try to get in as close as

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.020 
when shading try to get in as close as
you<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.810> line<00:02:46.160> before<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.520> shade<00:02:47.790> out

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
you can to the line before you shade out

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.410 
you can to the line before you shade out
without<00:02:48.690> actually<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.470> into<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.069> line

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:02.150 

miss<00:02:54.420> you're<00:02:54.630> black<00:02:55.080> much<00:02:55.500> more<00:02:55.740> even

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.250 

you'll<00:03:03.120> notice<00:03:03.360> when<00:03:03.600> I'm<00:03:03.750> feeding<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.620> black

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
you'll notice when I'm feeding the black

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.550 
you'll notice when I'm feeding the black
I'm<00:03:07.260> actually<00:03:07.470> taking<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.790> Machine<00:03:09.180> and

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
I'm actually taking the Machine and

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.400 
I'm actually taking the Machine and
doing<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.770> with<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.100> in<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:12.900> motion

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
doing this with it in this motion

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.580 
doing this with it in this motion
because<00:03:14.250> we<00:03:14.610> remember<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:15.960> a<00:03:15.990> round<00:03:16.290> or

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
because we remember this is a round or

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.800 
because we remember this is a round or
object<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.000> have<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.330> give<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.630> some

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
object and you have to give it some

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.540 
object and you have to give it some
depth

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
depth

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.450 
depth
coming<00:03:20.550> around<00:03:21.320> you<00:03:22.320> can't<00:03:22.620> run<00:03:22.890> straight<00:03:23.280> out

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
coming around you can't run straight out

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.160 
coming around you can't run straight out
with<00:03:23.490> it<00:03:23.700> because<00:03:24.060> it'll<00:03:24.210> very<00:03:24.540> be<00:03:24.840> very<00:03:25.080> flat

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.200 

if<00:03:31.170> you'll<00:03:31.380> notice<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.950> angle<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.400> my<00:03:32.430> hand<00:03:32.880> if

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
if you'll notice the angle of my hand if

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.520 
if you'll notice the angle of my hand if
you<00:03:33.360> look<00:03:33.570> at<00:03:33.690> my<00:03:33.840> fingers

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
you look at my fingers

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.160 
you look at my fingers
my<00:03:34.890> fingers<00:03:35.310> are<00:03:35.490> not<00:03:35.640> like<00:03:36.000> they<00:03:36.180> were<00:03:36.240> when<00:03:37.140> I

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
my fingers are not like they were when I

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.470 
my fingers are not like they were when I
outlined<00:03:37.740> because<00:03:38.040> when<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.340> outlined<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.180> was

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
outlined because when I outlined I was

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.450 
outlined because when I outlined I was
like<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:41.120> this<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.540> have<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.230> be<00:03:43.320> up<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.190> can

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
like this this I have to be up so I can

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.270 
like this this I have to be up so I can
see<00:03:44.730> where<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.540> ink<00:03:45.690> is<00:03:45.840> flowing<00:03:46.320> I'm<00:03:47.040> up

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
see where the ink is flowing I'm up

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:55.800 
see where the ink is flowing I'm up
above<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.790> design

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.570 

all<00:03:56.500> right<00:03:56.709> we're<00:03:56.860> gonna<00:03:56.980> do<00:03:57.160> some<00:03:57.370> shooting

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
all right we're gonna do some shooting

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.540 
all right we're gonna do some shooting
we're<00:03:57.940> gonna<00:03:58.030> shave<00:03:58.330> from<00:03:58.860> bottom<00:03:59.860> here<00:04:02.550> we're

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
we're gonna shave from bottom here we're

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.830 
we're gonna shave from bottom here we're
gonna<00:04:03.640> do<00:04:06.480> in<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.630> circular<00:04:07.870> four<00:04:09.660> get<00:04:10.660> where

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
gonna do in a circular four get where

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.640 
gonna do in a circular four get where
the<00:04:10.959> rounding<00:04:11.350> effect<00:04:11.680> on<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.920> design<00:04:16.650> I've

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
the rounding effect on the design I've

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.340 
the rounding effect on the design I've
switched<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.220> weight<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.760> placed<00:04:19.750> my<00:04:19.930> hand<00:04:19.959> on

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
switched the weight I placed my hand on

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.190 
switched the weight I placed my hand on
the<00:04:20.500> skin<00:04:20.889> because<00:04:21.519> being<00:04:21.790> back<00:04:22.030> here<00:04:22.389> is<00:04:22.780> too

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
the skin because being back here is too

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.020 
the skin because being back here is too
difficult<00:04:23.770> at<00:04:23.919> this<00:04:24.070> time<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:24.580> now<00:04:24.730> I'm<00:04:24.850> gonna

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
difficult at this time so now I'm gonna

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.030 
difficult at this time so now I'm gonna
move<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.270> this<00:04:25.660> type<00:04:25.930> here<00:04:26.230> but<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.889> can

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
move to this type here but you can

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.470 
move to this type here but you can
spread<00:04:27.280> your<00:04:27.490> fingers<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.030> still<00:04:28.300> get<00:04:28.450> the

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
spread your fingers and still get the

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.710 
spread your fingers and still get the
fuel<00:04:29.160> running<00:04:30.160> tight<00:04:30.520> enough<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:31.419> get<00:04:31.600> the

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
fuel running tight enough to get the

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.770 
fuel running tight enough to get the
correct<00:04:31.900> penetration<00:04:36.480> okay

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
correct penetration okay

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.270 
correct penetration okay
now<00:04:38.169> we're<00:04:38.380> gonna<00:04:38.470> get<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.770> in<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:38.950> little<00:04:39.160> bit

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
now we're gonna get it in a little bit

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.430 
now we're gonna get it in a little bit
heavier<00:04:39.580> black<00:04:39.940> still<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.080> shading

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
heavier black still in the shading

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.800 
heavier black still in the shading
effect<00:04:41.770> but<00:04:42.100> a<00:04:42.310> little<00:04:42.850> bit<00:04:43.030> heavier<00:04:43.360> up<00:04:43.510> into

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
effect but a little bit heavier up into

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.020 
effect but a little bit heavier up into
these<00:04:43.960> areas<00:04:44.200> here<00:04:44.680> which<00:04:44.860> will<00:04:45.040> be<00:04:45.190> primarily

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
these areas here which will be primarily

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.909 
these areas here which will be primarily
filled<00:04:46.360> in<00:04:46.480> a<00:04:46.570> little<00:04:46.810> bit<00:04:46.930> more<00:04:47.169> solid<00:04:47.710> and

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
filled in a little bit more solid and

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:58.320 
filled in a little bit more solid and
then<00:04:48.820> airbrush<00:04:49.540> down<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:57.040> solid<00:04:57.580> type<00:04:57.970> work

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
then airbrush down the solid type work

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.020 
then airbrush down the solid type work
in<00:04:58.570> here<00:04:58.810> for<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.139> harder<00:04:59.500> black<00:04:59.800> if<00:05:00.760> you'll

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
in here for the harder black if you'll

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.510 
in here for the harder black if you'll
notice<00:05:01.330> I'm<00:05:01.660> working<00:05:02.140> in<00:05:02.320> small<00:05:02.919> circular

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
notice I'm working in small circular

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.390 
notice I'm working in small circular
motions<00:05:03.790> such<00:05:04.780> as<00:05:04.990> this<00:05:05.229> here<00:05:08.010> to<00:05:09.010> be<00:05:09.160> more

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
motions such as this here to be more
