00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.180
 96 a 2 9 on the court 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.510
 remain 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.840
 the repression like at home the truth 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:18.980
 the other day 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.320
 I walked the streets of the city 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.470
 I tried to find myself and learn certain things that maybe 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.590
 they evolved or learn or maybe see life from another point of 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.640
 view 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.570
 it reminds me to walk along the edge of a park and I found a child 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.600
 I started talking 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.560
 with his toys his dreams his fantasies his illusions was a child 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.570
 too mature for his age but too much too long for his age 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.510
 and I told him 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.750
 you know I would like to play with you 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.249
 but I would like to play with you the words 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:53.480
 I would like to know 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.130
 and think like you 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.960
 and the child apparently did not understand what I was saying but I was trying to 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.730
 imagine standing 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.230
 in children's shoes 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.850
 I asked that if I were god and could grant that a wish 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.100
 what would you like me to do for you 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.310
 he stared at me and said you know 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.180
 I believe that this is not god 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.530
 and you can grant him no wish 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.750
 but it's okay 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.060
 and he told me you know 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.350
 if I could 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.700
 truly confess something would tell you that I would like if you were god that 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.890
 I converted xente the edition 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.160
 I was stunned and without understanding now I 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.820
 I did not know why that child was telling me that he would like me to make him 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.290
 TV 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.540
 and I told him why you would like me to turn you on television and he told me 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.460
 because I suffer 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.410
 I still did not understand 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.500
 apparently the child was much more evolved than me or had suffered what 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.230
 enough to realize the importance 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.150
 that he had television in man 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.850
 you know if you were god I would ask you to make me television 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.540
 because you know he talked to my mom 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.690
 and she prefers television 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.060
 my mom bothered me and she tells me that I kept quiet because she is watching the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.130
 TV 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.950
 when I approach my dad he tells me that I stayed still because he is looking at the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.179
 TV 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.599
 and if you were god 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.950
 I would ask you to convert me is on television so that that same tension 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.549
 that my parents put me on television 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.099
 they put it to a thousand and it's seven o'clock at night and I'm walking on the shore of 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.139
 a park only 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.579
 my parents have not realized that I'm not at home you know why because 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.569
 they are watching television 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.819
 1 the rattle 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.349
 96% north the singer
