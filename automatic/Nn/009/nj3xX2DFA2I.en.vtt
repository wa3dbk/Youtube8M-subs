 the parties understand that we cannot solve everything 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.380
 problems of the world and we cannot resist 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.530

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.570
 choose at least one

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.720

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.600
 no one like us such a humanity 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.500

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.330
 superior because superiority 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.580

 it seems that in the twenty-first century 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 it is absolutely immoral 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.070

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.890

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:23.339
 hearing my Slovakia will plant a packet maiden 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.959

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.939
 object Ryan rates himself 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.279

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:34.159
 the murder of the Russian food 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.109

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.379
 excess is certainly harmful but nonetheless 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.049
 man cannot and animal protein on 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.639

 can calm and healthy raschel 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.689
 because party policy is 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.449
