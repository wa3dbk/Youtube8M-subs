started with this football for hope

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.970 
started with this football for hope
centers<00:00:59.090> there<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.539> well<00:01:01.500> that's<00:01:01.680> been<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
centers there is one well that's been a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
centers there is one well that's been a
very<00:01:02.010> prescient<00:01:02.670> -<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.570> think

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
very prescient - but what do you think

from<00:01:07.380> from<00:01:07.650> others<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.250> each<00:01:08.400> World<00:01:08.640> Cup

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
from from others because each World Cup

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.870 
from from others because each World Cup
