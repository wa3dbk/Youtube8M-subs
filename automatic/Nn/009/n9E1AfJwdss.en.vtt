they're<00:01:11.960> doing<00:01:12.200> developmental<00:01:13.009> skills<00:01:13.369> too

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
they're doing developmental skills too

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.499 
they're doing developmental skills too
so<00:01:14.359> they<00:01:14.479> can<00:01:14.539> learn<00:01:14.840> higher-level<00:01:15.560> skills

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
so they can learn higher-level skills
