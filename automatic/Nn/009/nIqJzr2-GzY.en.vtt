actually<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.610> really<00:03:59.790> common<00:04:00.120> concern<00:04:00.450> I<00:04:00.600> see

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
actually a really common concern I see

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.990 
actually a really common concern I see
across<00:04:00.989> all<00:04:01.500> sorts<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.160> social<00:04:02.340> media<00:04:02.760> and

across all sorts of social media and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.449 
across all sorts of social media and
otherwise<00:04:03.390> which<00:04:03.720> is<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:04.079> idea<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.950> the

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
otherwise which is this idea that the

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.520 
otherwise which is this idea that the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
UFC is not consistently enough putting

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
females on these shows I actually don't

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.699

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
of slowly discovered that this is a

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.550 
of slowly discovered that this is a
marketable<00:04:18.090> good<00:04:18.329> thing<00:04:18.570> for<00:04:18.810> them<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.079> they

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
marketable good thing for them and they

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.070 
marketable good thing for them and they
have<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.769> build<00:04:20.130> up<00:04:20.340> their<00:04:20.579> roster<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:21.810> get<00:04:22.049> a

consistent number of females on the

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.750 
consistent number of females on the
cards<00:04:24.150> now<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:24.599> know<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.200> that's<00:04:25.440> not

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
cards now I know that that's not

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.430 
cards now I know that that's not
happen<00:04:25.970> fast<00:04:26.240> enough<00:04:26.420> for<00:04:26.720> some<00:04:26.900> people<00:04:27.230> but

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
happen fast enough for some people but

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.480 
happen fast enough for some people but
actually<00:04:27.740> think<00:04:27.890> they're<00:04:28.010> making<00:04:28.280> decent

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
actually think they're making decent

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.070 
actually think they're making decent
progress<00:04:28.670> for<00:04:29.240> what<00:04:29.360> they<00:04:29.480> have<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.720> work<00:04:29.870> with

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
progress for what they have to work with

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.960 
progress for what they have to work with
they<00:04:30.230> have<00:04:30.350> tons<00:04:30.650> of<00:04:30.920> divisions<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.490> cast<00:04:31.700> and

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
they have tons of divisions to cast and

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.610 
they have tons of divisions to cast and
they<00:04:32.300> have<00:04:32.420> to<00:04:32.540> figure<00:04:32.690> out<00:04:32.900> who<00:04:33.410> they're

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
they have to figure out who they're

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.720 
they have to figure out who they're
going<00:04:33.770> to<00:04:33.860> drop<00:04:34.040> and<00:04:34.280> who<00:04:34.340> they're<00:04:34.490> going<00:04:34.640> to

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
going to drop and who they're going to

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.460 
going to drop and who they're going to
keep<00:04:34.850> what<00:04:35.270> they're<00:04:35.480> stable<00:04:35.870> of<00:04:35.990> fighters<00:04:36.290> is

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
keep what they're stable of fighters is

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.870 
keep what they're stable of fighters is
going<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.740> look<00:04:36.890> like<00:04:37.070> I<00:04:37.280> think<00:04:37.400> they<00:04:37.610> tend<00:04:37.760> a

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
going to look like I think they tend a

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.340 
going to look like I think they tend a
book<00:04:38.060> as<00:04:38.240> they<00:04:38.450> need<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:38.930> because<00:04:39.140> of<00:04:39.230> that

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
book as they need and because of that

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.170 
book as they need and because of that
that's<00:04:39.830> why<00:04:39.950> you<00:04:40.040> see<00:04:40.220> this<00:04:40.310> into<00:04:40.550> consistency

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
that's why you see this into consistency

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.180 
that's why you see this into consistency
on<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.330> cards<00:04:41.720> but<00:04:42.050> as<00:04:42.200> we<00:04:42.410> get<00:04:42.530> more<00:04:42.860> fighters

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
on the cards but as we get more fighters

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.250 
on the cards but as we get more fighters
in<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.520> 135<00:04:44.090> division<00:04:44.540> they'll<00:04:44.870> be<00:04:45.020> able<00:04:45.140> to

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
in the 135 division they'll be able to

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260 
in the 135 division they'll be able to
plan<00:04:45.560> things<00:04:45.890> better<00:04:46.100> out<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:46.610> also<00:04:46.820> as<00:04:47.090> they

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
plan things better out and also as they

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.210 
plan things better out and also as they
put<00:04:47.510> fighters<00:04:47.840> together<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.500> sort<00:04:48.680> of<00:04:48.800> see

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
put fighters together and sort of see

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.770 
put fighters together and sort of see
how<00:04:49.370> things<00:04:49.580> play<00:04:49.820> out<00:04:49.910> with<00:04:50.270> wins<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.690> losses

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
how things play out with wins and losses

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.510 
how things play out with wins and losses
it's<00:04:51.170> gonna<00:04:51.320> become<00:04:51.620> more<00:04:51.770> obvious<00:04:52.250> to<00:04:52.400> them

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
it's gonna become more obvious to them

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.550 
it's gonna become more obvious to them
what<00:04:52.940> matches<00:04:53.150> need<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:53.660> be<00:04:53.750> made<00:04:53.960> who<00:04:54.350> needs

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
what matches need to be made who needs

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.230 
what matches need to be made who needs
to<00:04:54.710> be<00:04:54.800> brought<00:04:54.980> into<00:04:55.130> division<00:04:55.640> who<00:04:55.880> needs<00:04:56.120> to

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
to be brought into division who needs to

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.090 
to be brought into division who needs to
be<00:04:56.360> let<00:04:56.540> go<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:57.080> know<00:04:57.200> all<00:04:57.470> of<00:04:57.530> these<00:04:58.040> things

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
be let go you know all of these things

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.160 
be let go you know all of these things
and<00:04:58.670> that's<00:04:58.850> gonna<00:04:59.000> build<00:04:59.360> a<00:04:59.540> good<00:04:59.750> healthy

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
and that's gonna build a good healthy

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.600 
and that's gonna build a good healthy
women's<00:05:00.410> division<00:05:00.770> where<00:05:00.920> I<00:05:00.950> think<00:05:01.130> we<00:05:01.490> will

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
women's division where I think we will

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.150 
women's division where I think we will
see<00:05:01.850> consistent<00:05:02.570> fights<00:05:02.810> on<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.110> cards<00:05:03.590> and

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
see consistent fights on the cards and

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.410 
see consistent fights on the cards and
our<00:05:04.250> last<00:05:04.490> question<00:05:04.820> comes<00:05:04.850> from<00:05:05.030> Nina<00:05:05.270> Maria

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
our last question comes from Nina Maria

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.150 
our last question comes from Nina Maria
where<00:05:05.660> she's<00:05:05.810> asking<00:05:06.200> about<00:05:06.260> heavier<00:05:06.770> female

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
where she's asking about heavier female

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.760 
where she's asking about heavier female
weight<00:05:07.460> classes<00:05:07.850> in<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.360> UFC<00:05:08.630> and<00:05:09.140> beyond<00:05:09.410> so

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
weight classes in the UFC and beyond so

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.680 
weight classes in the UFC and beyond so
the<00:05:10.370> reason<00:05:10.640> I<00:05:10.700> wanted<00:05:10.730> to<00:05:11.000> talk<00:05:11.210> about<00:05:11.240> this

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
the reason I wanted to talk about this

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.180 
the reason I wanted to talk about this
is<00:05:11.870> because<00:05:12.170> of<00:05:12.290> the<00:05:12.380> way<00:05:12.500> that<00:05:12.680> I<00:05:12.770> came<00:05:12.830> into

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
is because of the way that I came into

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.160 
is because of the way that I came into
this<00:05:13.370> sport<00:05:13.670> a<00:05:13.850> lot<00:05:14.120> of<00:05:14.270> my<00:05:14.570> female<00:05:14.780> fighter

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
this sport a lot of my female fighter

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.660 
this sport a lot of my female fighter
friends<00:05:15.650> that<00:05:15.740> I<00:05:15.770> initially<00:05:15.980> had<00:05:16.280> before<00:05:16.640> I

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
friends that I initially had before I

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.310 
friends that I initially had before I
really<00:05:16.910> understood<00:05:17.300> anything<00:05:17.750> about<00:05:17.900> no<00:05:18.050> ma

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
really understood anything about no ma

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.830 
really understood anything about no ma
we're<00:05:19.100> heavier<00:05:19.370> fighters<00:05:19.820> they<00:05:20.600> weren't

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
we're heavier fighters they weren't

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.470 
we're heavier fighters they weren't
people<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.590> easily<00:05:22.340> made<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:22.640> 135<00:05:23.240> weight

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
people that easily made the 135 weight

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.630 
people that easily made the 135 weight
class<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:23.990> so<00:05:24.650> I<00:05:24.680> feel<00:05:25.070> like<00:05:25.100> I<00:05:25.250> have<00:05:25.400> a<00:05:25.430> lot<00:05:25.610> of

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
class and so I feel like I have a lot of

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.550 
class and so I feel like I have a lot of
personal<00:05:26.150> experience<00:05:26.630> with<00:05:26.810> this<00:05:26.930> and<00:05:27.170> from

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
personal experience with this and from

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.070 
personal experience with this and from
that<00:05:27.710> perspective<00:05:28.010> I<00:05:28.550> want<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.330> say<00:05:29.540> that<00:05:29.840> a

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
that perspective I want to say that a

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.590 
that perspective I want to say that a
vast<00:05:30.890> majority<00:05:31.190> of<00:05:31.610> female<00:05:32.000> fighters<00:05:32.360> who<00:05:32.570> are

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
vast majority of female fighters who are

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.800 
vast majority of female fighters who are
fighting<00:05:32.930> really<00:05:33.200> heavy<00:05:33.940> should<00:05:34.940> not<00:05:35.120> be<00:05:35.450> at

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
fighting really heavy should not be at

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.480 
fighting really heavy should not be at

regional athletes if you really want to

compete at that weight I think that's

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.430

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
think it's a realistic weight for a

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.670 
think it's a realistic weight for a
serious<00:05:50.330> professional<00:05:50.750> athlete<00:05:51.080> with<00:05:51.470> that
