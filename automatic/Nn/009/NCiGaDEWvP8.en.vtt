00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.790
 hello technocratic as it is so dry it 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.530
 stop goodbye dotcom and here we 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.320
 We found a very product 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.490
 interesting is called nano magnetic who 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.380
 it's bottom here we 're seeing 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.230
 three devices that can be 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.060
 transform into only one no thanks 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.400
 to what comes to be the nanos 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.740
 magnetic that will transfer 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.630
 information from one device to another 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.559
 but not only mobile that's something 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.510
 very interesting that I just got 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.970
 explain since you are going to be able to 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.410
 add for example if you have the 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.090
 same technology in a speaker by 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.100
 example imagine that this is a 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.470
 speaker and what you want is 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.360
 transfer the music to your other 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.850
 device as simply what 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.440
 do is connect and the speaker to 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.370
 work with both the three 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.230
 devices that you have 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.640
 connected or in case you 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.239
 want to load all these devices 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.950
 it is simply stick the battery is 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.170
 solar and will be able to charge the three 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.220
 devices then the idea of ​​these 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.990
 magnets is practically transferring or 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.450
 have the ability to be able to transfer 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.340
 data or either energy or other things 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.770
 so that in this way you can 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.790
 work with up to 127 devices and 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.400
 imagine having 120 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.050
 and this would have a giant tablet but 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.300
 the idea this may be such is to use 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.360
 three of these here can be made from this 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.700
 way and use two of these as 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.620
 you want but that's the idea and the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.450
 concept of these magnetic nano or 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.750
 let's say magnetic balls like you 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.450
 can appreciate that they are the ones that go to 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.910
 transfer the information with the data from 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.920
 one device to another then let's hope 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.570
 that this product goes to the market of 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.910
 unfortunately very interesting truth 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.430
 here they have it as a model but I think 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.259
 that the idea is understood and you have very 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.369
