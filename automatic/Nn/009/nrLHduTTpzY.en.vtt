00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
this says laser washed four thousand

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.080 
this says laser washed four thousand
which<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.010> weird<00:00:35.280> because<00:00:35.489> there<00:00:35.670> was<00:00:35.790> never<00:00:35.940> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
which is weird because there was never a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.720 
which is weird because there was never a
four<00:00:36.360> thousand<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:37.050> before<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.730> whatever

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
four thousand here before but whatever

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:49.890 
four thousand here before but whatever
they<00:00:38.910> did

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.490 

I<00:00:50.020> think<00:00:50.650> it's<00:00:50.770> saying<00:00:51.010> forward<00:00:52.290> that's<00:00:53.290> kind

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
I think it's saying forward that's kind

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:05.280 
I think it's saying forward that's kind
of<00:00:53.560> odd

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.380 

all<00:01:06.290> right

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.540 

my<00:01:09.930> parent<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.380> my<00:01:10.620> parents<00:01:11.100> car<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
my parent this is my parents car and

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.490 
my parent this is my parents car and
they<00:01:11.610> usually<00:01:11.790> let<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.300> get<00:01:12.480> very<00:01:12.810> dirty<00:01:13.170> so

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
they usually let it get very dirty so

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:24.300 
they usually let it get very dirty so
let's<00:01:13.890> see<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.160> happens

ultrasonics you can see one there on the

don't know if that's visible but this
machine<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:12.330> smart<00:02:12.930> enough<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.410> jog<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.160> arm<00:02:14.370> a
