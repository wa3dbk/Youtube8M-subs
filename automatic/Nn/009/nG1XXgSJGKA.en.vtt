course you're not really going to get
any<00:05:09.979> torso<00:05:10.789> articulation<00:05:11.450> involved<00:05:11.810> so<00:05:12.590> his

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
any torso articulation involved so his

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.740 
any torso articulation involved so his
articulation<00:05:13.070> is<00:05:13.610> pretty<00:05:14.090> hindered

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
articulation is pretty hindered

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.480 
articulation is pretty hindered
also<00:05:15.260> it<00:05:15.349> is<00:05:15.470> worth<00:05:15.620> noting<00:05:15.950> that<00:05:15.979> the<00:05:16.160> joints

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
also it is worth noting that the joints

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.430 
also it is worth noting that the joints
on<00:05:16.610> mine<00:05:16.789> are<00:05:17.060> are<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.270> little<00:05:17.450> loose<00:05:17.690> on<00:05:18.020> his

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
on mine are are a little loose on his

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.760 
on mine are are a little loose on his
leg<00:05:19.300> so<00:05:20.300> hopefully<00:05:20.780> that<00:05:20.930> is<00:05:20.960> not<00:05:21.139> the<00:05:21.289> case<00:05:21.470> on

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
leg so hopefully that is not the case on

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.770 
leg so hopefully that is not the case on
the<00:05:22.370> final<00:05:22.700> product<00:05:23.090> or<00:05:23.180> all<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.510> figures

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
the final product or all the figures

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.920 
the final product or all the figures
that<00:05:23.930> you<00:05:23.960> get<00:05:24.229> now<00:05:25.039> of<00:05:25.310> course<00:05:25.550> some<00:05:25.940> I'm<00:05:26.690> not

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
that you get now of course some I'm not

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.360 
that you get now of course some I'm not
really<00:05:27.050> sure<00:05:27.260> how<00:05:27.440> much<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.740> articulation

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
really sure how much the articulation

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.159 
really sure how much the articulation
matters<00:05:28.849> on<00:05:29.000> a<00:05:29.030> character<00:05:29.479> like<00:05:29.630> Millar

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
matters on a character like Millar

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.650 
matters on a character like Millar
because<00:05:30.590> he<00:05:31.400> is<00:05:31.580> a<00:05:31.610> little<00:05:31.910> bit<00:05:32.120> of<00:05:32.210> a<00:05:32.270> novelty

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
because he is a little bit of a novelty

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.540 
because he is a little bit of a novelty

of a fun set like this and especially

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.330 
of a fun set like this and especially
don't<00:05:50.660> mind<00:05:50.870> it<00:05:51.020> since<00:05:51.230> it<00:05:51.350> isn't<00:05:51.470> exclusive<00:05:52.100> I

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
don't mind it since it isn't exclusive I

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.450 
don't mind it since it isn't exclusive I
find<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.330> set<00:05:53.510> quite<00:05:53.750> humorous<00:05:54.250> with<00:05:55.250> that

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
being said I can say that the novelty

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.990 
being said I can say that the novelty
seems<00:05:58.370> lost<00:05:58.730> once<00:05:59.600> you<00:05:59.840> open<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:00.320> figures<00:06:00.620> up
