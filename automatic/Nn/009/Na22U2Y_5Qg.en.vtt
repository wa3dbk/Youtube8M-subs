00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
used to be really good and that was what

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.520 
used to be really good and that was what
my<00:00:44.010> channel<00:00:44.430> was<00:00:44.910> mainly<00:00:45.210> based<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.379> when

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
my channel was mainly based on but when

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.319 
my channel was mainly based on but when
call<00:00:46.770> duty<00:00:46.950> ghost<00:00:47.219> came<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> wasn't<00:00:48.090> that

call duty ghost came out I wasn't that
impressed<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> game<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.770> decided<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
impressed with the game and I decided to

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.459 
impressed with the game and I decided to
then<00:00:50.520> jump<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> another<00:00:51.449> game<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.989> started

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
then jump on to another game I started

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.560 
then jump on to another game I started
doing<00:00:52.590> some<00:00:52.829> minecraft<00:00:53.100> then<00:00:53.879> went<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> GTA

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
doing some minecraft then went to GTA

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.020 
doing some minecraft then went to GTA
and<00:00:54.930> now<00:00:55.350> i'm<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.590> titanfall<00:00:56.160> now<00:00:56.699> i<00:00:56.760> am

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and now i'm on titanfall now i am

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
and now i'm on titanfall now i am
enjoying<00:00:57.210> titanfall<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> really<00:00:58.620> good

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
enjoying titanfall it is a really good

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.889 
enjoying titanfall it is a really good
game<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> factor<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.750> just

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
game but the factor is that it just

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.020 
game but the factor is that it just
doesn't<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.530> enough<00:01:01.559> content<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.550> base<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
doesn't have enough content to base a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.479 
doesn't have enough content to base a
channel<00:01:03.539> off<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.500> really<00:01:04.739> fun<00:01:05.040> game<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
channel off it is a really fun game and

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.039 
channel off it is a really fun game and
I<00:01:05.519> do<00:01:05.580> enjoy<00:01:05.820> playing<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.930> just

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
I do enjoy playing it but it just

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.649 
I do enjoy playing it but it just
doesn't<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.740> enough<00:01:07.920> content<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.939> actually

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
doesn't have enough content to actually

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
doesn't have enough content to actually
be<00:01:09.780> able<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.080> record<00:01:10.530> stuff<00:01:10.770> constantly<00:01:11.250> and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.999 
all they're all really simple they're
not<00:01:36.090> too<00:01:36.360> complicated<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.470> base<00:01:37.650> maps

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
not too complicated like the base maps

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.310 
not too complicated like the base maps
most<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.939> them<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.090> these<00:01:39.479> little<00:01:39.630> pathways

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
most of them have these little pathways

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.990 
most of them have these little pathways
there's<00:01:40.860> usually<00:01:40.979> about<00:01:41.250> three<00:01:41.400> or<00:01:41.670> five

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
there's usually about three or five

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.179 
there's usually about three or five
pathways<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.689> can<00:01:42.840> go<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.470> maps<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.979> aren't

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
pathways you can go the maps just aren't

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.889 
pathways you can go the maps just aren't
everywhere<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.970> they<00:01:45.060> sort<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.810> this

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
everywhere so they sort of do have this

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.319 
everywhere so they sort of do have this
format<00:01:46.500> which<00:01:46.950> makes<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.490> map<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.850> lot<00:01:48.090> better

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
format which makes the map a lot better

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.510 
format which makes the map a lot better
and<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.110> sort<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.439> defend<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> lot

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
and you can sort of defend and get a lot

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.550 
and you can sort of defend and get a lot
more<00:01:50.549> kills<00:01:51.000> without<00:01:51.420> people<00:01:51.990> flanking<00:01:52.409> you

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
more kills without people flanking you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
more kills without people flanking you
and<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.220> bullshit<00:01:53.759> happening<00:01:54.240> within

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
and all this bullshit happening within

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.780 
and all this bullshit happening within
the<00:01:55.049> actual<00:01:55.229> map<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.159> I'm<00:01:56.340> really<00:01:56.579> enjoying
