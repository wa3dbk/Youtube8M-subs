can<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.040> onto<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.280> island<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.689> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
can get you onto this island now what I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.810 
can get you onto this island now what I
realized<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.920> jump<00:01:29.220> shot<00:01:29.430> thing<00:01:29.670> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
realized with this jump shot thing is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.300 
realized with this jump shot thing is
you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.509> actually<00:01:30.540> pick<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.500> bundle<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you can actually pick up the bundle and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.969 
you can actually pick up the bundle and
it<00:01:32.820> times<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.810> minute<00:01:34.110> 60<00:01:34.530> seconds<00:01:34.829> flat

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
it times out in a minute 60 seconds flat

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.679 
it times out in a minute 60 seconds flat
that's<00:01:35.310> how<00:01:35.430> long<00:01:35.729> you've<00:01:35.909> got<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.420> so

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
that's how long you've got it for so

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.929 
that's how long you've got it for so
really<00:01:37.530> arenanet<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.130> designed<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
really arenanet have designed it so you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.249 
really arenanet have designed it so you
can't<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.299> use<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.600> jump<00:01:39.869> anywhere<00:01:40.140> you

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
can't just use it to jump anywhere you

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.929 
can't just use it to jump anywhere you
want<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> whole<00:01:40.650> game<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.100> theory<00:01:41.610> because

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
want in the whole game in theory because

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.429 
want in the whole game in theory because
it's<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> time<00:01:42.479> out<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.810> quickly<00:01:43.049> but

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
it's going to time out so quickly but

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.340 
it's going to time out so quickly but
you<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.399> actually<00:01:44.579> Waypoint<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:46.170> will

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
you can actually Waypoint and it will

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.530 
you can actually Waypoint and it will
stay<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:47.189> hands<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> 60<00:01:48.090> seconds<00:01:48.450> will

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
stay in your hands the 60 seconds will

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.999 
stay in your hands the 60 seconds will
continue<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.020> count<00:01:49.170> down<00:01:49.350> while<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.619> loading

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
continue to count down while the loading

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.170 
continue to count down while the loading
screens<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.939> go<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.149> just

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
screens going there you go it just

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.149 
screens going there you go it just
despawn<00:01:51.720> there<00:01:51.930> there<00:01:52.409> 60<00:01:52.770> seconds<00:01:53.040> will

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
despawn there there 60 seconds will

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.190 
despawn there there 60 seconds will
continue<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.579> count<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:55.020> do

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
continue to count down but you do

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.020 
continue to count down but you do
actually<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.860> carry<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.399> even<00:01:56.670> after<00:01:56.759> way

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
actually get to carry it even after way

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.440 
actually get to carry it even after way
pointing<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.920> if<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.070> take<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.310> now<00:01:59.579> just<00:02:00.329> for

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
pointing so if I take you now just for

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270 
pointing so if I take you now just for
demonstration<00:02:00.600> purposes<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.860> way<00:02:02.040> point

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
demonstration purposes to this way point

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.789 
demonstration purposes to this way point
here<00:02:02.490> which<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.240> where<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> jumping<00:02:04.560> puzzle

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
here which is where the jumping puzzle

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.340 
here which is where the jumping puzzle
starts<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.420> show<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.630> actually<00:02:07.110> the

starts and I can show you actually the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.529 
starts and I can show you actually the
exit<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.250> basically<00:02:08.789> what<00:02:09.030> went<00:02:09.330> through<00:02:09.509> my

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
exit and basically what went through my

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.600 
exit and basically what went through my
head<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:10.110> how<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> figured<00:02:11.129> something<00:02:11.340> very

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
head and how I figured something very

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.080 
head and how I figured something very
difficult

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
difficult

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.180 
difficult

Mike I I failed cuz I hit some rocks on

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.259 
Mike I I failed cuz I hit some rocks on
the<00:02:19.720> way<00:02:19.840> down<00:02:20.080> oh<00:02:20.440> really<00:02:20.860> brilliant<00:02:21.580> okay<00:02:22.209> so

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
if you go to the way point where you'd

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.160 
if you go to the way point where you'd
usually<00:02:23.709> start<00:02:24.099> this<00:02:24.250> jumping<00:02:24.519> puzzle<00:02:25.170> very

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
usually start this jumping puzzle very

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.809 
usually start this jumping puzzle very
mind<00:02:26.379> when<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.590> first<00:02:26.860> figure<00:02:27.099> this<00:02:27.250> out<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.640> was

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
mind when I first figure this out it was

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.910 
mind when I first figure this out it was
all<00:02:27.940> blocked<00:02:28.180> off<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:28.720> we<00:02:28.930> had<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.739> big

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
all blocked off so we had the big

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.100 
all blocked off so we had the big
windmill<00:02:30.400> over<00:02:30.760> here<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.720> dock<00:02:31.870> over

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
windmill over here and the dock over

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.020 
windmill over here and the dock over
here<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:32.560> everything<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.580> climb<00:02:33.910> up

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
here and everything that you climb up

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.420 
here and everything that you climb up
behind<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:34.930> there<00:02:35.049> was<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.170> rock<00:02:35.709> very<00:02:36.040> early

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
behind but there was a rock very early

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.920 
behind but there was a rock very early
on<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:36.760> was<00:02:36.879> blocking<00:02:37.060> us<00:02:37.330> from<00:02:37.360> continuing

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
on that was blocking us from continuing

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.770 
on that was blocking us from continuing
to<00:02:38.319> savor<00:02:38.530> these<00:02:38.680> hay<00:02:38.890> bales<00:02:39.180> who<00:02:40.180> go<00:02:40.330> behind

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
to savor these hay bales who go behind

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.600 
to savor these hay bales who go behind
the<00:02:41.019> farm<00:02:41.290> from<00:02:41.470> get<00:02:41.830> up<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.040> rock<00:02:42.220> there<00:02:42.519> we

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
the farm from get up the rock there we

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.220 
the farm from get up the rock there we
go<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:43.180> could<00:02:43.330> go<00:02:43.450> behind<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:43.810> farm<00:02:44.019> over

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
go you could go behind the farm over

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.470 
go you could go behind the farm over
here<00:02:44.519> through<00:02:45.519> this<00:02:45.640> bush<00:02:45.880> this<00:02:46.060> was<00:02:46.209> totally

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
here through this bush this was totally

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.020 
here through this bush this was totally
fine<00:02:46.660> but<00:02:47.230> after<00:02:47.349> this<00:02:47.620> Hill<00:02:47.860> up<00:02:47.890> here<00:02:48.370> oh<00:02:48.579> you

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030

fine but after this Hill up here oh you
had<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.180> rock<00:02:49.420> here<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.410> blocked<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.709> off<00:02:50.860> so

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
had a rock here that blocked you off so

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.550 
had a rock here that blocked you off so
I<00:02:51.370> start<00:02:51.849> to<00:02:51.940> think<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.209> myself<00:02:52.239> well<00:02:52.780> what

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
I start to think to myself well what

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.410 
I start to think to myself well what
else<00:02:53.680> could<00:02:53.890> be<00:02:53.950> around<00:02:54.340> here<00:02:54.549> how<00:02:54.790> could<00:02:55.299> I

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.490 
actually a waterfall um can you see it
yeah<00:03:01.269> round<00:03:01.480> here<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.780> actually<00:03:02.049> came<00:03:02.290> over

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
yeah round here I actually came over

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.530 
yeah round here I actually came over
here<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.739> saw<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.160> waterfall<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:04.209> looked

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
here and saw this waterfall it looked

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.270 
here and saw this waterfall it looked
like<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.870> could<00:03:04.900> get<00:03:05.260> up<00:03:05.410> over<00:03:06.010> there<00:03:06.160> you

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
like you could get up over there you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.039 
like you could get up over there you
could<00:03:06.430> get<00:03:06.670> beyond<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.180> waterfall<00:03:07.690> here<00:03:07.930> I

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
could get beyond this waterfall here I

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.220 
could get beyond this waterfall here I
just<00:03:08.290> fell<00:03:08.470> down<00:03:08.500> all<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.730> way<00:03:09.849> but<00:03:10.329> still<00:03:10.810> up

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
just fell down all the way but still up

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.750 
just fell down all the way but still up
there<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.560> thought<00:03:11.860> well<00:03:12.069> how<00:03:12.099> can<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.400> do<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.579> and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
there I thought well how can I do it and

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.100 
there I thought well how can I do it and
they're<00:03:13.000> basically<00:03:13.360> i<00:03:13.450> combine<00:03:13.750> these<00:03:13.900> two

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
they're basically i combine these two

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.839 
they're basically i combine these two
ideas<00:03:14.230> together<00:03:14.560> remember<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.220> bundle<00:03:15.549> item

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
ideas together remember the bundle item

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.670 
ideas together remember the bundle item
that<00:03:16.000> was<00:03:16.090> up<00:03:16.239> at<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.420> top<00:03:16.599> and<00:03:16.840> wondered<00:03:17.620> to

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
that was up at the top and wondered to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.620 
that was up at the top and wondered to
myself<00:03:17.739> if<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.250> could<00:03:18.430> very<00:03:18.609> quickly<00:03:18.790> waypoint

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
myself if I could very quickly waypoint

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.930 
myself if I could very quickly waypoint
with<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:20.290> bundle<00:03:20.590> item<00:03:20.859> and<00:03:21.040> in<00:03:21.160> 60<00:03:21.579> seconds

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
with the bundle item and in 60 seconds

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.970 
with the bundle item and in 60 seconds
get<00:03:22.180> all<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.389> way<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.900> waterfall<00:03:23.799> and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
get all the way to that waterfall and

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.910 
get all the way to that waterfall and
possibly<00:03:24.730> jump<00:03:25.540> up<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.079> turns<00:03:26.290> out<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.680> is

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
possibly jump up and it turns out it is

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.870 
possibly jump up and it turns out it is
possible<00:03:27.609> but<00:03:28.239> for<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.049> make<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.470> really

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
possible but for you to make it really

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.009 
possible but for you to make it really
you<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:31.060> can't<00:03:31.359> go<00:03:31.540> neither<00:03:31.780> need<00:03:31.989> a

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
you you can't go neither need a

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.240 
you you can't go neither need a
reasonable<00:03:32.560> system<00:03:32.680> or<00:03:32.980> you're<00:03:33.099> going<00:03:33.190> to

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
reasonable system or you're going to

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.680 
reasonable system or you're going to
need<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.489> minimize<00:03:33.940> as<00:03:34.180> much<00:03:34.329> as<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.540> possibly

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
need to minimize as much as you possibly

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.930 
need to minimize as much as you possibly

later that we talked about another
another<00:03:53.410> time<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.099> anyway<00:03:54.310> um<00:03:54.720> let's<00:03:55.720> uh

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
another time it so anyway um let's uh

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.420 
another time it so anyway um let's uh
let's<00:03:56.169> see<00:03:56.470> what<00:03:56.590> happens<00:03:56.889> is<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:57.160> I'm<00:03:57.220> going

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
let's see what happens is so I'm going

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.610 
let's see what happens is so I'm going
to<00:03:57.459> grab<00:03:57.579> it<00:03:57.700> I'm<00:03:58.660> going<00:03:58.810> to<00:03:58.870> open<00:03:59.169> up<00:03:59.319> my<00:03:59.440> map

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
to grab it I'm going to open up my map

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.770 
to grab it I'm going to open up my map
here<00:03:59.829> this<00:04:00.010> is<00:04:00.130> basic<00:04:00.459> of<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:00.609> process<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.630> be

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
here this is basic of the process to be

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.900 
here this is basic of the process to be
ready<00:04:02.019> with<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.410> way<00:04:02.530> point<00:04:02.889> on<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.669> mini-map

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
ready with the way point on the mini-map

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.400 
ready with the way point on the mini-map
so<00:04:04.239> I<00:04:04.299> can<00:04:04.450> just<00:04:04.599> jump<00:04:04.780> across<00:04:04.930> straight<00:04:05.200> away

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
so I can just jump across straight away

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.110 
so I can just jump across straight away
I'm<00:04:05.859> going<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.010> give<00:04:06.130> myself<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.519> speed<00:04:06.849> buff

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
I'm going to give myself a speed buff

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.300 
I'm going to give myself a speed buff
I'm<00:04:07.690> gonna<00:04:07.900> tell<00:04:08.200> him<00:04:08.319> you<00:04:08.530> bet<00:04:08.799> to<00:04:08.980> get<00:04:09.160> out

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
I'm gonna tell him you bet to get out

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.099 
I'm gonna tell him you bet to get out
and<00:04:09.459> get<00:04:09.549> a<00:04:09.609> waypoint<00:04:09.849> immediately<00:04:10.630> get<00:04:10.930> hit

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
and get a waypoint immediately get hit

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.300 
and get a waypoint immediately get hit
the<00:04:11.169> loading<00:04:11.440> screen<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.889> hopefully<00:04:12.190> this

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
the loading screen and hopefully this

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.129 
the loading screen and hopefully this
loading<00:04:12.579> screen<00:04:12.819> will<00:04:13.000> go<00:04:13.510> through<00:04:13.750> as<00:04:13.930> fast

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
loading screen will go through as fast

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.469 
loading screen will go through as fast
as<00:04:14.410> possible<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:14.980> if<00:04:15.579> I<00:04:15.669> can't<00:04:15.880> make<00:04:15.940> this<00:04:16.209> run

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
as possible and if I can't make this run

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.819 
as possible and if I can't make this run
what<00:04:16.720> I'll<00:04:16.810> probably<00:04:16.930> have<00:04:17.139> to<00:04:17.200> do<00:04:17.349> is<00:04:17.530> turn

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
what I'll probably have to do is turn

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.890 
what I'll probably have to do is turn
off<00:04:17.889> fraps<00:04:18.519> turn<00:04:18.820> off<00:04:18.970> my<00:04:19.150> method<00:04:19.810> of

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
off fraps turn off my method of

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.670 
off fraps turn off my method of
recording<00:04:20.829> and<00:04:21.370> then<00:04:21.909> film<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:22.930> again<00:04:23.229> so<00:04:23.560> that

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
recording and then film it again so that

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.379 
recording and then film it again so that
you<00:04:23.770> guys<00:04:23.860> can<00:04:24.099> actually<00:04:24.430> see

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
you guys can actually see

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.909 
you guys can actually see
where<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.110> loading<00:04:26.349> screens<00:04:26.590> a<00:04:26.650> bit<00:04:26.770> more

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
where the loading screens a bit more

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.100 
where the loading screens a bit more
forgiving<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:28.150> what<00:04:28.509> basically<00:04:28.689> what<00:04:29.050> I'm

forgiving and what basically what I'm

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.209 
forgiving and what basically what I'm
going<00:04:29.259> to<00:04:29.319> try<00:04:29.439> and<00:04:29.469> do<00:04:29.650> is<00:04:29.860> with<00:04:30.009> as<00:04:30.099> much

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:30.219 
going to try and do is with as much

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:31.980 
going to try and do is with as much
swiftness<00:04:30.550> as<00:04:30.759> i<00:04:30.789> can<00:04:30.999> run<00:04:31.210> across<00:04:31.599> this<00:04:31.719> dock

here<00:04:32.340> jump<00:04:33.340> over<00:04:33.639> there<00:04:34.379> the<00:04:35.379> bundles<00:04:36.039> going

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:36.219 
here jump over there the bundles going

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:38.399 
here jump over there the bundles going
to<00:04:36.279> be<00:04:36.370> gone<00:04:36.520> any<00:04:36.849> second<00:04:37.389> now<00:04:37.419> jump<00:04:37.870> down<00:04:38.020> here

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
to be gone any second now jump down here

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.679 
to be gone any second now jump down here
and<00:04:38.590> then<00:04:39.219> hammer<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.699> one<00:04:39.819> key<00:04:39.999> ass<00:04:40.210> see<00:04:40.509> but

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:40.689 
and then hammer the one key ass see but

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:41.790 
and then hammer the one key ass see but
the<00:04:40.749> loading<00:04:40.960> screen<00:04:40.990> was<00:04:41.259> too<00:04:41.409> long<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:41.740> it

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
the loading screen was too long and it

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.260 
the loading screen was too long and it
timed<00:04:42.039> out<00:04:42.279> okay<00:04:42.759> so<00:04:42.819> I'll<00:04:42.939> see<00:04:43.090> you<00:04:43.150> in<00:04:43.240> a

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
timed out okay so I'll see you in a

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.119 
timed out okay so I'll see you in a
second<00:04:43.689> when<00:04:44.169> I<00:04:44.199> haven't<00:04:44.499> been<00:04:44.620> using<00:04:44.800> fraps

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
second when I haven't been using fraps

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.739 
second when I haven't been using fraps
and<00:04:45.460> we'll<00:04:45.669> see<00:04:45.849> we'll<00:04:46.360> see<00:04:46.389> how<00:04:46.539> this<00:04:46.659> goes

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:46.749 
and we'll see we'll see how this goes

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.390 
and we'll see we'll see how this goes
with<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.169> loading<00:04:47.439> screen<00:04:47.499> a<00:04:47.889> little<00:04:48.069> bit

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
with the loading screen a little bit

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.580 
with the loading screen a little bit
shorter<00:04:48.580> okay<00:04:49.569> and<00:04:49.779> we're<00:04:49.930> back<00:04:50.080> as<00:04:50.319> you<00:04:50.469> can

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
shorter okay and we're back as you can

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.869 
shorter okay and we're back as you can
see<00:04:50.740> this<00:04:50.919> time<00:04:51.159> the<00:04:51.310> loading<00:04:51.550> screen<00:04:51.610> was

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:51.879 
see this time the loading screen was

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.399 
see this time the loading screen was
much<00:04:52.029> quicker<00:04:52.240> because<00:04:52.419> my<00:04:52.629> swiftness<00:04:53.050> still

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
much quicker because my swiftness still

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.980 
much quicker because my swiftness still
up<00:04:53.590> so<00:04:53.889> I<00:04:53.919> can<00:04:54.249> use<00:04:54.520> those<00:04:54.550> extra<00:04:55.270> seconds<00:04:55.810> to

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
up so I can use those extra seconds to

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.679 
up so I can use those extra seconds to
hopefully<00:04:56.199> have<00:04:57.099> the<00:04:57.249> time<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:58.270> actually<00:04:58.360> get

00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:58.689 
hopefully have the time to actually get

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.089 
hopefully have the time to actually get
there<00:04:58.840> you<00:04:58.990> can<00:04:59.110> cut<00:04:59.289> a<00:04:59.319> lot<00:04:59.529> of<00:04:59.560> corners<00:04:59.949> like

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
there you can cut a lot of corners like

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.409 
there you can cut a lot of corners like
that<00:05:00.250> place<00:05:00.430> there<00:05:00.669> if<00:05:00.879> I<00:05:01.000> just<00:05:01.150> run<00:05:01.300> through

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
that place there if I just run through

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.119 
that place there if I just run through
the<00:05:01.569> bush<00:05:01.719> for<00:05:01.870> example<00:05:02.289> you<00:05:02.800> get<00:05:02.949> a<00:05:02.979> lot<00:05:03.099> more

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129 
the bush for example you get a lot more

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:05.070 
the bush for example you get a lot more
speed<00:05:03.520> so<00:05:03.939> once<00:05:04.120> again<00:05:04.240> trying<00:05:04.750> to<00:05:04.840> get<00:05:04.960> over

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
speed so once again trying to get over

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.869 
speed so once again trying to get over
here<00:05:05.500> there's<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.310> little<00:05:06.400> bit<00:05:06.580> of<00:05:06.639> lag

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:06.879 
here there's a little bit of lag

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.700 
here there's a little bit of lag
actually<00:05:07.240> Mike<00:05:07.419> your<00:05:07.599> scenes<00:05:07.840> but<00:05:08.169> we're<00:05:08.349> okay

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
actually Mike your scenes but we're okay

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.529 
actually Mike your scenes but we're okay
waiting<00:05:09.400> for<00:05:09.550> this<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.789> come<00:05:09.819> off<00:05:09.939> of<00:05:10.150> recharge

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
waiting for this to come off of recharge

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.409 
waiting for this to come off of recharge
as<00:05:10.779> much<00:05:10.930> as<00:05:11.110> possible<00:05:11.490> jumping<00:05:12.490> up<00:05:12.639> and<00:05:12.909> there

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
as much as possible jumping up and there

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.360 
as much as possible jumping up and there
you<00:05:13.509> go<00:05:13.689> so<00:05:14.080> if<00:05:14.379> you<00:05:14.469> do<00:05:14.620> that<00:05:14.830> in<00:05:15.039> the<00:05:15.129> last

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
you go so if you do that in the last

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.980 
you go so if you do that in the last
second<00:05:15.939> just<00:05:16.120> as<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.270> bundles<00:05:16.659> about<00:05:16.839> to

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
second just as the bundles about to

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.980 
second just as the bundles about to
leave<00:05:17.279> you<00:05:18.279> can<00:05:18.430> pull<00:05:18.669> up<00:05:18.879> to<00:05:19.089> this<00:05:19.240> waterfall

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
leave you can pull up to this waterfall

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.450 
leave you can pull up to this waterfall
up<00:05:20.169> here<00:05:20.349> now<00:05:20.500> apparently<00:05:20.889> an<00:05:21.099> achievement

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
up here now apparently an achievement

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.459 
up here now apparently an achievement
has<00:05:21.699> been<00:05:21.909> added<00:05:22.150> at<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.050> end<00:05:23.139> of<00:05:23.349> this

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:23.469 
has been added at the end of this

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:24.869 
has been added at the end of this
jumping<00:05:23.830> puzzle<00:05:24.099> now<00:05:24.189> so<00:05:24.370> I've<00:05:24.460> just<00:05:24.639> kind<00:05:24.819> of

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
jumping puzzle now so I've just kind of

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.089 
jumping puzzle now so I've just kind of
skipped<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:25.539> end<00:05:25.659> you<00:05:26.620> can<00:05:26.740> get<00:05:26.860> straight

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
skipped to the end you can get straight

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.529 
skipped to the end you can get straight
to<00:05:27.219> the<00:05:27.249> Karma<00:05:27.639> vendor<00:05:27.939> it's<00:05:28.150> much<00:05:28.360> quicker

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
to the Karma vendor it's much quicker

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:29.939 
to the Karma vendor it's much quicker
than<00:05:28.689> actually<00:05:29.110> going<00:05:29.319> through<00:05:29.469> the<00:05:29.710> shark

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
than actually going through the shark

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.159 
than actually going through the shark

actually made it yeah yeah yeah I'm just
through<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:35.949> invisible<00:05:36.729> maze<00:05:36.939> thing<00:05:37.330> alright

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
through the invisible maze thing alright

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.510 
through the invisible maze thing alright
okay<00:05:38.199> so<00:05:38.259> I<00:05:38.379> beat<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:38.889> punch<00:05:38.919> that's

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
okay so I beat you to the punch that's

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.149 
okay so I beat you to the punch that's
cool<00:05:39.699> okay<00:05:40.240> see<00:05:40.509> so<00:05:40.899> there<00:05:41.169> is<00:05:41.199> advantages<00:05:41.860> for

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
cool okay see so there is advantages for

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.820 
cool okay see so there is advantages for
men<00:05:42.550> matching<00:05:42.759> this<00:05:43.149> so<00:05:43.750> yeah<00:05:43.960> well<00:05:44.439> I<00:05:44.469> haven't

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
men matching this so yeah well I haven't

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.379 
men matching this so yeah well I haven't
gotten<00:05:45.069> achievement<00:05:45.580> kind<00:05:45.729> of<00:05:45.819> for<00:05:46.210> doing
