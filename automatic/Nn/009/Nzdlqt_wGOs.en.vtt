telling you how to get longer run time
on<00:00:29.519> your<00:00:30.029> RC<00:00:30.420> vehicle<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:31.230> other<00:00:31.470> words<00:00:31.969> how<00:00:32.969> to

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
on your RC vehicle in other words how to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.470 
on your RC vehicle in other words how to
make<00:00:33.719> one<00:00:34.079> fuel<00:00:34.980> tank<00:00:35.660> last<00:00:36.660> as<00:00:37.140> long<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:38.480> it

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
make one fuel tank last as long as it

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.750 
make one fuel tank last as long as it
will<00:00:40.110> now<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.280> first<00:00:41.579> thing

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
will now that is the first thing

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.090 
will now that is the first thing
obviously<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:46.700> 75<00:00:47.700> CC<00:00:48.329> tank<00:00:49.100> that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
obviously if you have a 75 CC tank that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.939 
obviously if you have a 75 CC tank that
does<00:00:50.340> not<00:00:50.489> hold<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:51.000> much<00:00:51.180> fuel<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.949> 125cc

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
does not hold as much fuel as a 125cc

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.630 
does not hold as much fuel as a 125cc
fuel<00:00:53.760> tank<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.809> or<00:00:55.140> 150<00:00:55.770> cc<00:00:56.070> fuel<00:00:56.280> tank<00:00:56.489> so

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
fuel tank so or 150 cc fuel tank so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.930 
fuel tank so or 150 cc fuel tank so
obviously<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.059> can't<00:00:57.300> expect<00:00:57.899> miracles<00:00:58.940> but

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
obviously you can't expect miracles but

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.380 
obviously you can't expect miracles but
if<00:01:00.719> you're<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.410> 1<00:01:01.920> fuel<00:01:02.250> tank<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> point<00:01:03.030> 18

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
if you're a 1 fuel tank on a point 18

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.800 
if you're a 1 fuel tank on a point 18
engine<00:01:03.719> should<00:01:03.930> usually<00:01:04.290> last<00:01:04.830> about<00:01:05.810> 10

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
engine should usually last about 10

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.190 
engine should usually last about 10
minutes<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.590> 15<00:01:08.520> minutes<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.479> depends<00:01:09.930> on

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
minutes to 15 minutes this depends on

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.190 
minutes to 15 minutes this depends on
your<00:01:10.470> tuning<00:01:10.979> tuning<00:01:11.880> comes<00:01:12.510> into<00:01:12.869> everything

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
your tuning tuning comes into everything

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.999 
your tuning tuning comes into everything
because<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.479> running<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.020> rich<00:01:16.380> now

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
because if you are running it rich now

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.800 
because if you are running it rich now
rich<00:01:17.400> basically<00:01:18.090> means<00:01:19.130> too<00:01:20.130> much<00:01:20.369> fuel<00:01:20.810> not

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
rich basically means too much fuel not

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.210 
rich basically means too much fuel not
enough<00:01:22.110> air<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.130> means<00:01:23.310> more<00:01:24.090> fuel<00:01:24.390> lesser

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
enough air or it means more fuel lesser

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.760 
enough air or it means more fuel lesser
now<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.400> means<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.909> your<00:01:27.900> engine<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.530> going

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
now this means that your engine is going

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.660 
now this means that your engine is going
to<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:28.979> taking<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.640> more<00:01:30.540> fuel<00:01:31.020> than<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:32.460> would

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
to be taking in more fuel than it would

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.270 
to be taking in more fuel than it would
be<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:33.630> running<00:01:33.930> Nina<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.100> one

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
be if it was running Nina so that is one

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.480 
be if it was running Nina so that is one
thing<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:35.909> I'm<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.420> saying<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.530> lean<00:01:38.250> out

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
thing now I'm not saying to you lean out

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.690 
thing now I'm not saying to you lean out
your<00:01:39.000> engine<00:01:39.479> as<00:01:39.780> much<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.380> possible<00:01:40.700> because

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
your engine as much as possible because

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.910 
your engine as much as possible because
that<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.899> damage<00:01:43.200> your<00:01:43.500> engine

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that is just going to damage your engine

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.200 
that is just going to damage your engine

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
ideal settings sort of like in between

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.380 
ideal settings sort of like in between
ones<00:01:59.490> oh<00:02:00.680> here<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.829> now<00:02:02.790> let's<00:02:03.090> imagine

I'm<00:02:03.840> running<00:02:04.290> my<00:02:04.439> car<00:02:04.880> on<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.719> setting<00:02:07.500> here

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
I'm running my car on this setting here

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.619 
I'm running my car on this setting here
what's<00:02:10.549> right<00:02:11.549> I'm<00:02:11.879> running<00:02:12.150> my<00:02:12.420> car<00:02:12.890> on<00:02:14.629> this

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
what's right I'm running my car on this

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:23.780 
what's right I'm running my car on this
setting<00:02:18.170> now<00:02:19.219> this<00:02:20.219> setting<00:02:20.909> is<00:02:22.790> completely

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
setting now this setting is completely

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.679 
setting now this setting is completely
flushed<00:02:24.859> with<00:02:25.859> the<00:02:26.010> edges<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:27.090> basically

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
flushed with the edges that basically

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.259 
flushed with the edges that basically
means<00:02:28.049> it<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.680> going<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.069> be<00:02:29.099> running<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.730> very

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
means it is going to be running a very

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.949 
means it is going to be running a very
very<00:02:31.049> very<00:02:31.409> rich<00:02:32.220> now<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.510> would<00:02:33.689> mean<00:02:33.930> that

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
very very rich now that would mean that

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.069 
very very rich now that would mean that
your<00:02:34.319> fuel<00:02:34.709> tank<00:02:35.069> would<00:02:35.340> last<00:02:35.579> about<00:02:36.079> three

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
your fuel tank would last about three

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.679 
your fuel tank would last about three
minutes<00:02:37.620> less<00:02:38.340> now<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.090> don't<00:02:39.299> want<00:02:39.540> that

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
minutes less now you don't want that

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.629 
minutes less now you don't want that
because<00:02:39.900> then<00:02:40.349> one<00:02:40.829> you<00:02:41.010> have<00:02:41.159> to<00:02:41.280> really<00:02:41.400> fill

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
because then one you have to really fill

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:46.909 
because then one you have to really fill
it<00:02:41.730> more<00:02:41.879> often<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.480> two<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:45.409> will<00:02:46.409> basically

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:46.919 
it more often and two you will basically

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.580 
it more often and two you will basically
be<00:02:47.099> wasting<00:02:47.730> your<00:02:47.760> feel<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:48.780> an<00:02:49.079> idealist

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
be wasting your feel so an idealist

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.740 
be wasting your feel so an idealist
setting<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.450> if<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:52.370> not<00:02:53.370> do<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:54.060> me<00:02:54.299> so<00:02:54.689> you

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
setting is if you not do it to me so you

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.539 
setting is if you not do it to me so you
don't<00:02:55.200> want<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.379> do<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.739> lean<00:02:55.980> because<00:02:56.280> to

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
don't want to do it to lean because to

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.020 
don't want to do it to lean because to
lean<00:02:56.790> will<00:02:57.060> damage<00:02:57.480> your<00:02:57.510> engine<00:02:59.030> so

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
lean will damage your engine so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.569 
lean will damage your engine so

basically that is the setting that is on

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.080 
basically that is the setting that is on
just<00:03:02.879> then<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:03.689> this<00:03:03.989> setting<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.609> running

very very well and on this setting I get

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.369 
very very well and on this setting I get

only affect it a very very minor

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.649 
only affect it a very very minor
percentage<00:03:30.829> so<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:32.489> is<00:03:32.639> one<00:03:32.849> thing<00:03:33.120> the

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.979 
grown into your arms vehicle the second
thing<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:41.010> percentage<00:03:41.669> of<00:03:41.879> nitro<00:03:42.540> you

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
thing is the percentage of nitro you

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.960 
thing is the percentage of nitro you
will<00:03:43.229> be<00:03:43.620> using<00:03:43.919> now<00:03:44.430> down<00:03:44.909> here<00:03:45.409> we<00:03:46.409> have<00:03:46.620> a

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
will be using now down here we have a

twenty-five percent and twenty percent
basically<00:04:01.079> let's<00:04:01.799> put<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.129> into<00:04:02.280> English

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
basically let's put that into English

the less nitro you have the longer your

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.780 
the less nitro you have the longer your
fuel<00:04:07.109> tank<00:04:07.439> is<00:04:07.650> going<00:04:07.979> to<00:04:08.129> last<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.729> the

fuel tank is going to last and the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.580 
fuel tank is going to last and the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
longer run time or the more run time you

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.800 
longer run time or the more run time you
will<00:04:13.709> be<00:04:13.739> getting<00:04:14.040> out<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.459> one<00:04:14.639> tank<00:04:14.970> if<00:04:15.629> you

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
will be getting out of one tank if you

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.769 
will be getting out of one tank if you
use<00:04:16.169> thirty<00:04:16.590> percent<00:04:17.099> in<00:04:17.370> here<00:04:17.789> you're<00:04:18.750> only

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:18.779 
use thirty percent in here you're only

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.410 
use thirty percent in here you're only
going<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.260> get<00:04:19.409> about<00:04:20.039> eight

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
going to get about eight

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.080 
going to get about eight
seven<00:04:21.810> or<00:04:22.260> maybe<00:04:22.710> even<00:04:22.950> six<00:04:23.430> minutes<00:04:23.820> runtime

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
seven or maybe even six minutes runtime

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.060 
seven or maybe even six minutes runtime
with<00:04:25.020> your<00:04:25.170> RC<00:04:25.470> vehicle<00:04:26.030> whereas<00:04:27.030> 16<00:04:28.010> is<00:04:29.010> a

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
with your RC vehicle whereas 16 is a

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.540 
with your RC vehicle whereas 16 is a
lower<00:04:29.550> consumption<00:04:30.210> of<00:04:30.390> fuel<00:04:30.690> therefore<00:04:31.550> you

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
lower consumption of fuel therefore you

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.120 
lower consumption of fuel therefore you
will<00:04:32.790> get<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.300> much<00:04:33.360> longer<00:04:33.810> run<00:04:34.200> time<00:04:34.500> out<00:04:34.830> of

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
will get a much longer run time out of

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.640 
will get a much longer run time out of
your<00:04:35.370> RC<00:04:35.790> vehicle<00:04:36.240> now<00:04:36.810> that<00:04:37.170> is<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.470> way<00:04:37.590> to

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
your RC vehicle now that is the way to

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.860 
your RC vehicle now that is the way to
do<00:04:37.950> it<00:04:38.100> so<00:04:38.520> what<00:04:38.670> you<00:04:38.790> need<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:38.970> do<00:04:39.240> is<00:04:39.480> it's<00:04:39.660> all
