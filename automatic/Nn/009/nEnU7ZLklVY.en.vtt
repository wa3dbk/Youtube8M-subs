to break in and kill this cannon a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.240 
to break in and kill this cannon a
little<00:00:45.270> bit<00:00:45.360> faster<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.440> know<00:00:46.559> save<00:00:47.219> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
little bit faster just you know save a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.190

little<00:00:47.489> bit<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.760> firing<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> Giants<00:00:49.050> it's

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
little bit of firing on the Giants it's

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.410 
little bit of firing on the Giants it's
probably<00:00:49.860> not<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.280> necessary<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
probably not really necessary if you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
probably not really necessary if you
have<00:00:51.539> level<00:00:51.840> 1<00:00:51.989> troops<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:53.160> know<00:00:53.250> obviously

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
have level 1 troops you know obviously

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.430 
have level 1 troops you know obviously
might<00:00:53.940> help<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.420> little<00:00:54.449> taking<00:00:54.989> out<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.260> one

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
might help a little taking out that one

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.430 
might help a little taking out that one
cannon<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.520> bit<00:00:56.640> faster<00:00:57.170> also<00:00:58.170> if<00:00:58.320> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
cannon a little bit faster also if you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.889 
cannon a little bit faster also if you
have<00:00:58.590> level<00:00:58.949> 1<00:00:59.070> troops<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.550> might<00:00:59.730> need<00:00:59.940> 10<00:01:00.750> or

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
have level 1 troops you might need 10 or

shouldn't have much problem with the map
it's<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.590> difficult<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.159> long<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.430> you
