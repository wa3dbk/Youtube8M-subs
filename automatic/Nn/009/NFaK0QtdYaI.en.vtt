any<00:04:20.500> time<00:04:21.090> um<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:23.080> only<00:04:23.170> thing<00:04:23.440> I'd<00:04:23.590> really

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
any time um the only thing I'd really

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.770 
any time um the only thing I'd really
don't<00:04:24.040> like<00:04:24.160> about<00:04:24.310> this<00:04:24.490> car<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.970> tires<00:04:25.240> that

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
don't like about this car the tires that

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.780 
don't like about this car the tires that
they<00:04:25.900> gave<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.440> stock<00:04:26.680> tires<00:04:26.890> there

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
they gave you the stock tires there

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.540 
they gave you the stock tires there
really<00:04:28.120> is<00:04:28.420> no<00:04:28.450> traction<00:04:29.110> on<00:04:29.530> these<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:30.160> the

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
really is no traction on these and the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.680 
really is no traction on these and the
dirt<00:04:30.820> it's<00:04:31.590> better<00:04:32.590> than<00:04:32.890> nothing<00:04:33.220> but<00:04:33.760> really

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
dirt it's better than nothing but really

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.570 
dirt it's better than nothing but really
there's<00:04:35.050> nothing<00:04:35.410> on<00:04:35.920> this<00:04:36.040> I've<00:04:36.220> been<00:04:36.340> just

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
there's nothing on this I've been just

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.700 
there's nothing on this I've been just
kind<00:04:36.700> of<00:04:36.790> driving<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.330> on<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.690> road<00:04:37.870> that's

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
kind of driving it on the road that's

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.830 
kind of driving it on the road that's
why<00:04:38.860> it<00:04:39.040> kind<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.400> looks<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.640> little<00:04:41.100> faded<00:04:42.100> out

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
why it kind of looks a little faded out

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.720 
why it kind of looks a little faded out
I<00:04:43.860> still<00:04:44.860> can't<00:04:44.920> think<00:04:45.250> about<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.460> third

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
I still can't think about that third

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.580 
I still can't think about that third
thing<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.060> got<00:04:46.240> cuz<00:04:46.450> I<00:04:46.510> got<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.690> toolkit<00:04:47.110> another

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
thing I got cuz I got a toolkit another

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.350 
thing I got cuz I got a toolkit another
motor<00:04:49.440> something<00:04:50.440> else<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:51.270> don't<00:04:52.270> know<00:04:52.330> I

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
motor something else I don't know I

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.520 
motor something else I don't know I
think<00:04:52.540> I<00:04:52.660> had<00:04:52.780> something<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:53.110> do<00:04:53.200> with<00:04:53.350> that<00:04:53.380> an

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
think I had something to do with that an

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
think I had something to do with that an
RC<00:04:53.830> car<00:04:54.010> another<00:04:55.530> so<00:04:56.530> really<00:04:57.040> nothing<00:04:57.250> like

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
RC car another so really nothing like

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.400 
RC car another so really nothing like
special<00:04:58.060> that<00:04:58.540> i'm<00:04:58.630> doing<00:04:58.750> right<00:04:59.050> now<00:04:59.200> I'm

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
special that i'm doing right now I'm

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.620 
special that i'm doing right now I'm
just<00:04:59.440> kind<00:04:59.770> of<00:04:59.800> showing<00:05:00.070> it<00:05:00.310> off<00:05:00.510> seeing<00:05:01.510> what

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
just kind of showing it off seeing what

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.140 
just kind of showing it off seeing what
you<00:05:01.720> guys<00:05:01.750> think<00:05:02.080> of<00:05:02.200> this<00:05:02.520> tell<00:05:03.520> me<00:05:03.640> like<00:05:03.970> your

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
you guys think of this tell me like your

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.290 
you guys think of this tell me like your
review<00:05:04.540> of<00:05:04.750> it<00:05:04.930> so<00:05:05.680> far<00:05:05.920> my<00:05:06.190> review<00:05:06.580> of<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:07.060> is

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
review of it so far my review of it is

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.070 
review of it so far my review of it is
that<00:05:07.330> it's<00:05:07.690> a<00:05:08.020> great<00:05:08.350> beginner<00:05:09.070> car<00:05:09.370> I<00:05:10.360> had<00:05:10.870> my

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
that it's a great beginner car I had my

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.860 
that it's a great beginner car I had my
uncle<00:05:11.680> who's<00:05:11.920> a<00:05:11.950> cop<00:05:12.190> I<00:05:12.520> had<00:05:12.910> him<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.120> clock<00:05:13.690> it

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
uncle who's a cop I had him a clock it

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.740 
uncle who's a cop I had him a clock it
for<00:05:14.080> me<00:05:14.200> and<00:05:14.320> I<00:05:14.410> got<00:05:14.590> I<00:05:14.800> got<00:05:15.010> it<00:05:15.280> up<00:05:15.400> to

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
for me and I got I got it up to

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.810 
for me and I got I got it up to
when<00:05:17.320> i<00:05:17.350> was<00:05:17.470> 18<00:05:17.920> i<00:05:17.950> think<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:18.490> was<00:05:18.580> a<00:05:18.640> top

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
when i was 18 i think that was a top

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.260 
when i was 18 i think that was a top
speed<00:05:19.060> for<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.450> so<00:05:19.960> it's<00:05:20.350> pretty<00:05:20.650> slow

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
speed for it so it's pretty slow

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.380 
speed for it so it's pretty slow
compared<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.420> most<00:05:22.720> RC<00:05:23.230> cars<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:23.950> I've<00:05:24.130> seen

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
compared to most RC cars that I've seen

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.040 
compared to most RC cars that I've seen
but<00:05:25.390> for<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.020> beginner<00:05:26.320> it's<00:05:27.190> really<00:05:27.580> good

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
but for a beginner it's really good

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.760 
but for a beginner it's really good
putting<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.140> body<00:05:29.410> back<00:05:30.070> on<00:05:30.250> here<00:05:31.470> ever<00:05:32.470> so

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
putting the body back on here ever so

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.090 
putting the body back on here ever so
carefully

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.470 

okay<00:05:36.670> all<00:05:37.060> right<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.530> did<00:05:38.530> get<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:39.480> clip

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
okay all right I did get the clip

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.960 
okay all right I did get the clip
holders<00:05:40.870> and<00:05:41.560> attached<00:05:41.800> to<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:42.040> body<00:05:43.110> and<00:05:44.110> the

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
holders and attached to the body and the

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.210 
holders and attached to the body and the
new<00:05:45.970> transmitter<00:05:46.510> that<00:05:46.690> I<00:05:46.750> had<00:05:46.900> to<00:05:47.020> get<00:05:47.200> my<00:05:47.440> the

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
new transmitter that I had to get my the

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.340 
new transmitter that I had to get my the
transmitter<00:05:48.610> that<00:05:48.730> came<00:05:48.910> with<00:05:49.090> it<00:05:49.350> was

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
transmitter that came with it was

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.460 
transmitter that came with it was
apparently<00:05:50.830> broke<00:05:51.540> it<00:05:52.540> was<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:53.020> car<00:05:53.200> would<00:05:53.440> go

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
apparently broke it was the car would go

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.830 
apparently broke it was the car would go
on<00:05:53.770> its<00:05:53.920> own<00:05:54.070> and<00:05:54.370> it<00:05:55.240> wasn't<00:05:55.570> just<00:05:55.660> like

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
on its own and it wasn't just like

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.290 
on its own and it wasn't just like
jitter<00:05:56.320> it<00:05:56.530> would<00:05:56.680> just<00:05:56.800> like<00:05:57.040> literally<00:05:57.370> go

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
jitter it would just like literally go

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.700 
jitter it would just like literally go
50<00:05:59.230> feet<00:05:59.410> and<00:05:59.620> stop<00:06:00.130> then<00:06:01.000> backwards<00:06:01.720> 15<00:06:02.320> feet

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
50 feet and stop then backwards 15 feet

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.590 
50 feet and stop then backwards 15 feet
and<00:06:02.920> then<00:06:03.010> stop<00:06:03.340> and<00:06:03.870> turn<00:06:04.870> randomly<00:06:05.680> and<00:06:05.740> so

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
and then stop and turn randomly and so

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.270 
and then stop and turn randomly and so
um<00:06:07.600> so<00:06:07.960> I<00:06:07.990> went<00:06:08.200> back<00:06:08.320> to<00:06:08.350> my<00:06:08.530> hobby<00:06:08.740> store<00:06:09.010> and

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
um so I went back to my hobby store and

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.220 
um so I went back to my hobby store and
bought<00:06:10.000> another<00:06:10.150> one<00:06:11.280> it's<00:06:12.280> all<00:06:12.400> good<00:06:13.230> but
