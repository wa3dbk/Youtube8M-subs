00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
to hit ctrl 9 and go back to textured

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.370 
to hit ctrl 9 and go back to textured
view<00:00:28.489> you<00:00:29.000> want<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:29.210> clear<00:00:29.539> all<00:00:29.720> your<00:00:29.869> ambient

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
view you want to clear all your ambient

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.049 
view you want to clear all your ambient
properties<00:00:30.800> from<00:00:30.980> your<00:00:31.130> surfaces<00:00:31.699> so<00:00:31.910> that

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
properties from your surfaces so that

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.119 
properties from your surfaces so that
the<00:00:32.150> lighting<00:00:32.330> the<00:00:32.989> preset<00:00:33.620> lighting<00:00:34.040> that

comes<00:00:34.370> with<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.790> moviemaker<00:00:35.239> works<00:00:35.540> right

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
comes with the moviemaker works right

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.320 
comes with the moviemaker works right
and<00:00:35.960> then<00:00:36.800> we're<00:00:37.160> also<00:00:37.280> going<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.910> clear<00:00:38.300> all

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
and then we're also going to clear all

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.569 
and then we're also going to clear all
the<00:00:38.540> reflections<00:00:39.199> off<00:00:39.379> of<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.650> surfaces<00:00:40.190> this

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
the reflections off of the surfaces this

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.000 
the reflections off of the surfaces this
will<00:00:40.790> improve<00:00:41.360> our<00:00:41.510> render<00:00:41.839> time<00:00:42.079> notice<00:00:42.920> I

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
will improve our render time notice I

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.229 
will improve our render time notice I
have<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.159> option<00:00:43.519> to<00:00:43.550> select<00:00:43.909> the<00:00:44.000> shadow

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
have the option to select the shadow

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.580 
have the option to select the shadow
types<00:00:44.540> we<00:00:44.659> want<00:00:44.870> we<00:00:44.960> could<00:00:45.050> go<00:00:45.199> with<00:00:45.289> none

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
types we want we could go with none

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.380 
types we want we could go with none
which<00:00:45.829> is<00:00:46.010> great<00:00:46.280> for<00:00:46.550> like<00:00:46.730> a<00:00:46.760> preview<00:00:47.239> render

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
which is great for like a preview render

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.700 
which is great for like a preview render
if<00:00:47.660> you<00:00:47.750> want<00:00:47.899> to<00:00:47.960> see<00:00:48.079> how<00:00:48.199> things<00:00:48.379> are<00:00:48.559> gonna

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
if you want to see how things are gonna

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.069 
if you want to see how things are gonna
look<00:00:48.949> you<00:00:49.789> can<00:00:49.940> use<00:00:50.090> your<00:00:50.239> deep<00:00:50.449> shadow<00:00:50.750> map

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
look you can use your deep shadow map

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.959 
look you can use your deep shadow map
which<00:00:51.469> means<00:00:51.710> you'll<00:00:51.890> have<00:00:52.010> to<00:00:52.160> calculate<00:00:52.399> the

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
which means you'll have to calculate the

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.720 
which means you'll have to calculate the
shadow<00:00:53.239> every<00:00:53.750> frame<00:00:54.140> um<00:00:54.609> depending<00:00:55.609> on

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
shadow every frame um depending on

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.099 
shadow every frame um depending on
what's<00:00:55.940> in<00:00:56.030> your<00:00:56.180> scene<00:00:56.420> this<00:00:56.600> can<00:00:56.840> be<00:00:56.960> real

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
what's in your scene this can be real

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.139 
what's in your scene this can be real
fast<00:00:57.379> a<00:00:57.559> real<00:00:57.739> slow<00:00:58.010> I<00:00:58.340> happen<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:58.969> prefer

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
fast a real slow I happen to prefer

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.259 
fast a real slow I happen to prefer
ray-traced<00:00:59.870> for<00:01:00.140> sunlight<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:01.090> there's<00:01:02.090> just

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
ray-traced for sunlight and there's just

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:03.790 
ray-traced for sunlight and there's just
one<00:01:02.329> little<00:01:02.570> caveat<00:01:02.989> if<00:01:03.350> you're<00:01:03.469> gonna<00:01:03.559> use

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
one little caveat if you're gonna use

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.439 
one little caveat if you're gonna use
the<00:01:04.009> ray-traced<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:04.759> wanna<00:01:04.910> go<00:01:05.030> in<00:01:05.119> here<00:01:05.360> and

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
the ray-traced you wanna go in here and

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.950 
the ray-traced you wanna go in here and
look<00:01:06.380> at<00:01:06.500> this<00:01:06.740> hair<00:01:07.100> prop<00:01:07.429> and<00:01:07.850> because<00:01:08.810> we

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
look at this hair prop and because we

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.900 
look at this hair prop and because we
have<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.229> lot<00:01:09.560> of<00:01:09.590> polygons<00:01:10.160> in<00:01:10.399> here<00:01:10.610> that<00:01:10.759> use

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
have a lot of polygons in here that use

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.660 
have a lot of polygons in here that use
transparency<00:01:11.840> mapping<00:01:12.350> on<00:01:12.500> them<00:01:12.710> that's

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
transparency mapping on them that's

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.639 
transparency mapping on them that's
going<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.940> render<00:01:14.149> really<00:01:14.660> slowly<00:01:14.960> with<00:01:15.500> our

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
going to render really slowly with our

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.290 
going to render really slowly with our
ray<00:01:15.800> traced<00:01:16.070> shadows<00:01:16.190> unless<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:17.000> just<00:01:17.149> go

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
ray traced shadows unless you just go

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.570 
ray traced shadows unless you just go
and<00:01:17.420> grab<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:17.780> hair<00:01:17.990> prop<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:19.069> turn<00:01:19.310> cast

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
and grab that hair prop and turn cast

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.380 
and grab that hair prop and turn cast
shadows<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.240> off<00:01:20.470> this<00:01:21.470> means<00:01:21.800> that<00:01:22.039> the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
shadows to off this means that the

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.910 
shadows to off this means that the
lighting<00:01:23.390> is<00:01:23.509> not<00:01:23.660> really<00:01:23.990> going<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.229> see<00:01:24.590> the

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
lighting is not really going to see the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.800 
lighting is not really going to see the
hair<00:01:25.099> prop<00:01:25.369> which<00:01:26.240> means<00:01:26.509> that<00:01:26.660> those

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
hair prop which means that those

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.050 
hair prop which means that those
raytrace<00:01:27.259> shadows<00:01:27.740> are<00:01:28.340> going<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.819> be<00:01:28.910> ignored

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
raytrace shadows are going to be ignored

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.749 
raytrace shadows are going to be ignored
by<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.479> hair<00:01:29.810> which<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.500> kind<00:01:31.099> of<00:01:31.190> noticeable

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
by the hair which is kind of noticeable

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:32.949 
by the hair which is kind of noticeable
if<00:01:31.849> you're<00:01:32.000> really<00:01:32.209> looking<00:01:32.390> at<00:01:32.599> your<00:01:32.750> shadow

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:32.959 
if you're really looking at your shadow

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.900 
if you're really looking at your shadow
lines<00:01:33.380> but<00:01:33.709> for<00:01:33.739> a<00:01:33.979> quick<00:01:34.160> animation<00:01:34.729> like

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
lines but for a quick animation like

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.370 
lines but for a quick animation like
this<00:01:34.940> I<00:01:35.300> don't<00:01:35.360> think<00:01:35.630> anybody's<00:01:36.140> going<00:01:36.289> to

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
this I don't think anybody's going to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.650 
this I don't think anybody's going to
see<00:01:36.649> it<00:01:36.800> and<00:01:37.009> we're<00:01:37.700> going<00:01:37.819> to<00:01:37.910> shave<00:01:38.119> precious

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
see it and we're going to shave precious

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.589 
see it and we're going to shave precious
seconds<00:01:39.080> off<00:01:39.229> of<00:01:39.259> every<00:01:39.890> one<00:01:40.099> of<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.599> frames

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
seconds off of every one of the frames

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:45.669 
seconds off of every one of the frames
in<00:01:41.989> this<00:01:42.649> animation<00:01:43.069> of<00:01:43.459> which<00:01:44.300> we<00:01:44.479> have<00:01:44.679> 429

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
in this animation of which we have 429

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.190 
in this animation of which we have 429
so<00:01:46.340> if<00:01:46.489> we<00:01:46.610> can<00:01:46.789> save<00:01:47.030> two<00:01:47.330> seconds<00:01:47.869> on<00:01:48.020> every

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
so if we can save two seconds on every

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.680 
so if we can save two seconds on every
frame<00:01:48.729> that's<00:01:49.729> going<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.119> translate<00:01:50.539> into

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
frame that's going to translate into

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.680 
frame that's going to translate into
well<00:01:51.380> over<00:01:52.130> ten<00:01:52.369> minutes<00:01:52.580> off<00:01:52.940> of<00:01:52.970> our<00:01:53.300> final

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
well over ten minutes off of our final

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.190 
well over ten minutes off of our final
render<00:01:54.020> time<00:01:54.849> so<00:01:55.849> we're<00:01:56.840> just<00:01:56.869> going<00:01:57.110> to

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
render time so we're just going to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.139 
render time so we're just going to
render<00:01:57.379> a<00:01:57.500> couple<00:01:57.800> of<00:01:57.890> test<00:01:58.099> frames<00:01:58.280> will<00:01:58.970> take

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
render a couple of test frames will take

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.449 
render a couple of test frames will take
frame<00:01:59.420> one<00:01:59.690> go<00:02:00.619> back<00:02:00.739> over<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.099> our<00:02:01.160> movie

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
frame one go back over to our movie

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.540 
frame one go back over to our movie
maker<00:02:01.640> tab<00:02:02.110> over<00:02:03.110> here<00:02:03.379> and<00:02:03.500> hit<00:02:03.679> render<00:02:04.160> frame

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
maker tab over here and hit render frame

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.309 
maker tab over here and hit render frame
and<00:02:05.119> we'll<00:02:05.270> see<00:02:05.420> how<00:02:05.569> fast<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:05.989> frame

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
and we'll see how fast that frame

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:15.240 
and we'll see how fast that frame
renders<00:02:09.310> yeah

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.890 

as<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.460> can<00:02:16.580> see<00:02:16.820> once<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.210> gets<00:02:17.330> started<00:02:17.750> it

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
as you can see once it gets started it

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.520 
as you can see once it gets started it
goes<00:02:18.050> really<00:02:18.530> really<00:02:18.800> quick<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:23.530> we're

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
goes really really quick and we're

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.060 
goes really really quick and we're
running<00:02:24.650> 18<00:02:25.580> seconds<00:02:26.030> for<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.300> frame<00:02:27.070> let's

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
running 18 seconds for that frame let's

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.380 
running 18 seconds for that frame let's
drive<00:02:28.430> another<00:02:28.880> frame<00:02:30.610> from<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:31.820> sequence

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
drive another frame from this sequence

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.700 
drive another frame from this sequence
here<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.810> want<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.140> see<00:02:33.260> how<00:02:33.320> long<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.530> takes

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
here I want to see how long that takes

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.950 
here I want to see how long that takes
to<00:02:34.190> render<00:02:34.540> render<00:02:35.540> frame<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.630> always

adjustments that it does to render the
frame<00:02:59.570> now<00:03:00.050> I<00:03:00.080> mean<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:01.040> actually<00:03:01.610> doesn't

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
frame now I mean this actually doesn't

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.660 
frame now I mean this actually doesn't
look<00:03:01.970> really<00:03:02.480> good<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:02.930> if<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.250> were<00:03:04.430> doing

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
look really good and if I were doing

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.730 
look really good and if I were doing
this<00:03:05.800> for<00:03:06.800> a<00:03:06.830> real<00:03:07.100> movie<00:03:07.490> I<00:03:07.790> would<00:03:07.850> probably

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
this for a real movie I would probably

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.840 
this for a real movie I would probably
get<00:03:09.740> a<00:03:09.770> little<00:03:10.070> bit<00:03:10.190> more<00:03:10.340> involved<00:03:10.760> with

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
get a little bit more involved with

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.370 
get a little bit more involved with
altering<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.390> lighting<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:11.780> stuff<00:03:12.020> here<00:03:12.230> for

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
altering the lighting and stuff here for

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
will just scrub on through the timeline

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.820 
will just scrub on through the timeline
here<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.480> little<00:03:17.690> bit<00:03:17.990> we<00:03:18.320> know<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.620> these

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
here a little bit we know that these

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.720 
here a little bit we know that these
don't<00:03:19.130> take<00:03:19.340> too<00:03:19.490> long<00:03:19.520> I<00:03:21.430> wanted<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.520> look<00:03:22.610> at

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
seconds per frame on this so if we want

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.370 
seconds per frame on this so if we want
to<00:03:56.970> get<00:03:57.120> an<00:03:57.240> idea<00:03:59.210> pop<00:04:00.210> this<00:04:00.390> guy<00:04:00.510> out<00:04:00.840> through

one more render let me get an idea of

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.020 
one more render let me get an idea of
how<00:04:04.140> long<00:04:04.350> this<00:04:04.500> is<00:04:04.560> actually<00:04:05.250> all<00:04:05.430> gonna<00:04:05.640> take

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
how long this is actually all gonna take

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.880 
how long this is actually all gonna take
we<00:04:09.030> can<00:04:09.240> simply<00:04:09.690> go<00:04:09.870> in<00:04:10.050> and<00:04:10.350> open<00:04:10.530> up<00:04:10.740> our

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
seconds per frame is 7,000 93 seconds

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.760 
seconds per frame is 7,000 93 seconds
divided<00:04:29.850> by<00:04:29.910> 60<00:04:30.420> gives<00:04:31.320> us<00:04:31.500> 121<00:04:32.430> minutes<00:04:33.770> 120

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
divided by 60 gives us 121 minutes 120

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.520 
divided by 60 gives us 121 minutes 120
one<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.340> half<00:04:35.580> minutes<00:04:36.060> divided<00:04:36.960> by<00:04:37.110> 60

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
one and a half minutes divided by 60

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.160 
one and a half minutes divided by 60
again<00:04:37.800> just<00:04:38.250> for<00:04:38.730> fun<00:04:38.790> and<00:04:39.240> this<00:04:39.750> tells<00:04:39.990> you

that<00:04:40.200> it's<00:04:40.410> going<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.560> take<00:04:40.770> slightly<00:04:41.100> over

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
that it's going to take slightly over

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.270 
that it's going to take slightly over
two<00:04:41.580> hours<00:04:41.760> to<00:04:43.460> render<00:04:45.230> these<00:04:46.230> 14<00:04:46.800> seconds<00:04:47.220> of

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
two hours to render these 14 seconds of

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.090 
two hours to render these 14 seconds of

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
by 480 which for a complex scene like

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.970 
by 480 which for a complex scene like
this<00:04:52.950> is<00:04:53.190> actually<00:04:53.820> really<00:04:54.390> really<00:04:54.630> good<00:04:54.980> so

just gonna go through and start

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.960 
just gonna go through and start
rendering<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.950> frames<00:05:11.190> on<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.370> timeline<00:05:11.820> now

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
rendering the frames on the timeline now

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.240 
rendering the frames on the timeline now
one<00:05:12.120> thing<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:12.419> want<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:12.660> be<00:05:12.720> sure<00:05:13.020> of<00:05:13.230> is<00:05:13.560> if

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
you're set up to render still images and

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.990 
you're set up to render still images and
when<00:05:37.140> you<00:05:37.229> go<00:05:37.320> to<00:05:37.350> hit<00:05:37.500> render<00:05:37.680> movie<00:05:38.160> you're

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
when you go to hit render movie you're

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.460 
when you go to hit render movie you're
gonna<00:05:39.120> get<00:05:39.300> a<00:05:39.360> little<00:05:39.510> warning<00:05:39.900> message<00:05:40.290> it

not set up for animation

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.040 
not set up for animation
because<00:05:44.430> you<00:05:44.580> need<00:05:44.729> to<00:05:44.880> go<00:05:45.000> in<00:05:45.270> do<00:05:45.720> your<00:05:45.810> under

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
because you need to go in do your under

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.730 
settings don't you want to make a movie
to<00:05:47.940> find<00:05:48.150> your<00:05:48.270> start<00:05:48.510> and<00:05:48.600> end<00:05:48.750> frames<00:05:49.110> and

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
to find your start and end frames and

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.860 
to find your start and end frames and
define<00:05:50.370> a<00:05:50.729> movie<00:05:51.090> file<00:05:51.330> that<00:05:51.570> you're<00:05:51.660> going<00:05:51.810> to

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
define a movie file that you're going to

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.080 
define a movie file that you're going to
render<00:05:52.080> to<00:05:52.410> and<00:05:53.370> you're<00:05:53.520> gonna<00:05:53.610> be<00:05:53.729> careful

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
render to and you're gonna be careful

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.450 
render to and you're gonna be careful
about

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
about

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.130 
about
because<00:05:54.700> moviemaker<00:05:55.450> will<00:05:55.720> just<00:05:55.930> go<00:05:56.050> ahead

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
because moviemaker will just go ahead

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.840 
because moviemaker will just go ahead
and<00:05:56.350> render<00:05:56.500> over<00:05:56.860> whatever<00:05:57.040> file<00:05:57.430> name<00:05:57.670> is

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
and render over whatever file name is

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.090 
and render over whatever file name is
there<00:05:58.120> so<00:05:59.050> you<00:05:59.110> maybe<00:05:59.410> want<00:05:59.680> to<00:05:59.770> give<00:05:59.860> it<00:05:59.950> a

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
there so you maybe want to give it a

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.600 
there so you maybe want to give it a
different<00:06:00.160> name<00:06:01.770> we'll<00:06:02.770> call<00:06:02.980> it<00:06:03.160> moviemaker

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
different name we'll call it moviemaker

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.850 
different name we'll call it moviemaker
test<00:06:03.910> to<00:06:06.570> save<00:06:07.570> it<00:06:07.690> except<00:06:08.080> and<00:06:08.380> then<00:06:08.500> go<00:06:08.620> back

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
test to save it except and then go back

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.120 
test to save it except and then go back
over<00:06:08.890> here<00:06:09.220> and<00:06:09.790> go<00:06:10.120> to<00:06:10.180> render<00:06:10.450> movie<00:06:10.900> and<00:06:11.770> now

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
over here and go to render movie and now

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.380 
over here and go to render movie and now
it's<00:06:12.280> gonna<00:06:12.400> start<00:06:12.700> rendering<00:06:13.030> out<00:06:13.240> the

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
it's gonna start rendering out the

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.510 
it's gonna start rendering out the
frames<00:06:13.630> one<00:06:13.900> after<00:06:14.170> another<00:06:14.200> and<00:06:14.650> at<00:06:15.250> the<00:06:15.400> end

frames one after another and at the end

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.740 
frames one after another and at the end
of<00:06:15.580> it<00:06:15.700> you'll<00:06:15.820> have<00:06:15.970> the<00:06:16.090> option<00:06:16.420> to<00:06:16.510> save<00:06:16.720> the
