meters by it's hard to see here it's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.200 
meters by it's hard to see here it's
about<00:00:47.250> 1

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.490 

I<00:00:50.290> don't<00:00:51.290> know<00:00:51.350> if<00:00:51.440> it's<00:00:51.620> exactly<00:00:51.710> a<00:00:52.040> square

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
I don't know if it's exactly a square

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.150 
I don't know if it's exactly a square
whether<00:00:54.500> it's<00:00:54.710> slightly<00:00:55.010> longer<00:00:55.340> one<00:00:55.490> we're

whether it's slightly longer one we're
looks<00:00:58.160> like<00:00:58.370> it's<00:00:58.489> slightly<00:00:58.700> longer<00:00:59.060> that

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
looks like it's slightly longer that

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.590 
looks like it's slightly longer that
we're<00:00:59.830> possibly<00:01:00.830> two<00:01:01.760> point<00:01:02.030> three<00:01:02.210> meters

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
we're possibly two point three meters

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:16.330 
we're possibly two point three meters
three<00:01:02.870> to<00:01:03.260> half<00:01:03.470> meters<00:01:12.790> it<00:01:13.790> corners<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:16.130> look

three to half meters it corners you look
at<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.520> cornice<00:01:25.899> reinforced<00:01:27.550> points<00:01:28.550> where

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
at the cornice reinforced points where

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.020 
at the cornice reinforced points where
you<00:01:28.790> can<00:01:28.880> stick<00:01:29.360> here<00:01:30.820> what<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.000> Paul<00:01:32.210> slope

along

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.280 

see<00:01:50.940> I'm<00:01:51.030> down<00:01:51.240> outside<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.080> where

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
see I'm down outside and this is where

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.410 
see I'm down outside and this is where
these<00:01:55.830> differ<00:01:56.190> slightly<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.909> other<00:01:57.060> talks

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
these differ slightly the other talks

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.880 
these differ slightly the other talks
you've<00:01:57.659> got<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:59.729> uncle<00:02:00.030> points

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
you've got like the uncle points

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.300 
you've got like the uncle points
scattered<00:02:01.890> around<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.460> here<00:02:02.729> Center<00:02:04.310> you've

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
scattered around in here Center you've

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:14.809 
scattered around in here Center you've
got<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:05.700> there<00:02:08.119> one<00:02:09.119> down<00:02:09.360> there<00:02:13.250> two<00:02:14.250> three

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
got one there one down there two three

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.690 
got one there one down there two three
four<00:02:15.209> five<00:02:15.569> six<00:02:15.900> seven<00:02:16.200> yeah<00:02:16.530> you've<00:02:17.310> got<00:02:17.459> yet

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
four five six seven yeah you've got yet

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.370 
four five six seven yeah you've got yet
anchor<00:02:17.970> points<00:02:18.360> scattered<00:02:18.630> around<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.110> top

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
anchor points scattered around the top

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
anchor points scattered around the top
so<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:21.209> gives<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.570> possibility<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.560> quite<00:02:23.370> a

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
so it gives a possibility of quite a

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.170 
so it gives a possibility of quite a
vast<00:02:23.730> array<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.380> configurations<00:02:25.910> God<00:02:26.910> see

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
vast array of configurations God see

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.640 
vast array of configurations God see
that<00:02:27.360> when<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.630> college<00:02:28.080> don't<00:02:28.350> drink<00:02:30.019> em<00:02:31.019> can

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
that when you college don't drink em can

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.230 
that when you college don't drink em can
you<00:02:31.680> see<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.300> wait<00:02:35.870> on<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.930> other<00:02:37.170> side

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
you see it wait on the other side

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.070 
you see it wait on the other side
it's<00:02:40.240> what<00:02:40.390> they<00:02:40.480> look<00:02:40.630> like<00:02:40.660> on<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.050> other

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
it's what they look like on the other

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.400 
it's what they look like on the other
side<00:02:45.060> patch<00:02:46.060> on<00:02:46.330> their<00:02:46.540> stop<00:02:47.080> any<00:02:47.290> water

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
side patch on their stop any water

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:59.410 
side patch on their stop any water
coming<00:02:47.830> in

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.559 

material<00:03:00.420> feels<00:03:00.659> very<00:03:00.959> late<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:02.390> it's<00:03:03.390> got

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
material feels very late and it's got

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:16.039 
material feels very late and it's got
like<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:04.400> Sullivan<00:03:05.400> Courtin<00:03:05.939> on<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:14.900> mean<00:03:15.900> I'd

like a Sullivan Courtin on it I mean I'd
be<00:03:16.079> testing<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:16.829> possibly<00:03:17.340> sighted<00:03:17.730> here

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
be testing this so possibly sighted here

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.170 
be testing this so possibly sighted here
um<00:03:18.890> but<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:19.920> will<00:03:20.069> I<00:03:20.099> be<00:03:20.310> Billy<00:03:20.519> as<00:03:20.700> well<00:03:20.879> so<00:03:21.150> I
