 I hope you are well 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.210
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.380
 new video on blackhawks 2 and yes 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.449
 this time we meet for my 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.230
 first over percentile in death match 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.910
 per team if this v6 at waldhof fork no 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.289
 I'm really funny this time 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.119
 this is not to more than 100 kg it is 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.980
 found but it's for a nuclear 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.390
 so bah tells you 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.430
 nuclear wemmel it's new zealand and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.870
 already 45 put on youtube yeah yeah but 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.250
 that one it was made in three 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.010
 minutes top chrono so it's still 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.360
 not bad with a weapon that I 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.129
 have you ever again presented so there 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.270
 and mutine so right now I'm going to you 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.469
 describe my class because this gameplay 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.989
 really did not last long so 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.940
 you can imagine so I was playing at the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.379
 hate mutineers with the asset that allows 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.910
 to finally have the joker earlier who 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.649
 allows to have three accessories on his 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.079
 main weapon so I had a viewfinder 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.430
 laser a fast charger and what the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.670
 fuck what did I say no I had 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.409
 not too accessory sold with 2 we have 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 all in ghost determination like 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.260
 usually an asset of looters we have 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.240
 three dexterity 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.979
 that's really as usual my little 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.450
 6 4 and here I think that's all that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.460
 makes ten points 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.810
 the grocery store that does not pay attention in 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.070
 done there it's this gameplay it's a little 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.420
 a fat at the fuck elsewhere it's 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.549
 studio mode on a collection really 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.720
 disgusting of the blow if I start to 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.400
 kill people by pulling aside 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.840
 do not start thinking that call me there 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.360
 is connected to the NASA server sends 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.650
 there as there it has nothing to do is 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.880
 just that studio mode beugin little and 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.930
 especially when the conect is 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.630
 disgusting but you have to know that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.000
 on this part I turned around 2 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.009
 bars the whole party I almost 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.689
 redeem but good as I was not there 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.920
 for to score because at the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.960
 base I just wanted to test the mutineers 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.159
 on my subscribers account before trying 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.619
 of the climb if the soul was good 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.950
 sure the account I use to close 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.869
 gameplay 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.729
 suddenly bah I think I will 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.320
 adopt it 1 so here are people a little 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.100
 gameplay what the fuck from time to time 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.950
 it does not hurt 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.570
 in addition you will see that 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.430
 I will not launch at all but who 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.289
 strict since in my head I was 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.170
 like that I'm going to make a nuclear 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.850
 it's too much forgotten so you 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.990
 imagine a little in the state in which 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.610
 I was at the moment when I did this 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.690
 gameplay 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.250
 myself I wonder how I did 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.630
 I have to have a nuclear on this 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.700
 part good at the same time the guys in 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.870
 face it was a little studs 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.910
 frankly no I will not you 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.500
 hide one and there is also another thing 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.480
 I take the opportunity to talk to you 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.250
 of that on this gameplay there is something about 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.420
 call of that do not pretend that I understood 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.370
 recently because I know that since 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.299
 still practically but that I 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.799
 really started to put in 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.049
 application source black ops from and who 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.150
 really succeeds me not bad it's the 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.530
 management spawn so frankly and there 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.060
 especially on slam know this is 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.410
 really easy since the mind they 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.700
 are either on one side of the map or 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.019
 the other side so in fact you kill everything 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.880
 the world on one side and they will inevitably 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.260
 respawn on the other side all you 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.000
 have to do is stay pretty much 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.739
 to the middle and you make your way 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.599
 returns from one side to the other to try 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.560
 to grab people quickly so he 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.730
 ya it's really one of the best 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.739
 matches I think to make nuclear 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.750
 quickly by the way the day after 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.000
 this one I made another one to the fal 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.620
 that will have lasted three minutes so 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.239
 yeah sports management including a 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.980
 really important thing seriously 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.810
 guys try to handle the spawn at best 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.280
 in domination like a high level of 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.480
 sport that and frankly you 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.730
 do not bother to make big scores 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.410
 it is one of the best ways and 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.940
 if you manage to manage 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.109
 frankly spawn you can not 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.100
 have superhuman reflexes if you 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.359
 are able all the time to be in 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.810
 the back of the opponents and all of good 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.819
 manage them 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.769
 you really can do big 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.120
 big massacre and you will take a lot 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.170
 more fun to play akon anyway 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.030
 I know that I take no pleasure 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.739
 when I get fucked one blow 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.900
 give some rage that's pretty epic 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.430
 so here you see that I already have my 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.829
 brutal medal and that's going to be pretty 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.930
 fast for the last so that's forcing 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.880
 Trapped a young slut shot 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.380
 you died and I really had 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.549
 lucky that the guy does not know how to aim for 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.980
 in my opinion he was blind where he touches 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.690
 a little how far to the la I had to be at 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.400
 28 I got started really 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.109
 stressed I told myself fucking I have 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.389
 my nuclear fact so here I have 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.299
 does a little that he is the last one who 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.859
 gives the nuclear and a the star and a 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.970
 add had a night even so for the 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.250
 second time while I was little 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.169
 used so here I unlock my little 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.549
 nuclear I still kill a guy a little 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.620
 young shot and I'm going to fuck 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.750
 since still good a guy who has touched 1 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.549
 I did not understand that I was going 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.450
 do goal and I'm going to cut here I think 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.300
 because 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.010
 anyway it's more interesting of 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.300
 hit it if you liked the video but you 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.920
 are a little I like a small subscription 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.310
 blah blah blah as usual it will make me 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.769
 pleasure 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.669
 on this I tell you do you wear well to the 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.669
 next can
