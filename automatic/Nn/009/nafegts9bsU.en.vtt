00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
tires so that's the most important thing

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.000 
tires so that's the most important thing
because<00:02:05.479> i<00:02:05.660> think<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:06.200> degradation<00:02:06.350> on<00:02:06.830> this

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
because i think the degradation on this

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.710 
because i think the degradation on this
this<00:02:07.280> track<00:02:07.550> on<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.790> tires<00:02:08.030> is<00:02:08.270> pretty<00:02:08.510> hard
