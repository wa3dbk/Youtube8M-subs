00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 and hello to all dear friends with you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.480
 rey again and before starting this release 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.580
 I would like to congratulate all of you on 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.340
 happy new year wish you 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.259
 happiness health success in everything and in 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.850
 overall all the best for you coming 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.529
 new year 2013 and now let's 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.529
 let's get started 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.529
 mechanism 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.109
 and in today's release on mechanisms i 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.190
 I'll show you a hidden passage in such 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.100
 small cozy 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.609
 to the name let's activate it putting 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.710
 this one here opening a small stop 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.299
 passes we go down at it and here you are 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.799
 can make a corridor application and how 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.589
 would we have a secret room with chests and 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:07.229
 plastered in them let's do more 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.200
 sounding sober it is really very loud 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.759
 like this a little bit and let's get down to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.429
 the construction of this very mechanism 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.009
 I'll build right here at one o'clock and all 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:20.190
 see the diagram is very simple and to begin with 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.759
 we need a traffic system for 2 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.819
 block up put this way on 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.490
 him we put 2 sticky pistons so was 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:33.030
 here it would be here so here riptide with 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.929
 maximum delay block like this and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.759
 block like this here torch and here torch 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.720
 so now we put it here 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.899
 here's the block now we take the pants piston 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.959
 its him here now also here 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.170
 put the block here we put the torch it 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:55.890
 here the block here we put 3 fag and giving 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.910
 immediately all the blocks replace the hellish block 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.649
 stone where he is with us but we take from us 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.269
 for centuries and put it not here and you here and 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.879
 here now immediately drank all of the screw 

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:12.000
 what I do not need and continue 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:15.420
 building perhaps now on this 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.680
 level we take distributors and put them 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.680
 so here 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.159
 so stop it seems to me a little wrong here 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.439
 now activate our scheme whom yes and 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.329
 very deciding with the distribution we put on 1 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.340
 higher 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:34.049
 so now these blogs can be principle 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.700
 remove and answer blocks think too yes yes 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.120
 I merge back and we are already starting 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.730
 to lay out the outline of our future gender 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:47.590
 so in theory go 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:50.290
 forgetting the form of Mari, we close everything 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.810
 in this way now we will take off 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.010
 activation to see about 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.040
 oh yeah i'm unfinished system take sticky 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.909
 we put the piston here so now here 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.569
 unit here is a comparator in the funnel as well 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:10.719
 now switch take the red block 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.230
 option block and put it on 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.669
 undraped 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.569
 core perks give one any item 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:20.109
 let's start the funnel here we switch back 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.419
 and the principle that we are left so 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.729
 so so more acceleration until we continue 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.409
 floor for 2 blocks 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:30.489
 This is how the water will make such a small 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:36.519
 Arochka this will be our future fireplace 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:40.959
 so let's say we make walls with this one 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:43.930
 sides and here on this side 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.689
 Further now here here we set 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.709
 sticky piston here are the holes 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:53.459
 here so it is the block we remove and we put the block 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:57.489
 here so now we take leverage 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.799
 Storchak activate it back put 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.849
 on the blog we put on him or fag 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:07.840
 here is the block and here is the block further 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.840
 and what else did you forget I go scheme very 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.170
 I do not remember well here so here is sticky 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.859
 Piston on him Redstone block 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.650
 so we switch back and here 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.340
 100 blessings so here now. stone and 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.220
 we carry the signal directly here as well 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.860
 then think so go now we take 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.120
 half blocks 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.550
 like that after what it was worth here and no 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.340
 I didnâ€™t remember exactly yes thatâ€™s all 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.550
 did take a block put it like this 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.389
 here's the red torch he had experience 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.930
 here blood torches here on the blog and here 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:53.470
 here's a torch 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.810
 so, in theory, go everything then back here 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.380
 block and ruslan torch on it now 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.470
 put the block here a piece of stone 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.919
 now we take sticky pistons we put them 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.810
 right here and so let's take 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.270
 steps that will close 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.229
 directly pass take quartz and 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.570
 steps rollers 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.300
 more fit quite class of course 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.530
 same and put them from here we wake left 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.600
 just for the amount of the button accordion was this 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.360
 nasty 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:25.180
 gorge I do not remember so at least make up blocks 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.360
 on him we stand whether Peter himself block 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.310
 one block like that perform well and kinship 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.100
 go principle then 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.980
 that's all 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.880
 it remains only to charge the distributors 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:41.750
 lighters sometimes do it 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:47.520
 lighters lighters act lighters 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:50.750
 where, too, I saw them probably must be terrified 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.960
 creative take let's take say i 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.140
 a couple 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.740
 lighters here one and 2 distributor 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:02.100
 tools in the second why the second here 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:06.030
 here and here we will do it now 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:08.940
 such a small corridor passage here 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.710
 put the block here and here the block and we wonder 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.120
 but then you can continue with you 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:17.160
 this corridor and do directly 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.270
 what he wants of course and in theory the idea 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.850
 everything should be ready 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.750
 like i don't care anything whats not 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:30.900
 missed let's try cost you on 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:34.680
 here it is necessary. sleep teeth we put you diet 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:37.530
 here the stone with closes and ignites 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.300
 stone and fireplace 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.910
 we can be opened like this 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.350
 go here is such a small scheme on 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.580
 today who wanted to show you in 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:49.440
 This New Year's Eve Edition 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:50.250
 and yes perhaps on this I finish my 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.860
 tudor dollars talked 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:57.540
 I will close the corners and say goodbye to you 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:07:00.360
 here and subscribed to the channel, put 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.370
 tremendous thumbs up comment and 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.910

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.270
 the joys of good and all good luck to all

 bye Bye
