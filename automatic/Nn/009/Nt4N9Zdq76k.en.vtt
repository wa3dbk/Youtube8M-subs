00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:10.500
 Well that's hallen spirit of music 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:15.509
 in short, Susanne Merkels would have mine 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.039
 house study all the best for something different 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.660
 kind of not so typical zettler 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.430
 though but I'm still on it 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.630
 to talk exactly why I say so 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.429
 but very good vote 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.149
 On her father's side, she returns 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.510
 have globe trotter world champion of 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.670
 so-called five courses and mothers 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.390
 should also be one of the big star 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:55.770
 stallions of america she is born 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:58.640
 2002 so now twelve years old just like that 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.640
 there are close to the end 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.840
 My father is not too big 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.840
 Tourists are very risky to ride 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:32.630
 the susi despite this top pedigree 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.920
 five-course descent 5 ghz long always only 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.410
 actually four-course so both sides 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.590
 we would fail is just 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.110
 because the americans are slow 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.450
 tempo tel called slow goes and 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.180
 fast tempo tel called rex two 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.180
 different gear types will be 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.600
 Of course they also know that the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.610
 the same football is indeed completely 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.690
 industry two gaits will 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.680
 the americans from the 5 gen 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.950
 he speaks then he means an eye he is 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.560
 neither rider actually a four- course 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.410
 so you can already see the sauce is 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.650
 right shot firmly so right 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.980
 is comfortable in the step therefore 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.739
 so for now hear me was the shiver 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.130
 community munich but for a beggar 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.900
 already extremely shot 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.730
 So let it go 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.290
 nevertheless always attentive and straight 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.360
 now that she is still a bit calmer 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.400
 has also become the beginning of the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.200
 Stepped up a bit more 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.459
 he was a bit small at the beginning 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.820
 and yes we have them here 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.150
 what exactly you have a few months 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.370
 First she tries to kill you 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.410
 For a month , they tried that 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.350
 has not really worked it 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.150
 not worked out not really that 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.480
 one still works with one completely 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.940
 I do not know much endurance 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.500
 believe rather no than yes we have up 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.489
 Either way with the owner 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:19.970
 let's say we leave her 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:21.980
 3 ghz distance drives is needed 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.010
 yes, easily with one hand too 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.860
 suffice 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.920
 rogans chamber normal movements 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.840
 so I just said no son center 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.140
 the typical kind with huge action 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.209
 Giant space handle but a whole 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:45.170
 normal to get that comfortable 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.849
 three-star leisure drives if you like that 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.959
 it's just a bit of a hand to do it 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.909
 just one hand just yet 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.480
 did and he with both hands 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:55.129
 then it is very easy for you too 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.959
 bit down to make them round 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.659
 she can be very nice house then 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:03.049
 drop and stretch forward 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.819
 downwards so for those who like one 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.510
 a bit more dressage work moderately 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:13.730
 would like that too is a very good one 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.699
 possibility had nice demonstrations 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.229
 to see that even rider keeps in the 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.900
 Location are driving forward 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:25.880
 riding is not the killer rider 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:30.500
 always so popular though in the last one 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.830
 year has become more and more often 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.260
 it has become a bit too much then 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.180
 sometime interview once said color 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.699
 as down on the direct way to 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.949
 Schwane is also a true fit 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.320
 but conversely you can see here wild 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.490
 come back to her when I get the 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.039
 take what trains 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.919
 The hand to keep it then I can 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.919
 Keep them in a good mood 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:04.729
 has a nice dressage suitability for 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.270
 someone who enjoys his horse 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:11.599
 even dressage moderately what can work 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.120
 to make it very difficult with her here 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:17.750
 leg completely clean of can here 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.840
 at the Trab here beautiful press 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.840
 to let 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.689
 So there you can definitely do a lot 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.090
 more 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:29.550
 In this way, rottenness is convenient too 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.259
 sit comfortably than some offenders that was 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.449
 do not testify 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:36.409
 So very comfortable he almost 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:46.400
 so to the job of the west 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:51.659
 as well as the gallop completely regulated 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:06:07.169
 very clean beautiful attitude always easy 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:06:11.580
 In the hand, listen well so agree 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:13.979
 pleasantly pleasant driving around 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:22.560
 frites learns with portrayed to 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:23.210
 fitness and visa as an offender should one 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.159
 to let 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:29.310
 very nice right as left to 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:31.800
 gallop attentive drives back there 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:36.500
 I'll see what happens next time 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:40.009
 there is look but clean makes her 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.009
 program continues 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:54.710
 and okay 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.800
 a beginner of a different kind
