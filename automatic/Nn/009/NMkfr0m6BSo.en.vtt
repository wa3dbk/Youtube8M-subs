00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
all this money it kind of makes sense to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.840

me that you would want you know a cover
for<00:00:47.180> it<00:00:47.329> that<00:00:47.450> it<00:00:47.540> should<00:00:47.720> be<00:00:47.809> included<00:00:48.079> so

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
for it that it should be included so

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.510 
for it that it should be included so
I've<00:00:48.739> always<00:00:48.890> kind<00:00:49.010> of<00:00:49.160> liked<00:00:49.340> that<00:00:49.370> about

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
I've always kind of liked that about

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.900 
I've always kind of liked that about
gigabyte<00:00:50.090> products<00:00:50.630> and<00:00:51.140> then<00:00:51.860> here<00:00:52.489> is<00:00:52.670> the

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
gigabyte products and then here is the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.400 
gigabyte products and then here is the
Ultrabook<00:00:53.390> but<00:00:53.600> let's<00:00:53.719> just<00:00:53.899> see<00:00:54.079> what<00:00:54.260> else

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
Ultrabook but let's just see what else

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.549 
Ultrabook but let's just see what else
is<00:00:54.559> underneath<00:00:54.950> here<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.399> start<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:56.840> we<00:00:56.989> have<00:00:57.260> a

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
is underneath here to start so we have a

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.540 
is underneath here to start so we have a
utilities<00:00:58.190> disc<00:00:58.520> and<00:00:58.940> a<00:00:59.090> user<00:00:59.329> user<00:00:59.840> manual<00:01:00.590> so

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
utilities disc and a user user manual so

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.859 
utilities disc and a user user manual so
let's<00:01:01.730> check<00:01:02.000> all<00:01:02.210> of<00:01:02.390> this<00:01:02.540> aside<00:01:04.509> and<00:01:05.509> take<00:01:05.840> a

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
let's check all of this aside and take a

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:13.310 
let's check all of this aside and take a
look<00:01:06.259> at<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.979> main<00:01:07.280> event<00:01:09.069> so<00:01:10.069> here<00:01:10.340> we<00:01:10.459> go

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.170 

so<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> gigabyte<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:16.550> two<00:01:17.550> four

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
so this is the gigabyte you two four

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.380 
so this is the gigabyte you two four
four<00:01:18.420> two<00:01:18.870> so<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.230> is<00:01:19.440> an<00:01:19.680> ultrabook

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
four two so this is an ultrabook

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.580 
four two so this is an ultrabook
if<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.570> take<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.780> quick<00:01:22.020> look<00:01:22.170> around<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
if we take a quick look around the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.180 
if we take a quick look around the
system<00:01:22.800> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.790> see<00:01:23.940> it<00:01:24.120> is<00:01:24.270> very<00:01:24.360> thin<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.740> we

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
system you can see it is very thin so we

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.030 
system you can see it is very thin so we
can<00:01:26.670> start<00:01:27.600> over<00:01:27.690> here<00:01:28.050> we<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.440> PSU

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
can start over here we have the PSU

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.590 
can start over here we have the PSU
there's<00:01:29.880> HDMI<00:01:30.480> two<00:01:30.810> USB<00:01:31.640> 3.0<00:01:32.640> s<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
there's HDMI two USB 3.0 s there's a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.100 
there's HDMI two USB 3.0 s there's a
card<00:01:34.350> reader<00:01:34.470> around<00:01:34.979> there<00:01:36.020> around<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
card reader around there around the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.300 
card reader around there around the
front<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.410> don't<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.710> much<00:01:37.860> else<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
front we don't have much else but a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.190 
front we don't have much else but a
couple<00:01:38.580> of<00:01:38.700> status<00:01:39.000> LEDs<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.870> bottom

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
couple of status LEDs and on the bottom

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.570 
couple of status LEDs and on the bottom
you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:40.830> are<00:01:40.860> two<00:01:41.250> panels

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
you can see that there are two panels

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.510 
you can see that there are two panels
one<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.870> memory<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.470> one<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.250> hard

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
one for the memory and one for the hard

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.650 
one for the memory and one for the hard
drive<00:01:44.580> or<00:01:44.970> SSD<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:47.030> around<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.180> side<00:01:48.450> we

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
drive or SSD and around this side we

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.370 
drive or SSD and around this side we
have<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.869> Kensington<00:01:49.170> lock<00:01:49.500> -<00:01:51.050> audio<00:01:52.050> and

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
have a Kensington lock - audio and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.160 
have a Kensington lock - audio and
microphone<00:01:52.560> two<00:01:53.250> USB<00:01:53.610> 2.0<00:01:54.210> at<00:01:54.450> full<00:01:54.690> size<00:01:54.780> VGA

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
and a full size Ethernet so this is a

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.090 
and a full size Ethernet so this is a
large<00:01:58.110> number<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.440> ports<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.369> an<00:01:59.700> ultrabook

more beautiful and it's actually more

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.660 
expensive at 13 hundred US dollars and
if<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.239> actually<00:02:51.540> just<00:02:51.690> turn<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:51.989> around<00:02:52.670> let's

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
if we actually just turn it around let's

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.630 
if we actually just turn it around let's
take<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.940> closer<00:02:54.930> look<00:02:55.110> here<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.340> can<00:02:56.459> see

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
take a closer look here so you can see

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.220 
take a closer look here so you can see
that<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.880> does<00:02:57.090> come<00:02:57.390> with<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:58.019> nice

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
that it does come with this nice

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.350 
that it does come with this nice
cleaning<00:02:58.560> cloth<00:02:58.950> which<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.760> again<00:03:00.180> one<00:03:00.330> of

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
cleaning cloth which is again one of

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.120 
cleaning cloth which is again one of
those<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.570> premium<00:03:01.260> gigabyte<00:03:02.720> offerings<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.680> if

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
those a premium gigabyte offerings so if

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.580 
those a premium gigabyte offerings so if
we<00:03:05.280> take<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.489> quick<00:03:05.670> look<00:03:06.000> at<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.570> keyboard<00:03:06.870> you

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
we take a quick look at the keyboard you

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.330 
we take a quick look at the keyboard you
can<00:03:07.620> see<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.130> this<00:03:08.280> 14<00:03:08.820> inch<00:03:10.340> keyboard

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
can see that that this 14 inch keyboard

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.699 
can see that that this 14 inch keyboard
is<00:03:11.459> full<00:03:11.700> size<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.450> has<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.780> slight<00:03:13.140> recession

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
is full size it has a slight recession

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.720 
is full size it has a slight recession
down<00:03:14.040> in<00:03:14.220> here<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:15.269> trackpad<00:03:15.799> actually<00:03:16.799> if<00:03:17.010> we

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
down in here the trackpad actually if we

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.430 
down in here the trackpad actually if we
can<00:03:17.910> just<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.450> just<00:03:18.600> kind<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.900> take<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.110> look<00:03:19.320> at

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
can just you just kind of take a look at

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.140 
can just you just kind of take a look at
it<00:03:19.560> there<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:19.950> can<00:03:20.100> kind<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.370> see<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.760> it's

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
it there you can kind of see it it's

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.949 
it there you can kind of see it it's
very<00:03:21.450> rough

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
very rough

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.809 
very rough
when<00:03:23.409> I<00:03:23.500> first<00:03:23.799> touched<00:03:24.010> it<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.310> was<00:03:24.340> actually<00:03:24.760> a

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
when I first touched it I was actually a

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.599 
when I first touched it I was actually a
little<00:03:24.969> bit<00:03:25.120> shocked<00:03:25.450> about<00:03:25.659> how<00:03:26.609> how

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
little bit shocked about how how

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.849 
little bit shocked about how how
textured<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.329> is<00:03:28.450> it's<00:03:28.659> all<00:03:28.810> over<00:03:29.109> the<00:03:29.230> top<00:03:29.500> but

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
textured it is it's all over the top but

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.520 
textured it is it's all over the top but
but<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.730> works<00:03:30.939> the<00:03:31.480> single<00:03:31.840> mouse<00:03:31.989> button<00:03:32.349> I'm

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
but it works the single mouse button I'm

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.170 
but it works the single mouse button I'm
not<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.739> big<00:03:32.950> fan<00:03:33.219> of<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:34.000> can<00:03:34.150> see<00:03:34.359> here<00:03:36.180> there

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
not a big fan of you can see here there

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.209 
not a big fan of you can see here there
then<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.540> finally<00:03:37.930> get<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.200> press<00:03:38.500> right<00:03:38.980> so

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:39.219 
then I finally get the press right so

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.129 
then I finally get the press right so
there's<00:03:39.400> there's<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.730> actually<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.510> very<00:03:40.870> large

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
there's there's a actually a very large

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.800 
there's there's a actually a very large
dead<00:03:41.500> space<00:03:41.859> on<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.670> scene<00:03:42.879> it<00:03:43.030> of<00:03:43.120> unusable

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
dead space on the scene it of unusable

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.759 
dead space on the scene it of unusable
button<00:03:44.109> that<00:03:44.290> I'm<00:03:44.409> not<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:45.310> thrilled<00:03:45.609> with

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
button that I'm not that thrilled with

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.860 
button that I'm not that thrilled with
typing<00:03:47.769> wise<00:03:48.069> I<00:03:48.489> have<00:03:49.269> spent<00:03:49.480> a<00:03:49.510> little<00:03:49.629> bit<00:03:49.750> of

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
typing wise I have spent a little bit of

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.839 
typing wise I have spent a little bit of
time<00:03:50.109> typing<00:03:50.409> on<00:03:50.530> this<00:03:50.650> why<00:03:50.769> don't<00:03:50.829> we<00:03:51.010> boot<00:03:51.700> it

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
time typing on this why don't we boot it

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.429 
time typing on this why don't we boot it
up<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.450> see<00:03:53.049> how<00:03:53.260> long<00:03:53.409> it<00:03:53.590> takes<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:54.069> turn<00:03:54.519> on

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
up and see how long it takes to turn on

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:16.420 
up and see how long it takes to turn on
so<00:03:56.439> there<00:03:56.709> we<00:03:56.859> go

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.569 

pretty<00:04:17.430> quick<00:04:18.019> all<00:04:19.019> right<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:19.680> now<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.250> have

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
pretty quick all right so now I have

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.700 
pretty quick all right so now I have
been<00:04:20.760> playing<00:04:21.000> around<00:04:21.150> with<00:04:21.450> this<00:04:22.350> unit

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
been playing around with this unit

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.690 
been playing around with this unit
previously<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:25.620> have<00:04:26.070> found<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.490> the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
previously and I have found that the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.000 
previously and I have found that the
keyboard<00:04:27.030> is<00:04:27.210> generally<00:04:27.780> pretty<00:04:27.990> good<00:04:28.139> but<00:04:28.889> if

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
keyboard is generally pretty good but if

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.800 
keyboard is generally pretty good but if
we<00:04:29.160> kind<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.580> go<00:04:30.150> in<00:04:30.360> close<00:04:30.720> here<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.380> can<00:04:32.010> see

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
we kind of go in close here you can see

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.440 
we kind of go in close here you can see
that<00:04:33.810> there<00:04:33.960> is<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.139> fair<00:04:34.680> amount<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:35.190> flex<00:04:35.790> they

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
that there is a fair amount of flex they

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.640 
that there is a fair amount of flex they
keep<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:36.840> wouldn't<00:04:37.080> call<00:04:37.260> this<00:04:37.410> keyboard

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
keep I wouldn't call this keyboard

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.100 
keep I wouldn't call this keyboard
bouncy<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:38.700> if<00:04:38.940> you're<00:04:39.450> looking<00:04:39.780> for

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110
