00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
and let's make an effort on this one

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.670 
and let's make an effort on this one
species<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:55.060> so<00:04:56.060> last<00:04:56.750> time<00:04:56.930> we<00:04:57.050> found<00:04:57.229> Eagle

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
species and so last time we found Eagle

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.650 
species and so last time we found Eagle
down<00:04:57.910> underneath<00:04:58.910> this<00:04:59.060> tree<00:04:59.500> it's<00:05:00.500> like<00:05:00.680> whoa

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
down underneath this tree it's like whoa

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.510 
down underneath this tree it's like whoa
and<00:05:02.660> this<00:05:03.290> is<00:05:03.440> you<00:05:03.710> know<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:03.950> way<00:05:04.250> I<00:05:04.280> see

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
and this is you know the way I see

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.779 
and this is you know the way I see
Paul's<00:05:04.790> approach<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.520> me<00:05:07.640> as<00:05:07.760> a

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
Paul's approach and and to me as a

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.450 
Paul's approach and and to me as a
scientist<00:05:08.210> it's<00:05:08.419> also<00:05:08.600> kind<00:05:09.470> of<00:05:09.560> kind<00:05:10.130> of<00:05:10.220> hard

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
scientist it's also kind of kind of hard

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.820 
scientist it's also kind of kind of hard
to<00:05:10.580> put<00:05:10.729> that<00:05:10.760> much<00:05:11.090> faith<00:05:11.570> in<00:05:11.870> in<00:05:12.140> one<00:05:12.380> Avenue

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
to put that much faith in in one Avenue

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.540 
to put that much faith in in one Avenue
but<00:05:13.220> I<00:05:14.140> feel<00:05:15.140> better<00:05:15.320> doing<00:05:16.160> this<00:05:16.340> with

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
but I feel better doing this with

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.370 
but I feel better doing this with
someone<00:05:16.820> like<00:05:16.970> Paul<00:05:17.240> who's<00:05:17.690> worked<00:05:18.050> around

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
someone like Paul who's worked around

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.320 
someone like Paul who's worked around
these<00:05:18.560> organisms<00:05:18.950> for<00:05:19.430> for<00:05:19.789> his<00:05:19.880> whole<00:05:20.060> life

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
these organisms for for his whole life

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.110 
these organisms for for his whole life
and<00:05:20.960> so<00:05:21.560> if<00:05:21.830> he<00:05:21.860> has<00:05:22.250> an<00:05:22.430> intuitive<00:05:22.729> feeling

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
and so if he has an intuitive feeling

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.110 
and so if he has an intuitive feeling
that<00:05:23.300> this<00:05:23.539> one<00:05:23.750> is<00:05:23.900> really<00:05:24.050> special<00:05:25.090> then<00:05:26.090> you

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
that this one is really special then you

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.719 
that this one is really special then you
know<00:05:26.419> I'm<00:05:26.570> going<00:05:26.810> with<00:05:26.960> him<00:05:27.080> on<00:05:27.229> this

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
know I'm going with him on this

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.329 
know I'm going with him on this
I'm<00:05:29.689> really<00:05:29.870> happy<00:05:30.199> with<00:05:30.379> how<00:05:30.650> stable<00:05:30.979> this<00:05:31.219> is

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:31.339 
I'm really happy with how stable this is

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:37.089 
I'm really happy with how stable this is
the<00:05:31.520> question<00:05:31.699> is<00:05:32.620> how<00:05:33.639> much<00:05:34.639> I<00:05:34.789> can<00:05:34.849> reach<00:05:36.099> I'm

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
the question is how much I can reach I'm

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:38.589 
the question is how much I can reach I'm
gonna<00:05:37.339> try<00:05:37.580> to<00:05:37.610> look<00:05:37.909> for<00:05:37.939> that<00:05:38.150> see<00:05:38.449> this

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
gonna try to look for that see this

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.010 
gonna try to look for that see this
little<00:05:38.749> cleft<00:05:39.529> right<00:05:39.770> here<00:05:40.009> I<00:05:40.719> could<00:05:41.719> take

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
little cleft right here I could take

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.350 
little cleft right here I could take
that<00:05:42.169> section<00:05:42.559> out<00:05:42.740> and<00:05:43.039> it's<00:05:43.969> touching<00:05:44.150> the

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
that section out and it's touching the

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.059 
that section out and it's touching the
wood<00:05:44.629> so<00:05:44.870> it's<00:05:45.050> likely<00:05:45.229> to<00:05:45.379> be<00:05:45.589> alive<00:05:45.830> right

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:46.069 
wood so it's likely to be alive right

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:48.040 
wood so it's likely to be alive right
they're<00:05:46.339> coming

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
they're coming

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.219 
they're coming
this<00:05:48.979> one's<00:05:49.189> really<00:05:49.460> unusual<00:05:49.669> because<00:05:50.360> it<00:05:50.960> is

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
this one's really unusual because it is

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.679 
this one's really unusual because it is
white<00:05:51.589> but<00:05:52.069> there's<00:05:52.249> a<00:05:52.309> living<00:05:53.180> membrane

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:53.689 
white but there's a living membrane

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:55.989 
white but there's a living membrane
underneath<00:05:54.229> and<00:05:54.740> from<00:05:55.069> that<00:05:55.189> living<00:05:55.550> membrane

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:55.999 
underneath and from that living membrane

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:58.269 
underneath and from that living membrane
I<00:05:56.270> hope<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:57.139> put<00:05:57.589> a<00:05:57.620> little<00:05:57.800> piece<00:05:57.979> of<00:05:58.129> tissue

00:05:58.269 --> 00:05:58.279 
I hope to put a little piece of tissue

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:01.059 
I hope to put a little piece of tissue
in<00:05:58.639> these<00:05:58.759> tubes<00:05:59.509> will<00:05:59.930> leave<00:06:00.650> the<00:06:00.800> conch

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
in these tubes will leave the conch

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.909 
in these tubes will leave the conch
there<00:06:01.639> in<00:06:01.909> the<00:06:02.449> wild<00:06:02.839> and<00:06:03.050> by<00:06:03.620> getting<00:06:03.889> a

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
there in the wild and by getting a

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.230 
there in the wild and by getting a
little<00:06:04.099> piece<00:06:04.219> of<00:06:04.249> tissue<00:06:04.520> I<00:06:04.729> can<00:06:04.999> take<00:06:05.149> it

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
little piece of tissue I can take it

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.969 
little piece of tissue I can take it
back<00:06:05.300> to<00:06:05.449> the<00:06:05.509> laboratory<00:06:05.659> and<00:06:06.319> then<00:06:06.649> we<00:06:06.830> can

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
back to the laboratory and then we can

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.329 
back to the laboratory and then we can
grow<00:06:07.159> it<00:06:07.309> out<00:06:08.469> okay<00:06:09.469> there<00:06:10.039> you<00:06:10.069> go

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:10.339 
grow it out okay there you go

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:17.019 
grow it out okay there you go
Oh<00:06:15.819> fantastic

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:17.029 
Oh fantastic

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:21.610 
Oh fantastic

go team that's all we need who knows

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.189 
go team that's all we need who knows
maybe<00:06:22.039> this<00:06:22.219> is<00:06:22.370> a<00:06:22.399> strain<00:06:22.759> that<00:06:22.969> will<00:06:23.199> cure

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
maybe this is a strain that will cure

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.889 
maybe this is a strain that will cure
tuberculosis<00:06:24.409> right<00:06:25.219> this<00:06:25.490> could<00:06:25.669> be<00:06:25.899> maybe

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:26.899 
tuberculosis right this could be maybe

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:29.619 
tuberculosis right this could be maybe
millions<00:06:27.469> of<00:06:27.589> lives<00:06:27.860> are<00:06:28.279> really<00:06:29.029> at<00:06:29.240> this

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629 
millions of lives are really at this

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.339 
millions of lives are really at this
