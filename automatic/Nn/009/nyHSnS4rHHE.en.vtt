00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
back well i will go back to the main

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.539 
back well i will go back to the main
menu<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.689> show<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:59.149> race

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.850 

alright<00:02:05.869> so<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.200> see<00:02:07.350> there's<00:02:07.530> different

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
there's four tracks in each area so

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:24.890 
there's four tracks in each area so
we'll<00:02:14.760> just<00:02:16.280> take<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.459> right<00:02:17.580> here<00:02:23.750> alright<00:02:24.750> so

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
we'll just take it right here alright so

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.930 
we'll just take it right here alright so
