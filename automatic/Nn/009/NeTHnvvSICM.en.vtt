pack review this texture pack is gonna
be<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.690> realistic<00:00:07.259> texture<00:00:07.529> pack<00:00:08.059> because<00:00:09.059> I

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
be a realistic texture pack because I

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.100 
be a realistic texture pack because I
know<00:00:09.269> there's<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> lot<00:00:09.570> people<00:00:09.719> out<00:00:09.809> there<00:00:10.019> who

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
genuinely like the way texture packs

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.270 
genuinely like the way texture packs
look<00:00:12.840> while<00:00:13.500> they're<00:00:13.620> genuine<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.040> don't<00:00:14.160> know

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280

why I'm showing you this because this is

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.599 
why I'm showing you this because this is
not<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.900> texture<00:00:16.230> pack<00:00:16.440> let's<00:00:17.160> go<00:00:17.250> ahead<00:00:17.430> and

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
not the texture pack let's go ahead and

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.920 
not the texture pack let's go ahead and
install<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.270> texture<00:00:18.750> pack<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:21.689> it's<00:00:21.840> gonna

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
install that texture pack and it's gonna

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.960 
install that texture pack and it's gonna
be<00:00:22.109> our<00:00:22.320> 3d<00:00:22.740> craft<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> 64<00:00:23.850> by<00:00:23.939> 64

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
be our 3d craft it's the 64 by 64

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.750 
be our 3d craft it's the 64 by 64
version<00:00:24.510> at<00:00:25.289> 85<00:00:25.680> percent<00:00:26.010> completion<00:00:26.279> there's

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
version at 85 percent completion there's

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.040 
version at 85 percent completion there's
a<00:00:26.820> few<00:00:27.029> things<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.449> think<00:00:27.480> are<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:27.810> done

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
a few things that I think are not done

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.990 
a few things that I think are not done
but<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.710> don't<00:00:28.769> think<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:29.550> noticed<00:00:29.880> that

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
but I don't think we really noticed that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.150 
but I don't think we really noticed that
right<00:00:30.150> now<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.750> let's<00:00:31.289> go<00:00:31.380> ahead<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.650> check

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
right now so let's go ahead and check

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.190 
right now so let's go ahead and check
out<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.309> blocks<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.940> then<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.930> different

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
out the blocks and then the different

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.639 
out the blocks and then the different
items<00:00:35.540> rather<00:00:36.540> bad<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.079> doesn't<00:00:37.530> look<00:00:37.620> much

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
items rather bad it doesn't look much

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.819 
items rather bad it doesn't look much
different<00:00:38.360> from<00:00:39.360> default<00:00:39.840> which<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.590> not

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
different from default which is not

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.350 
different from default which is not
supposed<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.340> called<00:00:41.520> default<00:00:41.850> realism

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
supposed to is called default realism

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.130 
supposed to is called default realism
dirt<00:00:44.180> it's<00:00:45.180> called<00:00:45.360> default<00:00:45.570> realism<00:00:46.020> because

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
dirt it's called default realism because

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.389 
dirt it's called default realism because
it's<00:00:46.410> supposed<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.680> looks<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.010> default

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
it's supposed to be looks like default

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.139 
it's supposed to be looks like default
but<00:00:47.850> no<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> lot<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:49.430> lot<00:00:50.430> more<00:00:50.579> realistic<00:00:50.879> manner

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
but no a lot a lot more realistic manner

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.049 
but no a lot a lot more realistic manner
unless<00:00:51.539> pixelation<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.320> think<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.850> looks

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
unless pixelation I think and this looks

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:54.470 
unless pixelation I think and this looks
nice

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
nice

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.330 
nice
I'm<00:00:54.780> not<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> fan<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> emerald<00:00:55.590> book<00:00:55.739> I'm

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
I'm not a fan of the emerald book I'm

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.170 
I'm not a fan of the emerald book I'm
gonna<00:00:56.489> found<00:00:56.699> am<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.030> look<00:00:57.180> period<00:00:58.789> Thor<00:00:59.789> that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
gonna found am I look period Thor that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.789 
gonna found am I look period Thor that
is<00:01:02.090> it's<00:01:03.090> pretty<00:01:03.570> much<00:01:03.690> default<00:01:04.350> text<00:01:04.589> back

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
is it's pretty much default text back

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.140 
is it's pretty much default text back
with<00:01:05.010> some<00:01:05.189> some<00:01:06.180> pretty<00:01:06.360> nice<00:01:07.820> paint<00:01:08.820> singing

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
with some some pretty nice paint singing

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
with some some pretty nice paint singing
guff<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.479> guess<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.080> very<00:01:10.260> high<00:01:10.439> quality

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
guff I guess it's a very high quality

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.580 
guff I guess it's a very high quality
version<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> default<00:01:11.909> textures<00:01:12.510> which<00:01:13.439> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
version of the default textures which is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.200 
version of the default textures which is
not<00:01:13.740> uncommon<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.460> see<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.150> this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
not uncommon to see but I think this

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.820 
not uncommon to see but I think this
this<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> set<00:01:15.960> Rebecca<00:01:16.200> does<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> great<00:01:16.590> job<00:01:16.650> of

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
this the set Rebecca does a great job of

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.100 
this the set Rebecca does a great job of
it<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.970> mentioned<00:01:18.479> earlier<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.869> don't

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
it now I mentioned earlier that I don't

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.050 
it now I mentioned earlier that I don't
like<00:01:19.350> default<00:01:19.979> texture<00:01:20.250> packs<00:01:20.520> or<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.880> mean

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
like default texture packs or I mean

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.850 
like default texture packs or I mean
more<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.299> guess<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.810> dislike<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> default

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
more I guess I dislike the default

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.530 
more I guess I dislike the default
texture<00:01:23.040> pack<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.640> also<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.450> like

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
texture pack but I also just like

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.690 
texture pack but I also just like
realistic<00:01:25.080> texture<00:01:25.320> packs<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:26.400> cuz<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> don't

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
realistic texture packs just cuz I don't

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.649 
realistic texture packs just cuz I don't
think<00:01:26.850> that's<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.119> spirit<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> game

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
think that's in the spirit of the game

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.210 
think that's in the spirit of the game
but<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.409> texture<00:01:28.710> pack<00:01:28.740> students<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
but this texture pack students have a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
but this texture pack students have a
happy<00:01:29.430> medium<00:01:29.820> between

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.580 

default<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.570> realistic<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:36.590> that

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
default and realistic that I like that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.429 
default and realistic that I like that
it<00:01:37.710> makes<00:01:37.829> sense<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.250> only<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:39.439> let's

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
it makes sense not only here but let's

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.649 
it makes sense not only here but let's
go<00:01:40.530> ahead<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> check<00:01:40.890> out<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.310> items<00:01:44.659> buying

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
go ahead and check out the items buying

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.109 
go ahead and check out the items buying
materials<00:01:46.110> right<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.939> they<00:01:47.939> might

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
materials right now and they might

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.749 
materials right now and they might
default<00:01:48.390> materials<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.930> me<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.740> GUI<00:01:50.369> system

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
default materials to me the GUI system

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.240 
default materials to me the GUI system
on<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.299> crazy<00:01:51.930> messed<00:01:52.320> up<00:01:52.530> don't<00:01:53.100> pay

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
on here is crazy messed up don't pay

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.819 
on here is crazy messed up don't pay
attention<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.700> that'll<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.750> fixed<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.290> this
