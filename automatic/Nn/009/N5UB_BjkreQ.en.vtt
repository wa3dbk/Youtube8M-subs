if<00:00:04.210> you<00:00:04.390> target<00:00:04.630> the<00:00:04.810> roots<00:00:05.109> of<00:00:05.230> the<00:00:05.350> cords

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:05.710 
if you target the roots of the cords

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.049 
if you target the roots of the cords
that's<00:00:05.890> a<00:00:05.979> great<00:00:06.220> way<00:00:06.370> just<00:00:06.550> to<00:00:06.640> get<00:00:06.760> started

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:07.059 
that's a great way just to get started

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:09.180 
that's a great way just to get started
because<00:00:07.269> you<00:00:07.450> can't<00:00:07.660> go<00:00:07.779> wrong<00:00:07.809> with<00:00:08.139> that<00:00:08.290> now

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190 
because you can't go wrong with that now

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
because you can't go wrong with that now
I'm<00:00:09.280> going<00:00:09.400> to<00:00:09.490> take<00:00:09.550> that<00:00:09.610> a<00:00:09.820> minor

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.210 
I'm going to take that a minor

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.209 
I'm going to take that a minor
pentatonic<00:00:10.540> scale<00:00:11.049> and<00:00:11.200> examine<00:00:11.740> what<00:00:11.950> I<00:00:11.980> have

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:12.219 
pentatonic scale and examine what I have

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.919 
pentatonic scale and examine what I have
available<00:00:12.339> as<00:00:12.759> far<00:00:12.999> as<00:00:13.120> roots<00:00:13.389> of<00:00:13.570> this<00:00:13.660> chord

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929 
available as far as roots of this chord

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.670 
available as far as roots of this chord
progression<00:00:14.440> I<00:00:14.650> don't<00:00:15.610> have<00:00:15.820> an<00:00:15.940> F<00:00:16.180> in<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:17.650> a

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
progression I don't have an F in the a

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.830 
progression I don't have an F in the a
minor<00:00:18.010> pentatonic<00:00:18.340> scale<00:00:18.850> so<00:00:19.570> we're<00:00:19.660> going<00:00:19.720> to

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
minor pentatonic scale so we're going to

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.790 
minor pentatonic scale so we're going to
leave<00:00:19.990> that<00:00:20.020> out<00:00:20.380> but<00:00:21.010> I<00:00:21.070> have<00:00:21.400> 2<00:00:21.730> g's<00:00:22.620> 3<00:00:23.620> a's

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
leave that out but I have 2 g's 3 a's

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.750 
leave that out but I have 2 g's 3 a's
two<00:00:24.420> DS<00:00:25.420> and<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.830> takes<00:00:27.100> care<00:00:27.310> of<00:00:27.370> all<00:00:27.610> the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
two DS and that takes care of all the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
now i use the a minor pentatonic scale

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.130 
now i use the a minor pentatonic scale
I'm<00:00:56.230> bail<00:00:56.469> out<00:00:56.649> on<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.859> F<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.249> then

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.800 

leave<00:01:03.130> it<00:01:03.250> on<00:01:03.370> yet<00:01:04.050> d<00:01:05.050> minor

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.219 
she back today
what<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:12.670> did<00:01:12.909> just<00:01:12.939> built<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.630> skeletal

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
what I did just built a skeletal

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.530 
what I did just built a skeletal
framework<00:01:14.560> established<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:16.060> roots<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.450> the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
framework established the roots of the

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.149 
framework established the roots of the
prevailing<00:01:17.020> court<00:01:17.290> each<00:01:17.439> time<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.860> court

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
prevailing court each time the court

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.190 
prevailing court each time the court
changed<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:18.790> then<00:01:19.420> what<00:01:19.540> we<00:01:19.630> can<00:01:19.780> do<00:01:19.930> is<00:01:20.049> just

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
changed and then what we can do is just

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.100 
changed and then what we can do is just
add<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.619> f<00:01:20.770> note<00:01:21.100> in<00:01:21.280> there<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.780> see<00:01:22.990> with

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
add the f note in there you see with

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.499 
add the f note in there you see with
those<00:01:23.229> f's<00:01:23.439> are<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:24.729> right<00:01:24.909> inside<00:01:25.149> your<00:01:25.299> C

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
those f's are they right inside your C

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.570 
those f's are they right inside your C
scale<00:01:25.780> now<00:01:26.290> would<00:01:26.500> suggest<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:27.009> do<00:01:27.190> that<00:01:27.399> and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
scale now would suggest you do that and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.700 
scale now would suggest you do that and
as<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:27.850> do<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:28.030> envision<00:01:28.690> both<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.229> a<00:01:29.259> minor

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
as you do that envision both the a minor

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.480 
as you do that envision both the a minor
pentatonic<00:01:30.100> scale<00:01:34.020> okay<00:01:35.020> now<00:01:35.530> each<00:01:35.770> chord<00:01:36.280> is

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
pentatonic scale okay now each chord is

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.850 
pentatonic scale okay now each chord is
going<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.880> have<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.060> root<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:38.110> included<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.710> f

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
going to have a root you included the f

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.039 
going to have a root you included the f
you<00:01:39.369> could<00:01:39.549> solo<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.090> use<00:01:40.210> just<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.630> minor

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
you could solo and use just the a minor

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.559 
you could solo and use just the a minor
pentatonic<00:01:41.409> scale<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.250> then<00:01:42.970> on<00:01:43.270> the

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
pentatonic scale and then on the

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.570 
pentatonic scale and then on the
measures<00:01:43.960> measures<00:01:44.319> one<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:45.009> four<00:01:45.310> where<00:01:45.490> you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
measures measures one and four where you

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.490 
measures measures one and four where you
have<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.759> F<00:01:45.909> chord<00:01:46.330> you<00:01:46.720> can<00:01:46.869> use<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.170> minor

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
have the F chord you can use the a minor

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.529 
have the F chord you can use the a minor
pentatonic<00:01:47.860> but<00:01:48.280> target<00:01:48.640> this<00:01:48.759> f<00:01:48.970> load<00:01:49.299> add

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
pentatonic but target this f load add

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.749 
pentatonic but target this f load add
that<00:01:49.840> in<00:01:49.960> there<00:01:49.990> as<00:01:50.319> your<00:01:50.500> route<00:01:50.710> I<00:01:50.950> suggest

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
that in there as your route I suggest

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.700 
that in there as your route I suggest
you<00:01:51.819> practice<00:01:52.030> sewing<00:01:52.539> that<00:01:52.690> way<00:01:52.840> but<00:01:53.560> then

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
you practice sewing that way but then

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.169 
you practice sewing that way but then
you<00:01:53.830> say<00:01:54.009> when<00:01:54.159> I<00:01:54.190> wait<00:01:54.429> a<00:01:54.490> minute<00:01:54.729> I've<00:01:55.119> got

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
you say when I wait a minute I've got

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.910 
you say when I wait a minute I've got
this<00:01:55.420> big<00:01:55.630> aitbaar<00:01:56.020> progression<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.770> it

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
this big aitbaar progression and it

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.710 
this big aitbaar progression and it
seems<00:01:57.190> like<00:01:57.310> I'm<00:01:57.819> wrestling<00:01:58.330> just<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.539> try<00:01:58.690> to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
seems like I'm wrestling just to try to

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.260 
seems like I'm wrestling just to try to
keep<00:01:58.840> up<00:01:59.080> with<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.350> changes<00:02:00.179> what<00:02:01.179> we're

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
keep up with the changes what we're

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.880 
keep up with the changes what we're
going<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.479> do<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.750> break<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.229> down<00:02:02.500> there<00:02:02.799> are

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
going to do is break this down there are

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.219 
going to do is break this down there are
actually<00:02:03.340> five<00:02:03.670> chord<00:02:04.240> connections<00:02:04.840> in<00:02:04.990> this

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.310 
be a minor to F as going to be on the
loops<00:02:42.090> then<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.239> measures<00:02:43.540> four<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:43.900> five<00:02:44.109> you

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
loops then it measures four and five you

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.199 
loops then it measures four and five you
have<00:02:44.500> F<00:02:44.709> D<00:02:45.250> minor<00:02:47.400> measures<00:02:48.400> five<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.850> six<00:02:49.090> you

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
have F D minor measures five and six you

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.009 
have F D minor measures five and six you
have<00:02:49.390> D<00:02:49.660> minor<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.109> G<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:52.180> measure<00:02:52.420> 7<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:52.959> 8

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
have D minor to G then measure 7 and 8

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.510 
have D minor to G then measure 7 and 8
or<00:02:53.170> just<00:02:53.320> a<00:02:53.440> minor

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
or just a minor

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.470 
or just a minor
so<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.580> way<00:02:56.700> I'm<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:56.940> establish<00:02:57.360> this

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
so the way I'm going to establish this

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.559 
so the way I'm going to establish this
lesson<00:02:57.870> will<00:02:57.990> take<00:02:58.200> each<00:02:58.470> pair<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.069> cords<00:02:59.640> get

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
lesson will take each pair of cords get

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.420 
lesson will take each pair of cords get
through<00:03:00.810> four<00:03:01.110> bars<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.709> work<00:03:01.890> on<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.190> first

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
through four bars and work on the first

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.100 
through four bars and work on the first
four<00:03:02.670> bars<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> progression<00:03:03.569> then<00:03:03.959> we'll

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
four bars of the progression then we'll

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.559 
four bars of the progression then we'll
take<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.349> next<00:03:04.709> pairs<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.489> cords<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:06.060> then

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
take the next pairs of cords and then

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.300 
take the next pairs of cords and then
finally<00:03:06.930> establish<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.530> entire<00:03:07.830> aitbaar

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
finally establish the entire aitbaar

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.880 
finally establish the entire aitbaar
progression
