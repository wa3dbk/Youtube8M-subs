 first leader of the Rioja like today his new Black Ops are coming with 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.150
 the i 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.369
 and while a fast game in progress new idea bounces the whole 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.539
 Here take where the game with the Cayenne get up 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.789
 a sexy gold clue 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.770
 and Master Inter dared I do not think the kids even on the map for sure 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.160
 Augur is not that interesting and important 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.400
 to use as a tool I believe iconic vest 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.460
 Think i'd college more everything on red 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.890
 Percent as an expression uses the Tom place or the or the Domorgel provided 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.910
 and then loaded 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.200
 Percent, she goes though course without on the a8 of the Blackberry 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.880
 and this time on the new Engine for Canada I did not do it as usual 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.270
 the dogs so we let natural millions of the containers was Kerner 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.530
 Obama before the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.530
 I have that last day 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
 almost forgot to change tariff itself not so important 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.549
 I've shaken some topics that I would like to see that's what it was 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.780
 First, the project spokesman announced the events that I did 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.390
 on 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.010
 we want to do it 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.430
 As a matter of fact, for branch release the CC for the PC has been lost 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.430
 he does not notice for the PC for the consoles 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.289
 and percent 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.990
 that is really important to me I think 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.540
 because I had this perfect on a PK often evenings Saturday so what 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.540
 she will get well but have time in black box 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.630
 and I have and now we are the Famous nobility that was still possible 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.829
 at half past eight the woman from misery mid 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.300
 also and so I meant 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.280
 Percent billions we can make a ghetto out of it who meant okay 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.660
 Great thing 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.510
 shall mean I have now a 2 of FC St 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.640
 but an iron friend is given as he had me 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.360
 and the other if I now here in the tube I'll get to it 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.249
 do some repetitive 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.979
 Indian age clarifies value 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:19.609
 you work there is how long it goes where 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:21.999
 Perr 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.209
 that also has the best price 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.180
 then I would like to talk to one with two percent and that at the 4 some 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.409
 Do you want more of the end two Degus should make 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.409
 and i have to say that year because i do too 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.969
 so traveling keeps this leak out of the record is one of the Dr 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.999
 Ultimately, this is not the promises but in the near future 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.789
 more he is with two children so look closely at this commemoration 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.979
 however, Merck has come up with 2 MS 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.410
 and also Theo the 44 5 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.340
 but it was predominantly fir d'Ã©ischt 6 1 m with 2 that currently having 4 percent of this 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.389
 kept more fun 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.959
 Per cent it's my question what more likely to have seen the beds smothered him 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:03.769
 creates 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.389
 maybe one or two Nugent Lalo will see him unusually 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.429
 best reflected in the comments 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:16.209
 if he wanted to go see next m from m with 2 million then wanted to look similar 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.259
 Daum still topped 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:22.639
 Dan Pearlman tides the player quickly times 1 or 5 poses himself 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.619
 certainly not longer than two 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.889
 In any case, I would say something that was so of me 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.249
 and 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.760
 yes also affected on the weekend is the section that was then St 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.259
 but the predicate really praises Rauter says one to the next time
