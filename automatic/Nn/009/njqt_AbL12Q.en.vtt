 what's the reason why me it's good 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.600
 I think of the next competitions 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.500
 and suddenly I realize that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.500
 I always accelerate 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.660
 I run because I like it I like me 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.660

 make me a philosophy of opinion of 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:04.440
 crying my sorrows my sorrows but I 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:06.360
 see as low first because running 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.660
 for me it's really synonymous with 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.660
 freedom 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.120
 pleasure on the day of the competition and 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.530
 sometimes it's suffering is 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.690
 during training but there are 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.690
 always a goal of pleasure 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:30.580
 hu is possible until it's true 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:35.700
 cover up to 80 years and more clean to 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.700
 Truyen 90 years running 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.020
 my dream is to be able to run without 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.540
 limit 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.540
 all day without fatigue 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.540
 gold continues to run long as 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.979
 that leaves me all the same when we 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:16.100
 hurts you are frustrated you have to 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:18.400
 inspire by Quebec championships 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.400

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.570

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.570
 Olympic on this guy 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.700

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.900

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.040

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.890
