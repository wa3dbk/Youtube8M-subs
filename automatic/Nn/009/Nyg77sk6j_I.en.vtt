you install these your Island Park
rivals<00:02:59.010> will<00:02:59.430> be<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.819> same<00:03:00.060> you'll<00:03:00.930> just<00:03:01.139> have

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
rivals will be the same you'll just have

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.410 
rivals will be the same you'll just have
to<00:03:01.440> subtract<00:03:01.889> a<00:03:02.220> percent<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:02.910> every<00:03:03.150> pound

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
to subtract a percent for every pound

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.960

through<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.410> math<00:03:04.620> transfer<00:03:05.220> function<00:03:05.790> and

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
through the math transfer function and

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.460 
through the math transfer function and
white<00:03:06.630> oak<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.940> we<00:03:08.940> increase<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.450> 14<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:09.989> think

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
white oak so we increase it 14 I think

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.170 
white oak so we increase it 14 I think
the<00:03:10.590> number<00:03:10.889> on<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.160> was<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.370> reduced<00:03:11.940> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the number on this was I reduced the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.390 
the number on this was I reduced the
count<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.630> 12<00:03:12.930> 12<00:03:13.230> percent<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:13.950> was<00:03:14.069> writing<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
count to 12 12 percent I was writing the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.759 
count to 12 12 percent I was writing the
ballpark<00:03:17.810> hey<00:03:18.810> that's<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:22.290> times<00:03:22.560> that

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
ballpark hey that's it that times that

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.610 
ballpark hey that's it that times that
it<00:03:22.980> yeah<00:03:23.730> let's<00:03:23.880> make<00:03:24.060> him<00:03:24.180> run<00:03:24.299> Bob<00:03:24.510> all<00:03:25.470> right

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
it yeah let's make him run Bob all right

00:03:25.620 --> 00:04:55.280 
it yeah let's make him run Bob all right
start

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:04.510 

let's<00:04:56.290> see<00:04:56.440> what<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:56.650> did
