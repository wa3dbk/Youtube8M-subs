and people appreciate that we were

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.159 
and people appreciate that we were
trying<00:00:10.969> to<00:00:11.120> do<00:00:11.240> and<00:00:11.419> I<00:00:11.480> think<00:00:11.539> that<00:00:11.660> this<00:00:11.870> part

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:12.169 
trying to do and I think that this part

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.279 
trying to do and I think that this part
of<00:00:12.320> the<00:00:12.999> of<00:00:13.999> the<00:00:14.509> game<00:00:14.690> I<00:00:14.839> would<00:00:14.929> not<00:00:15.079> say<00:00:15.169> the

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
of the of the game I would not say the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.130 
of the of the game I would not say the
game<00:00:15.440> is<00:00:15.469> for<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:16.250> family<00:00:16.610> than<00:00:16.789> in<00:00:17.660> place<00:00:17.900> I

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
game is for the family than in place I

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.490 
game is for the family than in place I
think<00:00:18.890> that<00:00:18.980> they<00:00:19.070> have<00:00:19.220> changed<00:00:20.380> after<00:00:21.380> the

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
think that they have changed after the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.950 
think that they have changed after the
middle<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:21.890> a<00:00:22.220> press<00:00:22.730> conference<00:00:22.940> you<00:00:23.780> could

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
middle of a press conference you could

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.150 
middle of a press conference you could
see<00:00:24.170> a<00:00:24.410> lot<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:25.570> more<00:00:26.570> support<00:00:27.410> for<00:00:27.860> the<00:00:27.980> team

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
see a lot of more support for the team

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.019 
see a lot of more support for the team
we<00:00:28.850> were<00:00:28.880> winning<00:00:29.120> home<00:00:29.450> before<00:00:30.140> was<00:00:30.470> away<00:00:31.280> and

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
we were winning home before was away and

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.639 
we were winning home before was away and
after<00:00:32.329> in<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.750> end<00:00:32.870> we<00:00:32.989> were<00:00:33.140> keeping<00:00:33.559> the

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
after in the end we were keeping the

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.680 
after in the end we were keeping the
balance<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:34.160> we<00:00:34.399> at<00:00:34.789> home<00:00:34.850> away<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:35.570> I

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
balance and we at home away and I

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.530 
balance and we at home away and I
thought<00:00:35.870> you<00:00:36.350> could<00:00:36.590> feel<00:00:37.030> more<00:00:38.030> support<00:00:38.390> for

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
thought you could feel more support for

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.260 
thought you could feel more support for
the<00:00:38.630> team<00:00:38.780> no<00:00:39.530> I<00:00:39.560> think<00:00:39.680> has<00:00:39.950> been<00:00:40.100> a<00:00:40.270> great

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
the team no I think has been a great

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.050 
the team no I think has been a great
experience<00:00:41.390> because<00:00:42.070> we<00:00:43.070> take<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.310> team<00:00:43.850> that

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
experience because we take a team that

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.729 
experience because we take a team that
was<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.239> team<00:00:44.870> in<00:00:44.900> transition<00:00:45.079> with<00:00:45.470> young

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
was a team in transition with young

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.110 
was a team in transition with young
players<00:00:46.570> we<00:00:47.570> have<00:00:47.720> seen<00:00:47.899> said<00:00:48.770> before<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:49.970> now

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
players we have seen said before and now

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.810 
players we have seen said before and now
we<00:00:50.180> have<00:00:50.600> letter<00:00:50.840> left<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.530> good<00:00:52.040> team<00:00:52.220> with<00:00:52.670> no

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
we have letter left a good team with no

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.479 
we have letter left a good team with no
experience<00:00:53.120> or<00:00:53.540> character<00:00:54.500> scoring<00:00:55.340> goals

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
experience or character scoring goals

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.080 
experience or character scoring goals
more<00:00:56.000> balanced<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.230> I<00:00:57.260> think<00:00:57.559> it<00:00:57.620> would<00:00:57.739> be

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
more balanced so I think it would be

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.670 
more balanced so I think it would be
good<00:00:59.090> for<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.450> next<00:00:59.660> manager<00:01:00.170> because<00:01:00.470> he

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
good for the next manager because he

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.639 
good for the next manager because he
will<00:01:00.800> have<00:01:00.829> a<00:01:00.920> very<00:01:01.160> good<00:01:01.219> team<00:01:01.520> and<00:01:01.730> also<00:01:02.329> even

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
will have a very good team and also even

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.410 
will have a very good team and also even
the<00:01:03.649> owner<00:01:03.800> will<00:01:04.009> bring<00:01:04.189> more<00:01:04.579> players<00:01:04.879> so<00:01:05.149> I

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
the owner will bring more players so I

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.320 
the owner will bring more players so I
think<00:01:06.250> this<00:01:07.250> team<00:01:07.460> will<00:01:07.640> be<00:01:07.760> joining<00:01:07.940> you<00:01:08.210> for

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
think this team will be joining you for

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.910 
think this team will be joining you for
the<00:01:08.450> title<00:01:08.630> next<00:01:08.930> year<00:01:09.049> when<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:09.770> have<00:01:09.890> a

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
the title next year when you have a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.910 
the title next year when you have a
global<00:01:10.460> player<00:01:10.610> like<00:01:10.820> this<00:01:11.150> group<00:01:11.740> very<00:01:12.740> good

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
professionals and plays with talent came

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.070 
professionals and plays with talent came
to<00:01:16.100> learn<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.549> to<00:01:16.729> improve<00:01:17.060> it's<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:17.870> pity

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
to learn and to improve it's a pity

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.960 
to learn and to improve it's a pity
because<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:18.500> could<00:01:18.710> see<00:01:18.890> how<00:01:19.670> they<00:01:19.940> were

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
because you could see how they were

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.600 
because you could see how they were

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
improving the relationship with everyone

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.789 
improving the relationship with everyone
the<00:01:25.850> staff<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.270> players<00:01:26.540> has<00:01:27.290> been<00:01:27.500> quite<00:01:27.770> good

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
the staff on players has been quite good

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.170 
the staff on players has been quite good
and<00:01:28.250> then<00:01:28.960> something<00:01:29.960> that<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.440> can<00:01:30.650> feel<00:01:31.180> for

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
and then something that you can feel for

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.880 
and then something that you can feel for
most<00:01:32.390> every<00:01:33.020> week<00:01:33.170> it's<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.470> little<00:01:33.650> bit<00:01:33.740> more

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
most every week it's a little bit more

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.399 
most every week it's a little bit more
and<00:01:34.100> more<00:01:34.220> especially<00:01:34.670> when<00:01:34.960> maybe<00:01:35.960> I<00:01:36.110> don't

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
and more especially when maybe I don't

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.340 
and more especially when maybe I don't
know<00:01:36.939> cannot<00:01:37.939> say<00:01:38.090> when<00:01:38.390> exactly<00:01:38.689> no<00:01:38.990> but<00:01:39.140> that

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
know cannot say when exactly no but that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.980 
know cannot say when exactly no but that
within<00:01:40.220> some<00:01:40.460> games<00:01:40.729> in<00:01:40.939> style<00:01:41.299> like<00:01:41.630> we<00:01:41.810> did

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
within some games in style like we did

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.130 
within some games in style like we did
and<00:01:42.400> changing<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.880> came<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.930> halftime

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140
