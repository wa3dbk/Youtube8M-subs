driving when arriving at the door of
this<00:00:30.740> place<00:00:31.010> and<00:00:31.280> looking<00:00:32.239> around<00:00:32.360> is

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
particularly rainy day and I thought to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.060 
particularly rainy day and I thought to
myself<00:00:34.190> what<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:34.910> hell<00:00:35.120> are<00:00:35.210> we<00:00:35.270> doing<00:00:35.920> it<00:00:36.920> was

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
myself what the hell are we doing it was

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.470 
myself what the hell are we doing it was
a<00:00:37.100> tremendous<00:00:37.370> experience<00:00:37.820> though<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:38.330> one

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
a tremendous experience though and one

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.570 
a tremendous experience though and one
thing<00:00:38.840> that<00:00:38.870> has<00:00:39.230> really<00:00:39.350> stood<00:00:39.650> out<00:00:39.710> to<00:00:39.830> me<00:00:39.980> is

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
thing that has really stood out to me is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.090 
thing that has really stood out to me is
the<00:00:40.820> importance<00:00:41.330> of<00:00:41.540> having<00:00:42.200> a<00:00:42.470> team<00:00:42.710> that<00:00:42.980> you

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
the importance of having a team that you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.850 
the importance of having a team that you
really<00:00:43.400> trust<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:44.120> believe<00:00:45.079> it<00:00:45.290> when<00:00:45.710> one

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
really trust and believe it when one

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.040 
really trust and believe it when one
starts<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:46.220> company<00:00:46.430> and<00:00:47.180> I<00:00:47.600> don't<00:00:47.780> think

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
starts a company and I don't think

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.600 
starts a company and I don't think
there's<00:00:48.200> any<00:00:48.350> better<00:00:48.560> way<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:48.860> establish<00:00:49.430> that

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
there's any better way to establish that

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.030 
there's any better way to establish that
in<00:00:49.880> a<00:00:49.970> real<00:00:50.150> sense<00:00:50.420> than<00:00:50.870> living<00:00:51.200> together<00:00:51.500> and

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
in a real sense than living together and

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.760 
in a real sense than living together and
really<00:00:52.850> putting<00:00:53.540> yourselves<00:00:54.230> in<00:00:54.380> a<00:00:54.470> position

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
really putting yourselves in a position

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.010 
really putting yourselves in a position
that<00:00:54.980> you<00:00:55.160> have<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.579> get<00:00:55.730> along<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.210> we<00:00:56.780> spent

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
that you have to get along and we spent

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.260 
that you have to get along and we spent

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
and all night we knew that the best way

to<00:01:02.000> make<00:01:02.780> hammerhead<00:01:03.230> reality<00:01:03.649> was<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.250> do<00:01:04.339> a

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
to make hammerhead reality was to do a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.880

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
in a position where we had something

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.459 
in a position where we had something
that<00:01:10.429> really<00:01:10.609> worked<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.240> was<00:01:11.389> tested<00:01:11.899> and<00:01:12.020> we

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
that really worked and was tested and we

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.910 
that really worked and was tested and we
could<00:01:12.619> actually<00:01:12.770> film<00:01:13.539> spending<00:01:14.539> many<00:01:15.530> many

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
could actually film spending many many

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.849 
could actually film spending many many
days<00:01:16.280> working<00:01:16.880> on<00:01:17.240> something<00:01:17.539> in<00:01:18.259> isolation

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
days working on something in isolation

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.219 
days working on something in isolation
is<00:01:19.130> difficult<00:01:19.609> at<00:01:20.240> this<00:01:20.420> time<00:01:20.689> it<00:01:20.869> was<00:01:20.990> just

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
is difficult at this time it was just

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.800 
is difficult at this time it was just
Lawrence<00:01:21.590> ravine<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.069> me<00:01:22.219> and<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:23.450> days<00:01:23.600> were

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
Lawrence ravine and me and the days were

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.349 
Lawrence ravine and me and the days were
hot<00:01:24.020> they<00:01:24.319> were<00:01:24.380> long<00:01:24.649> we<00:01:25.280> had<00:01:25.609> very<00:01:26.149> little

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
money and no real resources and it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.739 
money and no real resources and it
really<00:01:31.159> was<00:01:31.369> a<00:01:31.399> challenge<00:01:31.909> that<00:01:32.060> we<00:01:32.149> had<00:01:32.450> to

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
really was a challenge that we had to

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.199 
really was a challenge that we had to
decide<00:01:33.139> as<00:01:33.350> a<00:01:33.380> team<00:01:33.469> to<00:01:33.679> overcome<00:01:34.249> we<00:01:34.909> wanted

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:36.550 
decide as a team to overcome we wanted
to<00:01:35.270> make<00:01:35.479> sure<00:01:35.539> we<00:01:35.749> had<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.109> highest<00:01:36.289> quality

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
to make sure we had the highest quality

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.419 
to make sure we had the highest quality
footage<00:01:37.039> possible<00:01:37.609> so<00:01:37.880> we<00:01:38.170> mounted<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.429> canon

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
footage possible so we mounted a canon

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.449 
footage possible so we mounted a canon
7d<00:01:40.939> on<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.509> monopod<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:42.649> we<00:01:42.770> rigged<00:01:43.039> up<00:01:43.159> to<00:01:43.340> my

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
7d on a monopod that we rigged up to my

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.029 
7d on a monopod that we rigged up to my
bicycle<00:01:43.999> and<00:01:44.209> we<00:01:44.840> did<00:01:44.990> that<00:01:45.139> using<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.740> pool

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
bicycle and we did that using a pool

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.399 
bicycle and we did that using a pool
noodle<00:01:46.069> and<00:01:46.729> a<00:01:47.149> series<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.479> other<00:01:47.659> things<00:01:47.959> we

that was beyond are really our wildest

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.919 
that was beyond are really our wildest
projections<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:54.369> this<00:01:55.369> momentum<00:01:55.909> was<00:01:56.209> really

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
projections and this momentum was really

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.660 
projections and this momentum was really
unbelievable<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.859> carried<00:01:58.219> us<00:01:58.369> right
