happens<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:47.959> quickly<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.739> just<00:02:49.220> kind<00:02:49.430> of

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
happens so quickly and just kind of

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.979 
happens so quickly and just kind of
starts<00:02:49.880> right<00:02:50.120> from<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.360> beginning<00:02:50.480> here<00:02:50.900> in

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
starts right from the beginning here in

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.930 
starts right from the beginning here in
this<00:02:51.110> situation<00:02:51.709> they<00:02:51.950> don't<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.610> lot<00:02:52.820> of

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
this situation they don't have a lot of

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.120 
this situation they don't have a lot of
time<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.300> ease<00:02:53.570> into<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.110> film<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.590> ease<00:02:54.800> into

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
time to ease into the film to ease into

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.340 
time to ease into the film to ease into
the<00:02:55.340> characters<00:02:55.790> lives<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:56.989> makes<00:02:57.230> for

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
the characters lives and so it makes for

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.560 
the characters lives and so it makes for
kind<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.950> rushed<00:02:58.280> feeling<00:02:58.880> I<00:02:59.030> think<00:02:59.360> maybe

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
kind of a rushed feeling I think maybe

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.180 
kind of a rushed feeling I think maybe
if<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.959> film's<00:03:00.260> start<00:03:00.530> out<00:03:00.709> a<00:03:00.739> little<00:03:00.860> bit

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
if the film's start out a little bit

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.770 
if the film's start out a little bit
slower<00:03:01.520> and<00:03:01.670> then<00:03:02.000> got<00:03:02.300> into<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.630> situation

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
slower and then got into the situation

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.390 
slower and then got into the situation
they<00:03:03.500> might<00:03:03.620> have<00:03:03.739> had<00:03:03.800> a<00:03:03.860> little<00:03:03.950> more<00:03:04.070> depth

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
they might have had a little more depth

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.530 
they might have had a little more depth
with<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.670> characters<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.330> would<00:03:05.450> have

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
with the characters and I would have

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.060 
with the characters and I would have
been<00:03:05.660> a<00:03:05.690> little<00:03:05.810> more<00:03:05.959> entertaining<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.739> still

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
been a little more entertaining I still

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.680 
been a little more entertaining I still
enjoyed<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.459> film<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.820> was<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.940> fun<00:03:08.209> movie<00:03:08.570> I
