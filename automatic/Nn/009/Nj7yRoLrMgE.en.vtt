is if people are having a hard time you

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.160 
is if people are having a hard time you
know<00:02:02.700> cutting<00:02:02.909> back<00:02:03.149> or<00:02:03.360> taking<00:02:03.689> out<00:02:03.780> soda

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170

diet<00:02:04.890> soda<00:02:05.219> crystal<00:02:06.180> light<00:02:06.360> stuff<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.990> that

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
diet soda crystal light stuff like that

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.130 
diet soda crystal light stuff like that
that<00:02:07.290> are<00:02:07.409> genuinely<00:02:07.799> sweeter<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:09.179> suggest<00:02:09.959> to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
that are genuinely sweeter I suggest to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.220 
that are genuinely sweeter I suggest to
them<00:02:10.229> adding<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.860> drop<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.300> liquid<00:02:12.300> stevia

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
them adding a drop of liquid stevia

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.559 
them adding a drop of liquid stevia
and<00:02:13.319> that's<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.040> gentle<00:02:14.550> natural<00:02:15.120> sweetener

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
and that's a gentle natural sweetener

and that's a gentle natural sweetener
