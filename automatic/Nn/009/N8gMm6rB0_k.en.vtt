00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
them another try since they've

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460 
them another try since they've
redesigned<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.729> entire<00:01:23.759> thing<00:01:24.140> from<00:01:25.140> every

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
I felt I think I felt the same about the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.820 
I felt I think I felt the same about the
last<00:03:16.580> generation<00:03:17.090> of<00:03:17.270> these<00:03:17.450> earbuds<00:03:17.799> but<00:03:18.799> I

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
last generation of these earbuds but I

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.770 
last generation of these earbuds but I
am<00:03:19.400> excited<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:19.940> see<00:03:20.060> where<00:03:20.150> these<00:03:20.269> go<00:03:20.510> since

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
am excited to see where these go since

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.289 
am excited to see where these go since
it<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.049> a<00:03:21.080> flat<00:03:21.470> cable<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.730> should<00:03:22.940> be<00:03:22.970> harder

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
it is a flat cable it should be harder

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.670 
it is a flat cable it should be harder
for<00:03:23.330> them<00:03:23.570> to<00:03:23.630> get<00:03:23.810> tangled<00:03:24.200> up<00:03:24.260> but<00:03:24.320> i'm<00:03:24.530> not

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
for them to get tangled up but i'm not

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.800 
for them to get tangled up but i'm not
sure<00:03:24.739> i<00:03:25.250> don't<00:03:25.970> really<00:03:26.120> see<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.420> logic<00:03:26.570> in

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
sure i don't really see the logic in

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.210 
sure i don't really see the logic in
there<00:03:26.989> but<00:03:27.140> from<00:03:27.350> all<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.530> reviews<00:03:27.799> i've<00:03:28.010> seen

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
there but from all the reviews i've seen

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.759 
there but from all the reviews i've seen
another<00:03:28.549> ear<00:03:28.820> but<00:03:29.000> similar<00:03:29.330> to<00:03:29.480> these

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
another ear but similar to these

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.770 
another ear but similar to these
apparently<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.860> flat<00:03:31.100> cable<00:03:31.549> it<00:03:32.030> helps<00:03:32.570> a<00:03:32.660> lot

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
apparently the flat cable it helps a lot

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.390 
apparently the flat cable it helps a lot
with<00:03:32.930> them<00:03:33.140> not<00:03:33.500> getting<00:03:33.769> tangled<00:03:33.980> but<00:03:34.280> the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
with them not getting tangled but the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.090 
with them not getting tangled but the
cable<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:34.940> definitely<00:03:35.680> decently<00:03:36.680> i<00:03:36.799> think

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100

it's<00:03:37.220> just<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.610> perfect<00:03:37.820> length<00:03:38.120> i<00:03:38.269> can't

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450
