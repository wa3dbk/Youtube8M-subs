00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.850
 excellence but it's a plant one can 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.210
 tropical say zotique but who hold 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.950

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.830
 find in the north of europe wind 10 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.290
 - this is where the 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.690
 cameras excellent ricard sake for 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.190
 turn and this is the origin of china 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.539
 but it's good in europe since 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.329
 hundreds of years and now it's 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.320
 within families the most used in 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.359
 the gardens of europe 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.640
 it means that in Ile de France we 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.620
 can put in his childhood to you 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.730
 find them all over France 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.589
 they are how old for example 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.569
 there they are four years old then precisely a 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.229
 basket that can wait until 

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:53.719
 what size 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:56.839
 yeah it can happen up to 15 meters 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.519
 of earth with a style of 10 May 12 in 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.679
 made for the basket we talk about this guy 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.960
 is not too much it's st cyp it's the 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.760
 soap opera tipouce dries up and the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.010
 bottom of the to be there is that it's a 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.800
 foliage palmer yes that's a 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.310
 palm foliage tries not to case 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.320
 traditional for our customers when they 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.820
 buy a palm tree so like like 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.650
 this one how could you them 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.480
 counselors there it was atypical complaint 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.760
 for the dish is replanted isolated 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.720
 sun provision possibly so he 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.090
 need the plant and a po 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.030
 in the garden a single well-drained a 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.050
 ground very last because like all 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.050
 the palms do not really like there 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.870
 too much water is implanted that we water 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.590
 Once a week in summer a container 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.900
 is then the same but when he planted it 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.090
 in the garden it is necessary to water it 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.620
 the first year a little more a peace 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.480
 more often and if I want to 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.130
 cultivate one like that of that size 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.970
 about four years in a pot is this 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.390
 that it is possible yes look at a 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.700
 container and next year or in 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.270
 two years for you to repot them in a 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.270
 ice cream 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.770
 it's an easy plant 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.980
 yes it is an easy plant to cultivate 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.950
 easy to maintain with customers 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.440
 is enough in summer if the plant remains a 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.970
 container to give water once 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.800
 per week twice people in 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.910
 account the effect begins to dry out 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.520
 they must be removed 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.590
 yes the plant and the trend is to be done 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.720
 of the effect the base it is necessary to cut them 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.130
 after the winter from the end of February 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.750
 early March 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.630
 we start to cut the leaves that 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.820
 are drying it's enough because the 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.110
 plant after he does the new push 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.780
 inside 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.190
 inside the cairo we say that's where 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.040
 that he made the new leaf 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.750
 new defeat we carved there are two 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.459
 three years four years old the state is 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.260
 a little longer we do not go the size 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.150
 and resort to work the plants 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.310
 suffer and he will train trains 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
 have to formulate this guy is that I 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.680
 do things 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.940
 yes it's girls stop a little 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.940
 like the points we have on the arms 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.290
 crossed is a little characteristic 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.030
 palms 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.170
 the palm tree is flowers yes fed and 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.590
 this is called the form of 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.660
 a very nice day bunch also without 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.400
 doubt a few weeks must cut must 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.440
 cut must cut because it's beautiful 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.720
 to see but it's not good for the 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.280
 plant the plants that tired and this 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.780
 information that's the eyes when she has 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.900
 place every year when the plant 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.840
 it's about 7 8 years old starting to 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.840
 bloom and it happens in mid June 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.550
 the palm is a plant that is very 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.810
 graphic for at the very limit kind 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.120
 but to say that if we want to work 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.430
 all alone so we isolated this break and the 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.670
 contrasts with the provides to the conducted 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.470
 especially plume tenax and where the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.670
 too short for us it's very good 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.230
 with europe 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.080
 and if we want an Italian garden we 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.990
 can outright afford the full one 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.610
 to the house in oran 1 as well 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.680
 more contained that it's the dream 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:08.730
 oh that's the student and we're done 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.730
 exaggerate this folder if you want
