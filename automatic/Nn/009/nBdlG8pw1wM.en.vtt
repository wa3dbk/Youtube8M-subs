00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.569
 the cart 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.489
 and at home he mainly coaches 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.110
 kicks the bow is too little to get one 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.160
 sufficient for the low for 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.660

 front mattress thorin lens for something extra 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.780
 another that there are quite a few 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.810
