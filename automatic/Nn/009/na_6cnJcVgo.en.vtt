00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 that was it with this one already 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.580
 It can not be any more 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:16.980
 more it does not need my opinion 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:18.690
 Meet hey people and welcome 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.900
 to a new video 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.029
 I would like to briefly a small program 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.140
 introduce a small tool for the mac 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.310
 Similar to bradley manning 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.320
 this is a little program i think 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:38.790
 48 km which you exactly 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.550
 the battery life of your max that 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.370
 Timeline indicates it is so that you can 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.410
 here about the symbol demos with the mouse 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180
 Click one and then you will see 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.649
 here is the time 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.070
 but I sit in the train very often or 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.590
 in the cafÃ© and I always like that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.989
 see and know how long i still have mine 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.920
 I can use macbook without them 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.309
 Recharge must be here first 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.840
 this tool around daily program link to it 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.290
 you can find below in the video 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.299
 description yes if you have that is 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.060
 I think in zip format just once 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.400
 unpack and then we'll see 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.400
 this icon the program we start with 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.170
 a double click as usual and it was 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.369
 so to speak, as you can see 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.960
 We're up to a timeline ad 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.579
 exactly and a notification comes 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.110
 the new version is available 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.119
 although the latest is actually the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.799
 So I just downloaded 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.329
 a bit strange we want first 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.360
 I'm not more specific about the settings 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.220
 initially received but would like it is 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.490
 this battery is something of apple 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.369
 already on it is once have gone 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.220
 twice battery draw files at 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.060
 I think a little shit about it 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.270
 let's open that one 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.520
 system settings then go on 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.960
 save energy and down here this 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.479
 Take out the hook for this he did 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.270
 responsible for the advertisement 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.400
 so now we can close that again 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.590
 and have our battery indicator here 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.720
 at noon that is 3 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.330
 only 18 minutes I could still 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.920
 without charging my macbook use like that 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.440
 as I always display the user 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.239
 changes with the burden of 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.569
 macbooks that means if you have many 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.049
 have programs open if you have the cpu 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.450
 will work properly then will too 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.640
 very fast the runtime until may 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.799
 are the time until the next 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.819
 Charging drastically go down 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:43.110
 and then you immediately noticed the one here 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.540
 I just saw it now 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.720
 just do not speak and take short 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.950
 because of this, the battery increases 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.819
 running time still ten minutes straight 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.700
 let's go to the short one 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.920
 attitudes that you have here 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.459
 over it and click on how to get here 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.220
 can see here is the percentage display 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.290
 the power supply and how many 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.150
 charging cycles already my battery behind 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.310
 Ensures power consumption temperature 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.739
 It is important to start when registering 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.829
 we could also theoretically talk about the 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.470
 So control over the 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.880
 system settings but it is useful 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.049
 was not easy on it and can 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.590
 the program should deal with the 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.120
 you do not have to start an extra registration 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.500
 That's where we come to the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.930
 Notifications I just so 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.370
 who are just pumped up here 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.690
 you can adjust that yourself 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.130
 Tool should report when the battery 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.169
 status says it was reported that 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.169
 less than 15 percent or full 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:52.790
 charged is yes you can see it once 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:55.079
 here as a pop up or here in the whole 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.150
 notification notification 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:02.340
 center namely that only we also others 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.349
 see things that are so the top 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.459
 tools here 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.690
 you can also use the extension mode 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.579
 make others that is called this 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.190
 extended mode is actually only 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.299
 that we see these loading cycles and the 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.630
 temperature etc 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.950
 if we made that out of here now 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.130
 then sent only felt percent of 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.570
 Battery is left and no 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.580
 further info but I finds little 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.870
 I want to know a little bit better 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.050
 already have a bit of information to one 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.050
 lottery 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.509
 So yes, that was it actually already 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.389
 with these features of this little one 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:37.370
 tools if we want to delete that 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.750
 we can do it by right-clicking 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.410
 in the trash shed and practitioner 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.729
 with teachers as with yes as I said 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.289
 he is only a small tool yes if we 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.060
 Do not start it when registering 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.800
 Want this hook out of here and it 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.199
 has finished then also finish 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.830
 click and away it is that it was then 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.750
 already with 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.820
 with this program more can do it too 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.780
 but not in my opinion 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.910
 also do not know 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.090
 my hands it completely out also is 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.389
 the open source so for free like 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.979
 said link in the description if you 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.720
 have questions to the program or to 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:15.199
 a program that I like to introduce 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.630
 should write for you the best of me 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.250
 facebook or on twitter 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.020
 you can always call me around the clock 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.000
 to reach 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:27.229
 and I'll watch the program too 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.800
 if it costs the program is testing for 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:33.550
 you make a little review and then 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.550
 see something next time
