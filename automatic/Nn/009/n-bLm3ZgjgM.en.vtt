00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.179 

well<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.659> little<00:01:24.900> bit<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.470> think<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
well it's a little bit I think that to

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.700 
well it's a little bit I think that to
reflect<00:01:26.580> Swiss<00:01:27.240> mentality<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.500> little

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
reflect Swiss mentality it's a little

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.050 
reflect Swiss mentality it's a little
bit<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.920> stubbornness<00:01:30.439> it's<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.590> little<00:01:31.799> bit

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
bit of stubbornness it's a little bit

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.870 
bit of stubbornness it's a little bit
emphatic<00:01:34.520> low<00:01:35.520> profile<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.930> very<00:01:37.320> focused

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
emphatic low profile but very focused

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.109 
emphatic low profile but very focused
well<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.900> main<00:01:41.020> difference<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:42.490> really<00:01:42.820> just

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
well the main difference is really just

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.609 
well the main difference is really just
learning<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.570> names<00:01:46.080> it's<00:01:47.080> not<00:01:47.229> like<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.409> new

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619
