00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 well let's see a little 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.370
 differences the hercules 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.710
 original against them 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.070
 with pirates have others 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.810
 here you can see that the original has 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.910
 much but much more detail 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.910
 and fewer gaps on everything 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.360
 the copy 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:35.080
 and it even has some things that in the 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.550
 copy did not do like this that you can 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:42.000
 to enlarge 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.000
 and in the conpes comes 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.410
 articulated planes 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.390
 they have a translucent plastic 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.390
 red with others does not bring 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.340
 and has several details 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.370
 it is important for example the pill 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.830
 behind him 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.030
 of the foot that has extra supports 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.340
 so that he has greater 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.450
 you do not have 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.520
 this would be the original 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.520
 and now let's see the pirate 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.990
 if you can see in this part of here 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.990
 they have the holes that they said 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.660
 Uruguay does not move 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.420
 the shovel 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.420
 of this part has 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.120
 one color 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:50.170
 brings and stays fixed and the kitchen can be 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.170
 Bend 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.140
 the standing shovel can be separated in two 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.100
 while they watch over her 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.950
 it's just one piece 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.250
 and the foot has a flex in the part 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.250
 of the ankle 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.350
 in this case 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.180
 does not have 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.960
 that's why the legs are so 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.960
 rigid and can not be placed as in 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.060
 this case 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.060
 in a much more stable way 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.170
 and as I said 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.970
 while the extra selection brackets 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.350
 and it's a bit unstable is not it 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.980
 is falling all the time 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.980
 but 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.590
 but 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.590
 more complicated to keep it well 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.560
 but there is something weird for example the head 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.220
 it is much more this great 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.680
 with the original 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.680
 in proportion it looks much better 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.040
 this is just a pretty comparison 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.900
 unfair because its talking about a piece 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.569
 here 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:24.150
 and they should give as weapons 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.150
 seven or eight times more expensive 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.310
 and that should make the difference in 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.840
 all the details however by the 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.030
 cost of this figure 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.030
 what you get is a figure 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.030
 coming 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.700
 i 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.490
 to get a figure like this 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.800
 do not 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.850
 and I hope to get 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:17.680
 with someone who knows 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.359
 and if one day 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.720
 to end up in the hands of me with 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.720
 they 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.139
 but 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.380
 here is all this for you to see a 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.010
 little bit more details 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.010
 see you later
