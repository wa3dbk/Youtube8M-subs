00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.110
 studios and played who in evil birds who in 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.330
 captive bond and zombies and suddenly the very 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.580
 clever of them dawned and let's 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.800

 creators promise to release the first dlc 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.120
 but the cost is not reported what 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.950
 a game 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.230
 a long time ago the evil vikings attacked 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.860
 the kingdom of knights and the war was so 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.170
 cruelly that the goddess of the world began to cry as well 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.789
 cried for him two tears that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.469
 fell to the ground with two crystals 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.860
 who ended the war 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.989
 one got the Vikings another knight 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.309
 we are kings and keepers of kings 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.129
 got eternal life 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.629
 after some time on the horizon again 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.859
 war loomed and here we fall into the game 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.899
 govern we are not the immortal king 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.540
 edgarom who is already walking sand 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.220
 sprinkles one of his knights sir 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.170
 a garet that possesses such 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.450
 complexion that could hardly have come in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.280
 my room did not break my shoulder and did not break through 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.540
 my head 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.590
 it turns out that evil barbarians again have 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.530
 borders of the kingdom 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.409
 we must save everyone 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.630
 as usual the game consists of several 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.610
 important items first we have 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.810
 ballista which can crush enemies 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.570
 like cabbage 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.189
 management is easier than evil birds all 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.590
 this is not the only element of the game 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.930
 when passing levels we get all 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.240
 new and new projectiles each 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.280
 it is better to use for their own purposes for example 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.619
 normal boom quickly it charges 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.700
 possesses weak destructive power for small 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.470
 enemies the very thing 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.600
 but for shooting at the castle is better 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.520
 save pieces of stones 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.159
 you can even throw a potion into the enemy 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.290
 which will make him fight for us is 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.869
 so great when an adversary saves going on 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.909
 strong monster but he barely appeared 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.000
 turns and starts to break relatives 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.049
 walls in general the game is surprising elaboration and 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.330
 small details 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.119
 how do you make headshots of 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.350
 ballista shoot down your enemy 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.140
 or working frendly fire 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.040
 we can release our army against the enemy 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.989
 order a soldier for food 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.239
 at first only weak ones are available to us 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.950
 swordsmen but as the campaign progresses 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.920
 will be able to hire 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.590
 archers and paladins and even drovers as well 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.720
 words do not laugh a couple drovers 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.540
 donkeys is a formidable force and 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.200
 can become the earth any well if of course 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.200
 catch up 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:50.540
 move you stupid could wish patronymic 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.040
 the guy is no time to fool around 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.560
 vikings will try not to give us 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.120
 grab these donkeys i'm not sure what 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.609
 I will deserve if they succeed 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.030
 these animals harder to tame than my 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.640
 wife 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.319
 I hope you did not try to teach them 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.459
 same way sir forget try again 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.049
 once dosor 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.150
 It can be released into the battle, and Sir Gareth 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.950
 but only for a certain time he is 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.629
 Unlike conventional troops controlled by 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.849
 keyboard and can not only hack 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.409
 sword but also archery 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.019
 a great desire to even jump and 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.239
 cover yourself with a critical shield 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.239
 situations he can annihilate 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.639
 whole army of enemies important element of the game 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.439
 is building a castle in front of each 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.450
 mission we can fill the rest 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.609
 free space as decorative 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.310
 elements and rooms with troops 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.109
 upgrades are an important moment until you 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.180
 add room to the battle will not be 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.489
 order the appropriate type of troops yes 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.829
 and upgrades greatly simplify the process here 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.139
 you and the rapid recovery of food and more 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.590
 strong troops and extra seats in 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.780
 armies 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.239
 me the process of stuffing the castle with rooms 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.629
 seemed boring but lovers 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.760
 minecraft will find here what to do and 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.400
 all this can be improved for gold knocked out 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.409
 from enemy troops mission with enemy 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.840
 the castle can be passed in two ways either 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:12.109
 steal a flag or break it into dust 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.599
 all rooms with soldiers are creators not 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:17.060
 strive to simplify our life then in dso 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.489
 gnaws through the bowstring ballista and have to 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.769
 forget about shooting enemy troops then 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.930
 Our troops went on strike and even 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.849
 do drink water from the ass swamp and 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.039

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:30.530
 homeland again have to save the city from 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.330
 which sits on a wine diet and in the morning 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.330
 nothing but a hangover does not suffer 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.420

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.080
 let this son go and keep this one 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.760
 the war has affected us all just 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.810
 sometimes i feel like that 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.630
 my fighting skills are low 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.740
 I don't even know how to attack from a distance 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.460
 I really understand you 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.680

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.030
 perfection of course but juicy and bright 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.280
