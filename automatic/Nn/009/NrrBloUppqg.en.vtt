actually an apple corer it's something
that<00:00:28.289> I've<00:00:28.470> used<00:00:28.890> for<00:00:29.189> years<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:30.029> remove

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
that I've used for years to remove

that I've used for years to remove
candles<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.410> jars<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.700> works

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
candles out of jars and it just works

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.959 
candles out of jars and it just works
for<00:00:33.540> me<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.899> mean<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.410> use<00:00:34.710> anything<00:00:35.610> sharp

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
for me I mean you can use anything sharp

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.319 
for me I mean you can use anything sharp
probably<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> knife<00:00:36.899> or<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:38.070> any<00:00:38.280> other<00:00:38.640> type

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
probably a knife or just any other type

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.889 
probably a knife or just any other type
of<00:00:39.360> sharp<00:00:40.160> tool<00:00:41.160> should<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.629> find<00:00:42.809> that

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
of sharp tool should do I just find that

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.330 
of sharp tool should do I just find that
the<00:00:43.050> apple<00:00:43.410> corer<00:00:43.649> works<00:00:43.890> well<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:44.820> me

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.730 

now<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.360> candle<00:00:49.900> wicks<00:00:50.110> are<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.560> most

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
now the candle wicks are the most

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.890 
now the candle wicks are the most
difficult<00:00:51.190> part<00:00:51.520> because<00:00:52.240> they<00:00:52.450> are<00:00:52.570> glued

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
difficult part because they are glued

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.440 
difficult part because they are glued
down<00:00:53.200> I'm<00:00:53.620> just<00:00:53.830> going<00:00:54.130> to<00:00:54.190> do<00:00:54.910> my<00:00:54.940> best<00:00:55.240> to
