00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
mini map so that's pretty cool like if

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.319 
mini map so that's pretty cool like if
we<00:00:33.420> go<00:00:33.600> out<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.989> has<00:00:34.910> it's<00:00:35.910> probably<00:00:36.180> very

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
we go out it has it's probably very

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.720 
we go out it has it's probably very
similar<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.410> map<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:38.070> make<00:00:38.489> in

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
similar to the map you can make in

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.420 
similar to the map you can make in
Minecraft<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:40.410> walk<00:00:40.620> around<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.340> you

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
Minecraft and you walk around and you

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.420 
Minecraft and you walk around and you
see<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.450> walking<00:00:42.690> towards<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.020> ocean<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.920> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
see I'm walking towards the ocean but a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.090 
see I'm walking towards the ocean but a
quick<00:00:44.969> note<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.690> maker<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.500> mod<00:00:46.710> said

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
quick note the maker of this mod said

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.209 
quick note the maker of this mod said
that<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.329> might<00:00:48.539> take<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.989> some<00:00:49.230> extra<00:00:49.890> ram

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that this might take up some extra ram

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
that this might take up some extra ram
so<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.910> you're<00:00:51.059> having<00:00:51.210> performance<00:00:51.899> issues

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so if you're having performance issues

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.410 
so if you're having performance issues
with<00:00:52.829> Minecraft<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.820> might<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.090> want<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
with Minecraft you might not want to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.560 
with Minecraft you might not want to
have<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.469> map<00:00:55.649> present<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.820> let's<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.090> back

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
have the map present so let's go back

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.049 
have the map present so let's go back
and<00:00:57.870> turn<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.710> off<00:00:58.890> now<00:00:59.489> another<00:00:59.820> cool

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and turn that off now another cool

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.880 
and turn that off now another cool

all around so uh you know this is just

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.230 
all around so uh you know this is just
an<00:01:23.670> example<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:25.189> good-looking

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
an example it's not very good-looking

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.719 
an example it's not very good-looking
not<00:01:27.240> my<00:01:27.360> best<00:01:27.540> work<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.460> this<00:01:29.460> mod<00:01:29.700> is

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729

not my best work but this mod is
something<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.299> think<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.350> not<00:01:31.860> notch<00:01:32.189> but

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
something I think that not not notch but

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.830 
something I think that not not notch but
Jeb<00:01:34.049> should<00:01:34.380> implement<00:01:34.680> maybe<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.840> every

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
Jeb should implement maybe because every

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.580 
Jeb should implement maybe because every
every<00:01:37.470> good<00:01:38.329> RPG<00:01:39.329> type<00:01:39.750> game<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.350> I'd<00:01:40.560> say

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
every good RPG type game and I'd say

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.069 
every good RPG type game and I'd say
minecraft<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.340> an<00:01:41.490> RPG<00:01:41.640> type<00:01:42.119> game<00:01:42.450> should

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
minecraft is an RPG type game should

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.710 
minecraft is an RPG type game should
have<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.530> heads-up<00:01:43.920> display<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.909> you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
have a heads-up display that you can you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.630 
have a heads-up display that you can you
know<00:01:45.810> mess<00:01:46.049> around<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.310> go<00:01:47.460> into

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
know mess around with so if we go into

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.030 
know mess around with so if we go into
each<00:01:47.939> individual<00:01:48.689> setting<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.829> can

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
each individual setting here we can

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
each individual setting here we can
change<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.430> style<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.030> let's<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.840> solid

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
change the style so let's go to solid

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.499 
change the style so let's go to solid
one<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.640> see<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:53.909> makes<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
one and you can see that makes it like a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.959 
one and you can see that makes it like a
solid<00:01:54.960> bar<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.350> made<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.219> double<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.640> let's<00:01:56.820> go

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
solid bar and made it double so let's go

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.230 
solid bar and made it double so let's go
solid<00:01:57.780> two<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.829> make<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.130> bit<00:01:59.340> smaller<00:01:59.640> so

health bar popped back up and you can

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.670 
health bar popped back up and you can
see<00:02:47.269> it'll<00:02:47.930> go<00:02:48.019> back<00:02:48.140> away<00:02:48.320> after<00:02:48.530> eight

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
see it'll go back away after eight

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.090 
see it'll go back away after eight
seconds<00:02:49.040> so<00:02:49.100> that's<00:02:49.250> nice<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.180> cool<00:02:50.980> for<00:02:51.980> that

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
seconds so that's nice and cool for that

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.199 
seconds so that's nice and cool for that
now<00:02:53.230> another<00:02:54.230> cool<00:02:54.590> aspect<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:55.459> ok<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.060> can

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
now another cool aspect is ok you can

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.960 
now another cool aspect is ok you can
change<00:02:56.560> what's<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:58.010> debug<00:02:58.370> screen<00:02:58.519> and

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
change what's on the debug screen and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.699 
change what's on the debug screen and
what's<00:02:59.330> not<00:02:59.569> and<00:02:59.810> you<00:03:00.140> can<00:03:00.319> change<00:03:00.500> your

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
what's not and you can change your

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.340 
what's not and you can change your
crosshair<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:02.390> think<00:03:03.080> some<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.230> the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
crosshair so I think some of the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.750 
crosshair so I think some of the
crosshairs<00:03:03.890> are<00:03:04.040> cool<00:03:04.220> there's<00:03:04.430> lots<00:03:04.640> of

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.750 
crosshairs are cool there's lots of
styles<00:03:05.209> so<00:03:05.360> there's<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.600> 32<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.260> be<00:03:06.350> exact<00:03:06.760> so

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
styles so there's a 32 to be exact so

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.809 
styles so there's a 32 to be exact so
you'll<00:03:08.060> find<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.390> style<00:03:08.630> for<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:09.819> really
