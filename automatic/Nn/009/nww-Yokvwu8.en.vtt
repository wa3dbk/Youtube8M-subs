00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.030
 and today 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.559
 change it 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.559
 On the motorcycle 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.990
 plus 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:35.620
 and now that I think that we are already 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.449
 making a new adventure this time 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.300
 let's go through all that maps are 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.870
 the island of the tiger sorry for something out 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.360
 of normal 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.579
 not only are we going to visit the island not only 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.530
 we are going to visit its beaches but 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:57.879
 let's go up the mountain and from there 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:01:01.600
 We will try to offer all the 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.640
 put under the heat but we carry the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.030
 encouragement not to have to load and everything 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.030
 so 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.560
 I do not know, we're heading towards a great adventure 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.480
 possibly the greatest adventure of 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.310
 calviÃ  because we would put to the test 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.320
 our physical and mental capacity 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.470
 Amapala was waiting for us with many 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.470
 surprises 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.440
 all right 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.369
 this trip for the shovel we did 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.080
 thanks to the sponsorship of its competes a 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.820
 huge project for the development 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.150
 regional in the Gulf of Fonseca in 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.150
 Honduras 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.160
 we started knowing some of the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.200
 most important islets surrounding 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.200
 papaya and the story behind them 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.700
 finally we arrived at the island and the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.200
 we went to find the house where 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.200
 Albert Eisntein stayed 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.730
 at the end of the afternoon the top of the island 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.360
 of the tiger we expected an enormous challenge 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.010
 for us to climb 780 meters we arrived 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.950
 so tired that we only made one 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.569
 small campfire dinner and to sleep for 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.569
 see the sunrise the next day 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.050
 Y 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.879
 the greatest reward after 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.500
 to have managed to climb was to make a 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.430
 travel along the sandy beaches 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.430
 volcano of amapala 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.189
