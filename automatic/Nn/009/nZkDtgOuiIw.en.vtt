well<00:00:49.649> first<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.040> add<00:00:50.219> well<00:00:50.610> our<00:00:50.790> first

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
well first we add well our first

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.490 
well first we add well our first
ingredient<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.840> would<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.170> common

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
ingredient and that would be the common

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.560 
ingredient and that would be the common
household<00:00:52.829> gasoline<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.149> pour<00:00:54.390> that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
household gasoline so we just pour that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.279 
household gasoline so we just pour that
right<00:00:54.860> into<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.950> pot<00:00:56.570> now<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.719> add<00:00:57.840> our<00:00:57.870> second

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
right into the pot now to add our second

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.459 
right into the pot now to add our second
ingredient<00:00:58.760> common<00:00:59.760> household<00:01:00.120> bar<00:01:00.360> soap<00:01:00.660> now

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
ingredient common household bar soap now

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.990 
ingredient common household bar soap now
your<00:01:01.680> first<00:01:01.920> thought<00:01:02.160> maybe<00:01:02.399> well<00:01:02.789> I'll<00:01:02.969> just

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
your first thought maybe well I'll just

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.490 
your first thought maybe well I'll just
roughly<00:01:03.449> chop<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.140> throw<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.410> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
roughly chop this and throw it in the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.290 
roughly chop this and throw it in the
pot<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.539> that<00:01:06.539> would<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.960> bad<00:01:07.410> idea<00:01:08.149> see<00:01:09.149> the

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
pot but that would be a bad idea see the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.090 
pot but that would be a bad idea see the
problem<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.229> roughly<00:01:10.679> chop<00:01:10.800> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
problem is if you just roughly chop the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.040 
problem is if you just roughly chop the
soap<00:01:11.340> you'll<00:01:11.789> end<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.149> lumpy<00:01:12.509> napalm<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
soap you'll end up with lumpy napalm and

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.760 
soap you'll end up with lumpy napalm and
nobody<00:01:13.920> likes<00:01:14.160> won't<00:01:14.429> be<00:01:14.520> napalm<00:01:14.899> instead<00:01:15.899> use

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
nobody likes won't be napalm instead use

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.630 
nobody likes won't be napalm instead use
a<00:01:16.800> cheese<00:01:17.310> grater<00:01:18.920> well<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.160> we<00:01:20.429> have<00:01:20.459> a

our ingredients in the pot we're ready
to<00:01:35.099> really<00:01:35.429> start<00:01:35.729> cooking<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.660> first

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to really start cooking so the first

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260 
to really start cooking so the first
thing<00:01:36.929> we'll<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.759> level<00:01:38.759> crank<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.179> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
thing we'll do is level crank up the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.070 
thing we'll do is level crank up the
heat<00:01:40.520> that's<00:01:41.520> looking<00:01:41.670> pretty<00:01:41.819> good<00:01:42.149> so<00:01:42.899> this

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
heat that's looking pretty good so this

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.150 
heat that's looking pretty good so this
would<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.289> a<00:01:43.319> good<00:01:43.470> time<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.709> talk<00:01:43.979> about

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
would be a good time to talk about

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.580 
would be a good time to talk about
safety<00:01:44.520> considerations<00:01:45.330> after<00:01:46.200> all<00:01:46.349> we're

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
safety considerations after all we're

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.990 
safety considerations after all we're
making<00:01:46.890> napalm<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.789> kind<00:01:47.910> of

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
making napalm it can be kind of

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.199 
making napalm it can be kind of
dangerous<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:49.140> number<00:01:49.739> one<00:01:50.039> always<00:01:50.849> keep<00:01:51.060> your

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
dangerous so number one always keep your

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.419 
dangerous so number one always keep your
eye<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.660> napalm<00:01:52.110> don't<00:01:52.709> don't<00:01:53.039> take<00:01:53.280> your

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
eye on the napalm don't don't take your

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.999 
eye on the napalm don't don't take your
attention<00:01:53.819> elsewhere<00:01:54.200> number<00:01:55.200> two<00:01:55.380> make<00:01:55.979> sure

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
attention elsewhere number two make sure
