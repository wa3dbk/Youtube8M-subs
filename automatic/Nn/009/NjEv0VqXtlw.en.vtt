axe<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.820> check<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.210> between<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.259> processes

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
axe and check it between the processes

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.520 
axe and check it between the processes
and<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> sharpie<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.380> very

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and I have a sharpie this will be very

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.740 
and I have a sharpie this will be very
important<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.009> sharpening<00:01:44.729> out<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
important for sharpening out of the of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
important for sharpening out of the of
the<00:01:46.020> edge<00:01:46.140> I'll<00:01:46.530> show<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.740> how<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.100> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the edge I'll show you how to use this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.760 
the edge I'll show you how to use this
so<00:01:48.030> let's<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.270> started<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.470> want<00:01:49.710> to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
so let's get started so you want to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.899 
so let's get started so you want to
start<00:01:49.920> by<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.189> making<00:01:50.399> sure<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> blade<00:01:50.729> is

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
start by just making sure the blade is

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:51.950 
start by just making sure the blade is
nice<00:01:51.060> clean<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.360> mean<00:01:51.479> there's<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> little<00:01:51.840> bit

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
nice clean I mean there's a little bit

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960 
nice clean I mean there's a little bit
of<00:01:52.170> tree<00:01:52.530> what<00:01:53.189> does<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:53.820> that

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
of tree what does it do on that but that

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.319 
of tree what does it do on that but that
stuff<00:01:54.210> will<00:01:54.329> come<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.630> we're<00:01:55.560> gonna<00:01:55.649> start<00:01:56.329> by

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
stuff will come up we're gonna start by

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.679 
stuff will come up we're gonna start by
taking<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.750> sharpie<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:59.450> marking<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> edge

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
taking the sharpie and marking the edge

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.910 
taking the sharpie and marking the edge
so<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.229> want<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:01.770> want

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
so what you want to do is you just want

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.480 
so what you want to do is you just want
to<00:02:02.040> color<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:03.079> starting<00:02:04.079> from<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.439> edge

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
to color in starting from the very edge

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.499 
to color in starting from the very edge
you<00:02:07.490> go<00:02:07.640> right<00:02:07.820> about<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.270> end<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.450> the

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
you go right about to the end of the

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.969 
you go right about to the end of the
bevel<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.080> can<00:02:09.200> see<00:02:09.349> where<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.590> kind<00:02:09.770> of<00:02:09.830> takes

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
bevel you can see where it kind of takes

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.630 
bevel you can see where it kind of takes
a<00:02:10.069> turn<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:11.750> be<00:02:11.870> mean<00:02:12.860> out<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.190> how<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.340> taper

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
a turn to be mean out to how the taper

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.360 
a turn to be mean out to how the taper
there<00:02:13.880> at<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.030> very<00:02:14.180> end<00:02:14.360> just<00:02:15.040> color<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.220> in

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
there at the very end just color that in

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.820 
there at the very end just color that in
on<00:02:16.910> both<00:02:17.090> sides<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:18.110> once<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.349> got<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.620> done

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
on both sides so once you got that done

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.350 
on both sides so once you got that done
you're<00:02:19.220> ready<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.520> go<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.760> you'll<00:02:19.910> see<00:02:20.060> why<00:02:20.209> we

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
you're ready to go and you'll see why we

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.180 
you're ready to go and you'll see why we
need<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:21.440> we're<00:02:21.590> gonna<00:02:21.680> start<00:02:22.040> with<00:02:22.160> is

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
need that so we're gonna start with is

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.680 
need that so we're gonna start with is
this<00:02:22.670> coarse<00:02:23.470> grit<00:02:24.470> Lansky<00:02:25.069> stone<00:02:25.690> those

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
this coarse grit Lansky stone those

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.760 
this coarse grit Lansky stone those
different<00:02:26.989> stones<00:02:27.140> out<00:02:27.260> there<00:02:27.410> there's<00:02:27.560> water

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
different stones out there there's water

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.590 
different stones out there there's water
stones<00:02:28.130> there's<00:02:28.489> oil<00:02:28.610> stones<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.120> is<00:02:29.180> an<00:02:29.450> oil

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
stones there's oil stones this is an oil

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.020 
stones there's oil stones this is an oil
stone<00:02:29.989> specifically<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:31.760> just<00:02:31.880> put<00:02:32.000> a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
stone specifically so you just put a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.059 
stone specifically so you just put a
little<00:02:32.239> oil<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:33.470> spread<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:33.709> oil<00:02:33.980> out

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
little oil on it you spread that oil out

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
on there and then you start you want to

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.240 
on there and then you start you want to
start<00:02:35.780> more<00:02:36.170> flat<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.769> where<00:02:36.950> you're<00:02:37.069> going<00:02:37.190> to

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
start more flat to where you're going to

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.330 
start more flat to where you're going to
start<00:02:37.790> removing<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.450> black<00:02:38.750> from<00:02:39.739> this<00:02:40.040> part

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
start removing this black from this part

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.890 
start removing this black from this part
of<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.459> axe<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:40.850> then<00:02:41.300> go<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:41.720> way<00:02:41.870> so

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
of the axe and then go that way so

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.880 
of the axe and then go that way so
you'll<00:02:42.140> see<00:02:42.260> what<00:02:42.350> I'm<00:02:42.440> seeing<00:02:42.560> here<00:02:42.769> in<00:02:42.860> a

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
you'll see what I'm seeing here in a

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.270 
you'll see what I'm seeing here in a
second<00:02:47.140> okay<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.200> can<00:02:48.380> start<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:48.920> see<00:02:49.130> where

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
second okay you can start to see where

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.160 
second okay you can start to see where
I've<00:02:49.459> taken<00:02:49.670> off<00:02:49.850> some<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.150> black<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:51.110> you

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
I've taken off some of that black so you

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.150 
I've taken off some of that black so you
start<00:02:51.470> with<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.799> then<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:51.980> keep

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
start with that and then you keep

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.940 
start with that and then you keep
tipping<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.640> stone<00:02:52.910> this<00:02:53.239> way<00:02:53.480> as<00:02:53.950> you

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
tipping the stone this way as you

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.470 
tipping the stone this way as you
approach<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.790> edge<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.269> want<00:02:56.420> to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
approach to the edge and you want to

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.420 
approach to the edge and you want to
kind<00:02:56.569> of<00:02:56.690> work<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:57.920> know<00:02:57.980> forwards<00:02:58.340> and

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
kind of work you know forwards and

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.699 
kind of work you know forwards and
backwards<00:02:58.580> on<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.000> edge<00:02:59.209> until<00:02:59.870> you<00:03:00.049> get<00:03:00.170> all

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
backwards on that edge until you get all

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.289 
backwards on that edge until you get all
the<00:03:00.920> black<00:03:01.069> off<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.730> can<00:03:04.819> see<00:03:05.030> here<00:03:05.180> I've

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
the black off so you can see here I've

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.400 
the black off so you can see here I've
kind<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.510> gone<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.930> edge<00:03:06.049> a<00:03:06.080> little<00:03:06.260> bit

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
kind of gone to the edge a little bit

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.280 
kind of gone to the edge a little bit
and<00:03:07.000> now<00:03:08.000> there's<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.420> lot<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.630> black<00:03:08.780> left<00:03:09.049> and

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
and now there's a lot of black left and

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.710 
and now there's a lot of black left and
it's<00:03:09.440> left<00:03:09.709> in<00:03:09.859> the<00:03:09.950> grinding<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:11.390> was<00:03:11.540> done

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
it's left in the grinding that was done

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.660 
it's left in the grinding that was done
at<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:11.959> factory<00:03:12.519> um

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
at the factory um

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.160 
at the factory um
there's<00:03:13.910> white<00:03:14.120> slivers<00:03:14.690> between<00:03:14.959> it<00:03:15.079> but

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
there's white slivers between it but

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
there's white slivers between it but
then<00:03:15.260> there's<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.470> black<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:15.920> need<00:03:16.100> to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
then there's the black so you need to

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.920 
then there's the black so you need to
work<00:03:16.340> until<00:03:16.549> all<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:16.910> black<00:03:17.120> is<00:03:17.329> out<00:03:17.540> and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
work until all that black is out and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.810 
work until all that black is out and
with<00:03:18.530> these<00:03:18.620> Lansky<00:03:19.010> stones<00:03:19.250> when<00:03:19.609> if<00:03:19.700> you're

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
with these Lansky stones when if you're

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.860 
with these Lansky stones when if you're
getting<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:20.120> new<00:03:20.239> one<00:03:20.390> you're<00:03:20.480> gonna<00:03:20.540> have<00:03:20.750> to

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
getting a new one you're gonna have to

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.090 
getting a new one you're gonna have to
put<00:03:21.019> quite<00:03:21.140> a<00:03:21.230> bit<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.410> oil<00:03:21.620> into<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:21.950> to

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
put quite a bit of oil into it to

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.039 
put quite a bit of oil into it to
saturate<00:03:22.489> it<00:03:22.609> first<00:03:22.850> it'll<00:03:23.630> just<00:03:23.750> keep<00:03:23.870> stuck

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
saturate it first it'll just keep stuck

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.210 
saturate it first it'll just keep stuck
in<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.200> oil<00:03:24.350> in<00:03:24.500> but<00:03:24.620> you'll<00:03:24.799> get<00:03:24.859> to<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.040> point

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
in the oil in but you'll get to a point

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.280 
in the oil in but you'll get to a point
to<00:03:25.340> where<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.609> oil<00:03:25.790> will<00:03:26.720> just<00:03:26.840> kind<00:03:26.989> of<00:03:27.019> sit

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
to where the oil will just kind of sit

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.259 
to where the oil will just kind of sit
on<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.590> stone<00:03:28.250> like<00:03:28.459> that<00:03:28.670> that's<00:03:29.030> what<00:03:29.180> you

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
on the stone like that that's what you

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.750 
on the stone like that that's what you
want<00:03:29.480> so<00:03:30.040> just<00:03:31.040> keep<00:03:31.280> working<00:03:31.549> on<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:34.700> you

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
want so just keep working on it so you

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.920 
want so just keep working on it so you
can<00:03:34.940> see<00:03:35.150> here<00:03:35.359> I've<00:03:35.480> gotten<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.840> point

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
can see here I've gotten to the point

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.000 
can see here I've gotten to the point
where<00:03:36.049> I've<00:03:36.200> taken<00:03:36.230> off<00:03:36.500> all<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.829> black

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
where I've taken off all the black

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.789 
where I've taken off all the black
marker<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.609> looks<00:03:37.790> nice<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.000> clean<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:39.650> was

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
marker it looks nice and clean that was

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.170 
marker it looks nice and clean that was
that<00:03:40.100> was<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.250> coarse<00:03:40.519> side<00:03:40.700> so<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:40.970> want<00:03:41.120> to

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
that was the coarse side so you want to

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.310 
that was the coarse side so you want to
repeat<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:41.570> on<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.720> other<00:03:41.780> side<00:03:42.049> as<00:03:42.170> well

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
repeat that on the other side as well

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.590 
repeat that on the other side as well
and<00:03:42.760> then<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.790> do<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.150> same<00:03:44.299> thing<00:03:44.480> over

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
and then you do the same thing over

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.710 
and then you do the same thing over
again<00:03:44.720> with<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.650> fine<00:03:45.920> side<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.430> stone<00:03:46.720> so

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
again with the fine side of the stone so

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.300 
again with the fine side of the stone so
just<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.620> then<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:48.829> do<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:49.040> with<00:03:49.130> every

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
just and then you do it with every

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.670 
just and then you do it with every
single<00:03:49.459> grid<00:03:49.760> of<00:03:49.910> stone<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.150> have

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.520 

so<00:03:56.680> guys<00:03:56.860> I<00:03:57.099> just<00:03:57.129> did<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:58.540> coarser<00:03:59.049> grid<00:03:59.319> of

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
so guys I just did the coarser grid of

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.099 
so guys I just did the coarser grid of
the<00:03:59.739> stone<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.489> this<00:04:00.640> point<00:04:00.939> and<00:04:01.209> already<00:04:01.689> you

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
the stone to this point and already you

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.229 
the stone to this point and already you
can<00:04:02.260> see<00:04:02.560> from<00:04:02.769> doing<00:04:03.040> both<00:04:03.189> sides<00:04:03.430> which<00:04:04.090> all

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
can see from doing both sides which all

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.959 
can see from doing both sides which all
you<00:04:04.329> can<00:04:04.450> see<00:04:04.569> all<00:04:04.689> the<00:04:04.920> all<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:06.189> where<00:04:06.909> I've

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:06.969 
you can see all the all that where I've

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:09.479 
you can see all the all that where I've
been<00:04:07.090> doing<00:04:07.329> it<00:04:07.799> already<00:04:08.799> I<00:04:09.040> can<00:04:09.189> cut<00:04:09.340> some

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
been doing it already I can cut some

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.490 
been doing it already I can cut some
paper<00:04:09.609> with<00:04:09.849> it<00:04:09.970> it's<00:04:10.090> not<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.629> best<00:04:10.870> but

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
paper with it it's not the best but

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.559 
paper with it it's not the best but
that's<00:04:11.709> just<00:04:11.859> the<00:04:11.950> first<00:04:12.129> pass<00:04:12.549> so<00:04:13.390> what<00:04:13.510> you

to go as far up this time a little bit
closer<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.539> edge

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
closer to the edge

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.290 
closer to the edge
put<00:04:29.949> it<00:04:30.039> on<00:04:30.130> there<00:04:30.250> on<00:04:30.340> both<00:04:30.460> sides<00:04:30.789> and<00:04:31.120> do<00:04:31.210> the

end<00:04:31.479> then<00:04:31.599> do<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.229> fine<00:04:32.440> finer<00:04:33.430> grit<00:04:33.729> stone<00:04:39.360> so

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
end then do the fine finer grit stone so

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.950 
end then do the fine finer grit stone so
I've<00:04:41.410> done<00:04:41.620> both<00:04:41.800> sides<00:04:41.830> of<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.310> oil<00:04:42.970> stone<00:04:43.240> at

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
I've done both sides of the oil stone at

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.110 
I've done both sides of the oil stone at
this<00:04:44.080> point<00:04:44.410> again<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:45.340> just<00:04:45.550> want<00:04:45.729> to<00:04:45.789> wipe

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
this point again you just want to wipe

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.180 
this point again you just want to wipe
it<00:04:46.300> down<00:04:46.389> or<00:04:46.539> any<00:04:46.660> wall<00:04:46.949> just<00:04:47.949> give<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.130> a

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
it down or any wall just give it a

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.210 
it down or any wall just give it a
little<00:04:48.310> test<00:04:48.550> here<00:04:48.759> for<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.840> two<00:04:50.220> sessions

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
little test here for the two sessions

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.600 
little test here for the two sessions
we've<00:04:51.340> done<00:04:51.520> so<00:04:51.849> far<00:04:52.169> see<00:04:53.169> how<00:04:53.259> we<00:04:53.590> are<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:54.099> mean

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
we've done so far see how we are I mean

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.249 
we've done so far see how we are I mean
we're<00:04:55.509> getting<00:04:55.599> a<00:04:55.750> little<00:04:55.840> bit<00:04:56.050> of<00:04:56.139> that

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
we're getting a little bit of that

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.649 
we're getting a little bit of that
cutting<00:04:56.530> edge<00:04:56.970> but<00:04:57.970> this<00:04:58.090> is<00:04:58.210> where<00:04:58.360> we<00:04:58.449> go<00:04:58.539> on

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
cutting edge but this is where we go on

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:05.159 
cutting edge but this is where we go on
to<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:58.870> water<00:04:59.050> stone<00:05:03.720> for<00:05:04.720> this<00:05:04.870> part

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
to the water stone for this part

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.730 
to the water stone for this part
actually<00:05:05.520> these<00:05:06.520> are<00:05:07.020> square<00:05:08.020> flat<00:05:08.409> stones

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
actually these are square flat stones

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.680 
actually these are square flat stones
alright<00:05:09.280> and<00:05:09.729> something<00:05:10.090> one<00:05:10.240> way<00:05:10.360> actually<00:05:10.510> a

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
alright and something one way actually a

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.170 
alright and something one way actually a
lot<00:05:10.930> better<00:05:11.310> because<00:05:12.310> you're<00:05:12.580> able<00:05:12.820> to<00:05:12.849> adjust

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
lot better because you're able to adjust

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.969 
lot better because you're able to adjust
the<00:05:13.690> angle<00:05:13.870> that<00:05:14.199> you<00:05:14.349> done<00:05:14.740> that<00:05:14.889> you're

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
the angle that you done that you're

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.520 
the angle that you done that you're
going<00:05:15.099> to<00:05:15.130> be<00:05:15.250> honing<00:05:15.430> with<00:05:15.699> much<00:05:16.510> better<00:05:16.720> so

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
going to be honing with much better so

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.260 
going to be honing with much better so
you<00:05:17.620> want<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.830> start<00:05:18.070> kind<00:05:18.460> of<00:05:18.490> almost<00:05:18.669> you

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
you want to start kind of almost you

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.210 
you want to start kind of almost you
know<00:05:19.360> put<00:05:19.840> it<00:05:19.870> down<00:05:20.080> on<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.409> blade<00:05:20.830> like<00:05:20.979> that

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
know put it down on the blade like that

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.860 
know put it down on the blade like that
and<00:05:21.970> then<00:05:22.090> just<00:05:22.120> lift<00:05:22.360> it<00:05:22.449> up<00:05:22.539> just<00:05:22.659> a<00:05:22.840> little

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
and then just lift it up just a little

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.480 
and then just lift it up just a little
bit<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:24.310> then<00:05:24.550> just<00:05:24.580> start<00:05:26.010> start<00:05:27.010> sliding<00:05:27.220> it

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
bit and then just start start sliding it

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.200 
bit and then just start start sliding it
on<00:05:27.729> the<00:05:28.000> blade<00:05:28.180> like<00:05:28.389> that<00:05:29.940> okay<00:05:30.940> now<00:05:31.060> you<00:05:31.120> can

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
on the blade like that okay now you can

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.420 
on the blade like that okay now you can
start<00:05:31.449> to<00:05:31.570> see<00:05:31.690> that<00:05:31.840> I'm<00:05:31.930> starting<00:05:32.169> to<00:05:32.430> get

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
start to see that I'm starting to get

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.000 
start to see that I'm starting to get
some<00:05:33.729> of<00:05:33.849> that<00:05:33.930> felt<00:05:34.930> marker<00:05:35.289> off

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.170 

you<00:05:39.010> just<00:05:39.160> keep<00:05:39.310> doing<00:05:39.580> that<00:05:39.610> until<00:05:39.700> you<00:05:40.060> get

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
you just keep doing that until you get

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.400 
you just keep doing that until you get
all<00:05:40.300> of<00:05:40.420> it<00:05:40.480> off<00:05:40.630> just<00:05:40.840> a<00:05:40.900> little<00:05:41.110> by<00:05:41.170> little

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
all of it off just a little by little

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.480 
all of it off just a little by little
and<00:05:42.400> stop<00:05:42.880> right<00:05:43.180> before<00:05:43.210> right<00:05:44.190> as<00:05:45.190> soon<00:05:45.370> as

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
and stop right before right as soon as

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.860 
and stop right before right as soon as
you've<00:05:45.610> done<00:05:45.640> taking<00:05:46.150> all<00:05:46.330> of<00:05:46.450> it<00:05:46.540> off<00:05:46.630> along

you've done taking all of it off along

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.590 
you've done taking all of it off along
the<00:05:47.020> edge<00:05:47.820> this<00:05:48.820> will<00:05:48.970> take<00:05:49.090> some<00:05:49.240> practice

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
the edge this will take some practice

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.580 
the edge this will take some practice
and<00:05:49.720> hope<00:05:49.870> they<00:05:50.050> know<00:05:50.170> the<00:05:50.260> proper<00:05:50.410> way<00:05:50.560> to

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
and hope they know the proper way to

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.500 
and hope they know the proper way to
hold<00:05:50.800> it<00:05:50.980> and<00:05:51.160> give<00:05:51.760> just<00:05:51.910> fine<00:05:52.060> to<00:05:52.210> come<00:05:52.360> from

hold it and give just fine to come from
comfortable<00:05:52.960> zone<00:05:53.080> for<00:05:53.920> you<00:05:54.040> once<00:05:54.670> you<00:05:54.760> get<00:05:54.850> to

comfortable zone for you once you get to

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.000 
comfortable zone for you once you get to
the<00:05:55.030> very<00:05:55.180> fine<00:05:55.510> part<00:05:56.250> or<00:05:57.250> fine<00:05:57.460> grit<00:05:57.790> stone

the very fine part or fine grit stone
you<00:06:00.010> can<00:06:00.130> always<00:06:00.340> tell<00:06:00.580> where<00:06:00.820> it's<00:06:00.970> dull<00:06:01.270> by

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
you can always tell where it's dull by

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.320 
you can always tell where it's dull by
just<00:06:01.960> looking<00:06:02.200> at<00:06:02.290> it<00:06:02.410> like<00:06:02.440> this<00:06:02.790> and<00:06:03.790> you<00:06:04.210> can

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
just looking at it like this and you can

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.040 
just looking at it like this and you can
see<00:06:04.570> where<00:06:04.720> your<00:06:04.840> eyes<00:06:04.990> stop<00:06:05.410> so<00:06:05.650> this<00:06:06.070> um

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
see where your eyes stop so this um

there's<00:06:30.640> a<00:06:30.700> little<00:06:30.880> bit<00:06:30.970> of<00:06:31.000> a<00:06:31.120> dull<00:06:31.360> spot<00:06:31.390> it's

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
there's a little bit of a dull spot it's

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.360 
there's a little bit of a dull spot it's
just<00:06:31.990> a<00:06:32.050> slight<00:06:32.290> bit<00:06:32.320> dull<00:06:33.040> here<00:06:33.250> in<00:06:33.310> the

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
just a slight bit dull here in the

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.980 
just a slight bit dull here in the
middle<00:06:33.550> I've<00:06:33.610> been<00:06:33.700> trying<00:06:33.880> to<00:06:33.970> work<00:06:34.660> that<00:06:34.840> out

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
middle I've been trying to work that out

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.820 
middle I've been trying to work that out
so<00:06:35.020> that<00:06:35.350> that<00:06:35.680> goes<00:06:35.830> away<00:06:37.560> so<00:06:38.560> you<00:06:38.680> can<00:06:38.800> see

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
so that that goes away so you can see

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.090 
so that that goes away so you can see
right<00:06:39.310> when<00:06:39.550> I<00:06:39.580> get<00:06:39.670> to<00:06:39.910> the<00:06:40.000> middle<00:06:40.950> kind<00:06:41.950> of

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
right when I get to the middle kind of

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.570 
right when I get to the middle kind of
stops<00:06:42.570> cutting<00:06:43.570> really<00:06:43.780> well<00:06:44.340> but<00:06:45.340> it<00:06:45.460> is

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
stops cutting really well but it is

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.910 
stops cutting really well but it is
still<00:06:45.880> pretty<00:06:46.030> good<00:06:46.440> resolving<00:06:47.440> it<00:06:47.560> to<00:06:47.650> do<00:06:47.740> one

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
still pretty good resolving it to do one

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.400 
still pretty good resolving it to do one

see that beautiful edge coming on at the
very<00:07:10.750> tip<00:07:11.490> at<00:07:12.490> the<00:07:12.580> very<00:07:12.790> end<00:07:13.030> I<00:07:14.070> just<00:07:15.070> want<00:07:15.400> to
