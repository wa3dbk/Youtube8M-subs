 show sponsor site get mutant 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:16.840
 dot com hello everyone ate more 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.150
 more I fuck a million times repeated 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.730
 but I will say this phrase again because 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.190
 that many need to hear it again and 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.820
 there were times when I had a day 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.690
 there were 12 meals i fuck never 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.450
 missed and 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.089
 used to go to bed at 3 in the morning and had to 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.160
 get up at 6 to somehow fit 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:38.289
 these 12 meals 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.359
 I was so obsessed with becoming 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.760
 best bodybuilder as far as it is only 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:46.510
 Perhaps this concerns training 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.339
 concerns sleep cardio concerns food and i 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.129
 did everything that was required 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:54.010
 this is what Ivan should do and 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.039
 so often I told people how 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.050
 they should come but it is not always 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.870
 spread to me because yes 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.339
 I know what it is I have experience 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.500
 competitive performances in 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.170
 bodybuilding when I was not interested 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.469
 something but the desire to be the best 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.119
 bodybuilder in the world this was my goal 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:15.430
 now my life is full of other shit 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.409
 which is more important than just 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.960
 develop the best possible and body and 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.600
 last seven eight years i'm not eating anymore 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.659
 every two to three hours without cramming 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.270
 12 mother of their meals if i am so 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.579
 would have done it would have increased 160 kilos 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.920
 their muscles at the same time would go bankrupt where 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.750
 find so much money like that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.780
 more that would have had all the time just 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.180
 eat and cook but for those people for 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.299
 which competitive goal is relevant 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.759
 and you need to act but rather a thought 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.310
 which I want to convey to you is that 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.150
 It's been 8 years since I was eating 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.310
 as a bodybuilder 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.650
 but here I decided to take delivery 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.200
 food company supplies me with admission 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.020
 quality food so I donâ€™t have 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.540
 excuses for not having me now 8 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.240
 meals a day I eat them all and 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.850
 so it goes on six days a week and i 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.009
 I follow the program clearly because but this 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.740
 elementary I have already prepared everything 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.320
 packed brought throw food in a bag and 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.540
 getting out of the house is just very comfortable 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.450
 service and I feel again 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.090
 bodybuilder and I can not believe in 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.790
 change in your body in six 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.770
 days of similar food, even in my 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.060
 face probably shows that excess water 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.760
 out of the body 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.240
 I probably lost more than three liters 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.900
 water 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.490
 press motive looks with zion and 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.459
 worked and all because of the simplest 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.800
 changes in my diet and no i don't 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.420
 started doing trenbolone injections which 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.410
 would have provoked that 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.260
 no it's all about food and just awesome 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.170
 how important is our diet with you 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.660
 when you eat 8 times a day you get 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.000
 just a stark effect if before 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.459
 you ate four five times a day then 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.489
 result from 8 meals versus 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.860
 with four just incredible and no 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.570
 no point even trying to become 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.880
 bodybuilder trying to perform on 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.340
 tournaments and even think about it if you 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.250
 you will eat only four times a day 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.200
 just pointless it's like well 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.180
 let's say i will open a business and will dedicate 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.280
 he is only 4 hours a day 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.310
 What kind of business is this right there? 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.739
 it will be covered so success is not achieved but 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.080
 if i work 16 hours a day 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.239
 developing my business I will 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.120
 good chances to develop a successful business 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.459
 also in bodybuilding if you will 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.410
 eat four times a day who does not become 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.200
 you are a successful body builder 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.080
 you don't do what's necessary for this 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.180
 but if you have 12 motive meals 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.519
 per day then you do even beyond 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.700
 necessary here is the makings of a successful 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.670
 person who cooks all meals 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.609
 in his kitchen puts all this food 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.319
 takes everywhere wherever he goes no 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.420
 excuses 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.409
 don't miss no food no 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.290
 workout 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.719
 that's what you want me to do well myself 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.599
 feel because doing so myself 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:12.609
 this food is already cooked for me by this i 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.769
 and want to share with all people 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.930
 I know how important it is to 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.509
 constantly talking about it and let me 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.400
 sports supplement company I appreciate food 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.860
 above own products 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.620
 so it really matters and I myself 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.080
 I know this very well, but with 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.419
 I can hardly believe how mine changed 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.570
 body in just six days with such 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.199
 ration 8 meals per day and before 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.570
 almost every two hours and body substantially 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.610
 changed in some six days and yes I 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.009
 I share it with you because this fact 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.490
 shows how fuck all the same 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:51.370
 important yes yes exactly and yes they are farm no 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.500
 if you do not eat properly closing shop 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.570
 is recorded on the golf course or anywhere else 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.250
 up because when it comes to food 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:02.680
 you have to give all the best to the full this 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.659
 one of the key elements of success when 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.050
 it comes to bodybuilding 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:12.270
