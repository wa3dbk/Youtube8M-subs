00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
see with the light it kind of gets a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.879 
see with the light it kind of gets a
little<00:02:44.870> bit<00:02:45.049> better<00:02:45.230> on<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:47.630> 6900<00:02:48.470> series<00:02:48.500> we

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
little bit better on the 6900 series we

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:53.920 
little bit better on the 6900 series we
can<00:02:49.040> see<00:02:49.190> that<00:02:49.310> as<00:02:49.549> well<00:02:52.690> it's<00:02:53.690> got<00:02:53.840> the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.710 
can see that as well it's got the
Indiglo<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.760> yes<00:02:55.760> it's<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.090> mirror<00:02:56.389> but<00:02:56.540> it's
