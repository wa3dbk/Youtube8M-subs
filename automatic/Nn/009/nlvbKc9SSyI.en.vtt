00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
let's just go ahead and show it's very

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.200 
let's just go ahead and show it's very
simple<00:00:22.369> just<00:00:23.369> make<00:00:23.430> sure<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:23.910> your

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
simple just make sure you know your

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.849 
simple just make sure you know your
players<00:00:24.480> release<00:00:24.930> if<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.289> know<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.560> release

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
players release if you know is release

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.279 
players release if you know is release
you're<00:00:26.099> gonna<00:00:26.189> make<00:00:26.460> these<00:00:26.609> shots<00:00:26.910> very<00:00:27.000> easy

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.450 

so<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.410> pretty<00:00:31.560> simple<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.099> pick<00:00:32.369> up

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
so it's pretty simple you just pick up

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.450 
so it's pretty simple you just pick up
the<00:00:32.610> ball<00:00:33.260> go<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.530> range<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.219> want<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

just<00:00:38.700> let<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.969> fly<00:00:39.260> now<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.320> only<00:00:40.500> thing<00:00:40.739> I

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
just let it fly now the only thing I

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.590 
just let it fly now the only thing I
don't<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.129> about<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.550> drill<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.059> you

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
don't like about the drill is that you

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.810 
don't like about the drill is that you
don't<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:42.840> anybody<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.430> pass<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> ball

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.389 
don't have anybody to pass you the ball
after<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> shot<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.800> shoot<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.190> go

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
after a shot so you have to shoot it go

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.020 
after a shot so you have to shoot it go
get<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
get it

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.260

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.100 
probably going to be using turbo in this
mode<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.879> you're<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.239> are<00:00:54.390> time<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.050> you
