of<00:01:55.500> being<00:01:55.530> nothing<00:01:55.979> more<00:01:56.189> than<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> monster

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.670 
truck of fuck and it doesn't even look
cool<00:01:59.850> so<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:01.140> has<00:02:01.290> nothing<00:02:01.530> going

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680

cool so it really just has nothing going
for<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.430> mean<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.149> guess<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.450> could<00:02:03.479> use<00:02:03.750> it

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
for it I mean I guess you could use it

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.420 
for it I mean I guess you could use it
to<00:02:03.960> scratch<00:02:04.229> your<00:02:04.469> ass<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.009> really<00:02:05.250> needed

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
to scratch your ass if you really needed

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.010 
to scratch your ass if you really needed
to<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.060> would<00:02:06.149> only<00:02:06.240> be<00:02:06.509> used<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
to but that would only be used in the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.619 
to but that would only be used in the
most<00:02:07.170> desperate<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.860> situations<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
most desperate of situations and the

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.070 
most desperate of situations and the
next<00:02:09.869> one<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.110> actually<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.470> good<00:02:10.619> weapon

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
next one is actually a good weapon

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.260 
next one is actually a good weapon
for<00:02:11.200> once<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:11.740> in<00:02:11.950> liars<00:02:12.220> retreat<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:13.150> can

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
for once it is in liars retreat you can

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.700 
for once it is in liars retreat you can
get<00:02:13.390> there<00:02:13.600> from<00:02:13.810> any<00:02:14.170> of<00:02:14.290> these<00:02:14.410> three

get there from any of these three

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.530 
get there from any of these three
locations<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.490> towers<00:02:15.850> is<00:02:16.000> probably<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
locations the towers is probably the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.750 
locations the towers is probably the
easiest<00:02:16.660> because<00:02:17.050> those<00:02:17.410> are<00:02:17.650> pretty<00:02:17.800> easy<00:02:18.610> to

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
easiest because those are pretty easy to

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.670 
easiest because those are pretty easy to
find<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.330> though<00:02:20.170> once<00:02:20.380> you're<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.620> here

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
find and though once you're in here

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
a long-ass journey back there so this

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.180 
a long-ass journey back there so this
expedition<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.230> something<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.800> should<00:02:48.010> not

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
expedition is something that should not

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.430 
expedition is something that should not
be<00:02:48.220> traversed<00:02:48.850> without<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.840> assistance<00:02:50.110> of

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
be traversed without the assistance of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
pornography so that's just my

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.720 
pornography so that's just my

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
recommendation you don't have to do that

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.060 
recommendation you don't have to do that
