just to give you an insight into the
uses<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.400> benefits<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.000> using<00:00:15.150> concave

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
uses and the benefits of using concave

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.260 
uses and the benefits of using concave
steel<00:00:16.220> scared<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.369> say<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:17.609> I've<00:00:17.910> been<00:00:18.090> true

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
steel scared to say but I've been true

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.029 
steel scared to say but I've been true
for<00:00:18.449> over<00:00:18.660> thirty<00:00:18.869> years<00:00:18.990> now<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.390> probably

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
for over thirty years now and probably

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.740 
for over thirty years now and probably
99%<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.160> all<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.519> feet<00:00:23.699> are<00:00:23.820> ever<00:00:23.910> shod<00:00:24.150> have

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
99% of all the feet are ever shod have

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.970 
99% of all the feet are ever shod have
been<00:00:25.050> shot<00:00:25.740> with<00:00:25.890> concave<00:00:26.340> shoes<00:00:27.380> it's<00:00:28.380> so

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
been shot with concave shoes it's so

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.980 
been shot with concave shoes it's so
versatile<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.789> use<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:30.779> most

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
versatile you can use it for most

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.590 
versatile you can use it for most
applications<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:32.700> only<00:00:32.910> application<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
applications the only application the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.060 
applications the only application the
probably<00:00:34.020> wouldn't<00:00:34.200> want<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> use<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:34.800> is

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
probably wouldn't want to use it for is

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.979 
probably wouldn't want to use it for is
the<00:00:35.579> hind<00:00:35.820> end<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.239> slider<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:38.989> concave

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the hind end of a slider the concave

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.930 
the hind end of a slider the concave
profile<00:00:40.410> itself<00:00:40.770> gives<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.820> horse

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
profile itself gives the horse

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.020 
profile itself gives the horse
extraction<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.170> because<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.309> following

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
extraction so because of this following

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.410 
extraction so because of this following
and<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.660> way<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> concave<00:00:46.440> profile<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.129> made

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
and the way the concave profile is made

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.760 
and the way the concave profile is made
that's<00:00:48.420> why<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.960> shoe<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.350> increased

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
that's why you can shoe with increased

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.970 
that's why you can shoe with increased
width<00:00:50.010> or<00:00:50.640> increase<00:00:51.300> thickness<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.410> give

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
width or increase thickness to give

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.240 
width or increase thickness to give
cover<00:00:53.579> or<00:00:54.149> height<00:00:54.870> without<00:00:55.590> increasing<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
cover or height without increasing the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.490 
cover or height without increasing the
weight<00:00:56.520> another<00:00:57.300> great<00:00:57.570> benefit<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> one

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
weight another great benefit and the one

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.470 
weight another great benefit and the one
I<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.510> that<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.660> will<00:01:01.370> easily

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
I really like is that it will easily

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.759 
I really like is that it will easily

some basics you making skills

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.170 
some basics you making skills
not<00:01:43.770> much<00:01:43.950> fortune<00:01:44.430> involved<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> only

not much fortune involved the only
fortune<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> making<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> concave<00:01:47.399> shoe

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
fortune in the making the concave shoe

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.030 
fortune in the making the concave shoe
is<00:01:47.729> fortune<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> heels<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.950> forging<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.160 
simple leverage mechanics very very easy
but<00:01:58.100> before<00:01:58.460> we<00:01:58.580> do<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:58.730> what<00:01:59.480> I<00:01:59.510> do<00:01:59.720> is<00:01:59.780> break

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
but before we do that what I do is break

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.160 
but before we do that what I do is break
those<00:02:00.470> all<00:02:01.100> those<00:02:01.430> stages<00:02:01.790> down<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.570> then

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
those all those stages down and then

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.950 
those all those stages down and then
we'll<00:02:03.380> make<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.830> pair<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:04.100> shoes<00:02:04.600> just<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.750> see

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
we'll make a pair of shoes just to see

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.660 
we'll make a pair of shoes just to see
what<00:02:06.110> it's<00:02:06.230> like<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.440> how<00:02:06.830> easy<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.220> is<00:02:07.340> to

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
what it's like and how easy it is to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.720 
what it's like and how easy it is to
make<00:02:07.850> them<00:02:08.000> in<00:02:08.090> real<00:02:08.330> time<00:02:08.360> okay

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
make them in real time okay

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.890 
make them in real time okay

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
of the heel hold it over the end that

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.870 
of the heel hold it over the end that
they<00:02:13.850> hold<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.900> over<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.080> former<00:02:15.730> drop<00:02:16.730> you're

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
they hold it over the former drop you're

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.180 
they hold it over the former drop you're
hammering<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:18.230> as<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.500> material<00:02:18.860> starts<00:02:19.010> to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
hammering and as the material starts to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.090 
hammering and as the material starts to
snap<00:02:19.400> then<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.000> move<00:02:20.180> your<00:02:20.210> left<00:02:20.480> hand<00:02:20.630> under

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
snap then you move your left hand under

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.640 
snap then you move your left hand under

if<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.070> can<00:02:43.220> get<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.550> on<00:02:43.700> your<00:02:43.820> horse's<00:02:44.180> feet

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
if you can get that on your horse's feet

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.290
