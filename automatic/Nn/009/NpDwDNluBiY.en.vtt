00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.410 

well<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.610> doesn't<00:01:17.820> work<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.270> all

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
well this one doesn't work at all

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.170 
well this one doesn't work at all
because<00:01:18.900> as<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.439> see<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.860> drawer<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.340> too

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
because as you can see the drawer is too

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.940 
because as you can see the drawer is too
big<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:21.810> shallower<00:01:22.229> drawers<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.799> in

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
big it's for shallower drawers like in

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.850 
big it's for shallower drawers like in
the<00:01:23.040> kitchen<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:24.780> I'm<00:01:25.320> sure<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.680> would<00:01:25.799> work

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the kitchen and I'm sure it would work

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.450 
the kitchen and I'm sure it would work
good<00:01:26.250> especially<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.659> longer<00:01:28.650> handle

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
good especially with the longer handle

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.179 
good especially with the longer handle
type<00:01:29.670> inside<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.450> knobs<00:01:30.829> lay<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:31.950> both

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
type inside of the knobs lay out both

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.190 
type inside of the knobs lay out both
holes<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.759> them<00:01:32.850> spaced<00:01:33.150> evenly<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
holes and get them spaced evenly this

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
holes and get them spaced evenly this
one<00:01:34.409> I'm<00:01:34.530> sure<00:01:34.560> would<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:35.009> good<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.880> some<00:01:36.210> doors

where I like it I don't like it right at
the<00:02:06.270> top<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:06.840> you're<00:02:06.990> pulling<00:02:07.290> on

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.770 
take a lot of force to open the door I
just<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> little<00:02:12.060> lure<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.510> think<00:02:12.690> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
just like a little lure and I think it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.000 
just like a little lure and I think it
looks<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.050> little<00:02:13.140> more<00:02:13.560> banal

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
looks a little more banal

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.160 
looks a little more banal
that<00:02:14.220> way<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:15.239> all<00:02:15.360> personal<00:02:15.900> preference

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
that way it's all personal preference

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.580 
that way it's all personal preference
really<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:18.030> once<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.329> do<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.439> take

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
really so once you do that you just take

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.869 
really so once you do that you just take
a<00:02:19.650> drill<00:02:19.950> bit<00:02:20.129> now

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.610 
yep 3/16 drill bit I like one of the
little<00:02:38.340> point<00:02:38.610> on<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.109> so<00:02:40.109> it<00:02:40.170> doesn't<00:02:40.230> wander

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
little point on it so it doesn't wander

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.550 
little point on it so it doesn't wander
in<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.980> wood<00:02:41.159> and<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:42.390> just<00:02:42.900> line<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.409> on

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
in the wood and you just line it up on

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.289 
in the wood and you just line it up on
your<00:02:43.769> mark

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
your mark

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.550 
your mark
keep<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.450> straight<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.079> don't<00:02:46.230> want<00:02:46.470> it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
keep it straight you don't want it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.009 
keep it straight you don't want it
sideways<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.250> down<00:02:48.769> and<00:02:50.209> I<00:02:51.209> always<00:02:51.480> open<00:02:51.900> these

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
sideways up down and I always open these

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.830 
sideways up down and I always open these
because<00:02:52.769> as<00:02:53.099> you<00:02:53.579> can<00:02:53.700> see<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.659> pretty

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
because as you can see this is pretty

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.539 
because as you can see this is pretty
close<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.829> don't<00:02:56.040> want<00:02:56.159> to<00:02:56.220> drill<00:02:56.400> into

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
close so you don't want to drill into

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.510 
close so you don't want to drill into
that

and just pop her through careful not to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.560 
and just pop her through careful not to
have<00:03:04.280> your<00:03:04.400> hand<00:03:04.610> behind<00:03:04.790> there<00:03:05.090> obviously

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
that would leave a mark

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.080 
that would leave a mark
now<00:03:08.710> screws<00:03:09.710> that<00:03:09.830> come<00:03:09.980> with<00:03:10.040> these<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.550> fine

you got your face board here so the

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.780 
you got your face board here so the
problem<00:04:05.350> now<00:04:06.350> is<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:07.160> screws<00:04:07.430> that<00:04:07.549> came<00:04:07.730> with

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
problem now is the screws that came with

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.020 
problem now is the screws that came with
these<00:04:08.200> which<00:04:09.200> I<00:04:09.350> just<00:04:09.530> use<00:04:12.580> open<00:04:13.580> another<00:04:13.820> one

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
these which I just use open another one

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.750 
these which I just use open another one
up<00:04:14.180> quick<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:18.799> screw<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.250> comes<00:04:19.459> with<00:04:19.640> these

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
up quick the screw that comes with these

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.330 
up quick the screw that comes with these
is<00:04:20.060> I'm<00:04:20.780> not<00:04:20.959> even<00:04:21.140> going<00:04:21.290> to<00:04:21.350> measure<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.799> it

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
is I'm not even going to measure it it

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.040 
is I'm not even going to measure it it
looks<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.700> be<00:04:22.850> one<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.390> three<00:04:23.630> quarters

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
looks to be one of three quarters

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.320 
looks to be one of three quarters
probably<00:04:24.919> about<00:04:25.040> an<00:04:25.190> inch<00:04:25.370> inch<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:26.210> a

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
probably about an inch inch and a

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.940 
probably about an inch inch and a
quarter<00:04:28.360> but<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.750> put<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.020> in<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.470> as<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:30.860> can

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
quarter but you put it in and as you can

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.480 
quarter but you put it in and as you can
see<00:04:31.010> it<00:04:31.790> doesn't<00:04:32.030> stick<00:04:32.419> out<00:04:32.800> it's<00:04:33.800> too<00:04:34.190> short

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
see it doesn't stick out it's too short

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.830

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.929 

now<00:05:36.229> these<00:05:36.379> drawers<00:05:36.620> I<00:05:36.949> assume<00:05:37.520> it's<00:05:37.729> a

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:37.939 
now these drawers I assume it's a

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:40.869 
now these drawers I assume it's a
closing<00:05:38.870> feature<00:05:39.159> they<00:05:40.159> are<00:05:40.309> a<00:05:40.339> little<00:05:40.580> hard

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:40.879 
closing feature they are a little hard

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.909 
closing feature they are a little hard
to<00:05:41.029> open<00:05:41.059> when<00:05:41.839> you<00:05:41.960> first<00:05:42.139> start<00:05:42.439> they<00:05:42.589> stop

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
to open when you first start they stop

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.879 
to open when you first start they stop
right<00:05:43.249> about<00:05:43.490> here<00:05:43.999> I<00:05:44.499> think<00:05:45.499> there's<00:05:45.800> a

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
right about here I think there's a

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.950 
right about here I think there's a
spring<00:05:46.249> in<00:05:46.370> there<00:05:46.580> the<00:05:46.999> soft<00:05:47.300> closed<00:05:47.599> spring

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
spring in there the soft closed spring

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.189 
spring in there the soft closed spring
and<00:05:48.229> hold<00:05:48.589> them<00:05:48.800> so<00:05:49.729> I<00:05:50.149> don't<00:05:50.990> know<00:05:51.050> if<00:05:51.110> they

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
and hold them so I don't know if they

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.659 
and hold them so I don't know if they
loosen<00:05:51.559> up<00:05:51.649> over<00:05:51.919> time<00:05:52.099> or<00:05:52.279> if<00:05:52.339> that's<00:05:52.430> just

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
loosen up over time or if that's just

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.369 
loosen up over time or if that's just
the<00:05:52.759> way<00:05:52.849> they<00:05:52.999> are<00:05:53.029> but<00:05:53.749> it<00:05:53.990> takes<00:05:54.139> a<00:05:54.259> little

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:54.379 
the way they are but it takes a little

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:56.709 
the way they are but it takes a little
bit<00:05:54.499> to<00:05:54.620> open<00:05:54.649> a<00:05:54.889> but<00:05:55.099> I<00:05:55.279> really<00:05:55.669> like<00:05:55.879> that<00:05:56.599> you

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:56.719 
bit to open a but I really like that you

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:01.600 
bit to open a but I really like that you
can't<00:05:56.930> slam<00:05:57.349> them<00:05:59.830> nice<00:06:00.830> and<00:06:00.949> soft<00:06:01.339> and<00:06:01.490> the

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
can't slam them nice and soft and the

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.149 
can't slam them nice and soft and the
door<00:06:01.819> has<00:06:02.029> something<00:06:02.389> to<00:06:02.539> that<00:06:03.099> prevents<00:06:04.099> it

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:04.159 
door has something to that prevents it

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.939 
door has something to that prevents it
from<00:06:04.279> being<00:06:04.520> slammed<00:06:04.789> I<00:06:05.469> guess<00:06:06.469> if<00:06:06.620> you<00:06:06.710> slam

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
from being slammed I guess if you slam

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.179 
from being slammed I guess if you slam
it<00:06:07.009> hard<00:06:07.129> enough<00:06:07.399> it'll<00:06:08.050> look<00:06:09.050> but<00:06:09.289> the<00:06:09.800> normal

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:10.189 
it hard enough it'll look but the normal

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:13.510 
it hard enough it'll look but the normal
closing<00:06:10.479> can't<00:06:11.479> slam<00:06:11.809> it<00:06:11.960> so<00:06:12.740> there<00:06:13.339> you<00:06:13.490> have

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
closing can't slam it so there you have

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.279 
closing can't slam it so there you have
it

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
it

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.689 
it
nothing<00:06:15.289> major<00:06:15.499> if<00:06:15.860> you<00:06:16.189> use<00:06:16.459> the<00:06:16.669> old

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
nothing major if you use the old

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.989 
nothing major if you use the old
