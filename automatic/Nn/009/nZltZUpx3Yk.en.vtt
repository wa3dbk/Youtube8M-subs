00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
to go about actually using this thing

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.739 
to go about actually using this thing
and<00:00:26.710> so<00:00:27.220> to<00:00:27.279> start<00:00:27.400> off<00:00:27.759> with<00:00:28.029> I<00:00:28.269> got<00:00:28.630> this

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:28.749 
and so to start off with I got this

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.870 
and so to start off with I got this
airless<00:00:29.079> sprayer<00:00:29.230> sitting<00:00:29.589> here<00:00:29.829> and<00:00:29.980> every

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
airless sprayer sitting here and every

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.910 
airless sprayer sitting here and every
airless<00:00:31.210> sprayer<00:00:31.449> is<00:00:31.630> going<00:00:31.779> to<00:00:31.839> have<00:00:32.050> on<00:00:32.500> it

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
airless sprayer is going to have on it

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.610 
airless sprayer is going to have on it
an<00:00:33.070> on/off<00:00:33.640> switch<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:35.050> so<00:00:35.230> you<00:00:35.290> want<00:00:35.530> to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
an on/off switch and so you want to

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.680 
an on/off switch and so you want to
identify<00:00:35.650> the<00:00:36.250> on/off<00:00:36.880> switch<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.390> make<00:00:37.510> sure

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
identify the on/off switch and make sure

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.180 
identify the on/off switch and make sure
that<00:00:37.840> thing<00:00:38.080> is<00:00:38.260> in<00:00:38.440> an<00:00:38.530> off<00:00:38.650> position<00:00:38.920> before

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
that thing is in an off position before

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.340 
that thing is in an off position before
you<00:00:39.490> begin<00:00:39.790> doing<00:00:40.060> anything<00:00:40.390> with<00:00:40.570> it<00:00:40.780> this

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
you begin doing anything with it this

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.930 
you begin doing anything with it this
Titan<00:00:41.800> right<00:00:41.920> here<00:00:42.160> has<00:00:42.340> an<00:00:42.550> on/off<00:00:42.910> switch

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
Titan right here has an on/off switch

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.450 
Titan right here has an on/off switch
right<00:00:43.780> there<00:00:43.810> that<00:00:44.170> turns<00:00:44.380> the<00:00:44.620> unit<00:00:44.650> on<00:00:45.100> and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
right there that turns the unit on and

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.220 
right there that turns the unit on and
makes<00:00:45.880> it<00:00:46.030> so<00:00:46.180> it's<00:00:46.300> functional<00:00:46.810> this<00:00:46.930> is<00:00:46.990> an

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
makes it so it's functional this is an

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.140 
makes it so it's functional this is an
electric<00:00:47.860> airless<00:00:48.220> sprayer<00:00:48.370> there's<00:00:48.850> also

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
electric airless sprayer there's also

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.700 
electric airless sprayer there's also
gas<00:00:49.570> airless<00:00:50.080> wares<00:00:50.290> but<00:00:50.440> we<00:00:50.530> won't<00:00:50.680> be

electric you're also going to have some
type<00:00:54.400> of<00:00:54.430> knob<00:00:55.330> that<00:00:55.630> controls<00:00:56.080> the<00:00:56.290> pressure

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
type of knob that controls the pressure

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.080 
type of knob that controls the pressure
right<00:00:56.980> here<00:00:57.220> and<00:00:57.430> this<00:00:57.550> is<00:00:57.610> the<00:00:57.850> pressure

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
right here and this is the pressure

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.060 
right here and this is the pressure
control<00:00:58.570> knob<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.020> that's<00:00:59.410> what<00:00:59.650> actually

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
control knob and that's what actually

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.730 
control knob and that's what actually
controls<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.640> pressure<00:01:00.910> coming<00:01:01.300> out<00:01:01.840> of<00:01:02.170> your

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
controls the pressure coming out of your

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.359 
controls the pressure coming out of your
gun<00:01:03.070> right<00:01:03.310> here<00:01:03.610> and<00:01:04.350> I've<00:01:05.350> got<00:01:05.409> my<00:01:05.740> cord<00:01:06.100> this

is<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.800> pretty<00:01:15.130> convenient<00:01:15.580> manifold<00:01:16.240> filter

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
is a pretty convenient manifold filter

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.510 
is a pretty convenient manifold filter
that<00:01:16.750> actually<00:01:17.110> unscrews<00:01:17.680> without<00:01:17.979> any<00:01:18.130> tools

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
that actually unscrews without any tools

that actually unscrews without any tools
you<00:01:18.850> can<00:01:19.420> just<00:01:19.630> unscrew<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.260> right<00:01:20.380> here<00:01:20.560> and

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
you can just unscrew it right here and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.070 
you can just unscrew it right here and
it's<00:01:20.890> got<00:01:21.040> a<00:01:21.100> filter<00:01:21.550> that<00:01:22.090> filters<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.840> paint

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
it's got a filter that filters the paint

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.960 
it's got a filter that filters the paint
and<00:01:23.229> you<00:01:23.290> want<00:01:23.620> to<00:01:23.680> clean<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:24.040> thing<00:01:24.100> pretty

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
and you want to clean that thing pretty

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.790 
and you want to clean that thing pretty
much<00:01:25.090> every<00:01:25.330> time<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:26.050> use<00:01:26.350> it<00:01:26.380> when<00:01:26.680> you're

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
much every time you use it when you're

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800 
much every time you use it when you're
done<00:01:27.010> operating<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:27.940> machine<00:01:28.210> take<00:01:28.600> that

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
done operating the machine take that

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.890 
done operating the machine take that
filter<00:01:29.200> off<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.590> clean<00:01:29.920> that<00:01:30.070> thing<00:01:30.130> and

filter off and clean that thing and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.690 
filter off and clean that thing and
we'll<00:01:31.900> just<00:01:32.260> switch<00:01:32.710> this<00:01:32.860> thing<00:01:32.920> around

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
we'll just switch this thing around

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.399 
we'll just switch this thing around
right<00:01:33.940> here<00:01:34.240> this<00:01:34.420> opposite<00:01:34.990> side<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.200> this

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
right here this opposite side of this

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
a prime tube and that's when you put

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.640 
a prime tube and that's when you put
that<00:02:12.640> thing<00:02:12.700> in<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.630> prime<00:02:13.930> mode<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.410> flip<00:02:14.620> it

that thing in the prime mode you flip it
down<00:02:14.920> paint's<00:02:15.430> going<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.640> actually<00:02:15.880> come

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
of this tube and this is what's going to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.530 
of this tube and this is what's going to
purge<00:02:18.189> any<00:02:18.400> air<00:02:18.609> bubbles<00:02:19.000> out<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.269> your

itself<00:03:06.069> when<00:03:06.609> it's<00:03:06.730> sitting<00:03:06.909> on<00:03:06.969> the<00:03:07.090> ground

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
itself when it's sitting on the ground

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.539 
itself when it's sitting on the ground
it's<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.930> lot<00:03:08.109> more<00:03:08.290> sturdier<00:03:08.799> if<00:03:09.189> it's<00:03:09.370> in<00:03:09.489> a

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
it's a lot more sturdier if it's in a

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.770 
it's a lot more sturdier if it's in a
five-gallon<00:03:10.030> bucket<00:03:10.060> because<00:03:10.359> it's<00:03:10.599> got<00:03:10.750> a

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
five-gallon bucket because it's got a

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.020 
five-gallon bucket because it's got a
lot<00:03:10.930> larger<00:03:11.439> base<00:03:11.889> so<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.489> always<00:03:12.579> stick<00:03:12.879> my

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
lot larger base so I always stick my

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.869 
lot larger base so I always stick my
paint<00:03:13.329> into<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.049> five-gallon<00:03:14.590> bucket<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.219> I

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
paint into a five-gallon bucket and I

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.339 
paint into a five-gallon bucket and I
set<00:03:16.299> it<00:03:16.329> on<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.629> ground<00:03:16.840> I've<00:03:16.989> got<00:03:17.109> this<00:03:17.200> thing

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
set it on the ground I've got this thing

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.379 
set it on the ground I've got this thing
on<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.620> bench<00:03:17.829> right<00:03:18.040> here<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.909> make<00:03:19.239> it

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
on this bench right here to make it

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.750 
on this bench right here to make it
easier<00:03:19.659> to<00:03:19.780> show<00:03:19.989> you<00:03:20.340> how<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.400> run<00:03:21.579> this<00:03:21.699> thing

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
easier to show you how to run this thing

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.689 
easier to show you how to run this thing
so<00:03:22.629> now<00:03:23.109> I<00:03:23.139> got<00:03:23.349> this<00:03:23.440> thing<00:03:23.500> my<00:03:24.190> paints<00:03:24.519> in<00:03:24.609> my

this<00:05:33.640> right<00:05:33.880> if<00:05:34.450> this<00:05:35.140> thing<00:05:35.440> is<00:05:35.770> taking<00:05:36.490> up

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
this right if this thing is taking up

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.400 
this right if this thing is taking up
paint<00:05:37.090> but<00:05:37.300> it's<00:05:37.420> got<00:05:37.540> an<00:05:37.630> air<00:05:37.870> bubble<00:05:38.110> in<00:05:38.380> it

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
paint but it's got an air bubble in it

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.620 
paint but it's got an air bubble in it
and<00:05:38.740> it<00:05:38.890> won't<00:05:39.100> build<00:05:39.760> that<00:05:39.940> pressure<00:05:40.300> you'll

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
and it won't build that pressure you'll

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.540 
and it won't build that pressure you'll
just<00:05:40.870> hear<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:41.170> cycle<00:05:41.590> cycle<00:05:41.770> cycle<00:05:42.160> it's<00:05:42.460> not

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
just hear it cycle cycle cycle it's not

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.190 
just hear it cycle cycle cycle it's not
building<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:42.910> pressure<00:05:43.150> then<00:05:43.930> you'll<00:05:44.080> just

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
building the pressure then you'll just

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.860 
building the pressure then you'll just
take<00:05:44.350> your<00:05:44.410> prime<00:05:44.830> tube<00:05:45.190> right<00:05:45.910> here<00:05:45.940> stick<00:05:46.690> my

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
take your prime tube right here stick my

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.750 
take your prime tube right here stick my
prime<00:05:47.080> tomb<00:05:47.290> in<00:05:47.380> a<00:05:47.440> bucket<00:05:47.800> hold<00:05:48.280> on<00:05:48.460> to<00:05:48.670> it

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
prime tomb in a bucket hold on to it

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.730 
prime tomb in a bucket hold on to it
because<00:05:48.910> as<00:05:49.030> soon<00:05:49.150> as<00:05:49.240> you<00:05:49.420> flip<00:05:50.260> the<00:05:50.410> same<00:05:50.620> to

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
because as soon as you flip the same to

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.500 
because as soon as you flip the same to
Prime<00:05:51.010> a<00:05:51.280> lot<00:05:51.580> of<00:05:51.730> pressure<00:05:51.940> is<00:05:52.120> gonna<00:05:52.270> through

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
Prime a lot of pressure is gonna through

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.910 
Prime a lot of pressure is gonna through
shoot<00:05:52.840> through<00:05:53.020> this<00:05:53.110> tube<00:05:53.350> and<00:05:53.440> just<00:05:53.650> want<00:05:53.800> to

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920

shoot through this tube and just want to
shoot<00:05:54.550> up<00:05:54.700> in<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:54.850> air<00:05:54.910> and<00:05:55.390> throw<00:05:55.600> paint

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
shoot up in the air and throw paint

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.860

everywhere so I'm gonna hold on to it
put<00:05:58.870> it<00:05:58.960> down<00:05:58.990> the<00:05:59.350> prime<00:05:59.590> oh<00:05:59.770> you<00:06:00.220> can<00:06:00.340> see<00:06:00.490> now

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
put it down the prime oh you can see now

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.100 
put it down the prime oh you can see now
paint<00:06:01.300> coming<00:06:01.690> out<00:06:01.810> of<00:06:01.930> it<00:06:02.970> I'll<00:06:03.970> just<00:06:04.180> perch

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
paint coming out of it I'll just perch

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.590 
paint coming out of it I'll just perch
it<00:06:05.350> like<00:06:05.500> this<00:06:05.740> so<00:06:06.580> I<00:06:06.640> see<00:06:06.850> no<00:06:07.030> air<00:06:07.270> bubbles

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
it like this so I see no air bubbles

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.320 
it like this so I see no air bubbles
look<00:06:10.600> flip<00:06:11.380> it<00:06:11.500> back<00:06:11.650> to<00:06:11.830> the<00:06:11.950> spray<00:06:12.190> mode<00:06:12.430> so

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
look flip it back to the spray mode so

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.420 
look flip it back to the spray mode so
now<00:06:13.750> I've<00:06:13.870> heard<00:06:14.140> it<00:06:14.350> from<00:06:14.470> any<00:06:14.770> air<00:06:15.010> bubbles

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
now I've heard it from any air bubbles

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.840 
now I've heard it from any air bubbles
that<00:06:15.640> possibly<00:06:16.450> were<00:06:16.690> in<00:06:16.810> there<00:06:17.020> so<00:06:17.890> now<00:06:18.280> I'm

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
that possibly were in there so now I'm

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.700 
that possibly were in there so now I'm
ready<00:06:19.030> to<00:06:19.210> spray<00:06:19.450> and<00:06:19.750> when<00:06:20.470> I'm<00:06:20.590> done

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
ready to spray and when I'm done

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.500 
ready to spray and when I'm done
spraying<00:06:21.040> then<00:06:21.550> I'll<00:06:21.670> just<00:06:21.820> clean<00:06:22.030> my<00:06:22.060> unit

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
spraying then I'll just clean my unit

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.570 
spraying then I'll just clean my unit
all<00:06:22.630> up<00:06:22.810> and<00:06:23.050> that's<00:06:23.200> how<00:06:23.320> you<00:06:23.380> operate<00:06:24.040> a

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
all up and that's how you operate a

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.520 
all up and that's how you operate a
small<00:06:25.030> airless<00:06:25.510> sprayer<00:06:25.750> it's<00:06:26.020> pretty<00:06:26.230> simple

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
small airless sprayer it's pretty simple

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.010 
small airless sprayer it's pretty simple
process<00:06:26.740> so<00:06:27.510> when<00:06:28.510> you're<00:06:28.600> done<00:06:28.720> painting

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
process so when you're done painting

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.900 
process so when you're done painting
