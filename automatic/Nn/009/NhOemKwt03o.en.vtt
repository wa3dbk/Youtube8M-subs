is<00:00:48.909> using<00:00:49.720> cables<00:00:50.110> so<00:00:50.920> because<00:00:51.369> the<00:00:51.489> angle<00:00:51.879> of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
is using cables so because the angle of

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.600 
is using cables so because the angle of
it<00:00:52.150> really<00:00:52.750> go<00:00:52.989> ahead<00:00:53.290> and<00:00:53.500> work<00:00:54.250> it<00:00:54.369> a<00:00:54.430> lot

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
use gravity great the table machine the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.360 
use gravity great the table machine the
setting<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.629> cable<00:01:04.989> should<00:01:05.199> be<00:01:05.439> about

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
setting of the cable should be about
