00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
another what would happen if you put a

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:49.310 
another what would happen if you put a
lava<00:01:32.910> on<00:01:33.910> your<00:01:34.090> soul<00:01:34.330> sing<00:01:36.990> let's<00:01:37.990> try<00:01:38.229> that<00:01:38.410> I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:04.560 

wonder<00:01:50.320> if<00:01:50.410> you<00:01:50.500> would<00:01:50.649> go<00:01:50.800> fast<00:02:02.009> well<00:02:03.570> you

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
wonder if you would go fast well you

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.609 
wonder if you would go fast well you
still<00:02:04.900> do<00:02:05.110> that<00:02:05.290> kind<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.640> dip<00:02:06.640> thing<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.500> go

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
still do that kind of dip thing and go

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:25.170 
still do that kind of dip thing and go
kind<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.100> slow<00:02:17.579> how<00:02:18.579> about<00:02:18.850> water<00:02:23.910> will<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.030> be

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
kind of slow how about water will it be

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.509 
kind of slow how about water will it be
cool<00:02:25.450> if<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:25.780> could<00:02:25.870> like<00:02:32.130> put<00:02:33.130> milk

so so it works friends are running I
don't<00:02:44.140> see<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.410> pressure<00:02:44.739> plate<00:02:45.040> up<00:02:45.790> down

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
don't see the pressure plate up down

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
don't see the pressure plate up down
there<00:02:46.540> on<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.290> screen<00:02:47.560> or<00:02:47.709> my<00:02:48.040> mouth<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:49.140> you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
don't see a pressure plate so when you

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.400 
don't see a pressure plate so when you
get<00:02:52.600> on<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.170> jump<00:02:54.160> up<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:55.329> as<00:02:55.570> soon<00:02:55.840> as<00:02:56.170> you

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
get on it you jump up and as soon as you

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.699 
get on it you jump up and as soon as you
jump<00:02:56.650> off<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.690> rock<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:01.090> will<00:03:01.510> open<00:03:01.930> and

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
jump off of this rock that will open and

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:12.170 
jump off of this rock that will open and
your<00:03:03.489> plot<00:03:05.730> so

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:23.250 

very<00:03:13.180> very<00:03:13.570> simple<00:03:13.930> idea<00:03:18.960> and<00:03:19.960> the<00:03:20.170> causal<00:03:22.260> now

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
very very simple idea and the causal now

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.310 
very very simple idea and the causal now
what<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:23.470> have<00:03:23.560> here<00:03:24.780> probably<00:03:25.780> already<00:03:26.050> know<00:03:26.290> I

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
what I have here probably already know I

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.460 
what I have here probably already know I
just<00:03:26.680> have<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:26.890> sticky<00:03:27.340> piston<00:03:31.050> that's<00:03:32.050> just<00:03:32.290> a

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
just have a sticky piston that's just a

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.450 
just have a sticky piston that's just a
piston<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:35.140> what<00:03:35.290> happens<00:03:35.740> is<00:03:35.920> when<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.220> come

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
piston so what happens is when you come

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:45.300 
piston so what happens is when you come
back<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:42.160> will<00:03:42.280> only<00:03:42.490> come<00:03:42.970> undone<00:03:43.860> till<00:03:44.860> after

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
back it will only come undone till after

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.190 
back it will only come undone till after
you<00:03:45.790> jump<00:03:46.150> on<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.840> rock<00:03:47.290> thing<00:03:47.830> right<00:03:48.070> there<00:03:52.200> by

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
you jump on a rock thing right there by

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.340 
you jump on a rock thing right there by
that<00:03:53.230> time<00:03:53.740> you're<00:03:54.040> screwed<00:03:54.370> so<00:03:55.140> thank<00:03:56.140> you
