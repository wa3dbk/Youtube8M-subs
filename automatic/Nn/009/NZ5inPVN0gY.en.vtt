 forlán began a period of 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.710
 reconditioning and evaluation of 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.930
 conditions on the basis of the work 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.480
 had been held in Europe 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.600
 today we talk a lot about 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.640
 his history of 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.879
 trainings during the seasons 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.219
 which types the methodology of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.110
 work he has been doing and today 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.360
 we have a job at the same time a 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.750
 work to a job 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.329
 active coordinate more work 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.180
 and tomorrow it will make the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.010
 physiological assessment based on the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.469
 physiological evaluation 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.590
 Let's schedule let's do the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.550
 job planning the sequence 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.350
 of the works 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.869
 despite being more than 20 days 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.250
 stopped the player is well prepared 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.680
 and will do a job 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.939
 individualized to reach your way 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.750
 ideal physics it sells for 23 weeks 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.619
 practically stopped but a budget that 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.600
 conditions on salient 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.210
 so we have to now really 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.729
 evaluate for the amount of 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.320
 load load so that 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.780
 we can individualize 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.189
 this work is once individualized 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.500
 the information may be 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.020
 individualize this work we go 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.540
 work based on observations 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.700
 according to one of the following 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.950
 answers that the athlete will give in 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.360
 the trainings and so we 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.930
 we are adapting thus initiating the whole 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.610
 process of conscious retraining 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.780
 the importance of this basic work 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.090
 has been released and that it is 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.979
 anxiety hold the debut with 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.090
 and focus on your 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.030
 important preparation because 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.459
 and we know we have 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.800
 Expectation is for me to play but I have to 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.680
 to accept work well here this 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.120
 expectation later on the field is to play well 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.720
 do not make bnc do things fast 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.069
 then the results are negative 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.349
 yevhen on vacation in other weeks 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.540
 important difference is to work 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.590
 start a little bit more at ease 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.709
 to play fast is after and it's got to 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.519
 analyze has to see everything to get there 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.519
 in excellent conditions
