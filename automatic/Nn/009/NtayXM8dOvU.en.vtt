00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
replica case at this point because the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.310 
replica case at this point because the
graphic<00:05:09.350> is<00:05:09.530> actually<00:05:10.460> infused<00:05:11.030> into<00:05:11.390> the

graphic is actually infused into the

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.920 
graphic is actually infused into the
paint<00:05:12.650> job<00:05:12.920> on<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.910> item<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.360> on<00:05:14.780> the

briefcase it's a sticker and it's

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.850 
briefcase it's a sticker and it's
considerably<00:05:17.630> cheaper<00:05:17.930> than<00:05:18.260> the<00:05:18.320> briefcase

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
considerably cheaper than the briefcase

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.090 
considerably cheaper than the briefcase
