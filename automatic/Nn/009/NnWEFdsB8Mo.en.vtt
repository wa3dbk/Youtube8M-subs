started with my roots I started from the
bottom<00:04:06.740> and<00:04:07.190> clipped<00:04:07.430> my<00:04:07.610> hair<00:04:07.790> up<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.120> just

did<00:04:08.870> my<00:04:09.020> roots<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.530> then<00:04:09.710> I<00:04:09.830> kept<00:04:10.100> going<00:04:10.280> in

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
did my roots and then I kept going in

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.790 
did my roots and then I kept going in
sections<00:04:10.970> all<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.300> way<00:04:11.390> up<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.750> my<00:04:12.050> very<00:04:12.440> top

of my roots I let my roots sit for about

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.990 
of my roots I let my roots sit for about
10<00:04:15.500> minutes<00:04:15.710> first<00:04:16.130> because<00:04:16.520> that's<00:04:16.640> where<00:04:16.910> my

gonna be all blue which I'd be totally
fine<00:05:12.110> with<00:05:12.169> if<00:05:12.560> my<00:05:12.710> hair<00:05:12.889> turned<00:05:13.129> out<00:05:13.280> more

fine with if my hair turned out more

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
blue than black I'd be like whatever

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.580 
blue than black I'd be like whatever
though<00:05:16.729> that<00:05:17.120> will<00:05:17.419> turn<00:05:17.659> very<00:05:17.719> blue<00:05:18.289> but

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
though that will turn very blue but

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.899 
though that will turn very blue but
don't<00:05:18.740> be<00:05:18.860> freaked<00:05:19.069> out<00:05:19.219> if<00:05:19.699> you've<00:05:19.879> got

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
don't be freaked out if you've got

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.899 
don't be freaked out if you've got
virgin<00:05:20.539> hair<00:05:20.719> then<00:05:21.020> your<00:05:21.169> um<00:05:21.789> it'll<00:05:22.789> probably

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
virgin hair then your um it'll probably

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.820 
virgin hair then your um it'll probably
pick<00:05:23.240> up<00:05:23.389> more<00:05:23.629> of<00:05:23.719> that<00:05:23.840> blue<00:05:24.080> tint<00:05:24.440> but<00:05:24.770> I

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
pick up more of that blue tint but I

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.399 
pick up more of that blue tint but I
already<00:05:25.069> had<00:05:25.430> black<00:05:25.789> blue<00:05:26.330> put<00:05:26.840> into<00:05:27.080> my<00:05:27.199> hair

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
already had black blue put into my hair

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.580 
already had black blue put into my hair
so<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:27.979> kind<00:05:28.219> of<00:05:28.250> just<00:05:28.430> stuck<00:05:29.240> to<00:05:29.379> the<00:05:30.379> blue

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
so it kind of just stuck to the blue

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.890 
so it kind of just stuck to the blue
black<00:05:30.949> thing<00:05:31.310> going<00:05:31.849> on<00:05:31.969> so<00:05:32.360> it<00:05:32.509> didn't<00:05:32.750> take

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
black thing going on so it didn't take

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.830 
black thing going on so it didn't take
on<00:05:33.080> too<00:05:33.319> much<00:05:33.469> of<00:05:33.680> that<00:05:33.889> blue<00:05:34.159> but<00:05:34.659> this<00:05:35.659> is

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
on too much of that blue but this is

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.909 
on too much of that blue but this is
probably<00:05:36.379> the<00:05:36.650> most<00:05:36.819> blue<00:05:38.139> tint<00:05:39.139> that<00:05:39.740> I've

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
probably the most blue tint that I've

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.219 
probably the most blue tint that I've
had<00:05:40.159> that<00:05:40.550> I've<00:05:40.699> ever<00:05:40.880> used<00:05:41.000> for<00:05:41.509> any<00:05:41.659> color<00:05:41.960> I

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
had that I've ever used for any color I

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.890 
had that I've ever used for any color I
