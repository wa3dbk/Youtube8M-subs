because I got an injection of my hip I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.940 
because I got an injection of my hip I
decided<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.840> sort<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.200> continue<00:01:07.650> with<00:01:07.799> that

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
decided to sort of continue with that

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.590 
decided to sort of continue with that
training<00:01:08.340> cycle<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.850> bailed<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.330> for

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
training cycle that I bailed on for

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.560 
training cycle that I bailed on for
lower<00:01:09.720> body<00:01:10.369> for<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.549> upper<00:01:11.909> body<00:01:12.119> work<00:01:12.360> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
lower body for the upper body work to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.210 
lower body for the upper body work to
see<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.960> made<00:01:13.140> any<00:01:13.170> progress<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.890> my<00:01:13.950> bench

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
see if I made any progress on my bench

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.770 
see if I made any progress on my bench
pressing<00:01:14.610> my<00:01:14.670> overhead<00:01:15.060> press<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.630> was

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
pressing my overhead press so this was

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.580 
pressing my overhead press so this was
my<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:16.650> max<00:01:16.950> day<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.150> speak<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.350> see

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
my my max day so to speak as you can see

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
my my max day so to speak as you can see
obviously<00:01:20.130> i<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.759> i'm<00:01:21.119> recording<00:01:21.810> from<00:01:21.930> two

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
obviously i have i'm recording from two

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.960 
obviously i have i'm recording from two
angles<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.770> reason<00:01:23.430> for<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.939> to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
angles and the reason for that is to

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
angles and the reason for that is to
ensure<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.110> lift<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.470> good<00:01:25.740> based<00:01:26.070> on

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
ensure that the lift is good based on

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.310 
ensure that the lift is good based on
powerlifting<00:01:26.700> standards<00:01:27.240> now<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.960> was<00:01:28.170> just

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
powerlifting standards now this was just

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
powerlifting standards now this was just
a<00:01:28.439> regular<00:01:28.710> gym<00:01:29.070> lift<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.460> really<00:01:29.670> doesn't

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
a regular gym lift it really doesn't

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.429 
a regular gym lift it really doesn't
matter<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.659> buck<00:01:30.810> comes<00:01:31.020> up<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.229> little

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
matter if your buck comes up a little

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.620 
matter if your buck comes up a little
bit<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.820> any<00:01:33.060> movement<00:01:33.479> up<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
bit but you know any movement up the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.390 
bit but you know any movement up the
butt<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.100> saw

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
butt up like in that one you just saw

a<00:01:57.390> big<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:58.560> big<00:01:59.009> compromise<00:01:59.780> where<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.110> sort<00:02:01.680> of

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
a big a big compromise where you sort of

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.560 
a big a big compromise where you sort of
sacrifice<00:02:02.280> some<00:02:02.460> leg<00:02:02.670> drive<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.299> keep<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
butt down and that's something that just

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.560 
butt down and that's something that just
takes<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.909> lot<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.060> practice<00:02:06.540> with

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
takes a lot of practice with

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.600 
takes a lot of practice with
unfortunately<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.680> training<00:02:07.920> cycle<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
unfortunately in this training cycle a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.669 
unfortunately in this training cycle a
good<00:02:09.119> portion<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> training<00:02:09.869> cycle<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.379> was

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
good portion of the training cycle I was

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.740 
good portion of the training cycle I was
not<00:02:10.830> able<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.250> train<00:02:11.459> my

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
not able to train my

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.580 
not able to train my
Jim<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.580> got<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.600> little<00:02:14.750> sloppy<00:02:15.020> there<00:02:15.410> and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
Jim so I got a little sloppy there and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.140 
Jim so I got a little sloppy there and
as<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.800> can<00:02:15.950> see<00:02:15.980> my<00:02:16.250> butt<00:02:16.460> was<00:02:16.610> coming<00:02:16.910> up<00:02:17.000> on

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
as you can see my butt was coming up on

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.920 
as you can see my butt was coming up on
this<00:02:17.240> 275<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.520> decided<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:19.970> actually<00:02:20.570> go<00:02:20.900> up

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
this 275 so I decided to actually go up

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.800 
this 275 so I decided to actually go up
to<00:02:21.290> 280<00:02:21.920> pounds<00:02:22.490> because<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:23.000> 275<00:02:23.540> felt

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
to 280 pounds because the 275 felt

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.150 
to 280 pounds because the 275 felt
pretty<00:02:23.960> good<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.380> only<00:02:24.590> issue<00:02:24.740> was<00:02:24.920> really

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
pretty good the only issue was really

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.030 
pretty good the only issue was really
that<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.400> but<00:02:25.580> came<00:02:25.820> up<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.530> guys<00:02:27.860> will

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.400 
that the but came up so you guys will
see<00:02:28.070> that<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:29.180> know<00:02:29.209> I<00:02:29.330> basically<00:02:30.110> similar

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
see that you know I basically similar

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.580 
see that you know I basically similar
approach<00:02:30.920> similar<00:02:31.280> setup<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.590> unfortunately

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
approach similar setup and unfortunately

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.330 
approach similar setup and unfortunately
my<00:02:33.650> butt<00:02:33.950> came<00:02:34.160> up<00:02:34.310> again<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.270> in<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.350> end<00:02:36.470> you

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
my butt came up again so in the end you

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.620 
my butt came up again so in the end you
know<00:02:37.370> did<00:02:37.700> I<00:02:37.760> make<00:02:37.970> progress<00:02:38.209> in<00:02:38.420> this

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
know did I make progress in this

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.170 
know did I make progress in this
training<00:02:38.840> cycle<00:02:39.320> um<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:40.820> know<00:02:40.940> this

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
training cycle um you know this

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.940 
training cycle um you know this
obviously<00:02:41.810> would<00:02:42.050> not<00:02:42.200> have<00:02:42.320> counted<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.890> a

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
obviously would not have counted in a

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.030 
obviously would not have counted in a
powerlifting<00:02:43.490> meet<00:02:43.550> but<00:02:43.940> adding<00:02:44.900> 10<00:02:45.590> pounds

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
powerlifting meet but adding 10 pounds

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.820 
powerlifting meet but adding 10 pounds
ish<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.550> my<00:02:46.670> bench<00:02:46.910> press<00:02:47.410> under<00:02:48.410> one<00:02:48.590> training

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
ish to my bench press under one training

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.290 
ish to my bench press under one training
cycle<00:02:49.190> is<00:02:49.250> pretty<00:02:49.459> good<00:02:49.700> considering<00:02:50.120> my

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
cycle is pretty good considering my

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.990 
cycle is pretty good considering my
benches<00:02:50.720> much<00:02:50.959> by<00:02:51.110> far<00:02:51.350> my<00:02:51.470> weakest<00:02:51.860> lift<00:02:52.760> and

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
benches much by far my weakest lift and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.640 
benches much by far my weakest lift and
i<00:02:53.030> usually<00:02:53.180> don't<00:02:53.600> get<00:02:53.840> more<00:02:54.050> than<00:02:54.200> 5<00:02:54.410> pounds

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
i usually don't get more than 5 pounds

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.190 
i usually don't get more than 5 pounds
on<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:55.010> training<00:02:55.430> cycle<00:02:55.880> so<00:02:56.510> obviously<00:02:56.900> i<00:02:57.020> can't

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
on a training cycle so obviously i can't

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.260 
on a training cycle so obviously i can't
exactly<00:02:57.739> say<00:02:58.070> that<00:02:58.250> i<00:02:58.280> added<00:02:58.489> 10<00:02:58.850> pounds<00:02:59.150> my

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
exactly say that i added 10 pounds my

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.210 
exactly say that i added 10 pounds my
bench<00:02:59.540> because<00:02:59.780> my<00:03:00.170> butt<00:03:00.380> is<00:03:00.470> comin<00:03:00.770> up<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:00.950> you

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
bench because my butt is comin up so you

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.220 
bench because my butt is comin up so you
know<00:03:01.940> maybe<00:03:02.270> that's<00:03:02.480> that's<00:03:02.840> definitely

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
know maybe that's that's definitely

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.780 
know maybe that's that's definitely
helping<00:03:03.470> me<00:03:03.620> out<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.770> bit<00:03:03.890> despite<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.640> fact

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
helping me out a bit despite the fact

helping me out a bit despite the fact
that<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.330> know<00:03:05.420> it's<00:03:05.570> coming<00:03:05.750> up<00:03:05.930> maybe<00:03:06.260> just

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
that you know it's coming up maybe just

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.180 
that you know it's coming up maybe just
a<00:03:06.709> hair<00:03:06.950> maybe<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.790> few<00:03:07.970> centimeters<00:03:08.540> but<00:03:09.190> you

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
a hair maybe a few centimeters but you

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.380 
a hair maybe a few centimeters but you
know<00:03:10.280> going<00:03:10.520> forward<00:03:10.820> i'm<00:03:10.940> definitely<00:03:11.300> going
