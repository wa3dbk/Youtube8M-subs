00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.650 
um now just to give you all a review on
these<00:02:08.979> brands<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.489> what<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.640> think<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.090> far

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
these brands of what I think so far

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.650 
these brands of what I think so far
I<00:02:10.690> love<00:02:11.380> these<00:02:11.650> braids<00:02:12.040> but<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:13.330> can<00:02:13.630> say<00:02:14.250> that

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
I love these braids but I can say that

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.890 
I love these braids but I can say that
it's<00:02:16.660> not<00:02:17.380> lasting<00:02:18.130> like<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.520> would<00:02:18.940> think<00:02:19.120> it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
it's not lasting like I would think it

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.449 
it's not lasting like I would think it
already<00:02:20.050> looks<00:02:20.260> like<00:02:20.500> I've<00:02:20.620> had<00:02:20.770> like<00:02:21.310> I've

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
already looks like I've had like I've

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.490 
already looks like I've had like I've
had<00:02:21.670> these<00:02:21.880> for<00:02:22.180> two<00:02:22.540> or<00:02:22.690> three<00:02:22.870> weeks<00:02:23.080> already

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
had these for two or three weeks already

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.290 
had these for two or three weeks already
and<00:02:23.709> there's<00:02:24.190> only<00:02:24.280> been<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.519> couple<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.849> days

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
and there's only been a couple of days

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.199 
and there's only been a couple of days
the<00:02:25.390> only<00:02:25.599> thing<00:02:25.930> which<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.680> think<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:27.370> the

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
the only thing which I think is the

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.509 
the only thing which I think is the
problem<00:02:28.720> here<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.140> Kanekalon<00:02:30.099> hair<00:02:30.130> was

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
problem here is that Kanekalon hair was

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.910 
problem here is that Kanekalon hair was
used<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.060> just<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.330> hundred<00:02:31.480> percent

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
used this is just a hundred percent

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.370 
used this is just a hundred percent
Kanekalon<00:02:32.920> hair<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.420> because<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:34.959> isn't<00:02:35.260> like

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
Kanekalon hair and because it isn't like

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.220 
Kanekalon hair and because it isn't like
a<00:02:35.410> corset<00:02:36.280> texture<00:02:36.640> hair<00:02:36.819> such<00:02:37.060> as<00:02:37.330> marley

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
a corset texture hair such as marley

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.920 
a corset texture hair such as marley
brainy<00:02:38.560> or<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.340> better<00:02:39.790> twist<00:02:40.090> hair<00:02:40.330> then

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
brainy or the better twist hair then

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.220 
brainy or the better twist hair then
it's<00:02:41.110> more<00:02:41.590> silky<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.489> it's<00:02:42.640> more<00:02:42.910> prone<00:02:43.180> to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
it's more silky and it's more prone to

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.250 
it's more silky and it's more prone to
unravel<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:44.709> that<00:02:45.160> right<00:02:45.640> there<00:02:45.840> um<00:02:46.840> kind<00:02:47.200> of

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
unravel so that right there um kind of

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.520 
unravel so that right there um kind of
just<00:02:47.470> takes<00:02:48.400> away<00:02:48.700> from<00:02:49.299> me<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:50.260> joining

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
just takes away from me and joining

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.430 
just takes away from me and joining
style<00:02:50.920> in<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.580> longevity<00:02:51.790> um<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.930> have<00:02:53.140> had<00:02:53.410> a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
style in this longevity um I have had a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.130 
style in this longevity um I have had a
couple<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.830> braids<00:02:54.099> already<00:02:54.790> unraveled<00:02:58.140> and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
couple of braids already unraveled and

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.699 
couple of braids already unraveled and
they<00:02:59.290> are<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.470> stream<00:03:00.069> long<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:04.470> don't<00:03:05.470> know<00:03:05.620> if

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
they are a stream long I don't know if

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.289 
they are a stream long I don't know if
you<00:03:05.769> even<00:03:05.950> get<00:03:06.160> like<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.549> full<00:03:06.760> length<00:03:07.090> of

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
you even get like the full length of

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.900 
you even get like the full length of
them<00:03:07.450> but<00:03:07.630> they<00:03:07.780> are<00:03:07.810> down<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.319> my<00:03:08.620> butt<00:03:08.860> um<00:03:09.310> the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
them but they are down to my butt um the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.160 
them but they are down to my butt um the
only<00:03:10.030> reason<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.299> haven't<00:03:10.510> cutting<00:03:10.870> yet<00:03:11.019> is

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
only reason I haven't cutting yet is

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.810 
only reason I haven't cutting yet is
because<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.739> way<00:03:11.829> that<00:03:12.010> they<00:03:12.130> are<00:03:12.280> twisted<00:03:12.700> on

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
because the way that they are twisted on

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.430 
because the way that they are twisted on
the<00:03:12.910> ends<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.359> gives<00:03:13.510> them<00:03:13.630> like<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> natural

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
the ends and gives them like a natural

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.069 
the ends and gives them like a natural
finish<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.579> has<00:03:15.790> like<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.180> straight<00:03:16.570> ends

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
finish so it has like the straight ends

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.620 
finish so it has like the straight ends
on<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.590> bottom<00:03:17.890> they<00:03:18.459> were<00:03:18.730> burned<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.510> they

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
on the bottom they were burned and they

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.930 
on the bottom they were burned and they
were<00:03:19.810> also<00:03:20.200> dipped<00:03:20.500> in<00:03:20.709> boiling<00:03:21.190> water<00:03:21.459> but

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
were also dipped in boiling water but

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.990 
were also dipped in boiling water but
that<00:03:22.299> didn't<00:03:23.019> really<00:03:23.170> help<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:24.130> have<00:03:24.609> had<00:03:24.850> to

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
that didn't really help I have had to

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.059 
that didn't really help I have had to
burn<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.780> ends<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.319> couple<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.680> times<00:03:26.890> already

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
burn the ends a couple of times already

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.580 
burn the ends a couple of times already
and<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.970> have<00:03:28.180> had<00:03:28.359> three<00:03:28.600> twists<00:03:28.989> this<00:03:29.290> one

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
and I have had three twists this one

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.420 
and I have had three twists this one
about<00:03:30.489> three<00:03:31.450> times<00:03:31.660> they<00:03:31.989> already<00:03:32.440> in<00:03:33.280> my

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
about three times they already in my

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.039 
about three times they already in my
last<00:03:33.640> video<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.060> told<00:03:34.239> y'all<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.660> wanted<00:03:34.959> to

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
last video I told y'all that I wanted to

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.620 
last video I told y'all that I wanted to
wear<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.829> brace<00:03:36.069> roughly<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.239> four<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.600> five

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
wear the brace roughly to four to five

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.039 
wear the brace roughly to four to five
weeks<00:03:37.780> but<00:03:38.760> because<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.030> style<00:03:40.389> is<00:03:40.600> already

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
weeks but because the style is already

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.080 
weeks but because the style is already
messing<00:03:41.440> up<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.859> my<00:03:42.100> hair<00:03:42.340> is<00:03:42.370> actually<00:03:42.910> like

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
messing up and my hair is actually like

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.180 
messing up and my hair is actually like
unraveling<00:03:43.840> from<00:03:43.989> inside<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.680> braids<00:03:45.010> like

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
unraveling from inside the braids like

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.670 
unraveling from inside the braids like
my<00:03:45.819> actual<00:03:46.630> my<00:03:46.750> natural<00:03:47.139> hair<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.380> my<00:03:47.470> real

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
my actual my natural hair and my real

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.410 
my actual my natural hair and my real
hair<00:03:47.889> is<00:03:48.069> actually<00:03:48.519> coming<00:03:48.970> out<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.329> the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
hair is actually coming out of the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.410 
hair is actually coming out of the
braids<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.889> it's<00:03:50.889> really<00:03:51.160> hard<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.790> maintain

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
braids and it's really hard to maintain

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.690 
braids and it's really hard to maintain
like<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.560> first<00:03:53.769> couple<00:03:54.040> of<00:03:54.100> nights<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.459> just

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
like the first couple of nights I just

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.250 
like the first couple of nights I just
split<00:03:54.790> with<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.060> binding<00:03:55.510> on<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.780> top<00:03:56.019> part

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
split with the binding on the top part

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.259 
split with the binding on the top part
of<00:03:56.319> my<00:03:56.380> head<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:56.980> then<00:03:57.549> I<00:03:57.579> left<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:57.970> other

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
of my head and then I left the other

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.809 
of my head and then I left the other
braids<00:03:58.569> hanging<00:03:58.840> but<00:03:59.200> now<00:03:59.500> since<00:04:00.430> I<00:04:00.549> can<00:04:00.730> move

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
braids hanging but now since I can move

look instead of it being more coarse it

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.090 
look instead of it being more coarse it
if<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.240> will<00:04:25.360> use<00:04:25.510> like<00:04:25.660> a<00:04:25.720> Marley<00:04:26.200> braid<00:04:26.410> or<00:04:26.740> a

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
finger comer Havana twist hair but the

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.060 
finger comer Havana twist hair but the
style<00:04:30.970> would<00:04:31.240> last<00:04:31.570> longer<00:04:32.140> I<00:04:32.350> believe<00:04:32.800> if<00:04:33.040> you

use the coarser texture hair because it

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.310 
use the coarser texture hair because it
