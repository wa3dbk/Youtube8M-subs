00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:09.520

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.800
 welcome to super smash bros this 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.380
 Mr. rpg accompanies everyone 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.150
 guys is how you are and good thing 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.130
 is that we just give the preparations 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.720
 but my captor leave depends not 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.279
 capture my voice and therefore we 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.289
 it's time to repeat the death fight that 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.970
 will repeat the guest here and I do not know if the 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.529
 next week without combat has been 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:36.990
 very cool that you can see in his post 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:36.990
 well worth playing over the volcano 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.010
 marley to see if now we will have the 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.750
 same luck but we're in trouble and 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.830
 the other video has been a team video 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.600
 against team because we have started 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.770
 four people and he took us two to 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.480
 death but good guys do not worry 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.950
 we are going to serious problems to another with more 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.420
 of death the revenge is still standing 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.190
 I have not managed to kill him yet 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.110
 there was way to kill to see if it is 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.629
 impossible the power of immortality of 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:13.619
 lucky we 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:13.619
 in a way and this because it 's like that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.659
 caught something here 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:35.970
 because this drives me crazy 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.770
 and care 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:54.050
 at the door 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.869
 I swear 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:22.820
 it's been a death so sure 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.370
 some no longer being much but that's how it is 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900
 life there are times that you get 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.410
 times there is no way nor from me 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.410
 to touch t 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.280
 this visit 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:02.250
 but statistics is the statistic already 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.250
 it's an out of the ordinary thing 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.860
 I do not understand 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.160
 then correct 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.610
 the back of the hour 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:36.870
 but that 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:59.320
 I will not win them very sure 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.010
 is the trick 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.580
 but how many men do you go very 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.720
 and I know 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.310
 God, I'm on top of the volcano 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.310
 what is the same order to take by sack 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:25.400
 what you have inside everything was everything 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:28.690
 move 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.690
 maxwell are you tube 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:46.340
 I spent leg 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:46.340
 and it was already played 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.730
 he could not take weapons because he has a 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.390
 trapdoor in the hand dies senseless and 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.390
 then the other 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.730
 we see the girls
