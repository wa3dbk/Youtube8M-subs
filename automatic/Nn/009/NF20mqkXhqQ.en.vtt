00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:11.740
 Hi, welcome to the picture after we 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.639
 we saw the structure of the flower and the types of 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.369
 flower 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:20.410
 Let's start with the fruits of 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:24.329
 I have already represented angiosperms 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:29.550
 a flower with all its parts 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:33.370
 minions petals stamens and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.120
 the explanation of all these 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.510
 parts you can see in the class of 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.719
 flower structure good for this class I 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.680
 I want you to remember of the cartello 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:52.390
 cartel is composed of the stigma that is 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:56.949
 the upper aperture by the stylus that is 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:00.039
 this tubular portion and the ovary which is 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:04.300
 this large portion 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.430
 besides we have here the egg that 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.210
 it's on the ovary 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.930
 remembering that ovule is not gamete 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.560
 female gamete is the fair that is 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:22.810
 here inside the egg and in this case 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:26.340
 that the beasts are already fruitful here already 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:33.310
 occurred the process of fertilization 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:37.479
 I will highlight here the egg and also 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.210
 ovary that will be two important 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.500
 structures for the development of 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.350
 fruit 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.549
 as I already said in class 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.360
 egg-specific 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:56.250
 we know that this fertilized egg will 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.130
 then form the seeds of the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 development of the fertilized ovum 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:10.869
 we have the formation of the seed that seed 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.980
 information it can release hormones and 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.660
 these hormones can stimulate the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.370
 development of the egg wall 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:26.450
 and there from the development 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:31.430
 of the walls of this ovary we will 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.480
 form a fruit error then the fruit forms 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:40.160
 starting from the development of the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.970
 walls of the ovary and the fruit it may have 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.320
 consisting of two main parts 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.660
 pericarp that most of the fruit and 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.070
 the seeds 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:03:00.410
 Let's talk here then about each part 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:06.170
 of a fruit the outermost part of the 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:11.350
 This fruit is called an epi car so this 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:15.680
 The outer part is the epi 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.950
 responsible for coating the fruit 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:25.820
 this intermediate part 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:30.310
 we call the mesocarp the mesocarp is 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:34.910
 the part of the fruit that develops the most 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:38.390
 and is in the month the car because it is synthesized and 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:42.459
 accumulated substances 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:45.560
 such as sugars 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:50.120
 so we have this part here 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.810
 which is called the same 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.690
 carpus the inner part that 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:02.690
 usually cover the seeds is the 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:08.470
 endocarp then we have here the 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:13.959
 that is called carpal 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:19.250
 and here we also have the seeds 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:25.190
 seeds that came from the development 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:30.500
 of the fertilized ovum and the whole set of 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.139
 epi carpo mesocarp and endocarp we 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.930
 we call 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:41.310
 we are going to have skin that is most 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:44.279
 good fruit we have here then the whole 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.060
 structure of a fruit and want to highlight 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:53.129
 now the importance of the fruits 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:56.669
 fruits coat the seeds and the 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:05:01.590
 embryo is located in the seed then 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:06.169
 the fruit it protects the seeds then 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:12.169
 has the function of protecting these seeds 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:16.710
 The fruit also has a function of 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.900
 seed spread 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.139
 because the fruit usually 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.520
 juicy and tasty food 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.669
 for animals 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.889
 these animals will then eat the fruit and 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:33.449
 then release the seeds of this fruit 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:38.460
 through their feces 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:42.180
 thus the seeds are disseminated 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.810
 the environment and this allows them to 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:49.770
 spread and colonize new environments with 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:52.979
 greater chance of survival of the species 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.199
 so the fruits have important 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:59.370
 adaptive role 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:02.789
 in the group of angiosperms we ended up 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.759
 here with the fruit class and the next 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:09.680
 class Let's see the types of fruit 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.680
 thank you and see you there
