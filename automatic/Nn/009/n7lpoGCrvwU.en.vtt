and<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.719> going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.960> track<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.320> constraint

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
and it's going to track to constraint

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.300 
and it's going to track to constraint
I'm<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.020> hit<00:02:07.290> alt<00:02:08.420> R<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.830> clear<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
I'm then going to hit alt R to clear the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.190 
I'm then going to hit alt R to clear the
rotation

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
rotation

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.230 
rotation
and<00:02:13.290> we're<00:02:13.830> pretty<00:02:13.950> much<00:02:14.069> set<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.520> go<00:02:14.670> I'm

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
and we're pretty much set to go I'm

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.270 
and we're pretty much set to go I'm
gonna<00:02:15.420> do<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.599> little<00:02:15.750> trick<00:02:16.110> here<00:02:16.140> where<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:16.740> hit

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
gonna do a little trick here where I hit

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.020 
gonna do a little trick here where I hit
ctrl<00:02:18.060> alt<00:02:18.420> Q<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.319> go<00:02:20.069> into<00:02:20.220> quad<00:02:20.550> mode<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:20.970> we

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
ctrl alt Q and go into quad mode and we

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.140 
ctrl alt Q and go into quad mode and we
can<00:02:21.060> see<00:02:21.209> this<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.530> view<00:02:22.739> from<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:23.069> top

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
can see this is the view from the top

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.449 
can see this is the view from the top
the<00:02:24.150> front<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:25.200> right<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:25.950> here's<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
the front the right and then here's the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.920 
the front the right and then here's the
camera<00:02:26.730> view<00:02:27.000> that's<00:02:27.239> what<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.480> camera<00:02:27.840> is

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
camera view that's what the camera is

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.530 
camera view that's what the camera is
actually<00:02:28.140> going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.650> see<00:02:28.860> now<00:02:29.850> I'm<00:02:30.239> going<00:02:30.480> to

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
actually going to see now I'm going to

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.449 
actually going to see now I'm going to
go<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:30.989> add<00:02:31.110> one<00:02:31.410> more<00:02:31.620> object<00:02:31.890> I'm<00:02:32.310> going

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
go in and add one more object I'm going

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.840 
go in and add one more object I'm going
to<00:02:32.520> say<00:02:32.700> add<00:02:32.940> mesh<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:34.470> I'll<00:02:34.560> choose<00:02:34.850> Suzanne

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
to say add mesh and I'll choose Suzanne

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.910 
to say add mesh and I'll choose Suzanne
the<00:02:36.060> monkey<00:02:36.420> they<00:02:37.140> put<00:02:37.319> in<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.500> middle<00:02:37.650> there

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the monkey they put in the middle there

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.150 
the monkey they put in the middle there
and<00:02:38.269> I<00:02:39.269> think<00:02:39.569> I'll<00:02:39.959> zoom<00:02:40.560> in<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.920> little<00:02:41.040> bit

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
and I think I'll zoom in a little bit

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.820 
and I think I'll zoom in a little bit
now<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:41.819> important<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:43.080> check<00:02:43.319> if<00:02:43.530> we<00:02:43.650> have

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
now it's important to check if we have

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.830 
now it's important to check if we have
either<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.190> camera<00:02:44.459> or<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.970> camera<00:02:45.360> focus

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
either the camera or the camera focus

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.660 
either the camera or the camera focus
selected<00:02:46.410> I'm<00:02:46.560> gonna<00:02:46.680> select<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.250> camera

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
selected I'm gonna select the camera

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.990 
selected I'm gonna select the camera
initially<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:49.010> move<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.310> I'm<00:02:50.519> going<00:02:50.670> from<00:02:50.819> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
initially and move in I'm going from the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.720 
initially and move in I'm going from the
top<00:02:51.299> I'm<00:02:51.600> just<00:02:51.660> gonna<00:02:52.220> do<00:02:53.220> something<00:02:53.549> like

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
top I'm just gonna do something like

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.770 
top I'm just gonna do something like
that<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.739> with<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.980> camera<00:02:56.600> selected<00:02:57.600> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
that and with the camera selected the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.259 
that and with the camera selected the
nice<00:02:57.989> part<00:02:58.290> about<00:02:58.350> this<00:02:58.769> is<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.519> camera<00:03:00.030> will

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
nice part about this is the camera will

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.620 
nice part about this is the camera will
continually<00:03:01.459> focus<00:03:02.459> on<00:03:02.640> one<00:03:02.880> place<00:03:03.180> even<00:03:03.209> if

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
continually focus on one place even if

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.940 
continually focus on one place even if
as<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.989> move<00:03:04.230> him<00:03:04.350> around

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
as I move him around

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.559 
as I move him around
we<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.280> kind<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.549> see<00:03:05.760> what<00:03:05.940> happens<00:03:06.330> here

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
we can kind of see what happens here

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.490 
we can kind of see what happens here
notice<00:03:07.350> here<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.280> top<00:03:08.519> orthographic

and<00:03:14.760> pivots<00:03:16.190> in<00:03:17.190> order<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.989> stay<00:03:18.989> focused<00:03:19.470> on

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
and pivots in order to stay focused on

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.340

the<00:03:19.739> monkey<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:21.299> have<00:03:21.480> there<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.959> I'm

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
the monkey that we have there and I'm

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.349 
the monkey that we have there and I'm
just<00:03:22.380> going<00:03:22.709> across<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:23.130> x-axis<00:03:23.609> I<00:03:24.060> can<00:03:24.209> also

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
just going across the x-axis I can also

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.180 
just going across the x-axis I can also
do<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.989> across<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.530> y-axis<00:03:27.380> or<00:03:28.380> I'm<00:03:29.010> gonna

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
do this across the y-axis or I'm gonna

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.250 
do this across the y-axis or I'm gonna
have<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.459> go<00:03:29.549> to<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.880> front<00:03:30.239> view<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.870> select

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
have to go to the front view and select

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.880 
have to go to the front view and select
the<00:03:31.650> blue<00:03:32.010> one<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:33.120> change<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.690> z-axis<00:03:34.019> we<00:03:34.739> can

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
the blue one to change the z-axis we can

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.150 
the blue one to change the z-axis we can
see<00:03:35.100> we<00:03:35.190> kind<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.430> go<00:03:35.519> above<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.209> below<00:03:36.540> the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
see we kind of go above and below the

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.949 
see we kind of go above and below the
monkey<00:03:38.510> works<00:03:39.510> pretty<00:03:39.720> slick<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:40.260> then<00:03:40.859> I<00:03:41.130> can

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
monkey works pretty slick and then I can

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.710 
monkey works pretty slick and then I can
keep<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.170> camera<00:03:43.620> steady<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.390> let<00:03:45.390> me<00:03:45.510> move

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
keep the camera steady and let me move

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.849 
keep the camera steady and let me move
them<00:03:45.810> around<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.260> little<00:03:46.350> bit<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.709> get<00:03:46.829> a

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
them around a little bit so I get a

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.900 
them around a little bit so I get a
better<00:03:47.070> view<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.790> our<00:03:48.420> monkey<00:03:49.549> let's<00:03:50.549> put<00:03:50.820> him

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
better view of our monkey let's put him

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.500 
better view of our monkey let's put him
on<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.090> let's<00:03:51.870> keep<00:03:52.230> them<00:03:52.320> up<00:03:52.440> top<00:03:53.269> I'd<00:03:54.269> like

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
on that let's keep them up top I'd like

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.000 
on that let's keep them up top I'd like
to<00:03:54.630> bring<00:03:54.750> them<00:03:54.900> down<00:03:54.930> something<00:03:55.470> like<00:03:55.590> that

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
to bring them down something like that

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.530 
to bring them down something like that
there<00:03:56.640> we<00:03:56.730> go

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
there we go

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.539 
there we go
and<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.049> can<00:03:58.230> move<00:03:58.350> my<00:03:58.410> camera<00:03:58.829> focus<00:03:59.280> around

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
and I can move my camera focus around

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.979 
and I can move my camera focus around
now<00:03:59.640> one<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.910> hard<00:04:00.150> parts<00:04:00.450> about<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:00.840> the

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
now one of the hard parts about this the

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.370 
now one of the hard parts about this the
camera<00:04:01.380> focus<00:04:01.799> is<00:04:01.980> in<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.030> same<00:04:03.329> location<00:04:04.200> as

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
camera focus is in the same location as

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.080
