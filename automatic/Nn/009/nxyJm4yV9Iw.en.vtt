00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.350
 the event was determined by the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.990
 passage of a pontoon of the firm that 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.240
 takes care of the girl whose group 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.240
 basically it hit the bay 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.070
 has had both because the first 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.830
 taking the cake the second one taken 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.660
 due share we say to the whiplash 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.630
 that the crane had when it passed 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.789
 all we say has passed under the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.859
 span and therefore also demolished 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.600
 second span and we also see that there 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.730
 the crane poem also has a layer 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.970
 I had a loan I was about it 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.320
 same for which he fell right over the 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:46.410
 basis for risk was for whom 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:57.809
 he worked with the records he was also 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:01:00.059
 the successful hypothesis verified an appearance 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.660
 let's say structural of the bridge not 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.949
 there should be big problems 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.479
 cautiously forbidden by 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.240
 part of the municipality then the passage 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.910
 above is prohibited 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.849
 regarding our intervention 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:18.509
 serves to eliminate them immediate danger is 

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:21.270
 due to those pieces of network that you are 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.000
 torn and that because they are subject to 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.490
 wind action could then have a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.259
 failure and then fall into the water 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.610
 obviously if there was from the passage of 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.610
 embarking could create problems 

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:42.509
 analytical of the joke but it was life 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:44.360
 who built it 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:57.140
 protection 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:59.000
 the maintenance name then if there will be 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.070
 need this intervention obviously 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.140
 it's our understanding what was 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.140
 assessed at the due date 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.900
 no 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.640
 Luckily 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.139
 try it
