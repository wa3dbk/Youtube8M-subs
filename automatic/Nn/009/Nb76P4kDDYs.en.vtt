00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
but you can make it a lot less inspired

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.600 
but you can make it a lot less inspired
that<00:05:43.870> people<00:05:44.169> make<00:05:44.410> it<00:05:44.560> out<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:44.710> be<00:05:44.919> Super

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
really that unique about it sure the

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.620 
really that unique about it sure the
level<00:05:57.100> design<00:05:57.220> is<00:05:57.400> a<00:05:57.580> bit<00:05:57.790> more<00:05:57.970> intuitive

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
level design is a bit more intuitive

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.510 
level design is a bit more intuitive
than<00:05:58.660> the<00:05:58.900> original<00:05:59.740> Super<00:06:00.010> Mario<00:06:00.040> Brothers

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
than the original Super Mario Brothers

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.020 
than the original Super Mario Brothers
but<00:06:00.910> really<00:06:01.750> how<00:06:02.229> is<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:02.650> better<00:06:02.889> I<00:06:03.160> do<00:06:03.250> not<00:06:03.729> get

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
but really how is it better I do not get

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.150 
but really how is it better I do not get
it<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:04.300> game<00:06:04.479> plays<00:06:04.780> exactly<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.560> same<00:06:05.889> and

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
it the game plays exactly the same and

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.920 
it the game plays exactly the same and
the<00:06:06.520> power-ups<00:06:07.090> really<00:06:07.389> aren't<00:06:07.600> that<00:06:07.630> great

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
the power-ups really aren't that great
