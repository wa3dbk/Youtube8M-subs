are gifted free gold and it's also a
good<00:00:23.789> idea<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.060> wait<00:00:24.330> until<00:00:24.750> around<00:00:25.080> about

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
good idea to wait until around about

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.779 
good idea to wait until around about
level<00:00:25.740> seven<00:00:26.039> or<00:00:26.130> eight<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.580> because

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
level seven or eight for this because

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.150 
level seven or eight for this because
you'll<00:00:27.060> earn<00:00:27.180> free<00:00:27.539> gold<00:00:27.779> each<00:00:27.960> time<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.529> it's

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
you'll earn free gold each time and it's

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.490 
you'll earn free gold each time and it's
still<00:00:29.369> relatively<00:00:29.789> quick<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.330> level<00:00:30.630> I've<00:00:31.320> cut

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
still relatively quick to level I've cut

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.139 
still relatively quick to level I've cut
out<00:00:31.529> most<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.980> loading<00:00:32.250> screens<00:00:32.579> because

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
out most of a loading screens because

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.360 
out most of a loading screens because
they<00:00:33.510> are<00:00:33.660> awful<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.350> most<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.190> gameplay

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
they are awful and most of the gameplay

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.119 
they are awful and most of the gameplay
as<00:00:35.610> well<00:00:35.640> because<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.570> awful<00:00:36.930> but<00:00:37.829> basically

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
as well because it's awful but basically

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.950 
as well because it's awful but basically
this<00:00:38.340> glitch<00:00:38.610> works<00:00:38.910> because<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> game<00:00:39.719> keeps

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
this glitch works because the game keeps

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.040 
this glitch works because the game keeps
track<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.260> your<00:00:40.530> level<00:00:40.920> or<00:00:41.309> your<00:00:41.489> fame

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
track of your level or your fame

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.090 
track of your level or your fame
separately<00:00:43.050> tally<00:00:43.320> keeps<00:00:43.559> track<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.860> your

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
separately tally keeps track of your

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.819 
separately tally keeps track of your
currency<00:00:44.460> both<00:00:44.910> silver<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.600> gold<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.260> you'll

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
currency both silver and gold and you'll

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.529 
currency both silver and gold and you'll
see<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:47.670> only<00:00:47.730> will<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> gold

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
see that because not only will the gold

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.540 
see that because not only will the gold
be<00:00:48.750> duplicated<00:00:49.410> spoiler<00:00:50.070> alert

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
be duplicated spoiler alert

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.479 
be duplicated spoiler alert
so<00:00:50.850> will<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> silver<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:52.370> so<00:00:53.370> once

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489

you<00:01:33.360> know<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.049> level<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.470> up<00:01:34.650> play

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
you know is going to level you up play

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.640 
you know is going to level you up play
for<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.850> exit<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> dashboard<00:01:36.960> again<00:01:37.439> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
for it exit to the dashboard again and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.670 
for it exit to the dashboard again and
you'll<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.189> even<00:01:38.340> more<00:01:38.520> gold<00:01:39.560> just<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
you'll have even more gold just to

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.050 
you'll have even more gold just to
repeat<00:01:40.920> something<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.340> said<00:01:41.400> earlier<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
repeat something I said earlier it's a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.370 
repeat something I said earlier it's a
good<00:01:42.180> idea<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.450> wait<00:01:42.689> until<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.020> end<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.259> with

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
good idea to wait until you end up with

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.440 
good idea to wait until you end up with
seven<00:01:43.680> or<00:01:43.770> eight<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.490> because<00:01:45.329> you

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
seven or eight to do this because you

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.240 
seven or eight to do this because you
earn<00:01:45.600> free<00:01:45.930> gold<00:01:46.229> instead<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:46.920> gold<00:01:47.130> at

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
earn free gold instead of one gold at

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.010 
earn free gold instead of one gold at
the<00:01:47.280> beginning<00:01:47.729> or<00:01:47.909> two<00:01:48.210> gold<00:01:48.450> within<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> mid

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the beginning or two gold within the mid

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.230 
the beginning or two gold within the mid
levels<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.460> would<00:01:50.579> imagine<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.909> amount<00:01:51.119> of

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
levels and I would imagine the amount of

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.300 
levels and I would imagine the amount of
gold<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.659> earn<00:01:51.810> increases<00:01:52.649> as<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.920> level<00:01:53.189> up

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
gold you earn increases as you level up

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.850 
gold you earn increases as you level up
but<00:01:53.670> honestly<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.240> game<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.630> terrible<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.470> I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
but honestly this game is terrible and I

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.990 
but honestly this game is terrible and I
would<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.219> recommend<00:01:56.369> getting<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.880> much

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
would really recommend getting as much

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.580 
would really recommend getting as much
gold<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.689> early<00:01:57.990> on

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
gold as you can early on

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.109 
gold as you can early on
leveling<00:02:00.590> up<00:02:00.710> is<00:02:00.799> also<00:02:01.070> quite<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.310> slow<00:02:01.610> process

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
leveling up is also quite a slow process

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.700 
leveling up is also quite a slow process
and<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.509> would<00:02:02.659> imagine<00:02:02.750> they<00:02:03.229> go<00:02:03.350> into<00:02:03.500> patch

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
and I would imagine they go into patch

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.840 
and I would imagine they go into patch
this<00:02:03.920> very<00:02:04.189> very<00:02:04.400> soon<00:02:06.070> so<00:02:07.070> again<00:02:07.369> I've<00:02:07.640> got<00:02:07.759> to

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
this very very soon so again I've got to

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.969 
this very very soon so again I've got to
fist<00:02:08.000> screen<00:02:08.300> my<00:02:08.780> rewards<00:02:09.200> are<00:02:09.259> coming<00:02:09.530> down<00:02:09.739> I

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
fist screen my rewards are coming down I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.270 
fist screen my rewards are coming down I
have<00:02:10.429> leveled<00:02:10.819> up<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:15.260> immediately<00:02:15.920> once<00:02:16.220> the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
have leveled up so immediately once the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.710 
have leveled up so immediately once the
rewards<00:02:16.700> are<00:02:16.790> shown<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.270> exit<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:17.630> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
rewards are shown I exit to the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.120 
rewards are shown I exit to the

we go back in again and I have six gold

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.020 
we go back in again and I have six gold
