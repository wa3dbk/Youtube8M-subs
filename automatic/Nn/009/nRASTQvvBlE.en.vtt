 every time I get this and something else 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.740
 How you never put comfort ax 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.080
 - she has a new technology in the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.989
 market would not say that perhaps the only one 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.380
 Does this comfort take the ink beyond 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.030
 to please both protection I do not say in a 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.890
 process of repainting a process 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.410
 cultural heritage, it provides a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.850
 a more pleasant comfort environment 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.070
 Diego technically you working 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.289
 both in the heat reduction part in the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.379
 maine or in the part at the time of the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.020
 cold it allows to pass to the low 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.420
 salaries the ultraviolet still ie me 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.370
 I have both sensations I'm going to hit me. 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.320
 protect me from the cold and protect me 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 name of a sensation of freshness in the heat 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.400
 in squid this is simply a product 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.290
 simple product even with a 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.840
 technology they have the same 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.049
 smart particles can we 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.700
 ink does not think this django operation 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.560
 the climatic situation does not 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.299
 It's an ink I can change the color of the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.880
 my land can not change for your 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.040
 tv also if you do not want to change if 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.810
 I want neutral it also has several 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.650
 color options I do not have several options 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.110
 of colors 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.270
 one of the things things talk like talk about 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.460
 a tile soon with this one, okay? 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.829
 realize that I 've never been then, huh? 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.040
 equal the balance of the industry then it is a 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.159
 tile is the process of first painting 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.710
 first wash this tile is to make a 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.470
 using the product in dilution 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.570
 that we recommend there are no people who 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.130
 will apply paint without dilution then 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.960
 this is a problem over painting 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.810
 to the building what I do first 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.540
 place you will open the packaging to 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.240
 Do you want to go get the product? 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.329
 make a pre-mix before 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.130
 gives the dilution of the product without it 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.450
 homogeneously 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.390
 Now, we 're going to people. 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.250
 with the dilution process in water 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.200
 and water pollution and water is not a 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.690
 water-based product detail it is a 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.300
 product is that they do not have double then 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.010
 I can work, he has issues there. 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.660
 I worry about the smell even if it 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.610
 protect smell of love 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.019
 staff is always important when 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.360
 working with it works with 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.590
 to be concerned first with the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.530
 security right? 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.480
 this is it I assume a family father 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.880
 a housewife as professional 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.980
 course, sometimes we can give 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.650
 I also hit kot but if you have one 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.739
 roof still on ground he did not go up to see 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.080
 about I can imagine avoiding falls 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.370
 accidents or even the instrument that 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.690
 We have to be careful with the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.970
 security issue 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.860
 we recommend that you stay tuned until the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.569
 packaging text we found 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.970
 leaving the packaging in didactics is not 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.849
 compliant sheet that touches has step 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.620
 how to use how to dilute the 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.480
 care with surface preparation 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.000
 Seeking is with you here in that nation. 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.400
 packaging who come on so come on 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.350
 I'll just put it on a motorcycle so it's the 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.799
 The more I go there, the more I should not 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.019
 grow only when you are ok 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.600
 then the individual organization does not 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.609
 also forgetting oxy 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.410
 work with one with a situation where 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.780
 I know it can be applied to both 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.100
 volume as in pistol in the gun 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.239
 interesting you are using a 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.680
 fascist protection 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.660
 I wish it could be a great deal. 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.880
 along with it is starting very 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:39.560
 so with safety glasses 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.560
 I'll get the product and make a dilution. 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:50.750
 ok already illusion this we have more than 400 ml 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.000
 This is it, and you will talk a little 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.950
 Pomegranate right put some water 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.180
 while here we are around 400 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.769
 ml né 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.739
 what we are going to do a dilution one 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.769
 A little above just talking is more or less 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.040
 to cnet the first leblon she has she 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.390
 may be a little more serious and no longer 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.010
 above but yes 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.470
 I need to use this problem with 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.180
 modeling it will be there because the people 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.910
 It is assumed that the trail has a 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.919
 absorption and I need then 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.859
 first moment a little more water 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.860
 reached the product further we go there 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.760
 we do the colonel agra before we go 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.830
 do the pre-mix always check there 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.550
 to know that it is now very fine is only 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.550
 put here 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.400
 we have a roller we have the brush and 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.370
 remembering can also be applied 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.350
 pistol is a slightly larger dilution 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.240
 that I made this decrease was 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.940
 an initial dilution to work with 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.640
 these two tools pistol aa 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.750
 she had compressed air she needs to 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.340
 where just a little bigger 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.580
 is not how it works with the addition of 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.090
 30% ok, let's get ready for it 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:04.190
 I want to see if I can handle or 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.190
 make the first application of nutrition 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.650
 us the option speaks following him 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.110
 leaves as paint thinner is better 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.590
 so you can spread more uniform 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:23.150
 How did I do the pain, what leaves the 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.070
 solve mind what is on your hands and 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.780
 I'll have to give it 's necessary to train. 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.420
 normal only we asked for a break 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.640
 minimum of two hours take the same 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.370
 situation, I'll carry it later. 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.980
 looking at the top of the tray 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.960
 had is surplus né 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.000
 and then we apply the second coat 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.690
 after two hours remembering is 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 important the surface is cold right 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.250
 very hot look it speeds up 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.140
 drying of the product we can have a 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.400
 problem and with peeling then it is 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.090
 a detail 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.460
 liked this news at last our land 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.800
 You look wonderful, you had a 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.110
 highlight or be andrade we choose 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.960
 this color but I can paint with that 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.160
 In this product we have a 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:13.910
 of environment during rock 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.120
 we have a base with the very white color is 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.620
 only to imagine that is what the 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.290
 Things You Can Paint Your Ground 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.590
 only a personal detail how much more 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:27.050
 light color the reception of 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.570
 heat netter 13 detail also we 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.620
 we work with clear tone and layout 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.420
 from the roof 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.190
 we will have a better behavior in the 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.920
 reduction of heat output and 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.980
 eternal who is this, you have a tip 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.330
 super cool to renew and protect your 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.780
 roof that is better is the insulation 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.780
 thermal 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.710
 one more problem coming to the end but 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.190
 I wait for you and tomorrow, I'll take everything. 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.190
 can
