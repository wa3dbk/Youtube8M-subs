and see I know their cap in a so I'm

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.260 
and see I know their cap in a so I'm
basically<00:01:47.340> predicting<00:01:47.880> them<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> go<00:01:48.119> through

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
this tunnel I was gonna go try and

attack<00:01:49.590> them<00:01:49.740> there<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.729> realized

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
attack them there but then I realized

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.760 
attack them there but then I realized
that<00:01:51.570> I'd<00:01:51.750> run<00:01:51.990> into<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.229> whole<00:01:52.409> guru<00:01:52.619> them

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that I'd run into a whole guru them

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.870

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
going down from the tunnel and I really

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.770 
going down from the tunnel and I really
want<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.119> approach<00:01:54.299> them<00:01:54.509> from<00:01:54.659> behind

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
want to approach them from behind
