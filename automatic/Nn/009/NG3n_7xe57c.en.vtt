okay this is still not quite ready it's
making<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.490> row<00:01:20.729> kind<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.330> thing<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:21.990> not

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
making a row kind of thing so it's not

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.469 
making a row kind of thing so it's not
quite<00:01:22.530> ready<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.009> feels<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.299> that's

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
quite ready it feels like it but that's

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.300 
quite ready it feels like it but that's
how<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.750> check<00:01:25.080> there's<00:01:25.439> still<00:01:25.710> moisture<00:01:25.920> in

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
how you check there's still moisture in

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.210 
how you check there's still moisture in
these<00:01:26.460> stem<00:01:26.790> cells<00:01:26.820> cause<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:28.439> mildew<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
these stem cells cause what mildew and

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.069 
these stem cells cause what mildew and
can<00:01:29.400> bail<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.729> up<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.210> let's<00:01:30.840> get

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
can bail it up like this let's get

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.789 
can bail it up like this let's get
really<00:01:31.710> close<00:01:32.570> probably<00:01:33.570> another<00:01:34.170> day<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
really close probably another day and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.090 
really close probably another day and
it'll<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.070> ready<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.430> bail<00:01:35.640> when<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.450> bail

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
it'll be ready to bail when we do bail

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.770 
it'll be ready to bail when we do bail
we<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.340> want<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:39.650> in<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:42.680> top<00:01:44.509> fill<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.689> up
