damage and the tiger has a nice scope

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.030 
damage and the tiger has a nice scope
which<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> really<00:01:24.540> useful<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> far<00:01:25.560> distance

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
which is really useful on a far distance

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.920 
which is really useful on a far distance
since<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.000> light<00:01:27.180> weapon<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.780> move

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
since it's a light weapon you can move

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.330 
since it's a light weapon you can move
really<00:01:28.140> fast<00:01:28.409> from<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.890> place<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.159> another

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
really fast from one place to another

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.700 
really fast from one place to another
the<00:01:29.970> only<00:01:30.210> disadvantage<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.590> this

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the only disadvantage is is that this

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.319 
the only disadvantage is is that this
weapon<00:01:32.040> does<00:01:32.159> not<00:01:32.340> contain<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.729> lot<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.000> ammo

for killing several people with one ammo
