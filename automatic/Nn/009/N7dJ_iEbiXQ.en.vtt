00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
version of Alinea recipe and we decided

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
version of Alinea recipe and we decided
instead<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.970> putting<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.600> through<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.840> chinois

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
instead of putting it through a chinois

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.719 
instead of putting it through a chinois
that<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.530> would<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.799> try<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.460> through

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that we would just try to do it through

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.910 
that we would just try to do it through
some<00:01:09.180> cheesecloth<00:01:09.720> yeah<00:01:10.140> two<00:01:10.470> layers<00:01:10.680> of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
some cheesecloth yeah two layers of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.560 
some cheesecloth yeah two layers of
cheesecloth<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.670> would<00:01:11.850> get<00:01:12.030> strain

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
cheesecloth so it would get strain

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.380 
cheesecloth so it would get strain
properly<00:01:13.200> right<00:01:13.890> which<00:01:14.280> did<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.520> work<00:01:14.820> nice

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
which could have been because we

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
either way there was no making cubes out

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.530 
either way there was no making cubes out
of<00:03:02.099> them<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.549> those<00:03:02.730> are<00:03:02.760> hard<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.209> put<00:03:03.419> onto

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
of them and those are hard to put onto

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.629 
of them and those are hard to put onto
the<00:03:03.750> skewer<00:03:04.049> you<00:03:04.799> sort<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.040> had<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.189> crumple

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
the skewer you sort of had to crumple

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.030 
the skewer you sort of had to crumple
them<00:03:05.699> and<00:03:06.090> do<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.239> ball<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.989> just<00:03:07.469> hope<00:03:07.769> that

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
them and do a ball and just hope that

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.009 
them and do a ball and just hope that
they<00:03:08.340> would<00:03:08.519> be<00:03:08.760> sticky<00:03:09.239> enough<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.689> cling<00:03:09.989> to

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
they would be sticky enough to cling to

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.220 
they would be sticky enough to cling to
the<00:03:10.409> to<00:03:10.919> the<00:03:10.949> fake<00:03:11.250> oak<00:03:11.519> branch<00:03:11.900> skewer<00:03:12.900> yeah

stay on long enough to get dipped in the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.080 
stay on long enough to get dipped in the
batter<00:03:15.359> yeah<00:03:15.959> now<00:03:16.709> another<00:03:16.979> problem<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.759> we

set the leaves on fire yeah Julie is
making<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.609> base<00:03:35.819> here<00:03:36.090> out<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.389> four<00:03:36.840> wine

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
making a base here out of four wine

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.059 
making a base here out of four wine
corks<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.639> so<00:03:39.629> later<00:03:39.900> she<00:03:40.319> would<00:03:40.470> pierce<00:03:40.799> this

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
corks and so later she would pierce this

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.360 
corks and so later she would pierce this
with<00:03:42.049> several<00:03:43.049> different<00:03:43.439> wires<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:44.189> would

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
with several different wires that would

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.539 
with several different wires that would
hold<00:03:44.759> this<00:03:45.079> skewer<00:03:46.079> upright<00:03:46.530> sword<00:03:47.189> I<00:03:47.310> later

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
hold this skewer upright sword I later

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.119 
hold this skewer upright sword I later
yeah<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.329> was<00:03:48.449> a<00:03:48.479> little<00:03:48.840> wobbly<00:03:49.049> but<00:03:49.319> the

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
yeah it was a little wobbly but the

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.030 
yeah it was a little wobbly but the
concept<00:03:50.669> worked<00:03:50.939> pretty<00:03:51.239> much<00:03:51.650> not<00:03:52.650> Julie

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
concept worked pretty much not Julie

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.659 
concept worked pretty much not Julie

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
highly carbonated water so we use we use

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.340 
highly carbonated water so we use we use
lacroix<00:05:43.130> just<00:05:43.550> standard<00:05:44.180> water<00:05:44.450> it<00:05:44.990> also<00:05:45.140> is

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
lacroix just standard water it also is

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.810

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
the gray cold one it was drunk faster

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.140 
the gray cold one it was drunk faster
than<00:05:51.950> we<00:05:52.070> could<00:05:52.310> save<00:05:53.000> it<00:05:53.290> so<00:05:54.290> we<00:05:54.440> used

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
than we could save it so we used

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.270 
than we could save it so we used
slightly<00:05:56.150> cold<00:05:56.600> slightly<00:05:57.110> cold<00:05:57.560> highly

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
slightly cold slightly cold highly

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.730 
slightly cold slightly cold highly
carbonated<00:05:58.520> well<00:05:59.210> well<00:05:59.420> perhaps<00:05:59.740> carbonated

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
carbonated well well perhaps carbonated

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.970 
carbonated well well perhaps carbonated
water<00:06:00.920> and<00:06:01.990> we<00:06:02.990> measured<00:06:03.320> it<00:06:03.440> out<00:06:03.560> just

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
water and we measured it out just

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.240 
water and we measured it out just
perfectly<00:06:04.430> and<00:06:05.020> this<00:06:06.020> is<00:06:06.470> the<00:06:06.620> results<00:06:07.130> of

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
perfectly and this is the results of

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.340 
perfectly and this is the results of
those<00:06:08.120> proportions<00:06:08.810> we<00:06:09.680> got<00:06:09.920> a<00:06:10.510> pace<00:06:11.510> very

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
those proportions we got a pace very

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.060 
those proportions we got a pace very
thick<00:06:12.710> so<00:06:13.250> we<00:06:13.700> just<00:06:14.660> added<00:06:14.930> water<00:06:15.290> until<00:06:15.920> we

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
thick so we just added water until we

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.280 
thick so we just added water until we
thought<00:06:16.280> the<00:06:16.430> consistency<00:06:17.180> was<00:06:17.360> about<00:06:17.900> like

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
thought the consistency was about like

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.380 
thought the consistency was about like
that's<00:06:18.770> in<00:06:18.920> for<00:06:19.130> a<00:06:19.160> batter<00:06:19.370> would<00:06:19.640> yeah<00:06:19.880> but

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
that's in for a batter would yeah but

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.600 
that's in for a batter would yeah but
we've<00:06:20.510> had<00:06:20.930> to<00:06:21.110> add<00:06:21.260> probably<00:06:21.770> twice<00:06:22.130> as<00:06:22.190> much

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
we've had to add probably twice as much

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.150 
we've had to add probably twice as much
water<00:06:22.880> if<00:06:23.210> not<00:06:23.450> more<00:06:23.840> I<00:06:24.140> nominate<00:06:24.440> this<00:06:24.890> as<00:06:25.130> a

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
water if not more I nominate this as a

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.730 
water if not more I nominate this as a
misprint<00:06:25.640> so<00:06:26.330> this<00:06:26.480> is<00:06:26.630> the<00:06:26.780> lineup

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
misprint so this is the lineup

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.960 
misprint so this is the lineup
what's<00:06:27.889> going<00:06:28.130> on<00:06:28.250> the<00:06:28.340> skewer<00:06:28.610> you<00:06:28.819> have

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
what's going on the skewer you have

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.110 
what's going on the skewer you have
shallots<00:06:29.270> the<00:06:30.110> pheasant<00:06:30.590> the<00:06:31.130> cubes<00:06:31.610> yeah

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
shallots the pheasant the cubes yeah

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.499 
shallots the pheasant the cubes yeah
which<00:06:32.419> would<00:06:32.630> work<00:06:32.840> he<00:06:33.110> was<00:06:33.349> sort<00:06:33.830> of<00:06:33.949> cubes

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:34.509 
which would work he was sort of cubes

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.450 
which would work he was sort of cubes
right<00:06:35.509> were<00:06:35.960> you<00:06:36.560> can<00:06:36.680> see<00:06:36.830> her<00:06:36.919> fingers<00:06:37.280> yeah

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
right were you can see her fingers yeah

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.760 
right were you can see her fingers yeah
actually<00:06:37.789> here<00:06:38.360> are<00:06:38.539> very<00:06:38.930> difficult<00:06:39.169> to<00:06:39.500> put

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
actually here are very difficult to put

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.460 
actually here are very difficult to put
on<00:06:39.919> because<00:06:40.250> it<00:06:40.940> was<00:06:41.180> so<00:06:41.479> soft<00:06:41.780> it<00:06:42.169> hadn't

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
on because it was so soft it hadn't

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.760 
on because it was so soft it hadn't
really<00:06:42.680> gelled<00:06:42.979> enough<00:06:43.310> and<00:06:43.780> here's<00:06:44.780> our<00:06:44.990> fake

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
really gelled enough and here's our fake

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.580 
really gelled enough and here's our fake
oak<00:06:46.099> branch<00:06:46.460> hooking<00:06:47.270> there<00:06:47.630> the<00:06:48.139> oil<00:06:48.319> also

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
oak branch hooking there the oil also

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.029 
oak branch hooking there the oil also
spattered<00:06:49.280> like<00:06:49.490> crazy<00:06:49.910> it<00:06:50.630> was<00:06:50.870> very<00:06:51.110> hot<00:06:51.710> the

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 
spattered like crazy it was very hot the

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.540 
spattered like crazy it was very hot the
first<00:06:52.310> one<00:06:52.520> we<00:06:53.120> fed<00:06:53.389> to<00:06:53.780> our<00:06:54.229> friends<00:06:55.039> Josh<00:06:55.280> and

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
first one we fed to our friends Josh and

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.360 
first one we fed to our friends Josh and
Anthony<00:06:55.970> they<00:06:56.389> said<00:06:57.199> that<00:06:57.349> it<00:06:57.470> tasted<00:06:57.860> like<00:06:57.919> an

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
Anthony they said that it tasted like an

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.480 
Anthony they said that it tasted like an
overcooked<00:06:58.940> chicken<00:06:59.349> mcnugget<00:07:00.349> which<00:07:00.800> was

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
overcooked chicken mcnugget which was

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.939 
overcooked chicken mcnugget which was
not<00:07:01.699> pleasant<00:07:01.970> to<00:07:02.240> hear<00:07:02.539> after<00:07:03.139> seven<00:07:03.889> hours

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949 
not pleasant to hear after seven hours

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.370 
not pleasant to hear after seven hours
in<00:07:04.220> the<00:07:04.310> kitchen<00:07:04.400> so<00:07:05.120> that's<00:07:05.360> it<00:07:05.569> pheasant
