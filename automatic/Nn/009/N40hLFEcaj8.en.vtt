00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:23.429 
full of gooseberries as you can see and

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.609

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
then I have that crazy branch just full

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.769 
then I have that crazy branch just full
of<00:00:26.650> them<00:00:26.859> and<00:00:27.029> they<00:00:28.029> are<00:00:28.060> just<00:00:28.390> starting<00:00:28.539> to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
of them and they are just starting to

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.249 
of them and they are just starting to
ripen<00:00:28.990> and<00:00:29.920> somebody<00:00:30.789> asking<00:00:31.060> you<00:00:31.259> little

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
ripen and somebody asking you little

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.820 
ripen and somebody asking you little
while<00:00:32.380> ago

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
while ago

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.340 
while ago
how<00:00:33.310> do<00:00:33.370> you<00:00:33.460> know<00:00:33.550> when<00:00:33.700> they're<00:00:33.820> ripe

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
how do you know when they're ripe

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.480 
how do you know when they're ripe
because<00:00:35.350> they<00:00:35.620> don't<00:00:35.800> always<00:00:35.890> change<00:00:36.250> color

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
because they don't always change color

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.850 
because they don't always change color
you<00:00:36.790> can<00:00:36.970> let<00:00:37.120> them<00:00:37.270> sometimes<00:00:37.719> go<00:00:38.590> all<00:00:38.770> the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
you can let them sometimes go all the

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.860 
you can let them sometimes go all the
way<00:00:38.890> till<00:00:39.160> they're<00:00:39.280> full<00:00:39.460> red<00:00:39.670> but<00:00:40.510> if<00:00:40.750> you

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
way till they're full red but if you

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.310 
way till they're full red but if you
have<00:00:41.020> bugs<00:00:41.260> like<00:00:42.180> 99%<00:00:43.180> of<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.449> population<00:00:43.539> you

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
have bugs like 99% of the population you

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.560 
have bugs like 99% of the population you
don't<00:00:44.559> always<00:00:44.649> want<00:00:44.860> to<00:00:44.949> pick<00:00:45.070> them<00:00:45.309> when

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
don't always want to pick them when

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.779 
don't always want to pick them when
they're<00:00:46.570> fully<00:00:46.870> ripe<00:00:47.370> they're<00:00:48.370> pretty<00:00:48.579> sweet

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
they're fully ripe they're pretty sweet

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.760 
they're fully ripe they're pretty sweet
now<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:50.170> trick<00:00:50.410> I<00:00:50.530> go<00:00:50.680> by<00:00:51.059> once<00:00:52.059> any<00:00:52.329> of<00:00:52.539> them

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
now the trick I go by once any of them

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.090 
now the trick I go by once any of them
get<00:00:53.770> even<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.160> little<00:00:54.280> bit<00:00:54.430> of<00:00:54.520> frosting<00:00:54.969> of<00:00:55.149> red

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
get even a little bit of frosting of red

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.100 
get even a little bit of frosting of red
they're<00:00:57.100> pretty<00:00:57.309> sweet<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.649> pick<00:00:59.859> this

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.139 

yeah<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:04.350> sweet

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:13.440 

you<00:01:07.659> can<00:01:07.810> let<00:01:07.929> them<00:01:08.049> go<00:01:08.229> a<00:01:10.200> little<00:01:11.200> bit<00:01:12.450> more

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
you can let them go a little bit more

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.990 
you can let them go a little bit more
red<00:01:13.630> but<00:01:14.280> personally<00:01:15.280> I<00:01:15.340> don't<00:01:15.490> let<00:01:15.729> them<00:01:15.850> go

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
red but personally I don't let them go

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.660 
red but personally I don't let them go
much<00:01:16.479> more<00:01:16.719> red<00:01:16.899> than<00:01:16.929> this<00:01:17.429> because<00:01:18.429> at<00:01:18.579> that

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
much more red than this because at that

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.450 
much more red than this because at that
point<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:20.259> birds<00:01:20.530> start<00:01:20.740> eyeing<00:01:21.039> them<00:01:21.159> up<00:01:21.280> and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
point the birds start eyeing them up and

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.399 
point the birds start eyeing them up and
even<00:01:22.390> come<00:01:22.539> back<00:01:22.689> one<00:01:22.899> day<00:01:22.929> and<00:01:23.079> you'll<00:01:23.319> get

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
even come back one day and you'll get

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.289 
even come back one day and you'll get
none<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:23.829> there's<00:01:24.610> something<00:01:24.759> to<00:01:24.850> me<00:01:25.000> lots<00:01:25.209> of

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
none and there's something to me lots of

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:25.770 
none and there's something to me lots of
times

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
times

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.980 
times
between<00:01:26.649> all<00:01:26.829> these<00:01:27.119> types<00:01:28.119> of<00:01:28.299> gooseberry

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
between all these types of gooseberry

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.719 
between all these types of gooseberry
bushes

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.330 

and<00:01:34.360> I'll<00:01:34.450> just<00:01:34.479> show<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:34.810> my<00:01:35.079> other<00:01:35.439> one

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.720 

now<00:01:40.340> this<00:01:40.490> point<00:01:40.700> here<00:01:40.970> it's<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.660> older<00:01:41.900> plant

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
now this point here it's the older plant

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.480 
now this point here it's the older plant
it's<00:01:43.730> a<00:01:43.910> bit<00:01:44.210> bigger<00:01:44.690> and<00:01:44.930> bushier<00:01:45.320> I<00:01:45.560> can't

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
it's a bit bigger and bushier I can't

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.890 
it's a bit bigger and bushier I can't
say<00:01:46.640> that<00:01:46.760> it's<00:01:46.940> yielding<00:01:47.420> much<00:01:47.570> more<00:01:47.810> than

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
say that it's yielding much more than

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.400 
say that it's yielding much more than
the<00:01:47.960> other<00:01:48.080> one

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
the other one

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.190 
the other one
well<00:01:48.830> maybe<00:01:49.010> oh<00:01:51.700> yeah<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:52.820> can<00:01:52.970> see<00:01:53.000> this<00:01:53.960> one

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
well maybe oh yeah you can see this one

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.840 
well maybe oh yeah you can see this one
seems<00:01:54.440> to<00:01:54.500> be<00:01:54.650> sweeter<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.310> maybe<00:01:55.610> that's

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
seems to be sweeter and maybe that's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.350 
seems to be sweeter and maybe that's
just<00:01:56.150> cause<00:01:56.270> it's<00:01:56.420> older<00:01:56.720> I<00:01:56.870> don't<00:01:57.020> know<00:02:01.360> yeah

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
just cause it's older I don't know yeah

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.190 
just cause it's older I don't know yeah
that's<00:02:02.480> really<00:02:02.690> sweet

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
that's really sweet

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.610 
that's really sweet
considering<00:02:03.920> they're<00:02:04.040> still<00:02:04.280> uh<00:02:05.440> colored<00:02:06.440> and

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
considering they're still uh colored and

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.170 
considering they're still uh colored and
then<00:02:06.740> occasionally<00:02:07.520> you'll<00:02:07.820> see<00:02:07.850> one<00:02:08.060> like

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
then occasionally you'll see one like

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.350 
then occasionally you'll see one like
this<00:02:09.250> when<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.340> see<00:02:10.369> one<00:02:10.610> like<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:10.790> and<00:02:11.210> then

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
this when you see one like that and then

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.730 
this when you see one like that and then
the<00:02:11.450> rest<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.720> them<00:02:11.810> are<00:02:11.870> all<00:02:11.930> green<00:02:12.200> be<00:02:12.530> really

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
the rest of them are all green be really

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.070 
the rest of them are all green be really
suspicious<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:14.480> know<00:02:14.570> when<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.780> pick<00:02:14.900> it

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
suspicious you know when you pick it

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.920 
suspicious you know when you pick it
take<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.320> look<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:16.820> can<00:02:16.850> tell<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.330> bug<00:02:17.540> got

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
take a look you can tell that a bug got

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.600 
take a look you can tell that a bug got
in<00:02:18.050> there<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:19.640> made<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.410> sort<00:02:21.410> of<00:02:21.610> ripen

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
in there and that made it sort of ripen

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.300 
in there and that made it sort of ripen
or<00:02:22.820> rot<00:02:23.090> or<00:02:23.360> whatever<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.750> want<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.930> call<00:02:24.020> it

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
or rot or whatever you want to call it

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.680 
or rot or whatever you want to call it
so<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.550> one<00:02:25.700> I'm<00:02:26.030> not<00:02:26.210> going<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.450> be<00:02:26.540> eating

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
so that one I'm not going to be eating

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.090 
so that one I'm not going to be eating
that<00:02:26.720> one<00:02:27.010> I'll<00:02:28.010> just<00:02:28.040> throw<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.490> away<00:02:30.100> yeah

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
that one I'll just throw it away yeah

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.570 
that one I'll just throw it away yeah
this<00:02:31.310> one<00:02:31.490> has<00:02:31.640> little<00:02:32.620> light<00:02:33.620> frosting<00:02:34.400> of

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
this one has little light frosting of

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.380 
this one has little light frosting of
red<00:02:34.760> on<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.090> I<00:02:36.100> would<00:02:37.100> probably<00:02:37.300> wait

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:55.360 

I<00:02:41.420> don't<00:02:42.080> know<00:02:42.140> if<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.290> camera<00:02:42.560> can<00:02:42.680> see<00:02:42.710> that

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.600 

yeah<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.150> would<00:02:56.390> probably<00:02:56.510> wait<00:02:57.610> another

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
yeah so I would probably wait another

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.900 
yeah so I would probably wait another
week<00:02:58.760> before<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.110> picked<00:03:00.290> all<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.500> them

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
week before I just picked all of them

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.660 
week before I just picked all of them
most<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:02.060> them<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.330> taste<00:03:02.540> are<00:03:02.750> sweet

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
most of them I taste are sweet

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.860 
most of them I taste are sweet
unfortunate<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.819> enough<00:03:05.060> that<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.330> can<00:03:05.510> ill

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
unfortunate I have enough that I can ill

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.470 
unfortunate I have enough that I can ill
sample<00:03:06.319> some<00:03:06.530> here<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.769> there<00:03:07.330> but<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:08.390> think

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
sample some here and there but I think

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.250 
sample some here and there but I think
I'm<00:03:08.690> going<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.870> wait<00:03:09.970> another<00:03:10.970> week<00:03:11.260> I'll

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
I'm going to wait another week I'll

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.160 
I'm going to wait another week I'll
taste<00:03:12.970> probably<00:03:13.970> 5<00:03:14.180> or<00:03:14.209> 10<00:03:14.480> of<00:03:14.510> them<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.930> if

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
taste probably 5 or 10 of them and if

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.330 
taste probably 5 or 10 of them and if
they're<00:03:15.319> all<00:03:15.410> sweet<00:03:15.680> I'll<00:03:15.890> pick<00:03:16.069> them<00:03:16.190> off

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
they're all sweet I'll pick them off

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.680 
they're all sweet I'll pick them off
that's<00:03:16.730> what<00:03:16.940> I'll<00:03:17.030> do

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
that's what I'll do

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.300 
that's what I'll do
I<00:03:17.720> don't<00:03:18.319> want<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.530> birds<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.860> get<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.160> them

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
I don't want the birds to get to them

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.880 
I don't want the birds to get to them
birds<00:03:19.760> just<00:03:19.970> love<00:03:20.209> these<00:03:20.330> or<00:03:21.080> whatever<00:03:21.530> other

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
birds just love these or whatever other

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.740 
birds just love these or whatever other
animals<00:03:22.340> in<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.580> middle<00:03:22.790> of<00:03:22.849> night<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.239> know

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
animals in the middle of night you know

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.199 
animals in the middle of night you know
just<00:03:23.989> they<00:03:24.170> pick<00:03:24.349> these<00:03:24.500> things<00:03:24.739> clean<00:03:25.209> I

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
just they pick these things clean I

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.270 
just they pick these things clean I
think<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.750> only<00:03:26.870> good<00:03:26.959> thing<00:03:27.319> is<00:03:27.470> these<00:03:28.069> have

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
think the only good thing is these have

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.470 
think the only good thing is these have
thorns<00:03:28.780> very<00:03:29.780> big<00:03:29.930> thorns<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:31.360> think<00:03:32.360> that

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
thorns very big thorns and I think that

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.960 
thorns very big thorns and I think that
keeps<00:03:32.690> that<00:03:32.840> some<00:03:33.110> of<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.349> pests<00:03:33.980> but<00:03:34.220> the

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
keeps that some of the pests but the

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.410 
keeps that some of the pests but the
birds<00:03:35.209> don't<00:03:35.480> seem<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.900> care<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.910> that's<00:03:38.090> how<00:03:38.360> I

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
birds don't seem to care so that's how I

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.289 
birds don't seem to care so that's how I
choose<00:03:39.200> one<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:39.620> harvest<00:03:40.430> my<00:03:40.610> gooseberries

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
choose one to harvest my gooseberries

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.890 
choose one to harvest my gooseberries
and<00:03:41.510> look<00:03:42.379> at<00:03:42.500> how<00:03:42.560> they're<00:03:42.709> growing<00:03:42.860> I<00:03:43.900> hope

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
and look at how they're growing I hope

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.060
