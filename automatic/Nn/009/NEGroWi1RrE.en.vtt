because<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> title<00:00:48.570> I've<00:00:48.629> written<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
because on the title I've written the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.470 
because on the title I've written the
different<00:00:49.710> parts<00:00:50.039> part<00:00:50.309> 1<00:00:50.520> part<00:00:50.730> 2<00:00:50.850> part<00:00:50.940> 3<00:00:51.210> etc

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
different parts part 1 part 2 part 3 etc

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.619 
different parts part 1 part 2 part 3 etc
and<00:00:52.469> let's<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.550> how<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.910> go<00:00:54.090> ahead<00:00:54.420> with

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and let's see how we can go ahead with

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.540 
and let's see how we can go ahead with
the<00:00:54.870> design<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.800> particular<00:00:55.980> part

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the design so in this particular part

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.090 
the design so in this particular part
I'm<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> show<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.260> create<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.829> flat

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
I'm going to show you to create the flat

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
I'm going to show you to create the flat
boundaries<00:00:59.640> flat<00:00:59.969> boundary<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.390> important

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
boundaries flat boundary is important

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.240 
boundaries flat boundary is important
because<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.410> need<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.620> convert<00:01:01.980> this

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
because we need to convert this

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.179 
because we need to convert this
particular<00:01:03.120> surface<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.989> part<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.040> can

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
particular surface to part so if we can

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.740 
particular surface to part so if we can
really<00:01:05.369> converting<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> surface<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.479> part

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
really converting the surface to part

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.469 
really converting the surface to part
you<00:01:07.049> should<00:01:07.470> actually<00:01:07.700> clear<00:01:08.700> create<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
you should actually clear create the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.530 
you should actually clear create the
flat<00:01:10.229> boundaries<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.700> select<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> line

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
flat boundaries so select the line

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.130 
flat boundaries so select the line
definition<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
definition and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.390 
definition and
create<00:01:16.520> lines<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.880> this

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.420 

right

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
right

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.499 
right
another<00:01:26.030> one<00:01:26.330> over<00:01:26.630> here

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.830 

okay

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
okay

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.120 
okay
that's<00:01:32.409> it<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.880> we<00:01:33.970> got<00:01:34.119> three<00:01:34.509> lines<00:01:34.810> there

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
that's it so we got three lines there

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.929 
that's it so we got three lines there
now<00:01:36.130> use<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:37.149> fill<00:01:37.420> command<00:01:38.460> which<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.670> very

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
now use the fill command which is very

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.330 
now use the fill command which is very
useful<00:01:40.210> at<00:01:40.720> times<00:01:40.780> just<00:01:42.210> select

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.840 

and<00:01:45.579> use<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.960> filter<00:01:47.229> man<00:01:47.680> here<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:50.850> here

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
and use the filter man here here here

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.630 
and use the filter man here here here
okay

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.270 

another<00:01:55.180> one

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.270

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
complete closed surface the next step is

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.610 
complete closed surface the next step is
to<00:04:58.770> join<00:04:59.430> all<00:04:59.760> of<00:04:59.790> the<00:05:00.060> surfaces<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.810> then
