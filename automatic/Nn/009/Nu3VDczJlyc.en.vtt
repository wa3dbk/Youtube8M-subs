00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.430
 we come to the final stage of tailoring 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.610
 a blanket 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.180
 after we drained you embraced him 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.640
 need to be aligned in width and length 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.870
 trim excess padding and bumps 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.020
 edges we cut out an oblique inlay 10 wide 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:32.579
 centimeters and grind parts between 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.850
 a 45 degree angle 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.909
 our blanket is almost ready 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.719
 it remains only to grind the edge for this 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:45.510
 I carved out 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:52.589
 10 cm wide slant 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:56.800
 doubled and sharpen the recoil with a seam 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:59.469
 centimeter in general more than a centimeter 0 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.309
 2 millimeters that is , you decide what 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:05.440
 on top of 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:09.280
 the face is the front side there's inlay 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.280
 she herself is double and all knock on old 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.820
 cinema cute she lingering background fog 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.820
 so wide 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.250
 now we come to the corner 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:41.840
 do not bring the line to the width just went 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:53.710
 that is, the creature with these data needles 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:53.710
 take out turn 45 degrees and 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:08.200
 turn down again and continue to lay 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.200
 through line of the whole structure 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.590
 we already started on the perimeter less 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:41.410
 blanket oblique and got to the joints 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:41.410
 Now we cut off the surplus wiki 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.510
 and grind off 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.440
 limit switches among themselves 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:02.680
 but very close to doing basically 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:08.660
 odia false places pills where is here 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:11.230
 chaos here is more important to grind off the wall 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.230
 im angle 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:32.920
 without capturing it is unlikely we will capture 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.060
 pumped out the blanket and now let's 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:43.750
 let's see how the corner will look like 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:51.300
 we have it 100 than of the chin it turns out 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:51.300
 little corner very neatly on this side 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:03.120
 it already turns out to be a little corner and 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:09.230
 here is a little corner now need to take 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:13.620
 hand lu and very carefully skirting the cut 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.459
 overlapping the seam will occupy it 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.820
 hand stitches or straight stitches 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.590
 then do not apply on monofilament and 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.760
 stitching the front side of the bake 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.729
 one millimeter from the seam attachment in 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.460
 the side of the bake in the finished form bake 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.880
 should look the same with the face and 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.780
 seamy if you sew a blanket 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.530
 to the exhibition 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.940
 it is better to hem tape back secret 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.960
 cotton thread stitches 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.960
 our blanket is ready
