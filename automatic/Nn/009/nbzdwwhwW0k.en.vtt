it's time to take a look at animation in
fireworks<00:00:02.439> we'll<00:00:03.249> see<00:00:03.399> how<00:00:03.519> to<00:00:03.580> create<00:00:03.759> simple

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
use States to control your animation

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.060 
use States to control your animation
while<00:00:10.780> fireworks<00:00:11.200> isn't<00:00:11.559> necessarily<00:00:11.950> a

while fireworks isn't necessarily a
dedicated<00:00:12.579> animation<00:00:13.119> program<00:00:13.509> you<00:00:14.019> can

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:14.169 
dedicated animation program you can

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:15.390 
dedicated animation program you can
certainly<00:00:14.349> use<00:00:14.530> the<00:00:14.799> software<00:00:15.070> to<00:00:15.190> create

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
certainly use the software to create

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.640 
certainly use the software to create
simple<00:00:16.240> animations<00:00:16.689> that<00:00:16.869> you<00:00:17.320> can<00:00:17.529> either

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
simple animations that you can either

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.429 
simple animations that you can either
export<00:00:18.220> as<00:00:18.429> an<00:00:18.550> animated<00:00:18.910> gif<00:00:18.970> or<00:00:19.330> as<00:00:20.050> a<00:00:20.080> swift

complicated<00:00:24.849> but<00:00:25.029> for<00:00:25.210> simple<00:00:25.480> animations

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
complicated but for simple animations

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.749 
complicated but for simple animations
you<00:00:26.080> can<00:00:26.140> certainly<00:00:26.439> do<00:00:26.710> that<00:00:26.830> here<00:00:27.070> and<00:00:27.189> I'm

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
you can certainly do that here and I'm

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.279 
you can certainly do that here and I'm
going<00:00:27.939> to<00:00:27.970> show<00:00:28.119> you<00:00:28.179> a<00:00:28.330> couple<00:00:28.839> of<00:00:28.990> ways<00:00:29.140> you

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
going to show you a couple of ways you

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.079 
going to show you a couple of ways you
can<00:00:29.410> do<00:00:29.529> so<00:00:29.740> we're<00:00:30.519> going<00:00:30.550> to<00:00:30.730> start<00:00:30.939> by

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.089 
can do so we're going to start by

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.069 
can do so we're going to start by
creating<00:00:31.359> a<00:00:31.509> new<00:00:31.539> document<00:00:31.660> like<00:00:32.500> so<00:00:32.770> and<00:00:34.079> I'm

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
creating a new document like so and I'm

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.440 
creating a new document like so and I'm
going<00:00:35.140> to<00:00:35.530> make<00:00:35.980> something<00:00:36.250> to<00:00:36.460> animate<00:00:36.820> we'll

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
going to make something to animate we'll

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.119 
going to make something to animate we'll
start<00:00:37.750> with<00:00:37.870> an<00:00:37.989> ellipse<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:39.270> we'll<00:00:40.270> draw

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
start with an ellipse and we'll draw

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.389 
start with an ellipse and we'll draw
circle<00:00:42.129> there<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.710> let's<00:00:44.949> give<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.129> a<00:00:45.219> nice

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
circle there and let's give it a nice

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.920 
circle there and let's give it a nice
bright<00:00:46.199> fill<00:00:47.199> and<00:00:49.320> nice<00:00:50.320> bright<00:00:50.649> outline<00:00:51.100> and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
bright fill and nice bright outline and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.790 
bright fill and nice bright outline and
we'll<00:00:52.930> go<00:00:53.140> down<00:00:53.230> here<00:00:53.289> to<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.590> properties

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
we'll go down here to the properties

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.380 
we'll go down here to the properties
inspector<00:00:54.129> and<00:00:54.489> make<00:00:54.760> it<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:54.910> little<00:00:55.059> heavier

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
inspector and make it a little heavier

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.819 
inspector and make it a little heavier
and<00:00:55.710> then<00:00:56.710> we'll<00:00:57.489> get<00:00:57.609> some<00:00:57.850> text<00:00:58.179> on<00:00:58.300> here

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
and then we'll get some text on here

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.630 
and then we'll get some text on here
let's<00:00:59.829> type<00:01:00.899> sail<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.190> sort<00:01:03.399> of<00:01:03.460> thing

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
let's type sail that's the sort of thing

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.130 
let's type sail that's the sort of thing
that<00:01:03.670> you<00:01:03.820> would<00:01:04.000> see<00:01:04.299> in<00:01:04.570> an<00:01:04.689> animated<00:01:05.019> gif

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
that you would see in an animated gif

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.410 
that you would see in an animated gif
usually<00:01:05.740> animated<00:01:06.220> gifs<00:01:06.400> are<00:01:06.580> kind<00:01:07.299> of

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
usually animated gifs are kind of

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.840 
usually animated gifs are kind of
blinking<00:01:07.840> things<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.350> catch<00:01:08.530> your<00:01:08.740> eye<00:01:08.799> in<00:01:09.189> the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
blinking things to catch your eye in the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.840 
blinking things to catch your eye in the
corner<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.479> a<00:01:10.810> webpage<00:01:11.409> somewhere<00:01:11.950> we'll<00:01:12.729> go

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
corner of a webpage somewhere we'll go

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.999 
corner of a webpage somewhere we'll go
with<00:01:12.970> Arial<00:01:13.420> bold<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.820> we'll<00:01:15.820> match<00:01:16.060> our<00:01:16.420> red

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
with Arial bold and we'll match our red

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.039 
with Arial bold and we'll match our red
and<00:01:18.180> we'll<00:01:19.180> get<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.390> pretty<00:01:19.600> big<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:21.759> so<00:01:22.049> so

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
and we'll get it pretty big like so so

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.450 
and we'll get it pretty big like so so
once<00:01:23.259> you've<00:01:23.380> created<00:01:23.409> an<00:01:23.860> object<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:24.340> you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
once you've created an object that you

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.090 
once you've created an object that you
want<00:01:24.610> to<00:01:24.729> animate<00:01:24.939> in<00:01:25.329> fireworks<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:27.009> you

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
want to animate in fireworks what you

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.679 
want to animate in fireworks what you
need<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.340> do<00:01:27.430> is<00:01:27.549> convert<00:01:27.880> it<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.119> symbol<00:01:28.360> I

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
need to do is convert it to a symbol I

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.080 
need to do is convert it to a symbol I
didn't<00:01:29.409> get<00:01:29.590> my<00:01:29.740> exclamation<00:01:30.520> point<00:01:30.759> in<00:01:30.909> there

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
didn't get my exclamation point in there

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.690 
didn't get my exclamation point in there
when<00:01:31.570> I<00:01:31.689> was<00:01:31.869> editing<00:01:32.020> so<00:01:32.530> we'll<00:01:32.710> highlight

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
when I was editing so we'll highlight

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.940 
when I was editing so we'll highlight
both<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:34.030> those<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.450> retype<00:01:35.079> it<00:01:35.290> E

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
both of those and retype it E

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.260 
both of those and retype it E
exclamation<00:01:36.759> point<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.869> I'll<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:40.000> rid<00:01:40.210> of

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
exclamation point and I'll get rid of

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.700 
exclamation point and I'll get rid of
the<00:01:40.659> little<00:01:41.140> tiny<00:01:41.439> Arial<00:01:41.979> one<00:01:42.189> there<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
the little tiny Arial one there so and

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.330 
the little tiny Arial one there so and
we'll<00:01:45.399> sender<00:01:45.729> that<00:01:45.880> again<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.829> create<00:01:48.159> an

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
we'll sender that again so to create an

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.249 
we'll sender that again so to create an
animation<00:01:48.640> with<00:01:48.880> this<00:01:49.000> object<00:01:49.180> there's<00:01:50.110> two

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
animation with this object there's two

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.260 
animation with this object there's two
ways<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.530> can<00:01:50.680> do<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.799> first<00:01:51.549> way<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:51.939> to

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
ways you can do it first way is to

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.480 
ways you can do it first way is to
create<00:01:52.540> an<00:01:52.750> animation<00:01:53.079> symbol<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:54.430> you

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
create an animation symbol and so you

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.719 
create an animation symbol and so you
grab<00:01:54.790> everything<00:01:55.210> on<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.509> page<00:01:55.719> like<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.729> or

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
grab everything on the page like so or

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.830 
grab everything on the page like so or
everything<00:01:57.969> you<00:01:58.119> want<00:01:58.299> to<00:01:58.329> animate<00:01:58.539> rather

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
everything you want to animate rather

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.060 
everything you want to animate rather
and<00:01:59.289> you<00:01:59.320> go<00:01:59.680> to<00:01:59.740> modify<00:02:00.689> symbol<00:02:01.890> convert<00:02:02.890> to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
and you go to modify symbol convert to

states and we want it to move to 50 as
the<00:03:02.540> max<00:03:02.750> but<00:03:03.019> we<00:03:03.109> can<00:03:03.260> edit<00:03:03.379> that<00:03:03.620> later<00:03:03.859> and

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
the max but we can edit that later and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.229 
the max but we can edit that later and

this<00:03:08.329> little<00:03:08.629> rotation<00:03:08.959> wheel<00:03:09.739> here<00:03:10.069> so<00:03:10.220> we'll

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
this little rotation wheel here so we'll

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.309 
this little rotation wheel here so we'll
do<00:03:10.639> this<00:03:10.790> we<00:03:11.030> want<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:11.359> move<00:03:11.510> from<00:03:12.079> one

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
do this we want it to move from one

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.009 
do this we want it to move from one

corner of the canvas to the other we're
going<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.230> start<00:03:15.560> with<00:03:15.859> no<00:03:16.790> opacity<00:03:17.419> and<00:03:17.840> we'll

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
going to start with no opacity and we'll

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.140 
going to start with no opacity and we'll
start<00:03:18.769> which<00:03:18.859> will<00:03:18.980> be<00:03:19.129> transparent<00:03:19.699> and<00:03:19.790> then

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
start which will be transparent and then

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.589 
start which will be transparent and then
it<00:03:20.239> will<00:03:20.389> move<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:20.780> 100%<00:03:21.109> and<00:03:22.030> let's<00:03:23.030> start<00:03:23.329> the

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
it will move to 100% and let's start the

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.740 
it will move to 100% and let's start the
scale<00:03:24.019> to<00:03:26.199> say<00:03:27.310> 150<00:03:28.310> percent<00:03:28.879> now<00:03:29.329> I'm<00:03:29.419> using<00:03:29.599> a

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
scale to say 150 percent now I'm using a

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.229 
scale to say 150 percent now I'm using a
slider<00:03:30.079> but<00:03:31.040> if<00:03:31.250> like<00:03:31.519> me<00:03:31.699> you<00:03:31.849> can't<00:03:32.090> hit<00:03:32.180> the

slider but if like me you can't hit the

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.789 
slider but if like me you can't hit the

number you want exactly you can always

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.220 
number you want exactly you can always
type<00:03:34.099> it<00:03:34.280> on<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.400> keyboard<00:03:34.609> and<00:03:35.239> we<00:03:35.930> do<00:03:36.049> want

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
type it on the keyboard and we do want

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.789 
type it on the keyboard and we do want
it<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.379> rotate<00:03:37.239> say<00:03:38.239> full<00:03:38.510> 360<00:03:39.169> degrees<00:03:39.470> and

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
it to rotate say full 360 degrees and

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.680 
it to rotate say full 360 degrees and
we'll<00:03:40.760> do<00:03:40.879> clockwise<00:03:41.269> instead<00:03:41.540> of

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
we'll do clockwise instead of

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.110 
we'll do clockwise instead of
counterclockwise<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.590> so<00:03:43.099> by<00:03:43.250> clicking<00:03:43.310> okay

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
counterclockwise and so by clicking okay

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.000 
counterclockwise and so by clicking okay

back through the different states you

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.250 
back through the different states you
can<00:04:21.469> see<00:04:21.620> where<00:04:21.739> we<00:04:21.829> started<00:04:22.219> and<00:04:22.400> ended<00:04:23.090> up

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
can see where we started and ended up

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.860 
can see where we started and ended up
from<00:04:26.260> here<00:04:26.620> we<00:04:26.800> go<00:04:26.950> back<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.370> state<00:04:27.700> one<00:04:27.910> click

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
and see if we can make this a little

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.920 
and see if we can make this a little
better<00:05:04.890> ok<00:05:05.890> let's<00:05:06.100> go<00:05:06.220> back<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.550> state<00:05:06.790> 1<00:05:06.930> click

on the object you can't see it but it's
there<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.090> we'll<00:05:10.960> move<00:05:11.740> this<00:05:12.010> around<00:05:13.080> we

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
there and we'll move this around we

then see this number 7 here in the
states<00:05:22.480> panel<00:05:22.780> we<00:05:23.230> double<00:05:23.530> click<00:05:23.710> that<00:05:23.740> we<00:05:24.190> see

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
states panel we double click that we see

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.360 
states panel we double click that we see
it's<00:05:25.270> defining<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.990> state<00:05:26.230> delay<00:05:26.620> which

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
it's defining the state delay which

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.170 
it's defining the state delay which
means<00:05:27.820> in<00:05:28.120> each<00:05:28.510> of<00:05:28.750> these<00:05:28.900> states<00:05:29.350> or<00:05:29.590> frames

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
means in each of these states or frames

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.360 
means in each of these states or frames
appears<00:05:31.180> 7<00:05:32.080> one<00:05:32.230> hundredths<00:05:32.680> of<00:05:32.740> a<00:05:32.860> second<00:05:33.220> on

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
appears 7 one hundredths of a second on

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.320 
appears 7 one hundredths of a second on
screen<00:05:33.820> which<00:05:34.810> is<00:05:35.050> as<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:35.590> can<00:05:35.620> see

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
screen which is as you can see

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.570 
screen which is as you can see
unbelievably<00:05:37.330> fast<00:05:37.950> so<00:05:38.950> what<00:05:39.340> we're<00:05:39.430> going<00:05:39.520> to

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
unbelievably fast so what we're going to

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.720 
unbelievably fast so what we're going to
do<00:05:39.730> is<00:05:39.940> change<00:05:40.240> that<00:05:40.510> up<00:05:40.690> to<00:05:40.930> say<00:05:41.370> 25<00:05:42.370> one

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
do is change that up to say 25 one

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.360 
do is change that up to say 25 one
hundredth<00:05:43.030> of<00:05:43.120> a<00:05:43.210> second<00:05:43.600> there<00:05:44.080> if<00:05:44.410> you<00:05:45.130> want

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
hundredth of a second there if you want

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.980 
hundredth of a second there if you want
you<00:05:45.550> can<00:05:45.700> do<00:05:45.820> them<00:05:45.970> individually<00:05:46.180> so<00:05:46.810> you<00:05:46.870> can

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
you can do them individually so you can

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.510 
you can do them individually so you can
have<00:05:47.140> different<00:05:47.350> speeds<00:05:47.860> for<00:05:48.190> different

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
have different speeds for different

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.630 
have different speeds for different
stages<00:05:49.230> but<00:05:50.230> if<00:05:50.350> you<00:05:50.500> just<00:05:50.710> shift-click<00:05:51.220> you

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
stages but if you just shift-click you

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.460 
stages but if you just shift-click you
can<00:05:51.790> do<00:05:51.910> them<00:05:52.060> all

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
can do them all

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.290 
can do them all
well<00:05:53.470> that's<00:05:53.620> by<00:05:53.770> holding<00:05:54.070> the<00:05:54.190> shift<00:05:54.220> key<00:05:54.670> to

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
well that's by holding the shift key to

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.660 
well that's by holding the shift key to
click<00:05:55.540> select<00:05:56.350> all<00:05:56.650> the<00:05:56.770> states<00:05:57.010> and<00:05:57.280> then<00:05:57.550> you

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:57.670 
click select all the states and then you

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.360 
click select all the states and then you
double<00:05:57.970> click<00:05:58.180> and<00:05:58.480> now<00:05:58.510> they're<00:05:59.440> all<00:05:59.620> at<00:05:59.890> 25

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
double click and now they're all at 25

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.740 
double click and now they're all at 25
so<00:06:00.700> let's<00:06:00.880> play<00:06:01.090> that<00:06:02.370> and<00:06:03.450> that's<00:06:04.450> a<00:06:04.570> little

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
so let's play that and that's a little

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.650 
so let's play that and that's a little
slower<00:06:05.520> it's<00:06:06.520> not<00:06:07.090> quite<00:06:07.420> as<00:06:07.540> exciting

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
slower it's not quite as exciting

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.170 
slower it's not quite as exciting
probably<00:06:08.470> but<00:06:08.620> it's<00:06:08.740> a<00:06:08.800> little<00:06:09.040> calmer<00:06:09.250> so

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
probably but it's a little calmer so

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.580 
probably but it's a little calmer so
let's<00:06:10.330> stop<00:06:10.600> that<00:06:13.230> once<00:06:14.230> you've<00:06:14.380> got<00:06:14.500> the

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
let's stop that once you've got the

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.230 
let's stop that once you've got the
animation<00:06:15.070> looking<00:06:15.400> more<00:06:15.640> or<00:06:15.730> less<00:06:15.880> like<00:06:16.120> you

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
animation looking more or less like you

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.420 
animation looking more or less like you
want<00:06:16.420> it<00:06:16.510> to<00:06:16.600> look<00:06:16.810> you<00:06:17.440> have<00:06:17.650> to<00:06:17.830> export<00:06:18.250> it

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
want it to look you have to export it

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.640 
want it to look you have to export it
and<00:06:18.550> to<00:06:18.640> do<00:06:18.880> that<00:06:19.120> you<00:06:19.900> go<00:06:20.020> to<00:06:20.050> the<00:06:20.230> optimize

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
and to do that you go to the optimize

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.750 
and to do that you go to the optimize
panel<00:06:21.010> and<00:06:21.750> set<00:06:22.750> it<00:06:22.840> to<00:06:22.870> animated<00:06:23.500> GIF<00:06:23.760> what

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
panel and set it to animated GIF what

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.330 
panel and set it to animated GIF what
that<00:06:24.940> does<00:06:25.180> is<00:06:25.480> it<00:06:25.660> creates<00:06:25.780> a<00:06:26.080> gif<00:06:26.260> file<00:06:26.500> that

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
that does is it creates a gif file that

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.760 
that does is it creates a gif file that
will<00:06:27.660> duplicate<00:06:28.660> all<00:06:28.870> of<00:06:28.990> those<00:06:29.140> frames<00:06:29.500> and

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
will duplicate all of those frames and

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.270 
will duplicate all of those frames and
you<00:06:29.800> can<00:06:30.580> preview<00:06:30.850> it<00:06:31.060> in<00:06:31.180> a<00:06:31.270> browser<00:06:31.300> and<00:06:32.280> it

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
you can preview it in a browser and it

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.580 
you can preview it in a browser and it
will<00:06:33.580> play<00:06:34.450> pretty<00:06:34.780> much<00:06:34.900> as<00:06:35.080> you<00:06:35.110> have<00:06:35.410> to

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
will play pretty much as you have to

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.950 
will play pretty much as you have to
find<00:06:35.830> it<00:06:35.980> the<00:06:36.670> image<00:06:36.850> will<00:06:37.180> be<00:06:37.390> this<00:06:37.630> entire

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
find it the image will be this entire

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.610 
find it the image will be this entire
canvas

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
canvas

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.500 
canvas
