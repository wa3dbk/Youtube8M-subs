00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.880
 very white chocolate mousse recipe 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.080
 slight direction the pool is gone 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.109
 for our recipe for our mousse 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.529
 white chocolate we will need 400 g 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.500
 of liquid cream a tablespoon of 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.670
 cornstarch 200 g white chocolate 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.260
 and 3 egg whites 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.750
 so we'll start by heating our 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.690
 liquid cream then a trick it takes 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.360
 put a drop of water at the bottom of the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.239
 pan to prevent the cream 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.539
 do not hang here we will leave it apart 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.539
 heat 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.910
 we will put our white chocolate in 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:59.350
 heat a little about 4 x 10 seconds and 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:02.350
 we will mix as and when 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.250
 control there it's completely melted 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.550
 so we put aside in my pan I 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.300
 so put a tablespoon of 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.900
 cornstarch 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.660
 so it will be a tablespoon 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.110
 practically shave not too full 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.130
 it will be this faith and this quantity 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.600
 the cellar she's worth 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.600
 so here I am going to mix 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.040
 there it starts to boil we will count 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.930
 about a minute we have to 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.380
 can cornstarch now I 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.869
 drop my wave fire is a loving father 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:49.289
 and givers only with white chocolate 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:49.289
 confused there I mix 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.439
 once that's mixing well I'm going 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.810
 the past 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.289
 I spent his family to recover 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:09.560
 possible really sears 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:12.110
 here we have recovered a little bit 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.069
 film my preparation to contact and I 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.130
 let it cool down your 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:25.160
 base and cold well we will remove the 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:28.069
 movie and we're going to relax her I'm going is 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.470
 broken but them to recover the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.349
 whites then the yellows I do not throw them 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.790
 I will not use gilding for 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.250
 I put very directly into a 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.780
 Omelette 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.780
 I will be able to mount them in snow 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.810
 I will now put a spoon to 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:59.230
 caster sugar soup for tight 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:03.280
 but white here I go the chords 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:09.670
 so could upstream but no I cream and 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.859
 white chocolate so with maryse i'm going 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.250
 so go gradually and 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:18.840
 gently we will lift our mass 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.840
 to avoid breaking our bourgneuf 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:27.639
 I pour the rest of my plans 2 and I 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:31.060
 let's continue to gently lift 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:36.430
 to prevent my cream from falling down 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:39.609
 they get a ceded foam manage 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.370
 very aerial is actually it takes 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.400
 turn in that the salad bowl passed the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.319
 spatula so under the foam and raised 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.480
 so here we do that until we 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.000
 have more lumps in fact of white 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.459
 good if the rest a little bit is 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.090
 no problem we are approaching at the end of 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.449
 our recipe 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:08.049

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.000
 really something very very 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.000
 air 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:23.390
 they patted me I think I'll 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.390
 put a little spoon again 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:34.920
 we'll do it the second you will have the 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.180

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.230
 fresh before tasting 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.480

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.130
