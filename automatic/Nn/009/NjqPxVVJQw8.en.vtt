00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 well here the third millennium we have 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.319
 come informing of the danger that 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.780
 constitute these strange spheres that 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.420
 fly within our atmosphere that 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.549
 they pass very close to the planes in March 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.789
 We present you with a video where you can see 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.430
 a plane and five objects go to 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.109
 a few meters from it an impact 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.480
 it would have been really catastrophic 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.240
 Well, it just happened to a 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.060
 aeromexico plane on May 15 collided 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.860
 with an unknown object when 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.690
 overflying in the area near cancún 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.410
 and then it had to be diverted towards 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.360
 that airport is about a 777 airplane 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.850
 and the radio meter was affected see 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.640
 you the image captured by a passenger 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.760
 and you therefore consider should or should not 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.050
 regulate and recognize this phenomenon 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.500
 here the investigation of mariluz 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.500
 cheek 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.570
 the night of May 15 , 2015 after 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.400
 of three hours of flight the m1 of a 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.970
 well-known Mexican airline with destination 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.710
 to madrid was diverted from its route it 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.660
 indicated the passengers of a landing 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.369
 not foreseen in the itinerary without 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.920
 additional information the model airplane 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.050
 777 200 arrived at cancún quintana roo 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.910
 where this photograph was obtained that 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.670
 shows a bump dent in the 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.050
 aircraft radiometer passengers 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.780
 reported failure on the screens and a 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.520
 blackout of lights during the ascent that 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.440
 could have caused such a blow to 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.140
 prevent the aircraft from crossing the ocean 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.720
 Atlantic the encounter with presences 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.610
 unknown reveals the vulnerability 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.039
 air for both commercial flights and 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.810
 military what you will see next is 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.289
 a material captured on March 15 of 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.149
 2015 a cessna c-25 plane perform 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.800
 a 25-mile practice flight 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.780
 nautical to the southwest of the city of 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.149
 toluca was found in mid-flight with 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.240
 minus 5 objects that crossed in 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.270
 opposite very close to the aircraft 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.630
 observe carefully the objects pass to 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.119
 great speed below the plane 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.590
 the path of the third object is perceived 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.590
 almost on par with it 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.420
 so the fourth object moved 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.209
 and the red wine on a straight and very 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.209
 near the fuselage of the plane 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.050
 of having impacted who would have 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.730
 blamed blamed for not existing 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.540
 this recording would not know what happened 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.860
 there are amazing cases 8 of 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.950
 December 2013 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.690
 11m with 22 minutes a sphere went from 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.090
 bottom up very close to an airplane 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.310
 boeing 747 cargo company 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.099
 cargolux that when moving on the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.549
 city ​​of san mauro in italy maintained 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:56.180
 an altitude of 25 thousand 975 feet and one 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.730
 speed of 400 9 knots equal to 758 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.090
 kilometers per hour an approach 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.220
 allows you to see the details of the moment 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.569
 attention to the following material an object 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.610
 Luminous approaches the plane 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.280
 moving in a straight line and in a way 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.810
 frontal almost a collision said the 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.890
 witness who was recording in 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.629
 the vicinity of the airport 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.040
 international of Manchester in 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.040
 england in 2013 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.409
 now listen to the news anchor 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.689
 on Wednesday, the driver indicated it 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.220
 of the channel nine news presenting this 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.019
 animation based on the reports of the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.480
 pilot of a company cessna 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.640
 citizen who reported a meeting with 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.470
 unidentified objects including the 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.940
 federal aviation administration launched 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.129
 an investigation qualifying as 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.129
 priority in aeronautical safety 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.480
 this happened in Mexico on November 3 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.209
 of 2008 in the valley colony in the 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.220
 federal district at 17 13 o'clock the 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.049
 watchman of heaven arturo double gil it 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.209
 I was recording this expert object 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.659
 that apparently remained static to 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.209
 step of this plane sharing the same 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.639
 airspace a collision between aircraft 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.459
 and unidentified objects is a 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.400
 reality and therefore a danger to the 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.220
 aviation all at some time we are 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.530
 passengers later the impacts and the 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.440
 closing of airports in china usa and 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.599
 mexico after the presence of objects 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.280
 unknown reported for third millennium
