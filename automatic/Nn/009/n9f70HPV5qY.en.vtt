a great advantage because if you've got
slow<00:01:45.670> guys<00:01:45.939> which<00:01:46.329> you<00:01:46.689> make<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:46.899> mess<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.469> you

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
slow guys which you make a mess on you

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.279 
slow guys which you make a mess on you
know<00:01:47.740> they'll<00:01:47.889> catch<00:01:48.310> them<00:01:48.549> and<00:01:49.240> when<00:01:49.929> you<00:01:50.079> get

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
know they'll catch them and when you get

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.620 
know they'll catch them and when you get
past<00:01:50.590> not<00:01:51.369> just<00:01:51.609> the<00:01:51.729> line<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:52.090> scrimmage<00:01:52.209> but

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
past not just the line of scrimmage but

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.539 
past not just the line of scrimmage but
perhaps<00:01:53.069> linebackers<00:01:54.069> and<00:01:54.099> through<00:01:54.429> the

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
perhaps linebackers and through the

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.849 
perhaps linebackers and through the
secondary<00:01:55.139> what's<00:01:56.139> it<00:01:56.259> like<00:01:56.439> to<00:01:56.619> have<00:01:56.740> that

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
secondary what's it like to have that

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.069 
secondary what's it like to have that
feeling<00:01:57.130> when<00:01:57.369> you<00:01:57.490> know<00:01:57.520> you're<00:01:57.880> free<00:01:58.149> I<00:01:58.389> feel

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
feeling when you know you're free I feel

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.690 
feeling when you know you're free I feel
good<00:01:59.319> because<00:01:59.529> you<00:01:59.649> know<00:01:59.889> once<00:02:00.099> you<00:02:00.189> get<00:02:00.429> data

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700
