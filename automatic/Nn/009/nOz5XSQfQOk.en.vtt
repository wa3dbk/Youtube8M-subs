00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 How about friends today I bring you a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.120
 tutorial on how to make a logo for 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.990
 our crew in gta 5 comes out 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.990
 we start 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.400
 first we click on the part where 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.400
 says crews 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.019
 and then to manage tribes 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.420
 Once there we click on the pencil landmark 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 which is on the current logo of your 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.559
 crew there you see the logos 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.379
 created and below it appears a section that 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.210
 says create new emblem we click and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.210
 will take us to the logo creator 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.070
 now I will make a quick logo for you 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.690
 to pause the video so it's not so 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.550
 long 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.770
 Well, this was the fastest logo 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.990
 what I could do now I will teach you 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.030
 record it and post it in your click on the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.650
 part below is the section that says 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.200
 save they give everything they do want 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.240
 save it once saved them will appear 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.740
 at the bottom your new logo with 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.660
 others who have done then 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.490
 they select the logo they want and they 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.220
 the section that says publish appears 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.350
 then the crews selector appears 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.540
 to know where they want to publish that 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.460
 logo once you have selected your 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.259
 crew will already be ready in the section of 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.340
 logos of the leader of his crew so that he 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.340
 choose the logo 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.880
 in this case I am the leader of this 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.340
 I will raise and I will have the logos that make 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.439
