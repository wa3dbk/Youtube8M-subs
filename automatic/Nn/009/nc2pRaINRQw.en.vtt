00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.739
 Welcome to your car made of wood 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.720
 mountain to the new golf sports are the 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.330
 I would like to present to you today 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.330
 it is the successor of the golf 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.640
 Plus, and as you can already see, that is 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.160
 vehicle old much more modern much 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.920
 become sportier the line guide 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.750
 the vehicle is much stronger 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.320
 through this line of character which is 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.140
 ahead 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:10.660
 from the headlights over the doors 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.979
 pulls up in the rear of the vehicle which 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.500
 have become very nice are the 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.020
 door handles now here in this 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.060
 Character line were included 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.750
 and so the vehicle just works in 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.119
 its sportier and sportier shape 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.740
 many dynamic the vehicle stops 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.330
 also get new proportions and 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.759
 this makes the car look easy 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.210
 Vorderbau halt clearly sporty because 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.860
 he sits much shallower heals and that 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.090
 just stop him again 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.090
 striking new face 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:55.189
 of course, the gloss piece is also the 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:58.189
 luggage compartment which I can open times are 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.750
 Of course, 500 liters does not increase yet 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.600
 I can do it all over again 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.070
 expand to 5 190 liters if I 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.000
 just the backseat continues to 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.100
 can push forward 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.950
 and if that's not enough then you can 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.459
 I fold normally up to 1500 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.930
 liters volume made that nice 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.950
 the loading floor actually only with one 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.440
 hand can sink and the loading floor 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.870
 then again has the advantage that 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.030
 the luggage compartment cover down here 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.860
 can stow again and then just 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.450
 Close the lid and then it is 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.370
 ding gone they lay the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.690
 rear seat around and can then until after 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.690
 load through the front 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.660
 and who the 1500 liter trunk volume 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.860
 not enough 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.650
 Of course he has the possibility 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.660
 then ordered via the optional ware 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.940
 roof rail holder again from 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.650
 volkswagen the carrier systems to hold on 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.360
 bring where you then, of course, stop 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.670
 again bicycle rack or a roof box 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.440
 could mount again if it 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.560
 maybe in the ski holiday goes and 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.990
 you still hold something larger objects 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.530
 yes the golf sports would have to stow if 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.180
 has become 13 inches longer 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.900
 And that of course has the advantage 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.730
 then sit on the back and that 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.200
 great is that the golf sports line 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.720
 although he is a bit flatter 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.340
 Actually now looks like the entry 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.230
 Everything has remained the same 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.580
 its predecessor model tend that 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.740
 Of course I can do this alone here 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.360
 Golfsport content again make 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.990
 of course that's how I feel 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.400
 again the inclination of my backrest 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.710
 stop 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.800
 thanks to the adjustable rear seat 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.470
 namely, at 18 inches I can do that in 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.660
 increase the volume here 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.380
 that means that you are really here then 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.000
 a super large space here 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.000
 at the back 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.140
 taken place in golf when noticed 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.420
 you actually that he exactly the same 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.360
 Advantages of the previous model heals 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.220
 has the upright seating position yes what 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.410
 I personally succeeded very well 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.270
 find is that all the controls 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.220
 have now moved up to the top 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.370
 that means you have the control for the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.950
 Air conditioning better in the view is not sitting 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.770
 more as deep as in the previous model and 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.310
 also the radios or 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.680
 Navigation systems are much now 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.630
 arranged above that is one has 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.370
 a much better look at this 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.790
 theme during the ride and will not 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.470
 so distracted yes and though the 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.290
 golf sports if it's much higher 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.750
 located as the golf sedan makes 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.610
 He personally gave me a lot of fun 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.400
 So fan is really nice through the 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.720
 curves depend on the gas and the good 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.250
 impressions we just want to join him 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.250
 show the next movie 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.270
 I hope the driving shots have them 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:10.490
 as much fun as mine and 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.169
 Of course I would be happy if you 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.759
 Just go directly to and move in 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.710
 Car dealership Holzberg at the hamburger 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.839
 come and then just me 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.039
 to present live the vehicle to him 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:21.319
 personally again the advantages 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.800
 easy to show the vehicle 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.800
 Many Thanks
