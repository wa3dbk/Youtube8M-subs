00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
you've built up enough star power to

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.590 
you've built up enough star power to
truly<00:04:50.670> rock<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.120> that's<00:04:51.830> right<00:04:52.830> exactly<00:04:53.600> what

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
truly rock and that's right exactly what

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.720 
truly rock and that's right exactly what
I<00:04:54.720> call<00:04:54.930> that's<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:55.650> star<00:04:55.920> power<00:04:56.100> now<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.490> real

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
I call that's a star power now the real

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.280 
I call that's a star power now the real
trick<00:04:57.000> with<00:04:57.120> that<00:04:57.150> is<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:57.690> make<00:04:57.960> sure<00:04:58.080> you<00:04:58.170> got

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
trick with that is to make sure you got

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.950 
trick with that is to make sure you got
at<00:04:58.410> least<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.920> 4x<00:04:59.640> multiplier<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:00.540> if<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:00.810> can

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
at least a 4x multiplier so if you can

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.390 
at least a 4x multiplier so if you can
see<00:05:01.110> why<00:05:01.290> you're<00:05:01.440> rocking<00:05:01.770> out<00:05:01.920> and<00:05:02.190> they

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
see why you're rocking out and they

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.620 
see why you're rocking out and they
bottom<00:05:02.760> left-hand<00:05:02.970> corner<00:05:03.120> there's<00:05:03.450> little

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
bottom left-hand corner there's little

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.600 
bottom left-hand corner there's little
counter<00:05:03.990> yeah<00:05:04.350> for<00:05:04.560> every<00:05:04.920> eighth<00:05:05.100> notes<00:05:05.400> that

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
counter yeah for every eighth notes that

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.770 
counter yeah for every eighth notes that
you<00:05:05.700> hit<00:05:05.940> it's<00:05:06.360> going<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.540> give<00:05:06.660> you<00:05:06.720> a

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
you hit it's going to give you a

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.480 
you hit it's going to give you a
multiplier<00:05:07.230> so<00:05:07.440> right<00:05:07.620> now<00:05:07.650> you're<00:05:07.920> times<00:05:08.220> to

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
multiplier so right now you're times to

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.040 
multiplier so right now you're times to
every<00:05:09.120> single<00:05:09.270> note<00:05:09.420> you<00:05:09.540> hit<00:05:09.660> is<00:05:09.750> look<00:05:09.870> twice

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
every single note you hit is look twice

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.300 
every single note you hit is look twice

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.620 
boom times three oh my god you can get
up<00:05:13.470> to<00:05:13.590> x<00:05:13.800> 4<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.370> that's<00:05:14.670> when<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:15.240> really
