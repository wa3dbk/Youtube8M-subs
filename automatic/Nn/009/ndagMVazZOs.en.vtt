Hawks to their ligaments ligaments don't

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.270 
Hawks to their ligaments ligaments don't
get<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> lot<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.539> blood<00:00:57.809> flow<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.100> machine

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
get a lot of blood flow so this machine

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.610 
get a lot of blood flow so this machine
is<00:00:59.640> increasing<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> blood<00:01:00.420> flow<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:01.109> those

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
is increasing the blood flow to those

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.270 
is increasing the blood flow to those
areas<00:01:02.210> helping<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.359> any<00:01:03.830> micro<00:01:04.830> tears<00:01:05.040> they

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
areas helping with any micro tears they

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.730 
areas helping with any micro tears they
may<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.880> any<00:01:06.270> inflammation<00:01:06.659> stuff<00:01:07.560> like

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
may have it any inflammation stuff like

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.679 
may have it any inflammation stuff like
that<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.100> helps<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.490> rid<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> lactic<00:01:09.210> acid

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that it helps get rid of the lactic acid

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.770 
that it helps get rid of the lactic acid
and<00:01:09.840> increases<00:01:10.409> blood<00:01:10.590> flow<00:01:10.909> this<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.180> dms

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
and increases blood flow this is a dms

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
hamstrings are a little slow we're going

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.130 
hamstrings are a little slow we're going
to<00:01:16.950> massage<00:01:17.280> your<00:01:17.490> hamstrings<00:01:18.180> I'll<00:01:18.840> flush

to massage your hamstrings I'll flush
out<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.590> lactic<00:01:20.040> acid<00:01:20.549> make<00:01:21.000> her<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> little

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
out that lactic acid make her a little

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.380 
out that lactic acid make her a little
softer<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.430> she<00:01:23.759> really

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
softer in there you can see she really

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.969 
softer in there you can see she really
likes<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.840> she's<00:01:25.020> lifting<00:01:25.200> her<00:01:25.470> tail<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
likes it she's lifting her tail so you

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.460 
likes it she's lifting her tail so you
can<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.400> right<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:28.320> can

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
can get right in there for that you can

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.410 
can get right in there for that you can
feel<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.740> vibration<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.640> muscle<00:01:30.119> going

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
feel the vibration of the muscle going

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.210 
feel the vibration of the muscle going
all<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> way<00:01:30.840> through<00:01:31.200> or<00:01:31.350> hamstring<00:01:31.950> group

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
all the way through or hamstring group

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.580 
all the way through or hamstring group
this<00:01:32.850> also<00:01:33.090> relaxes<00:01:33.900> them<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.229> they<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this also relaxes them if they have a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.830 
this also relaxes them if they have a
few<00:01:34.920> hours<00:01:34.950> before<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.939> show<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> lot<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.540> times

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
few hours before the show a lot of times

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.230 
few hours before the show a lot of times
they'll<00:01:37.079> lay<00:01:37.229> down<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.710> sleep<00:01:38.030> really<00:01:39.030> let

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
they'll lay down and sleep really let

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.660 
they'll lay down and sleep really let
that<00:01:39.450> therapy<00:01:40.200> go<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> work<00:01:40.680> before<00:01:41.189> they<00:01:41.490> have

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
that therapy go to work before they have

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.639 
that therapy go to work before they have
to<00:01:41.790> get<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.270> work<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.659> hard<00:01:42.960> try<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
to get up and work really hard try to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.859 
to get up and work really hard try to
work<00:01:43.890> with<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.280> muscle<00:01:44.670> fibers<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.270> first<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
work with the muscle fibers at first and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.800 
work with the muscle fibers at first and
then<00:01:45.990> we'll<00:01:46.079> go<00:01:46.259> cross<00:01:46.530> fibers<00:01:47.600> it's<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
then we'll go cross fibers it's like a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.510 
then we'll go cross fibers it's like a
good<00:01:49.079> massage<00:01:49.259> therapist<00:01:50.040> would<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
good massage therapist would do on a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.930 
good massage therapist would do on a
person

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.610 

this<00:01:54.940> is<00:01:55.120> really<00:01:55.300> good<00:01:55.510> to<00:01:55.960> use<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.410> their

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
this is really good to use on their

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.740 
this is really good to use on their
dense<00:01:56.920> muscle<00:01:57.160> areas<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:58.270> can<00:01:58.480> you<00:01:58.600> really

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
dense muscle areas you can you really

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.260 
dense muscle areas you can you really
get<00:01:58.960> in<00:01:59.140> there<00:01:59.290> pretty<00:01:59.470> beat<00:02:02.910> you<00:02:03.910> can<00:02:04.060> see

get in there pretty beat you can see

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.730 
get in there pretty beat you can see
where<00:02:04.450> that's<00:02:04.600> kind<00:02:04.900> of<00:02:04.960> tight<00:02:05.200> going<00:02:05.560> down

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
where that's kind of tight going down

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.770 
where that's kind of tight going down
into<00:02:05.980> here<00:02:06.160> so<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.120> want<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.450> work<00:02:07.600> that

into here so you want to work that

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.220 
into here so you want to work that
really<00:02:08.020> light<00:02:08.410> at<00:02:08.590> first<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:10.630> then<00:02:10.810> after<00:02:11.170> it

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
really light at first and then after it

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.930 
really light at first and then after it
softens<00:02:11.710> up<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.070> can<00:02:12.220> get<00:02:12.400> in<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.670> little

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
softens up you can get in a little

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.940 
softens up you can get in a little
deeper<00:02:13.360> get<00:02:14.320> that<00:02:14.470> lactic<00:02:14.890> acid<00:02:15.340> out<00:02:16.950> and

deeper get that lactic acid out and
going<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.030> go<00:02:19.120> with<00:02:19.330> fibers<00:02:19.900> first<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.560> then

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
going to go with fibers first and then

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.470 
going to go with fibers first and then
after<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.070> loosen<00:02:21.460> it<00:02:21.550> up<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.880> can<00:02:22.030> go<00:02:22.180> cross

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
after you loosen it up you can go cross

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.660 
after you loosen it up you can go cross

sore<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:04.810> if<00:03:04.989> she<00:03:05.110> had<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.230> suspensory<00:03:06.100> we

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
sore like if she had a suspensory we

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.770 
sore like if she had a suspensory we
have<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.400> different<00:03:06.850> attachment<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:07.630> could

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
have a different attachment so we could

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.870 
have a different attachment so we could
just<00:03:07.959> concentrate<00:03:08.170> on<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.980> area<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.520> really

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
just concentrate on that area and really

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.790 
just concentrate on that area and really
increase<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.510> energy<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:11.170> just<00:03:11.410> one<00:03:11.560> specific

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
increase the energy to just one specific

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.949 
increase the energy to just one specific
area<00:03:12.340> or<00:03:13.620> we<00:03:14.620> can<00:03:14.830> generalize<00:03:15.520> it<00:03:15.820> use<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.780> all

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
area or we can generalize it use it all

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.760 
area or we can generalize it use it all
over<00:03:16.989> her<00:03:17.380> back<00:03:18.450> horses<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:19.660> have<00:03:19.720> they<00:03:20.560> get

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
over her back horses that have they get

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.310 
over her back horses that have they get
out<00:03:20.920> in<00:03:21.100> their<00:03:21.250> neck<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.880> lot<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.840> times<00:03:23.050> from

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
out in their neck a lot of times from

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.190 
out in their neck a lot of times from
their<00:03:23.770> head<00:03:24.010> movements<00:03:24.550> tasting<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.209> cow<00:03:25.450> you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
their head movements tasting a cow you

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.170 
their head movements tasting a cow you
can<00:03:26.350> also<00:03:26.530> use<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:27.130> on<00:03:27.220> their<00:03:27.430> neck

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.220 

sometimes<00:03:34.180> these<00:03:34.330> horses<00:03:34.750> need<00:03:34.960> to<00:03:34.990> see

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
sometimes these horses need to see

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.840 
sometimes these horses need to see
chiropractors<00:03:35.950> too<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.490> this<00:03:36.640> will

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
chiropractors too and so this will

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.420 
chiropractors too and so this will
really<00:03:37.030> loosen<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:37.660> up<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.650> muscles<00:03:39.040> up<00:03:39.190> for

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
really loosen it up the muscles up for

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
afterwards after he's adjusted it to

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.010 
afterwards after he's adjusted it to
make<00:03:43.180> sure<00:03:43.360> they<00:03:43.540> stay<00:03:43.570> in<00:03:43.780> place<00:03:45.900> after<00:03:46.900> we

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
make sure they stay in place after we

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.470 
make sure they stay in place after we
finish<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.560> treatment<00:03:48.060> we<00:03:49.060> also<00:03:49.180> use

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
finish the treatment we also use

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.690 
finish the treatment we also use

this<00:03:52.360> works<00:03:52.690> into<00:03:53.020> their<00:03:53.230> where<00:03:53.500> we've<00:03:53.680> opened

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
this works into their where we've opened

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.400 
this works into their where we've opened
up<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.250> blood<00:03:55.120> vessels<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:55.690> dilated<00:03:56.260> them

up the blood vessels and dilated them

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.350 
up the blood vessels and dilated them
