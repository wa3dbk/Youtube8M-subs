00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
line now these have to kind of hard to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.880 
line now these have to kind of hard to
say<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.219> size<00:00:32.430> they<00:00:32.669> are<00:00:33.800> from<00:00:34.800> my

say what size they are from my

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.290 
say what size they are from my
recommendation<00:00:35.460> would<00:00:35.520> be<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.940> small

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
recommendation would be just a small

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.459 
recommendation would be just a small
medium<00:00:36.660> especially<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.110> don't<00:00:37.260> feel<00:00:37.380> like

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
medium especially you don't feel like

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.810 
medium especially you don't feel like
your<00:00:37.590> head<00:00:37.770> being<00:00:38.270> because<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:40.520> just<00:00:41.520> feel<00:00:41.670> like

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
your head being because I just feel like

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.889 
your head being because I just feel like
that's<00:00:41.940> probably<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.329> best<00:00:42.450> eyes<00:00:42.660> ago

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
that's probably the best eyes ago

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.630 
that's probably the best eyes ago
usually<00:00:43.800> when<00:00:43.950> they<00:00:44.010> sell<00:00:44.219> bucket<00:00:44.489> hats

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
usually when they sell bucket hats

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.040 
usually when they sell bucket hats
online<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.270> you're<00:00:45.390> not<00:00:45.450> sure<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:46.020> should

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
online and you're not sure if I should

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.750 
online and you're not sure if I should
get<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> small<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.039> medium<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> first<00:00:47.579> ones

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
get the small and medium the first ones

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.220 
get the small and medium the first ones
