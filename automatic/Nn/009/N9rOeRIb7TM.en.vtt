00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello how are you in solutions and 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.069
 Welcome to a new evolution of your 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.629
 channel in this video come to show you the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:16.740
 update of the official application 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:18.090
 of the motorbike camera that good in 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.130
 this video basically I come to 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.080
 show them and it's somewhat informative the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.730
 update of this application that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.250
 it comes then by default in our 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.599
 bike that just buy it good some 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.199
 they will ask this update is 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.910
 available for the 2013 and 2014 model yes 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.340
 what is it and you can also ask 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.530
 if for that you need root or user 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.480
 if you do not need really good da 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.980
 same as if you have root you can 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.570
 install and if you do not have root then 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.309
 you can also do it so well there's no 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.140
 any problem with this here 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.059
 I have the two applications already installed 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.640
 how good is not an update via 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.440
 because good only update this 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.930
 application that already comes by default but 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.820
 which is an apk modified so to speak 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.160
 which will give us different options 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.050
 more in regards to this application that already 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.760
 it comes then just buy our 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.229
 device the truth is that they are a 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.120
 series of configurations that we go 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.830
 they are going to help us take better 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.810
 and good, most of all, configure the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.060
 application to our liking as for 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 the photography that we need of equal 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.330
 way to the video then good by 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.790
 example we enter here to the camera that 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.380
 it is already just buying the device and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.350
 Well, nothing out of the ordinary 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.760
 we have here the screen in camera mode 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.710
 if we throw to the right we 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.720
 we found with these options that already 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.820
 they come here previously or predetermined 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.040
 mind if we throw to the right we 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.720
 we found the gallery and well 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.880
 if we do up and down 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.530
 we will play with the zoom then good 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.450
 up to here everything normal there is no 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.830
 problem here good because basically we 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.470
 we will find only with one 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.570
 button which is the help so 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.340
 to know a little more in gestures 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.560
 who manages that application in such a way 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.720
 Well here we could already start 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.820
 realize us comparing it with this other 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.350
 application that there is a new section for 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.030
 well then say good if we have 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.250
 social the right we're going to find 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.470
 with another button here on the bottom 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.380
 right which has as the symbol of 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.180
 a beetle or a non- catarina caterpillar or 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.770
 something like that then good we press it 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.170
 since we are going to appear different 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.600
 ranges that we can go modifying 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.960
 different intervals and so on all 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.480
 good ones 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.360
 there are many that are so delicate and that 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.160
 there will be no need to touch them but yes 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.990
 there are others that good here for example in 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.150
 guys settings we can go playing with 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.350
 they like for example inactivity to 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.360
 moment that we are in the application 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.070
 of the camera because if we do not want that 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.260
 last all the time on the 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.880
 screen that goes off simply or if 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.620
 we do not want it to go off while milan 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.260
 be in this application we can also 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.300
 activate the detector of the faces 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.800
 we can activate more sensors and good 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.080
 here something important we can configure 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.030
 the size of the photographs the size 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.980
 in which we see the photographs and also 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.690
 the size of the videos which I 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.080
 it seems pretty good because if we want 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.520
 then record a video at 1280 pixels then 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.200
 there simply would be no problem 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.120
 we simply select it or if 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.520
 we want to lower it to the minimum for 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.560
 this way as I can record more 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.540
 amount of minutes and not worry 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.700
 a lot for the memory we can also see 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.180
 here for example the others 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.590
 configurations like for example 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.230
 issues of the front camera the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.930
 panorama we could also play with the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.520
 then good approach and others the truth 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.990
 it's pretty good we can play 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.760
 with the white balance 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.410
 etcetera the truth is that these options 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.900
 they are quite good if you are a user 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.420
 that then does not conform to the simple 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.100
 options that device brings you and 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.380
 finally we find these 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.910
 last two are the redundancy the 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.490
 which are good so here others 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.260
 more than good options I'm not very 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.060
 so much that of what functions we 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.920
 allow but it will be a matter of 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.870
 investigate a little bit and well then 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.180
 this is more than anything they are then 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.920
 information does not modify modifiable 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.140
 then good simply to know 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.790
 more thoroughly our hardware the 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.410
 camera then good really these 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.270
 are the changes that have been implemented in 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.040
 This new version of the motorcycle camera 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.540
 that is really good here they will have 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.190
 down the apk so they can 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.020
 download so good then there would be 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.790
 no kind of problem they install it and 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.920
 Well, it does not replace the application 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.690
 official that is already predetermined in 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.340
 his bike that so good if in some 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.500
 moment they wish to return to the official 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.540
 it will simply be necessary to uninstall 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.610
 this application and good in this way 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.049
 Well I would not have any kind of problem 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.890
 well, this video has been quite 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.080
 Quick 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.400
 I wanted to show them so well 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.930
 if you liked them I remind you that I 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.910
 can help a lot by giving you a good
