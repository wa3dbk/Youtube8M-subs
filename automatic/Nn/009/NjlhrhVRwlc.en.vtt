00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
and as I keep saying but you know the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.019 
and as I keep saying but you know the
performance<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.400> getting<00:00:29.640> better<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.939> better

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.790 
performance is getting better and better
individually<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.109> think<00:00:31.320> more<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.650> as<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
individually but I think more so as a

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.709 
individually but I think more so as a
team<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> think<00:00:32.160> early<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> season<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.570> may

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
team I think early in the season we may

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.450 
team I think early in the season we may
have<00:00:33.809> got<00:00:33.989> caught<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.920> counter-attack

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
have got caught and a counter-attack

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.250 
have got caught and a counter-attack
that<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.670> thought<00:00:35.850> today<00:00:36.090> we<00:00:36.210> looks<00:00:36.360> both<00:00:36.960> sides

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
that I thought today we looks both sides

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.600 
that I thought today we looks both sides
of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> game<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> thought<00:00:37.890> defensively<00:00:38.010> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
of the game I thought defensively and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.580 
of the game I thought defensively and
attacking<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.149> look<00:00:39.270> creative<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.899> defensively

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
attacking we look creative I defensively

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.920 
attacking we look creative I defensively

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
to have to this I'm hoping by the end of

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.359 
to have to this I'm hoping by the end of
the<00:01:18.840> season<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.409> will<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:20.250> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
the season that we will get that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.830 
the season that we will get that
compulsion<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.970> conference<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.540> go<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.720> win

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
compulsion that conference to go on win

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.240 
compulsion that conference to go on win
games<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.259> they're<00:01:22.380> getting<00:01:22.560> better<00:01:22.680> each

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
games but they're getting better each

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.920 
games but they're getting better each
week<00:01:23.310> they're<00:01:23.700> getting<00:01:23.909> better<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.869> said

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
week they're getting better like I said

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.080 
week they're getting better like I said
before<00:01:25.110> collectively<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.909> you

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
before collectively then as you

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.340 
before collectively then as you
mentioned<00:01:27.479> there<00:01:27.600> was<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.960> under<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
mentioned there was just under a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.929 
mentioned there was just under a
thousand<00:01:28.829> fans<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.369> watch<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> game<00:01:29.820> do

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
thousand fans here to watch the game do

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.670 
thousand fans here to watch the game do
you<00:01:30.030> think<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.750> Wolves<00:01:31.140> continues<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.619> you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
you think the Wolves continues to you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.289 
you think the Wolves continues to you
leave<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.159> promise<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.670> satisfaction

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
leave with promise and satisfaction

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.640 
leave with promise and satisfaction
after<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.540> performance<00:01:33.720> even<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.409> think

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
after the performance even I think

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.870 
after the performance even I think
definitely<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.070> performance<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.790> know

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
definitely with the performance you know

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.539 
definitely with the performance you know
i<00:01:35.909> think<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.570> overall<00:01:37.189> I<00:01:38.189> thought<00:01:38.369> were<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
i think that overall I thought were the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.520 
i think that overall I thought were the
better<00:01:38.729> team<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.540> we're<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.840> know<00:01:39.960> we're

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
better team I think we're you know we're

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.319 
better team I think we're you know we're
looking<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> produce<00:01:41.100> obviously<00:01:41.850> plays<00:01:42.060> for

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
looking to produce obviously plays for

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.819 
looking to produce obviously plays for
the<00:01:42.390> first<00:01:42.600> team<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.439> think<00:01:43.619> they'd<00:01:43.770> be

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the first team I like to think they'd be

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:44.960 
the first team I like to think they'd be
look<00:01:43.950> into<00:01:44.130> thinking<00:01:44.430> yell<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.790> two<00:01:44.939> or

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
look into thinking yell as a two or

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.789 
look into thinking yell as a two or
three<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.270> there<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.659> definitely<00:01:46.619> got<00:01:46.770> a

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
three in there that definitely got a

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.770 
three in there that definitely got a
chance<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.670> bit<00:01:47.729> more<00:01:47.909> time<00:01:48.180> maybe

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
chance and a little bit more time maybe

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.200 
chance and a little bit more time maybe
wanted<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> go<00:01:49.290> out<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.470> long<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.579> they<00:01:51.090> keep

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
wanted to go out and long and they keep

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.910 
wanted to go out and long and they keep
growing<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.630> growing<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.990> that's<00:01:52.560> our<00:01:52.710> job

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
growing and growing and that's our job

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.639 
growing and growing and that's our job
and<00:01:53.430> even<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.540> an<00:01:54.600> Under<00:01:54.869> 21s<00:01:55.110> game<00:01:55.409> there<00:01:55.560> was

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
and even for an Under 21s game there was

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.899 
and even for an Under 21s game there was
quite<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.890> bit<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.070> atmosphere<00:01:56.159> given<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
quite a bit of atmosphere given the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.550 
quite a bit of atmosphere given the
nature<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.719> fixed<00:01:58.020> year<00:01:58.200> what<00:01:58.350> would

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
nature of the fixed year what would

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.840 
nature of the fixed year what would
think<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.829> does<00:01:59.040> for<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> players<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
think that does for the players on the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.399 
think that does for the players on the
pitch<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.240> think<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.990> next<00:02:01.110> step<00:02:01.350> for

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
pitch I think this is the next step for

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.530 
pitch I think this is the next step for
them<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.100> don't<00:02:02.310> produce<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.329> for

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
them and if we don't produce that for

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.880 
them and if we don't produce that for
them<00:02:03.719> then<00:02:04.020> when<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.320> do<00:02:04.380> get<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.829> next

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
them then when they do get to that next

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.740 
them then when they do get to that next
step<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.460> playing<00:02:05.700> league<00:02:05.880> football<00:02:06.240> whether

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
step of playing league football whether

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.089 
step of playing league football whether
it's<00:02:06.930> here<00:02:07.079> or<00:02:07.140> whether<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.590> out<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.860> long

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it's here or whether it is out on long

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.380 
it's here or whether it is out on long
and<00:02:08.520> that's<00:02:08.759> going<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:09.030> difficult<00:02:09.090> for

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and that's going to be difficult for

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.550 
and that's going to be difficult for
them<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.869> think<00:02:09.929> there<00:02:10.110> were<00:02:10.170> more<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.440> can

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
them so I think there were more we can

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.160 
them so I think there were more we can
expose<00:02:10.890> them<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.039> good<00:02:11.280> crowds<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.930> great<00:02:12.930> pitch

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
expose them to good crowds a great pitch

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.780 
expose them to good crowds a great pitch
great

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
great

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.550 
great
it<00:02:13.849> is<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.659> better<00:02:14.810> they're<00:02:15.049> going<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.230> be<00:02:15.349> and

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
it is the better they're going to be and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.709 
it is the better they're going to be and
you<00:02:16.549> know<00:02:16.670> sometimes<00:02:16.939> playing<00:02:17.360> on<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.480> train

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:17.719 
you know sometimes playing on a train

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.110 
you know sometimes playing on a train
ground<00:02:18.019> in<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.950> daytime<00:02:19.370> doesn't<00:02:19.700> produce<00:02:19.849> your

ground in a daytime doesn't produce your

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469 
prepare you for what the real low

prepare you for what the real low
football<00:02:21.890> is
