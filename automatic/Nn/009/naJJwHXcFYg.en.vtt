 In fact, any library is very large 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.620
 future

 overall quite flexible magnifier 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.650
 and in which there will be either a children's center 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.699
 reading 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.840
 which will not be very active 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.229
 to develop such a direction as 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.240
 for example communicator 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.629
 technology according to the Decembrists mining 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.789
 which today is unfortunately in the district we 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:08.669
 will develop very actively 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.520
 direction of working with people with 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.759
 life restrictions then 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.489
 do we have today we do not eat these goals 

00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:17.219
 according to the need to move and understand 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:19.349
 and the constitution 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:20.479
 so that 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.999
 our story 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:24.319
 Yes of course 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.580
 opposite 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.189
 it's only the beginning 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:29.610
 by the way it is calculated 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.779
 that humanity in created 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:34.189

 for sure 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:38.659
