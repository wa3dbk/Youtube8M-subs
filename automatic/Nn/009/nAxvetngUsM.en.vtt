which was step two this all took about

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.550 
which was step two this all took about
maybe

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
maybe

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.110 
maybe
45<00:02:13.980> minutes<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.459> an<00:02:14.489> hour<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.880> put<00:02:15.030> together

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
45 minutes to an hour to put together

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.330 
45 minutes to an hour to put together
but<00:02:15.540> it's<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:15.810> your<00:02:15.959> basic<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:17.220> know

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
but it's just your basic you know

but it's just your basic you know
sliding<00:02:18.120> drawer<00:02:18.360> system<00:02:18.780> with<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.170> bottom

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
sliding drawer system with the bottom

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.650 
sliding drawer system with the bottom
door<00:02:20.190> being<00:02:20.430> slightly<00:02:20.730> larger<00:02:21.209> than<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.390> two

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
door being slightly larger than the two

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.790 
door being slightly larger than the two
top<00:02:22.440> drawers<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.989> yeah<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.230> that's<00:02:25.380> step<00:02:25.590> two

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
top drawers so yeah so that's step two

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.210 
top drawers so yeah so that's step two
step<00:02:26.310> two<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.520> finished<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:28.080> then<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:29.010> move

step two is finished and then you move
on<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.730> step<00:02:30.180> three<00:02:30.690> which<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:32.900> shelf<00:02:33.900> assembly

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
on to step three which is shelf assembly

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.040 
on to step three which is shelf assembly
no<00:02:35.670> no<00:02:35.730> if<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:35.940> see<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.900> still

no no if you can see that but that still

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.199 
no no if you can see that but that still
has<00:02:37.200> shelf<00:02:37.950> assembly<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:38.550> now<00:02:38.760> we've<00:02:38.910> got<00:02:39.090> to

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
has shelf assembly so now we've got to

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.160 
has shelf assembly so now we've got to
construct<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> shelves<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.590> make<00:02:40.739> like<00:02:41.700> a

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
construct the shelves to make like a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.320 
construct the shelves to make like a
cubicle<00:02:43.170> system<00:02:43.819> which<00:02:44.819> will<00:02:44.970> go<00:02:45.060> under<00:02:45.269> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
cubicle system which will go under the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.050 
cubicle system which will go under the
bed<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.560> let's<00:02:46.709> do<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:46.980> folks<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.519> step<00:02:47.790> four

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
bed so let's do that folks so step four

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.850 
bed so let's do that folks so step four
is<00:02:48.209> complete<00:02:48.600> we've<00:02:48.810> got<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.170> cubby<00:02:49.470> system

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
is complete we've got the cubby system

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.140 
is complete we've got the cubby system
done<00:02:50.569> this<00:02:51.569> is<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:52.049> four<00:02:52.850> cubby<00:02:53.850> shelf

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
done this is just a four cubby shelf

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.500 
done this is just a four cubby shelf
system<00:02:54.569> that<00:02:54.750> was<00:02:54.900> completed<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.530> step<00:02:55.799> three

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
system that was completed in step three

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.380 
system that was completed in step three
so<00:02:57.510> there's<00:02:58.200> step<00:02:58.470> three<00:02:59.000> right<00:03:00.000> next<00:03:00.269> to

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
so there's step three right next to

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.020 
so there's step three right next to
completed<00:03:01.230> step<00:03:01.470> two<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:02.099> dresser<00:03:02.459> there's

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
completed step two the dresser there's

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.550 
completed step two the dresser there's
all<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.239> hardware<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.840> tools<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.260> used

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
all the hardware and tools that I used

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.449 
all the hardware and tools that I used
and<00:03:05.250> there's<00:03:05.970> completed<00:03:06.569> step<00:03:06.780> one

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
and there's completed step one

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.570 
and there's completed step one
so<00:03:08.459> now<00:03:08.640> after<00:03:08.940> step<00:03:09.690> three<00:03:10.500> we<00:03:11.010> got<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.190> start

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
so now after step three we got a start

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.930 
so now after step three we got a start

about five hours to completely assemble
the<00:04:42.960> instructions<00:04:43.640> excuse<00:04:44.640> me<00:04:44.789> the

the instructions excuse me the

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.260 
the instructions excuse me the
instructions<00:04:46.169> are<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.349> little<00:04:46.620> misleading

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
instructions are a little misleading

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.180 
instructions are a little misleading
there<00:04:48.270> was<00:04:48.390> one<00:04:48.630> part<00:04:49.289> of<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.650> instructions

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
there was one part of the instructions

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.760 
there was one part of the instructions
that<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.400> found<00:04:50.820> that<00:04:51.150> were<00:04:51.330> incorrect<00:04:51.900> but

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
that I found that were incorrect but

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.740 
that I found that were incorrect but
that<00:04:52.890> was<00:04:53.039> early<00:04:53.370> on<00:04:53.520> in<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.760> process<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.270> it

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
that was early on in the process and it

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.050 
that was early on in the process and it
was<00:04:54.870> pretty<00:04:55.050> easy<00:04:55.320> to<00:04:55.590> identify<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:56.370> fix<00:04:56.610> um

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
was pretty easy to identify and fix um

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.909 
was pretty easy to identify and fix um
but<00:04:57.780> other<00:04:57.900> than<00:04:58.080> that<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.380> instructions<00:04:58.830> are

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
but other than that the instructions are

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.950 
but other than that the instructions are
pretty<00:04:59.099> straightforward<00:04:59.640> it's<00:05:00.360> just<00:05:00.599> a<00:05:00.720> whole

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
pretty straightforward it's just a whole

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.320 
pretty straightforward it's just a whole
lot<00:05:01.200> of<00:05:01.229> stuff<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.740> symbol<00:05:02.120> it's<00:05:03.120> pretty

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
lot of stuff to a symbol it's pretty

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.149 
lot of stuff to a symbol it's pretty
easy<00:05:03.539> but<00:05:03.870> it<00:05:03.990> just<00:05:04.169> takes<00:05:04.560> some<00:05:04.740> time<00:05:04.770> because

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
easy but it just takes some time because

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.430 
easy but it just takes some time because
as<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:06.090> can<00:05:06.210> see<00:05:06.270> there's<00:05:06.599> just<00:05:06.690> a<00:05:06.930> lot<00:05:07.140> of

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
as you can see there's just a lot of

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.050 
as you can see there's just a lot of
things<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.860> screw<00:05:08.130> in<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.340> lot<00:05:08.669> of<00:05:08.789> things<00:05:08.940> to

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
things to screw in a lot of things to

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.990

a number of moves just look the process
