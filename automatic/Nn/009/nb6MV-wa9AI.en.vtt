part of the Z and I'm just getting a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.250 
part of the Z and I'm just getting a
tight<00:00:50.760> curl<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.930> not<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
tight curl going on it's not going to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.740

flexible hold glue I don't think it's
important<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.719> use<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.260> flexible<00:01:04.650> whole<00:01:04.830> Glu

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
important to use the flexible whole Glu

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.320 
important to use the flexible whole Glu
it's<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> had<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.210> want<00:01:09.210> to

use this over the hot glue gun now and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.710 
use this over the hot glue gun now and
I'm<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.460> go<00:01:11.610> ahead<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.090> put<00:01:12.270> glue<00:01:12.450> all

I'm going to go ahead and put glue all

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.070 
I'm going to go ahead and put glue all
along<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.320> edge<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:14.070> my<00:01:14.549> paper<00:01:15.240> here
