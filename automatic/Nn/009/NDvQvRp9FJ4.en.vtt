00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.299 
into the fact that I Peyton Manning in
one<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> my<00:00:43.110> previous<00:00:43.290> video<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.980> my<00:00:44.100> live

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
one of my previous video is my live

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.920 
one of my previous video is my live
commentary<00:00:44.850> Peyton<00:00:45.180> Manning<00:00:45.420> challenge<00:00:45.809> was

actually<00:00:46.230> pretty<00:00:46.350> good<00:00:46.530> video<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:47.399> should

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
actually pretty good video you should

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.450 
actually pretty good video you should
check<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.760> out<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.710> gave<00:00:49.710> Peyton<00:00:50.160> Manning

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
check it out but I gave Peyton Manning

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.240

and<00:00:50.930> fantasy<00:00:51.930> football<00:00:52.260> kind<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> sparked

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and fantasy football kind of sparked

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.510 
and fantasy football kind of sparked
this<00:00:54.020> idea<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.230> me<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.980> tracking<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
this idea in me like the tracking of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.069 
this idea in me like the tracking of
stats<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.149> Call<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.390> Duty<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.719> think<00:00:57.960> it's

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
stats in Call of Duty I think it's

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.869 
stats in Call of Duty I think it's
really<00:00:58.469> comparable<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.629> know<00:01:00.829> I've<00:01:01.829> been<00:01:01.879> you

know me and a lot of other people have

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.310 
know me and a lot of other people have
been<00:01:04.979> critical<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.610> tracking<00:01:06.360> stats<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.170> Call

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
been critical of tracking stats and Call

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.390

youtube I think a lot of youtubers get

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.850 
youtube I think a lot of youtubers get
scrutinized<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.810> stats<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.470> take<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
scrutinized for stats so we take it a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.190 
scrutinized for stats so we take it a
little<00:01:25.979> bit<00:01:26.159> more<00:01:26.310> seriously<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.750> um<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
little bit more seriously but um and

little bit more seriously but um and
actually<00:01:28.530> quick<00:01:29.040> side<00:01:29.250> note<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.240> said

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
actually quick side note like I said

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.140 
actually quick side note like I said
before<00:01:30.710> people<00:01:31.710> asking<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> see<00:01:32.430> my<00:01:32.579> stats<00:01:32.850> is

before people asking to see my stats is

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.480 
before people asking to see my stats is
one<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.540> most<00:01:33.979> frequent<00:01:34.979> comments<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.430> get

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
one of the most frequent comments I get

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.789 
one of the most frequent comments I get
and<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.119> did<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.869> stats<00:01:37.229> video<00:01:37.409> if<00:01:37.680> you're

really<00:01:38.009> curious<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.570> lot<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.560> months<00:01:40.740> ago

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
really curious like a lot of months ago

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.230 
really curious like a lot of months ago
I<00:01:40.920> think<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.310> four<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:41.700> five<00:01:41.729> months<00:01:42.060> ago

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
I think was like four or five months ago

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
I think was like four or five months ago
and<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:42.990> gonna<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.290> another<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:43.649> before

gonna<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.720> significantly<00:01:48.720> better<00:01:48.960> but

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
gonna be significantly better but

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.090

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
black ops 1 and black ops 2 you know the

black ops 1 and black ops 2 you know the
stats<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.719> game<00:02:00.930> ignited<00:02:01.590> me<00:02:01.680> like<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.070> had

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
stats in that game ignited me like I had

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.060 
stats in that game ignited me like I had
i<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:03.659> looked<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.049> hundred<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.619> ninety

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
i just looked a hundred and ninety

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.880 
i just looked a hundred and ninety
thousand<00:02:05.610> kills<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.119> black<00:02:06.719> ops<00:02:06.899> 1<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.380> black

ops worn black ops 2 at this point i

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.809 
ops worn black ops 2 at this point i
think<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.410> pretty<00:02:10.530> safe<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.800> say<00:02:10.920> probably

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
think it's pretty safe to say probably

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.990 
think it's pretty safe to say probably
my<00:02:11.879> favorite<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.629> favor

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
my favorite to favor

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.540 
my favorite to favor
call<00:02:13.120> duty<00:02:13.270> games<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.080> I<00:02:14.650> know<00:02:14.710> that's<00:02:15.130> weird

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
call duty games and I know that's weird

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.150 
call duty games and I know that's weird
to<00:02:16.090> say<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:17.080> like<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.620> current<00:02:17.800> call<00:02:18.070> of

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
to say it I like the current call of

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.260 
to say it I like the current call of
duty<00:02:18.370> game<00:02:18.550> because<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.880> know<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.030> lot<00:02:19.120> of

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
duty game because I know a lot of

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.020 
duty game because I know a lot of
commentators<00:02:19.740> just<00:02:20.740> say<00:02:21.310> they<00:02:21.610> hate<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:21.970> and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
commentators just say they hate it and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.460 
commentators just say they hate it and
it's<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.240> worst<00:02:22.420> thing<00:02:22.540> ever<00:02:22.750> at<00:02:23.020> this<00:02:23.230> point

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
it's the worst thing ever at this point

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.130 
it's the worst thing ever at this point
but<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:24.070> don't<00:02:24.970> know<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.240> has<00:02:25.390> its<00:02:25.540> problems<00:02:25.720> but

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
but I don't know it has its problems but

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.260 
but I don't know it has its problems but
I<00:02:26.290> really<00:02:26.560> like<00:02:26.710> it<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:26.980> think<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.340> much

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
I really like it I think it's much

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.210 
I really like it I think it's much
better<00:02:28.540> than<00:02:29.050> any<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.770> other<00:02:29.890> call<00:02:30.130> of

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
better than any of the other call of

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.910 
better than any of the other call of
duty's<00:02:30.459> apart<00:02:30.820> from<00:02:30.940> black<00:02:31.090> ops<00:02:31.330> 1<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:32.050> did

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
duty's apart from black ops 1 so I did

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.310 
duty's apart from black ops 1 so I did
really<00:02:33.160> good<00:02:33.430> in<00:02:33.730> terms<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.540> stats<00:02:34.840> in<00:02:35.140> black

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
really good in terms of stats in black

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.940 
really good in terms of stats in black
ops<00:02:35.530> 1<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:36.880> like<00:02:37.060> reignited<00:02:38.020> this<00:02:38.530> land

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
ops 1 and it's like reignited this land

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.170 
ops 1 and it's like reignited this land
that's<00:02:39.070> like<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> fifth<00:02:39.459> time<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.730> said<00:02:40.030> that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
that's like the fifth time I said that

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.730 
that's like the fifth time I said that
but<00:02:40.209> that's<00:02:40.660> kind<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.110> theme<00:02:41.350> for<00:02:41.410> this

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
but that's kind of a theme for this

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.120 
but that's kind of a theme for this
commentary<00:02:42.160> I'm<00:02:42.940> really<00:02:43.930> liking<00:02:44.320> black<00:02:44.680> ops<00:02:44.890> 2

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
commentary I'm really liking black ops 2

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.699 
commentary I'm really liking black ops 2
again<00:02:45.370> because<00:02:46.120> i<00:02:46.239> want<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.660> get<00:02:46.870> stats

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
again because i want to get stats

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.780 
again because i want to get stats
comparable<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:49.000> black<00:02:49.209> ops<00:02:49.450> 1<00:02:49.890> Arab<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.220> fuck

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
comparable to black ops 1 Arab I fuck

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.400 
comparable to black ops 1 Arab I fuck
that<00:02:51.940> up<00:02:51.970> i<00:02:52.120> think<00:02:52.150> i<00:02:52.360> want<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.600> get<00:02:52.690> my<00:02:52.900> stats

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
that up i think i want to get my stats

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.140 
that up i think i want to get my stats
from<00:02:53.530> black<00:02:53.709> ops<00:02:53.890> 2<00:02:54.040> close<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.850> what<00:02:55.000> they<00:02:55.090> were

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
from black ops 2 close to what they were

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.270 
from black ops 2 close to what they were
in<00:02:55.300> black<00:02:55.480> ops<00:02:55.660> 1<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.080> it's<00:02:56.200> gonna<00:02:56.290> be<00:02:56.380> really

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
in black ops 1 and it's gonna be really

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.970 
in black ops 1 and it's gonna be really
difficult<00:02:57.580> um<00:02:58.060> kill<00:02:58.810> death<00:02:59.050> wise<00:02:59.260> cuz<00:02:59.680> like<00:02:59.830> i

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
difficult um kill death wise cuz like i

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.880 
difficult um kill death wise cuz like i
said<00:03:00.190> before<00:03:00.340> i<00:03:00.880> kind<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.810> experimented<00:03:02.560> with

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
said before i kind of experimented with

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.400 
said before i kind of experimented with
the<00:03:03.010> whole<00:03:03.160> reverse<00:03:03.489> boosting<00:03:04.000> thing<00:03:04.410> right

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
the whole reverse boosting thing right

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.470 
the whole reverse boosting thing right
at<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.560> beginning<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.010> game<00:03:06.160> it's<00:03:07.090> was

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
at the beginning of the game it's was

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.210 
at the beginning of the game it's was
complete<00:03:07.810> bullshit<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.470> i<00:03:08.530> just<00:03:08.739> fucked<00:03:08.980> my

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
complete bullshit and i just fucked my

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.270 
complete bullshit and i just fucked my
stats<00:03:09.520> up<00:03:09.760> i<00:03:09.880> added<00:03:10.360> like<00:03:10.510> 10,000<00:03:11.320> deaths<00:03:11.440> for

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
stats up i added like 10,000 deaths for

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.590 
stats up i added like 10,000 deaths for
no<00:03:12.340> apparent<00:03:12.700> reason<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:13.090> was<00:03:13.300> literally

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
no apparent reason I was literally

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.080 
no apparent reason I was literally
playing<00:03:13.930> better<00:03:14.470> players<00:03:14.860> with<00:03:15.459> when<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:15.820> had

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
playing better players with when I had

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.390 
playing better players with when I had
worse<00:03:16.300> stats<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.200> don't<00:03:17.950> know<00:03:18.070> where<00:03:18.370> that

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
worse stats so I don't know where that

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.009 
worse stats so I don't know where that
reverse<00:03:18.850> boosting<00:03:19.360> thing<00:03:19.570> maybe<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:19.870> was

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
reverse boosting thing maybe it was

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.930 
reverse boosting thing maybe it was
prevalent<00:03:20.980> at<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.400> beginning<00:03:21.700> of<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.820> game

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
prevalent at the beginning of the game

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.400 
prevalent at the beginning of the game
but<00:03:22.180> when<00:03:22.330> I<00:03:22.360> did<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.660> around<00:03:23.530> january<00:03:24.330> her

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
but when I did it around january her

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.930 
but when I did it around january her
December<00:03:26.410> January<00:03:26.440> whatever<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:27.370> made

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
December January whatever it made

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.259 
December January whatever it made
literally<00:03:28.870> no<00:03:29.140> difference<00:03:29.500> so<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:30.030> did<00:03:31.030> add

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
literally no difference so I did add

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.120 
literally no difference so I did add
like<00:03:31.540> 10,000<00:03:32.170> deaths<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:32.470> it's<00:03:32.620> really<00:03:32.830> tough

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
like 10,000 deaths so it's really tough
