00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
after doing that doing the same thing

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.000 
after doing that doing the same thing
but<00:01:12.810> switching<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.380> your<00:01:13.409> pistol<00:01:13.860> right

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
afterwards because that's going to be

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.730 
afterwards because that's going to be
when<00:01:15.810> you're<00:01:16.670> possibly<00:01:17.670> main<00:01:18.000> problems

when you're possibly main problems

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.410 
when you're possibly main problems

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
that's because that's what was one of

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.289 
that's because that's what was one of
Mines<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.310> yeah<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.460> practice<00:01:23.909> switching

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
just demonstrating that you can keep on

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.810 
just demonstrating that you can keep on
going<00:02:31.740> higher<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.670> higher<00:02:33.740> but<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:35.220> can

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
going higher and higher but you can

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.280 
going higher and higher but you can
basically<00:02:35.880> go<00:02:36.180> as<00:02:36.330> high<00:02:36.480> as<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.690> want<00:02:36.720> but

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
basically go as high as you want but

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.610 
basically go as high as you want but
you're<00:02:37.440> still<00:02:37.650> able<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.910> die<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.420> water<00:02:39.690> and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
you're still able to die in water and

you're still able to die in water and
all<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.739> stuff<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.550> can<00:02:41.850> still<00:02:42.120> fly

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
all that stuff but you can still fly

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.180 
all that stuff but you can still fly

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
close please do not forget that glitch

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.920 
close please do not forget that glitch
because<00:03:57.030> if<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:58.410> barely<00:03:59.070> hold<00:03:59.549> it<00:03:59.670> on<00:03:59.930> for

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
because if you barely hold it on for

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.680 
because if you barely hold it on for
long<00:04:01.350> enough<00:04:01.650> you'll<00:04:02.070> just<00:04:02.760> die<00:04:03.150> hitting<00:04:03.630> the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
long enough you'll just die hitting the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.259 
long enough you'll just die hitting the
