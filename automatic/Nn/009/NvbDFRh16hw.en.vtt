00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.889 

I<00:00:01.010> would<00:00:02.010> describe<00:00:02.250> it<00:00:02.550> as<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:03.120> as<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.689> new

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
I would describe it as the as a new

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.869 
I would describe it as the as a new
standard<00:00:04.319> in<00:00:04.470> full-size<00:00:04.890> trucks<00:00:05.279> we<00:00:05.580> know

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
standard in full-size trucks we know

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.760 
standard in full-size trucks we know
this<00:00:06.180> new<00:00:06.450> truck<00:00:06.750> going<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.080> redefine<00:00:07.379> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
this new truck going to redefine the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.060 
this new truck going to redefine the
segment<00:00:08.220> taking<00:00:08.849> Wade<00:00:09.120> out<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:10.070> increasing

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
segment taking Wade out and increasing

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.810 
segment taking Wade out and increasing
capability<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.660> way<00:00:12.809> for<00:00:13.139> any<00:00:13.469> tool<00:00:14.160> to

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
capability is the way for any tool to

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.700 
capability is the way for any tool to
move<00:00:14.969> forward<00:00:15.360> it's<00:00:15.929> going<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.260> feel<00:00:16.470> better

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
move forward it's going to feel better

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.220 
move forward it's going to feel better
and<00:00:16.890> perform<00:00:17.699> better<00:00:17.940> than<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.050> current

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
and perform better than the current

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.470 
and perform better than the current
trucks<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.830> road<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.730> will<00:00:21.000> be<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> new

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
trucks on the road this will be a new

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.480 
trucks on the road this will be a new
standard<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.199> really<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.830> future<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.189> top

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
standard it really is the future of top

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.609 
standard it really is the future of top
I<00:00:23.699> think<00:00:23.880> that's<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> best<00:00:25.019> way<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.289> describe

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
I think that's the best way to describe

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.179 
I think that's the best way to describe
it<00:00:26.510> we<00:00:27.510> wanted<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> do<00:00:27.930> something<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.619> big<00:00:28.890> with

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
it we wanted to do something so big with

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.650 
it we wanted to do something so big with
this<00:00:29.340> truck<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:29.910> said<00:00:30.119> let's<00:00:30.269> break<00:00:30.510> it

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
this truck that we said let's break it

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.569 
this truck that we said let's break it
down<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.990> its<00:00:31.019> core<00:00:31.439> elements<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.189> probably

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
down to its core elements but probably

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.100 
down to its core elements but probably
the<00:00:32.730> most<00:00:32.850> exciting<00:00:33.030> thing<00:00:33.510> was<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:34.020> were

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the most exciting thing was we were

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.080 
the most exciting thing was we were
opening<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.590> doors<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.920> materials<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.910> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
opening the doors to materials this is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.940 
opening the doors to materials this is
the<00:00:36.180> highest<00:00:36.390> volume<00:00:36.960> vehicle<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.469> America

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the highest volume vehicle in America

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.770 
the highest volume vehicle in America
and<00:00:38.129> we're<00:00:38.670> going<00:00:39.090> we're<00:00:39.390> making<00:00:39.690> this

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and we're going we're making this

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.920 
and we're going we're making this
dramatic<00:00:40.440> change<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.570> materials<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.780> came

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
dramatic change in materials and we came

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.020 
dramatic change in materials and we came
up<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.590> dynamite<00:00:44.129> combination<00:00:44.879> of

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
up with just a dynamite combination of

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.900 
up with just a dynamite combination of
aluminum<00:00:45.690> alloy<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.469> use<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.399> cab<00:00:47.640> in

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
aluminum alloy that we use on the cab in

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.450 
aluminum alloy that we use on the cab in
the<00:00:48.000> box<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> front<00:00:48.840> end<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.250> we<00:00:50.250> put<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the box in the front end and we put that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.540 
the box in the front end and we put that
over<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.820> steel<00:00:51.149> frame<00:00:51.360> which<00:00:52.170> has<00:00:52.800> boron<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
over a steel frame which has boron and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.799 
over a steel frame which has boron and
higher<00:00:53.730> strength<00:00:54.120> steel<00:00:54.390> than<00:00:54.600> we've<00:00:54.719> ever

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
higher strength steel than we've ever

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.200 
higher strength steel than we've ever
put<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> frame<00:00:55.559> before<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.219> took<00:00:56.340> 700<00:00:56.699> pounds

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
put in a frame before it took 700 pounds

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.670 
put in a frame before it took 700 pounds
of<00:00:57.300> weight<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.899> vehicle<00:00:58.289> still<00:00:58.320> is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
of weight out and this vehicle still is

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.439 
of weight out and this vehicle still is
more<00:00:58.859> capable<00:00:59.010> than<00:00:59.250> HIV<00:00:59.550> ever<00:00:59.789> produced<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
more capable than HIV ever produced and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.209 
more capable than HIV ever produced and
what<00:01:00.690> we've<00:01:00.899> managed<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.620> with<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.949> light

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
what we've managed to do with that light

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.429 
what we've managed to do with that light
weight<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.760> actually<00:01:03.210> poured<00:01:03.510> back<00:01:03.750> into<00:01:04.080> more

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
weight is actually poured back into more

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.190 
weight is actually poured back into more
capability<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.970> vehicle<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.930> actually

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
capability for the vehicle it's actually

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.859 
capability for the vehicle it's actually
more<00:01:07.409> fun<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.830> drive<00:01:08.040> more<00:01:08.490> capable<00:01:09.060> yet<00:01:09.540> looks

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
more fun to drive more capable yet looks

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.770 
more fun to drive more capable yet looks

it's<00:01:18.570> tough<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.320> standard-bearer<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.100> trucks

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
it's tough the standard-bearer of trucks

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.340 
it's tough the standard-bearer of trucks
is<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:20.939> are<00:01:21.030> usually<00:01:21.330> around<00:01:21.540> capability

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
is all are usually around capability

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.539 
is all are usually around capability
payload<00:01:23.250> hauling<00:01:24.210> etc<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.619> even<00:01:25.950> more<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.400> in

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
payload hauling etc but even more so in

today's environment it's also around

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.480 
today's environment it's also around
fuel<00:01:28.290> efficiency<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.130> go<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.369> that
