00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 set the global environmental statistics 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.120
 We all have a hard time in our environment 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.130
 there are more and more houses with always 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.440
 more modern equipment around us 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.940
 Cars drive the crowds of cars 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.460
 always build new machines 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.740
 while the waste heaps inexorably 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.680
 it's time to do something about it 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.520
 to save our environment 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.840
 one of the main sources of 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.570
 Pollution are the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.430
 transport as a manufacturer we feel 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.430
 us responsible for the environment with 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.899
 the potential alternative 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.640
 We use drive options 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.270
 our product range is a new one 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.270
 vehicle complements 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.950
 it is the solaris urbino with 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.720
 hybrid drive environmentally friendly and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.110
 at the same time gentle on the budgets 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.110
 our customers 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.790
 the production of a hybrid vehicle 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.860
 crowns the several months of our work 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.840
 Engineering offices it would be in such a way 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.970
 short time without support from 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.530
 our experienced partners to the companies 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.580
 suffered and can of course 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.580
 not possible 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.789
 the solaris urbino 18 with hybrid drive 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.770
 based on the classic flu 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.350
 Construction of stainless steel 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.289
 in the entire low floor city bus 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.640
 family rubino is used 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.920
 the simplest description of the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.079
 Hybridantriebs is a set of 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.329
 Electric motors to support the 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.700
 standard diesel drive thus in the 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.509
 range of the optimal 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.740
 fuel consumption are operated 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.720
 can 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.189
 The excess energy will be during 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.939
 the ride in special batteries 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.950
 saved 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.390
 those used in the hybrid system 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.979
 Batteries are also available at each 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.170
 braking process charged 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.700
 the resulting energy becomes 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.360
 acceleration of the vehicle again 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.360
 used 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.820
 the propulsion is the central element 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.620
 the hybrid drive in which the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.270
 combination of the torques of both 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.270
 Motors takes place bandic 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.970
 It consists of two electric motors two 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.660
 synchronous clutches and three planets 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.660
 operated 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.680
 visually the ev module resembles the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.420
 traditional manual and away 4 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.819
 117 kilograms 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.380
 The area is powered by the drive 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.140
 the roof of the vehicle placed 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.090
 Batteries and a guard complement the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.010
 during the braking process 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.500
 energy is in a special battery 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.360
 thus be stored on the bus roof 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.910
 those used in the hybrid system 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.319
 batteries during each braking process 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.239
 charged and are not external 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.100
 Energy sources depend on the 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.190
 service life of the nickel metal hybrid 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.459
 Battery short mmh with a weight of 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.650
 4 137 kilograms is about seven 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.410
 years depending on the type of 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.769
 bus use the inverter 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.900
 so-called dpm dual power inverter 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.760
 Module is an important electrical 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.370
 part of the system 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.170
 The hybrid bus forces the driver to 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.120
 no radical changes 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.040
 in terms of driving habits and 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.200
 Vehicle operation by the use 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.560
 optimized solutions even simplified 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.420
 were the control keyboard on the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.400
 dashboard is analogous to the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.200
 traditional bus designs for 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.590
 operation of the hybrid drive was the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.390
 so-called DNA control unit three future 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.310
 Reverse used in hybrid vehicle 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.390
 comes the traditional brake system 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.700
 rarely used 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.480
 to delineate the letting go of the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.820
 accelerator 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.700
 At the same time, the braking intensity is increased 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.440
 The DNA control unit will set this 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.120
 additionally allows the reason 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.120
 diagnostics of the drive system 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.099
 the transport companies will be 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.420
 mostly by the first argument 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.069
 So the reduction of the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:01.989
 fuel consumption of the hybrid buses 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:04.239
 convinced the diesel engine is by the 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.720
 coordinated use optimally protected 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.720
 and lasts longer 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.500
 for the bus driver are a very good 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.690
 driving dynamics and easy handling 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.160
 of advantage for the passengers of the 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.160
 significantly reduced noise level 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.789
 solaris urbino hybrid is suitable 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.069
 especially for the transport companies 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.020
 and industry pioneer of theirs 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.849
 permanently benefit from investments 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.120
 want and on environmental protection 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.120
 put
