 hello everyone we are still here at tokyo game show 2010 sylvain bouillat 

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.930
 are distant on the stand of the valbarelle have spoken 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.150
 domino gold-related costs you know the package feel both on ds this 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.920
 sense next December in Japan anyway and then on playstation 3 but 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.149
 with an adventure that we could find them to his taste that I could play 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.079
 then the demo of the tokyo game show is cut into two separate parts the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.270
 first he revealed to the front who have themselves 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.680
 so you're here to walk around a club he adopts his crusade launched 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.610
 very early 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.250
 as a reminder, this has developed along with the fugues 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.890
 more mehdi baala fantastic lybia 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.520
 with a little magic the little character is there with his little 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.610
 his little celtic to his ally a kind of sweet no rest with a 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.540
 long nose with a lantern at the end 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.280
 it's quite strange but in any case there are a lot of people in this 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.230
 city 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.640
 animation ouroux animations will be very well that animated very cool and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.900
 very well could tell him 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.720
 we are fully immersed ambulance and the second part of the demo she is 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.810
 related to the fighting itself lanka of the exploration 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.890
 we have a large map that has somewhere a little bit like the 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.720
 pilots have grasped the old one we see from above and suddenly like that we 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.220
 discover the places and go from castle to forest can caverns and then to 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.450
 inside and not like in a traditional RPG that went out 9 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.360
 hours well you will meet enemies that you can see on the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.590
 map is much more convenient so possibility to avoid them 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.600
 but if you meet them federgon withdrawal directly into the fight 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.160
 alas to davos to manage your different characters for them 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.510
 moving directly on the map by sending your costs see even your spells 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.630
 magical since you know behind the scenes of the stars you have a smoking room 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.970
 on which you will be able to do the business of the incantations and one 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.200
 found in this version playstation 3 during the phases of more exploration and 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.450
 fight well the herault adele donned a small map of the most beautiful 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.630
 effect and I was really bluffed talking animations you talked about it 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.810
 moments ago when for example there is a small stream in a forest 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.440
 little reminder strangely a model who loved of course disappointed the audience and there 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.550
 we find ourselves galette galette for the editorial wind blows that 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.809
 take the cat a little 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:32.349
 we are immersed in a very beautiful adventure in any case that is announced 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.809
 really weidenfeller club e the game the game is planned so wanted at all to 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:41.599
 the time in 2011 bkc graph that you saw one in cel shading but very 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.249
 very hungry not at all if we did not play with very black words we really 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.199
 the impression of being in a cartoon, that's what we 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.889
 could say for now on the premises there is no European date 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:55.969
 for the moment we really hope that the version ds later version ps3 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.390
 let's get to our house anyway 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.390

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.870
