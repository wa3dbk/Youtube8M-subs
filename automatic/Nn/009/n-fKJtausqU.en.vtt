any
and<00:01:52.810> for<00:01:53.079> me<00:01:53.259> right<00:01:53.409> this<00:01:53.619> second<00:01:54.750> they<00:01:55.750> have<00:01:55.930> a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
and for me right this second they have a

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:05.880 
and for me right this second they have a
diamond<00:01:56.500> pattern<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:58.780> front<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:04.890> this

mint-condition<00:02:14.370> really<00:02:15.370> rough<00:02:15.790> along<00:02:16.150> here

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
mint-condition really rough along here

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:23.880 
mint-condition really rough along here
for<00:02:16.810> some<00:02:16.989> reason<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:19.630> almost<00:02:19.900> like<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:22.890> never

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
for some reason it's almost like I never

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:32.670 
for some reason it's almost like I never
seen<00:02:24.220> one<00:02:24.370> roughly<00:02:24.970> there<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:27.030> wonder<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:32.470> the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
seen one roughly there I wonder is the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.979 
seen one roughly there I wonder is the
covers<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.489> good<00:02:33.819> condition<00:02:34.329> right<00:02:34.450> there

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
covers in good condition right there

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.569 
covers in good condition right there
I<00:02:35.190> wonder<00:02:36.190> if<00:02:36.220> that's<00:02:36.459> just<00:02:38.190> they<00:02:39.190> had<00:02:39.430> to

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
I wonder if that's just they had to

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:46.710 
I wonder if that's just they had to
cover<00:02:39.880> off<00:02:40.620> maybe<00:02:44.640> interesting<00:02:45.690> anyway<00:02:46.690> I

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
cover off maybe interesting anyway I

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.640 
cover off maybe interesting anyway I
didn't<00:02:46.959> have<00:02:46.989> one<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.380> these<00:02:47.440> in<00:02:47.620> my

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.890 
and like full mint condition I have
heard<00:03:36.310> from<00:03:36.459> other<00:03:36.639> collectors<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.480> 6th

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
heard from other collectors that the 6th

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.460 
heard from other collectors that the 6th
printing

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.060 

with<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.430> diamonds<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:44.080> actually<00:03:44.530> more<00:03:44.770> rare

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
with the diamonds is actually more rare

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:52.320 
with the diamonds is actually more rare
than<00:03:48.060> this<00:03:49.060> error<00:03:49.960> that<00:03:50.890> is<00:03:51.640> missing<00:03:52.210> the

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
than this error that is missing the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.310 
than this error that is missing the
diamonds<00:03:53.640> so<00:03:55.710> that's<00:03:56.710> kind<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.100> interesting<00:03:57.340> I

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
diamonds so that's kind of interesting I

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.770 
diamonds so that's kind of interesting I
don't<00:03:59.320> have<00:04:00.180> well<00:04:01.180> what's<00:04:01.690> that<00:04:01.900> don't<00:04:02.230> have<00:04:02.500> I

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
don't have well what's that don't have I

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.760 
don't have well what's that don't have I
thought<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:04.810> had<00:04:05.080> it<00:04:05.110> but<00:04:05.290> it<00:04:05.410> turned<00:04:05.590> out<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.740> be

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
thought I had it but it turned out to be

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.810 
thought I had it but it turned out to be
a<00:04:05.830> fifth<00:04:06.130> printer<00:04:07.170> so<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.560> have<00:04:09.190> another<00:04:09.430> sixth

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
a fifth printer so I have another sixth

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.310 
a fifth printer so I have another sixth
printing<00:04:10.150> coming<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.660> they<00:04:10.720> didn't<00:04:10.990> make<00:04:11.110> any

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
printing coming and they didn't make any

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.260 
printing coming and they didn't make any
mention<00:04:11.620> whether<00:04:11.980> or<00:04:12.100> not<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:12.400> was<00:04:12.520> blank<00:04:13.030> or

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
mention whether or not it was blank or

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.410 
mention whether or not it was blank or
not<00:04:13.390> so<00:04:13.570> hopefully<00:04:13.900> it's<00:04:14.880> got<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.030> diamond

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
not so hopefully it's got the diamond

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.360 
not so hopefully it's got the diamond
pattern<00:04:16.769> so<00:04:17.769> there<00:04:17.859> you<00:04:17.980> go

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
pattern so there you go

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.210 
pattern so there you go
