00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:10.020
 of the career 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.280
 chronic students of the group 12 mt to 3 in 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.440
 this case we are going to show you the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.570
 starting practice and they were with 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.820
 motor spin fun the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.110
 materials that we are going to use are 4 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:26.489
 resistances to 220 3 buttons bus button 4 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.869
 5volts relays and a 5- ball motor 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.960
 next my partner jonathan 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.420
 Carazo will show you how a 6 is installed 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.420
 in the elevators was a protoboard 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.390
 good afternoon, good, here we are going to 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.899
 present as my partner says 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.140
 the proto board how is this a circuit 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.960
 start and stop with reversible here 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.050
 I have my course is my push button is going 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.970
 to my first to my first this relay and 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.879
 in the first relay I send voltage 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.489
 to the second but by an interlock 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.800
 when you press me this push button goes to 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.520
 learn green and orange and you 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.229
 has to turn off that of the unemployment in 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.119
 this case here is already activating 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.860
 it locked this led 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.869
 nothing else what is indicating me from 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.930
 I have voltage when I have voltage 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.890
 my engine is spinning my engine turns to 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.490
 my left goes tour so that's how it is 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.159
 spinning I give stop button 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.220
 Nails in Nails The cigar is lit 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.670
 orange the red right now what I 'm going to 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.539
 make is the investment of turn and you have 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.110
 that turn yellow pure and my 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:45.520
 engine will turn to the opposite side 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.520
 there is already learned my miller 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.039
 and my engine is already turning to the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.189
 contrary to the one I was going to give 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:57.969
 stop button turn off all my leds and 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:01.770
 the pure red is on and this was 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.770
 our practice starting and stopping
