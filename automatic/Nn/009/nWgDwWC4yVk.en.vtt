00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
going into season 2 while I did enjoy

going into season 2 while I did enjoy
season<00:05:16.669> 1<00:05:16.819> personally<00:05:17.479> I<00:05:17.509> felt<00:05:17.779> it<00:05:17.960> could<00:05:18.050> have

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
season 1 personally I felt it could have

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.200 
season 1 personally I felt it could have
been<00:05:18.259> better<00:05:18.469> but<00:05:18.979> if<00:05:19.219> the<00:05:19.580> new<00:05:19.729> season<00:05:20.120> is

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
been better but if the new season is

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.149 
been better but if the new season is
anything<00:05:20.599> how<00:05:20.719> the<00:05:20.779> last<00:05:20.990> one<00:05:21.199> ended<00:05:21.500> I<00:05:21.650> think

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
anything how the last one ended I think

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:23.290 
anything how the last one ended I think
will<00:05:22.279> be<00:05:22.370> good<00:05:22.490> for<00:05:22.639> the<00:05:22.699> rest<00:05:22.849> of<00:05:22.969> this<00:05:23.060> show
