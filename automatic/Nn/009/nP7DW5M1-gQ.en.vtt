3100 we'll check it out how long it

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.780 
3100 we'll check it out how long it
lasts<00:03:43.989> maybe<00:03:44.500> last<00:03:44.829> even<00:03:45.160> longer<00:03:45.190> than<00:03:45.489> their

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
lasts maybe last even longer than their

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.699 
lasts maybe last even longer than their

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.750 
million battery with a 5.2 inch and
screen<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.739> can<00:03:50.860> see<00:03:51.130> also<00:03:51.519> here<00:03:51.670> of

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
screen and you can see also here of

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.340 
screen and you can see also here of
course<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:52.239> one<00:03:52.450> plus<00:03:52.660> one<00:03:52.690> is<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:53.019> little<00:03:53.260> bit

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
course the one plus one is a little bit

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.770 
course the one plus one is a little bit
bigger<00:03:53.950> but<00:03:54.519> of<00:03:54.670> course<00:03:54.940> as<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.329> said<00:03:55.360> there's<00:03:55.690> a

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
bigger but of course as I said there's a

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.020 
bigger but of course as I said there's a
bigger<00:03:55.989> screen<00:03:56.260> inside<00:03:56.620> so<00:03:56.890> that's<00:03:57.579> just

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
bigger screen inside so that's just

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.270 
bigger screen inside so that's just
natural<00:03:58.440> if<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.590> guys<00:03:59.739> only<00:03:59.980> know<00:04:00.160> that

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
natural if you guys only know that

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
against 5.5 inches of course a lot

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.120 
against 5.5 inches of course a lot
smaller<00:04:05.430> but<00:04:06.430> in<00:04:06.610> terms<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.880> thickness<00:04:08.130> this

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
smaller but in terms of thickness this

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.100 
smaller but in terms of thickness this
can<00:04:09.340> maybe<00:04:09.459> see<00:04:09.760> here<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.450> iphone<00:04:10.900> is

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
can maybe see here the iphone is
