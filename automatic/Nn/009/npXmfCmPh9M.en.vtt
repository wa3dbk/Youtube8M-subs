00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.199 
there and just gently keep rolling this
-<00:03:00.470> you're<00:03:00.680> at<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:00.890> halfway<00:03:01.040> mark

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.330 

we're<00:03:09.209> going<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.599> do<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.439> same<00:03:10.680> thing<00:03:10.980> on<00:03:11.189> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
we're going to do the same thing on the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:26.870 
we're going to do the same thing on the
other<00:03:11.370> side

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.970 

just<00:03:27.570> gently<00:03:27.930> push<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.260> together<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:28.890> little

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
just gently push it together a little

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.780 
just gently push it together a little
bit<00:03:30.350> now<00:03:31.350> if<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.620> like<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:32.040> can<00:03:32.250> brush<00:03:32.580> this

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
bit now if you like you can brush this

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.240 
bit now if you like you can brush this
with<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> bit<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.480> non-dairy<00:03:33.960> milk<00:03:34.380> or<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.890> little

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
with a bit of non-dairy milk or a little

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.420 
with a bit of non-dairy milk or a little
bit<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.460> water<00:03:35.700> but<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.830> think<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.160> moist

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
bit of water but I think this is moist

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.790 
bit of water but I think this is moist
enough<00:03:38.670> for<00:03:39.060> my<00:03:39.210> liking<00:03:39.450> just<00:03:40.170> because<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.620> has

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
enough for my liking just because it has

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.710 
enough for my liking just because it has
just<00:03:41.040> thawed<00:03:41.760> out<00:03:42.710> so<00:03:43.710> now<00:03:44.460> we'll<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.210> cutting

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720
