drive<00:01:33.509> shaft<00:01:33.930> that's<00:01:34.680> sealed<00:01:35.009> by<00:01:35.280> an<00:01:35.460> o-ring

drive shaft that's sealed by an o-ring

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.090 
drive shaft that's sealed by an o-ring
because<00:01:36.780> those<00:01:36.960> o-rings<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.770> been<00:01:37.920> known<00:01:38.070> to

fail

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
fail

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.360

so<00:01:39.460> we<00:01:39.610> created<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.090> magnetic<00:01:40.570> coupler

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
so we created the magnetic coupler

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.760 
so we created the magnetic coupler
outside<00:01:42.370> we<00:01:42.910> have<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.060> series<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.690> neo<00:01:44.110> dominium
