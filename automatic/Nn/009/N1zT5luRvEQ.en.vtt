but
it<00:01:09.800> is<00:01:10.010> better<00:01:10.820> than<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.270> seems<00:01:12.160> because<00:01:13.160> it's

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
it is better than it seems because it's

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
got a really really short cooldown so

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.330 
got a really really short cooldown so
our<00:01:17.120> early<00:01:17.510> game<00:01:17.720> it's<00:01:18.290> actually<00:01:18.440> fantastic

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
our early game it's actually fantastic

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
what else does a patient have he has a

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.820 
what else does a patient have he has a
shield<00:01:33.880> it's<00:01:34.150> called<00:01:34.390> faint<00:01:34.870> it's<00:01:35.140> kind<00:01:35.620> of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
shield it's called faint it's kind of

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.700 
shield it's called faint it's kind of
really<00:01:36.190> really<00:01:36.790> really<00:01:37.390> good<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:40.500> don't<00:01:41.500> pick

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
really really really good I don't pick

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.370 
really really really good I don't pick
it<00:01:41.860> up<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.100> level<00:01:42.280> 4<00:01:42.729> oddly<00:01:43.420> enough<00:01:43.450> because<00:01:44.170> at

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
it up to level 4 oddly enough because at

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.650 
it up to level 4 oddly enough because at
earlier<00:01:44.860> levels<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.940> shield<00:01:46.180> isn't<00:01:46.420> very

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
earlier levels the shield isn't very

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.570 
earlier levels the shield isn't very
good<00:01:46.870> and<00:01:47.080> more<00:01:47.740> importantly<00:01:48.130> without<00:01:48.280> it

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
good and more importantly without it

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.969 
good and more importantly without it
much<00:01:48.760> ap<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.600> shield<00:01:49.840> is<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:49.990> very<00:01:50.260> good<00:01:50.290> it

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
much ap the shield is a very good it

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.100 
much ap the shield is a very good it
doesn't<00:01:51.520> provide<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:53.680> much<00:01:53.979> extra<00:01:54.430> defense

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
doesn't provide that much extra defense

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:03.480 
doesn't provide that much extra defense
however<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:59.190> always<00:02:00.190> enough<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:02.590> there

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
however is always enough I just there

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.190 
however is always enough I just there
are<00:02:03.610> very<00:02:03.820> few<00:02:03.910> situations<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.930> can't

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
are very few situations that you can't

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.080 
are very few situations that you can't
get<00:02:05.470> out<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:05.770> through<00:02:06.009> correct<00:02:06.340> use<00:02:06.580> of<00:02:06.610> fans

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
get out of through correct use of fans

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.060 
get out of through correct use of fans
because<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:08.170> will<00:02:08.440> just<00:02:08.619> block<00:02:08.910> ton<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.030> damage

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
because it will just block ton of damage

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.000 
because it will just block ton of damage
another<00:02:12.070> really<00:02:12.370> important<00:02:12.850> aspect<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.450> is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
another really important aspect of it is

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:22.620 
another really important aspect of it is
faint<00:02:15.840> increases<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:21.270> reduces<00:02:22.270> the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
faint increases the it reduces the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.270 
faint increases the it reduces the
cooldown<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:23.700> your<00:02:25.530> passive<00:02:26.530> key<00:02:26.950> strike

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
cooldown of your passive key strike

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.640 
cooldown of your passive key strike
which<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.880> extra<00:02:28.780> damage<00:02:28.930> based<00:02:29.260> on<00:02:29.500> your

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
which is extra damage based on your

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.400 
which is extra damage based on your
players<00:02:30.540> bonus<00:02:31.540> health

it

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
it

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.670 
it
gives<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.180> decrease<00:02:37.780> cool<00:02:38.140> down<00:02:38.350> on<00:02:38.500> that

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
gives you decrease cool down on that

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.620 
gives you decrease cool down on that
every<00:02:39.160> time<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.459> attack<00:02:39.940> while<00:02:40.360> it's

every time you attack while it's
currently<00:02:41.020> active<00:02:41.530> it's<00:02:41.770> see<00:02:42.370> where<00:02:42.610> I'm

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
currently active it's see where I'm

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.850 
currently active it's see where I'm
getting<00:02:43.030> having<00:02:44.020> difficulty<00:02:44.470> voting<00:02:44.590> that

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
getting having difficulty voting that

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.070 
getting having difficulty voting that
basically<00:02:45.459> when<00:02:45.790> it's<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.120> if<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:46.480> attack<00:02:46.810> it

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
basically when it's on if you attack it

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.140 
basically when it's on if you attack it
takes<00:02:47.860> off<00:02:49.110> 1.5<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.470> think<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:51.430> can<00:02:51.790> get<00:02:51.970> up<00:02:52.120> to

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
takes off 1.5 I think it can get up to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.380 
takes off 1.5 I think it can get up to
two<00:02:53.100> seconds<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.489> active<00:02:54.940> cooldown<00:02:55.360> of

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
two seconds of the active cooldown of

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.970 
two seconds of the active cooldown of
Keystone<00:02:55.930> which<00:02:56.080> normally<00:02:56.410> has<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.590> cool<00:02:56.860> down

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
Keystone which normally has a cool down

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.460 
Keystone which normally has a cool down
hole<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.520> believe<00:02:58.000> 10<00:02:58.360> seconds<00:02:58.930> might<00:02:59.110> be<00:02:59.260> eight

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
hole I believe 10 seconds might be eight

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.190 
hole I believe 10 seconds might be eight
but

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.010 

it's<00:03:02.379> kiss<00:03:03.090> considering<00:03:04.090> all<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.540> ways<00:03:04.750> you

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
it's kiss considering all the ways you

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.479 
it's kiss considering all the ways you
can<00:03:05.170> reduce<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.650> cool<00:03:05.800> down<00:03:05.860> attacking

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
can reduce it to cool down attacking

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.100 
can reduce it to cool down attacking
champions<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.090> attacking<00:03:07.420> anything<00:03:07.810> while

shadow<00:03:18.489> dash<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.300> range<00:03:19.750> torch<00:03:20.200> it's<00:03:20.500> not

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
shadow dash is a range torch it's not

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.120 
shadow dash is a range torch it's not
very<00:03:20.860> long<00:03:21.069> direction<00:03:21.580> on<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.910> tortoise<00:03:22.390> or

very long direction on the tortoise or

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.259 
very long direction on the tortoise or
now<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.190> could<00:03:24.640> say<00:03:24.819> that<00:03:24.849> it's<00:03:25.120> not<00:03:25.180> that

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
now you could say that it's not that

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.570 
now you could say that it's not that
great<00:03:25.569> but<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.110> torque<00:03:26.349> is<00:03:26.530> amazing<00:03:27.160> slowing

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
great but the torque is amazing slowing

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.880 
great but the torque is amazing slowing

it's<00:03:53.970> 550<00:03:54.970> shield<00:03:55.959> a<00:03:56.400> level<00:03:57.400> by<00:03:57.610> what<00:03:57.819> am<00:03:57.910> I

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
it's 550 shield a level by what am I

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.110 
it's 550 shield a level by what am I
talked<00:03:58.120> about<00:03:58.150> level<00:03:58.510> 3

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
talked about level 3

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.150 
talked about level 3
however<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.390> has<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:02.250> 1.5<00:04:03.250> AP<00:04:04.120> ratio<00:04:05.160> which

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
however it has a 1.5 AP ratio which

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.790 
however it has a 1.5 AP ratio which
means<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:07.060> get<00:04:07.209> a<00:04:07.270> small<00:04:07.569> amount<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:07.930> AP<00:04:08.290> you

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
means you get a small amount of AP you

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.809 
means you get a small amount of AP you
can<00:04:08.950> easily<00:04:09.190> give<00:04:09.730> an<00:04:09.940> ant<00:04:10.180> argot<00:04:10.810> Ally<00:04:11.819> 1,000

builds

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.180 

I<00:04:38.730> find<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:39.600> it's<00:04:40.080> not<00:04:40.290> very<00:04:40.500> different<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.160> a

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
I find that it's not very different to a

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.770 
I find that it's not very different to a
traditional<00:04:41.490> Shen<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.120> only<00:04:42.390> difference<00:04:42.690> is

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
traditional Shen the only difference is

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.930 
traditional Shen the only difference is

you want to poke a lot more because you

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.660 
you want to poke a lot more because you

like<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.280> tank<00:05:05.669> now<00:05:06.659> you<00:05:07.050> will<00:05:07.229> die<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.530> lot

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
like a tank now you will die a lot

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.499 
like a tank now you will die a lot
faster<00:05:08.159> than<00:05:08.840> normally<00:05:09.840> would<00:05:10.050> as<00:05:10.319> tank

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
faster than normally would as tank

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.629 
faster than normally would as tank
because<00:05:12.509> you're<00:05:12.689> not<00:05:12.840> one<00:05:13.159> but<00:05:14.159> you'll<00:05:14.400> deal<00:05:14.610> a

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
because you're not one but you'll deal a

lot more damage and you'll have your

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.300 
lot more damage and you'll have your
essentially<00:05:19.020> two<00:05:19.229> things<00:05:19.560> you're<00:05:19.889> a<00:05:19.919> burst

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
essentially two things you're a burst

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.719 
essentially two things you're a burst
tank<00:05:20.879> and<00:05:21.210> burst<00:05:22.020> damage<00:05:22.460> because<00:05:23.460> you've<00:05:23.610> got

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
tank and burst damage because you've got

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.929 
tank and burst damage because you've got
two<00:05:23.939> abilities<00:05:24.389> which<00:05:25.189> get<00:05:26.189> surprising

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:26.939 
two abilities which get surprising

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:29.029 
two abilities which get surprising
amounts<00:05:27.419> of<00:05:27.539> damage<00:05:27.750> and<00:05:28.139> fire<00:05:28.740> off

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
amounts of damage and fire off

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.790 
amounts of damage and fire off
relatively<00:05:29.819> rapidly<00:05:30.389> you<00:05:31.139> saw<00:05:31.379> it<00:05:31.439> you<00:05:31.620> can

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
relatively rapidly you saw it you can

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.469 
relatively rapidly you saw it you can
throw<00:05:32.039> about<00:05:32.189> every<00:05:32.789> four<00:05:33.240> and<00:05:33.419> a<00:05:33.449> half

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
throw about every four and a half

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.850 
throw about every four and a half
seconds<00:05:35.870> so<00:05:36.870> you've<00:05:37.020> got<00:05:37.050> high<00:05:37.379> burst<00:05:37.680> damage

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
seconds so you've got high burst damage

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.679 
seconds so you've got high burst damage
but<00:05:38.129> you've<00:05:38.250> also<00:05:38.370> got<00:05:38.580> high<00:05:38.759> burst<00:05:39.000> tankiness

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:39.689 
but you've also got high burst tankiness

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:42.409 
but you've also got high burst tankiness
because<00:05:40.080> you've<00:05:40.259> got<00:05:40.409> a<00:05:40.699> shield<00:05:41.699> and<00:05:42.090> a<00:05:42.240> shield

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
because you've got a shield and a shield

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.709 
because you've got a shield and a shield
for<00:05:42.629> an<00:05:42.719> ally<00:05:43.849> more<00:05:44.849> importantly<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.389> shield

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:45.719 
for an ally more importantly the shield

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:49.070 
for an ally more importantly the shield
it<00:05:45.960> can<00:05:46.289> suck<00:05:46.560> up<00:05:47.029> considerable<00:05:48.029> I'll<00:05:48.750> evel's

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
it can suck up considerable I'll evel's

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.790 
it can suck up considerable I'll evel's
and<00:05:49.259> high<00:05:49.409> a<00:05:49.439> people<00:05:49.919> lemons<00:05:51.439> happy<00:05:52.439> numbers

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
and high a people lemons happy numbers

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.950 
and high a people lemons happy numbers
it<00:05:53.490> can<00:05:53.729> suck<00:05:53.909> up<00:05:54.000> considerable<00:05:54.629> amounts<00:05:54.900> of

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
it can suck up considerable amounts of

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.260 
it can suck up considerable amounts of
damage<00:05:55.139> for<00:05:55.529> you<00:05:55.770> but<00:05:56.400> it<00:05:56.490> is<00:05:56.610> only<00:05:56.759> temporary

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
damage for you but it is only temporary

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.219 
damage for you but it is only temporary
so<00:05:57.569> you're<00:05:57.719> not<00:05:57.810> a<00:05:57.870> tank<00:05:58.229> all<00:05:58.620> the<00:05:59.039> time<00:06:02.060> it's

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
so you're not a tank all the time it's

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.110 
so you're not a tank all the time it's
it's<00:06:04.229> interesting<00:06:04.529> you<00:06:04.979> end<00:06:05.460> up<00:06:05.610> playing<00:06:05.879> like

it's interesting you end up playing like
a<00:06:06.150> tank<00:06:06.449> for<00:06:06.690> dealing<00:06:08.150> considerable
