of like orange spots now those are
actually<00:01:44.100> rubber<00:01:44.490> that's<00:01:44.790> actually<00:01:45.090> rubber

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
actually rubber that's actually rubber

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.179 
actually rubber that's actually rubber
in<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> sidewalls<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.200> two<00:01:46.409> millimeters<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
in the sidewalls it's two millimeters of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.730 
in the sidewalls it's two millimeters of
rubber<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.939> helps<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.600> reduce<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
rubber and that helps like reduce the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.380 
rubber and that helps like reduce the
amount<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.189> jarring<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.180> when

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
amount of like jarring you get when

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.530 
amount of like jarring you get when
you're<00:01:51.540> landing<00:01:51.750> off<00:01:52.170> jumps<00:01:52.770> there's<00:01:53.340> a

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
you're landing off jumps there's a

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.350 
you're landing off jumps there's a
quadratic<00:01:55.430> sidecut<00:01:56.430> radius<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.270> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
quadratic sidecut radius so it's a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.480 
quadratic sidecut radius so it's a
combination<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:58.259> quite<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> few<00:01:59.100> psychic

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
combination of quite a few psychic

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.730 
combination of quite a few psychic
radiuses<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.600> board<00:02:01.140> will<00:02:01.259> actually<00:02:01.500> turn

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
radiuses so the board will actually turn

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.350 
radiuses so the board will actually turn
at<00:02:02.100> both<00:02:02.280> high<00:02:02.520> speeds<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.939> low<00:02:03.090> speeds

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
at both high speeds and low speeds

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.749 
at both high speeds and low speeds
making<00:02:03.600> large<00:02:04.259> arcs<00:02:04.799> or<00:02:04.950> small<00:02:05.460> arcs

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
making large arcs or small arcs

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.969 
making large arcs or small arcs
depending<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.899> want<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.259> now

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
depending on what do you want to do now

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.279 
depending on what do you want to do now
one<00:02:08.550> great<00:02:08.910> thing<00:02:08.940> about<00:02:09.119> Solomon<00:02:09.660> decks<00:02:10.020> is

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
one great thing about Solomon decks is

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.800 
one great thing about Solomon decks is
the<00:02:10.470> fact<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.920> they<00:02:11.039> really<00:02:11.069> take<00:02:11.819> pride<00:02:12.690> in

their
their<00:02:13.950> basis<00:02:14.520> now<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.360> an<00:02:15.540> extruded<00:02:15.900> base

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
their basis now this is an extruded base

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.160 
their basis now this is an extruded base
but<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.099> has<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.550> has<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> great<00:02:18.180> standard<00:02:18.810> stone

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
but it has it has a great standard stone

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.979 
but it has it has a great standard stone
stone<00:02:19.830> ground<00:02:20.099> finish<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.720> board's

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
stone ground finish to it so the board's

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.750 
stone ground finish to it so the board's
gonna<00:02:22.110> it's<00:02:22.620> gonna<00:02:22.770> last<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.190> long<00:02:23.310> time<00:02:23.340> it's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
