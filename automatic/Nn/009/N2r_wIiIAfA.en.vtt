00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.310
 not 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.310
 antananarivo - no 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.519
 it was excellent 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:34.700
 all about famous chocolates 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.800
 Dona Young can already confirm that it really happens again 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.140
 we agree that it is different 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.090
 and even hotter 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.410
 suddenly we can gain more time our part but also also put itself 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.480
 the rumors are confirmed milk in the microwave bain-marie 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.700
 this first part is just waiting 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.250
 christmas microwaves to melt 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.220
 kennedy one minute even put 30 second part but still no points 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.800
 not to risk burning 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 thirty seconds just a little bit 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.610
 when they have already built a strong squad competitor bertin comes 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.099
 We call it the physical-athletic gaga that we 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.090
 turn into museum 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.090
 we'll put on the oil cooler 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.130
 The time fla right and leaves the young lady very sweet and I ended up forgetting saboó 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.890
 also 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.520
 turning into a different dessert also different from here 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.540
 most people are already accustomed to it already been 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.410
 bolt that I mixed were born 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.410
 check out a little more consistently 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.460
 another important thing this mix is ​​not too far away 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.890
 nor so high can acquire such a creamier consistency 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.170
 to form a mousse 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.550
 Good, but no job 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.600
 with this part 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.709
 and then we'll play clarinet and three defeats 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.709
 You just need your reception here. 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.599
 until it is snowy 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.909
 only mix is ​​inscribed already made occupied by the electric panel as 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.989
 because he's going to get no more angry than the heavy 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.749
 You do not even have to wait for many well-detailed forms 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.889
 I'm happy 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.949
 is a desecration of the West in this pastoral speech with the fact that in the four 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:45.419
 lines with emphasis on the largest ascending sport tray children eat 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.309
 we think it is especially 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:52.309
 I'll ask what? 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.509
 you may come across a little rap and just talk 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:01.189
 the united nations continue many passes 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.279
