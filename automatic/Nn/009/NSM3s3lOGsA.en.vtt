here's a quick botany lesson from a
chemist<00:00:13.769> chlorophyll<00:00:14.769> is<00:00:14.950> the<00:00:15.040> pigment<00:00:15.340> in

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640 
chemist chlorophyll is the pigment in

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.769 
chemist chlorophyll is the pigment in

is<00:00:19.480> very<00:00:19.720> important<00:00:20.260> for<00:00:20.380> plants<00:00:20.829> and<00:00:21.009> it<00:00:21.489> is

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
is very important for plants and it is

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.850 
is very important for plants and it is
vital<00:00:22.029> for<00:00:22.060> photosynthesis<00:00:22.989> to<00:00:23.169> occur<00:00:23.200> the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
vital for photosynthesis to occur the

breathes oxygen would not be able to
live<00:00:41.700> okay<00:00:42.700> let's<00:00:43.480> get<00:00:43.660> started<00:00:43.900> with<00:00:44.140> this

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
live okay let's get started with this

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.590 
live okay let's get started with this
experiment<00:00:44.740> I'm<00:00:45.280> going<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:45.850> be<00:00:45.970> extracting

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
experiment I'm going to be extracting

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.450 
experiment I'm going to be extracting
the<00:00:46.720> chlorophyll<00:00:47.230> from<00:00:47.440> some<00:00:47.740> spinach<00:00:48.190> leaves

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
the chlorophyll from some spinach leaves

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.970 
the chlorophyll from some spinach leaves
because<00:00:49.180> it's<00:00:49.330> what<00:00:49.510> I<00:00:49.540> had<00:00:49.840> at<00:00:50.080> hand<00:00:50.380> I'm

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
because it's what I had at hand I'm

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.640 
because it's what I had at hand I'm
going<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.400> add<00:00:51.580> the<00:00:52.000> spinach<00:00:52.240> leaves<00:00:52.450> to<00:00:53.440> some

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
going to add the spinach leaves to some

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.130 
going to add the spinach leaves to some
ethanol<00:00:54.130> but<00:00:54.670> you<00:00:54.820> can<00:00:55.000> use<00:00:55.180> any<00:00:55.390> alcohol<00:00:55.960> that

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
ethanol but you can use any alcohol that

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.160 
ethanol but you can use any alcohol that
you<00:00:56.290> want<00:00:56.530> I<00:00:56.860> am<00:00:57.340> using<00:00:57.550> an<00:00:57.760> alcohol<00:00:57.940> as<00:00:58.630> the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
you want I am using an alcohol as the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.040 
you want I am using an alcohol as the
solvent<00:00:59.710> because<00:01:00.300> alcohols<00:01:01.300> are<00:01:01.510> less<00:01:01.690> polar

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
solvent because alcohols are less polar

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.380 
solvent because alcohols are less polar
than<00:01:02.290> water<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.829> they<00:01:03.310> are<00:01:03.610> able<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:04.089> dissolve

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
than water and they are able to dissolve

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.929 
than water and they are able to dissolve
chlorophyll<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.439> continue<00:01:06.250> along<00:01:06.549> with<00:01:06.759> our

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
chlorophyll to continue along with our

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.330 
chlorophyll to continue along with our
biology<00:01:07.509> lesson<00:01:07.900> there<00:01:08.409> are<00:01:08.560> actually<00:01:09.039> four

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
biology lesson there are actually four

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.649 
biology lesson there are actually four
different<00:01:09.369> types<00:01:09.939> of<00:01:10.119> chlorophyll

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
different types of chlorophyll

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.910 
different types of chlorophyll

chlorophyll a B C and D the chlorophyll

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.489 
chlorophyll a B C and D the chlorophyll
molecules<00:01:15.609> differ<00:01:15.969> in<00:01:16.329> the<00:01:16.840> placement<00:01:17.380> of

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
molecules differ in the placement of

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:20.789 
molecules differ in the placement of
atoms<00:01:18.219> throughout<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.700> molecule<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
chlorophyll molecules are found for

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.870 
chlorophyll molecules are found for
example<00:01:25.170> chlorophyll<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.409> is<00:01:26.829> found<00:01:27.219> mainly<00:01:27.520> in

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
example chlorophyll a is found mainly in

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.260 
example chlorophyll a is found mainly in
plans<00:01:28.630> as<00:01:29.170> is<00:01:29.710> chlorophyll<00:01:30.219> b<00:01:30.429> while

plans as is chlorophyll b while

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.840 
plans as is chlorophyll b while
chlorophyll<00:01:31.899> c<00:01:32.170> is<00:01:32.439> found<00:01:32.740> in<00:01:32.920> algae<00:01:33.609> and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
chlorophyll c is found in algae and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.959 
chlorophyll c is found in algae and
chlorophyll<00:01:34.600> d<00:01:34.929> is<00:01:35.200> found<00:01:35.679> in<00:01:35.969> cyanobacteria

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
chlorophyll d is found in cyanobacteria

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.449 
chlorophyll d is found in cyanobacteria
however<00:01:37.569> all<00:01:37.990> four<00:01:38.649> of<00:01:38.679> these<00:01:38.859> chlorophyll

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459 
however all four of these chlorophyll

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.120 
however all four of these chlorophyll
molecules<00:01:40.060> contain<00:01:40.479> one<00:01:41.079> common<00:01:41.560> functional

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
molecules contain one common functional

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.149 
molecules contain one common functional
group<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.579> chlorine<00:01:43.359> ring<00:01:43.749> and<00:01:44.079> at<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.770> center

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
group a chlorine ring and at the center

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.190 
group a chlorine ring and at the center
of<00:01:45.189> this<00:01:45.340> chlorine<00:01:45.729> ring<00:01:46.090> there<00:01:46.689> is<00:01:46.719> a

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
of this chlorine ring there is a

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.580 
of this chlorine ring there is a
magnesium<00:01:47.649> ion<00:01:48.340> okay<00:01:49.209> you<00:01:50.079> should<00:01:50.259> now<00:01:50.409> be

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
magnesium ion okay you should now be

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.959 
magnesium ion okay you should now be
able<00:01:50.709> to<00:01:50.859> see<00:01:51.069> that<00:01:51.189> the<00:01:51.340> solvent<00:01:51.639> is

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
able to see that the solvent is

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.269 
able to see that the solvent is
beginning<00:01:52.389> to<00:01:52.539> turn<00:01:52.689> a<00:01:52.990> light<00:01:53.319> green<00:01:53.649> color<00:01:53.979> as

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:54.279 
beginning to turn a light green color as

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:56.639 
beginning to turn a light green color as
you<00:01:54.639> can<00:01:54.759> see<00:01:54.999> this<00:01:55.420> spinach<00:01:55.899> leaf<00:01:56.170> has<00:01:56.409> turned

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
you can see this spinach leaf has turned

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.399 
you can see this spinach leaf has turned
completely<00:01:56.859> white<00:01:57.810> except<00:01:58.810> for<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.139> bottom

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
completely white except for the bottom

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.589 
completely white except for the bottom
portion<00:01:59.799> which<00:02:00.159> I<00:02:00.340> left<00:02:00.609> to<00:02:01.119> show<00:02:01.329> you<00:02:01.389> what

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
portion which I left to show you what

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:04.359 
portion which I left to show you what
the<00:02:01.749> original<00:02:02.229> color<00:02:02.469> looks<00:02:02.829> like

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
the original color looks like

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.690 
the original color looks like
now<00:02:05.030> you're<00:02:05.810> probably<00:02:06.079> wondering<00:02:06.740> what<00:02:07.399> can<00:02:07.609> I

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
now you're probably wondering what can I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.300 
now you're probably wondering what can I
do<00:02:07.759> with<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:08.300> chlorophyll<00:02:08.959> extract<00:02:09.590> well

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
do with this chlorophyll extract well
