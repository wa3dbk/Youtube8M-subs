Hello and welcome in another episode of Czajnikowy

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.990
Today, upon your wish, we'll show you how to make Matcha milkshake. Stay with us.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.990
Tips and opinions, yerba mate

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Tests, brewing tea

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.990
To prepare matcha milkshake we'll obviously need matcha, we talked about it earlier.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Powdered Japanese green tea. Next, milk. What we've got here is cow milk, full fat,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.990
and also some cane syrup. We like this one and there's no sense to use citrus or other flavours here,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.990
matcha alone has a very clear, distinctive taste, it's just going to sweeten all up.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.990
We're going to make it in the shaker. So let's start!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.990
The syrup goes in, 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
some milk,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.990
and a little matcha. You can use a smaller amount here, it will be stronger if you take more

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but even a small amount will give a lovely green colour to our drink.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.990
And now we need to shake it all up.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.990
You need to shake it for a while, maybe half a minute or so.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.990
If you like it very cold, then you can add some ice to it, to make it all nice and cold.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.990
We're doing it just cooled down but not iced. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But this kind of cold shake can give you a nice refreshment, as well.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And it's done!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Lovely green matcha milkshake.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.990
Delightful. I can taste green tea very intensely.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.990
It will boost your energy, it's sweet and milky, really fantastic.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I highly recommend this delicious matcha milkshake to all of you, guys.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
That's all for now! Experiment with matcha cause it's a very forgiving product to use, so have fun with it.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.990
It comes out great, especially sweet. Make sure you visit our website Czajnikowy.pl

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and see you in the next episodes!
