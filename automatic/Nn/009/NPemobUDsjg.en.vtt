digital zoom so as digital zoom you take
the<00:00:23.990> photo<00:00:24.200> and<00:00:24.710> if<00:00:25.160> you<00:00:25.340> enlarge<00:00:26.029> it

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
the photo and if you enlarge it

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.909 
the photo and if you enlarge it
basically<00:00:26.570> just<00:00:26.660> takes<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.050> same<00:00:27.199> photo<00:00:27.470> and

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
basically just takes the same photo and

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.459 
basically just takes the same photo and
gets<00:00:28.400> a<00:00:28.489> bit<00:00:28.610> closer<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.449> it<00:00:29.720> can<00:00:29.900> end<00:00:30.079> up<00:00:30.259> quite

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:30.469 
gets a bit closer so it can end up quite

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:33.459 
gets a bit closer so it can end up quite
pixelated<00:00:30.980> optical<00:00:31.640> zoom<00:00:31.669> actually<00:00:32.469> focuses

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
pixelated optical zoom actually focuses

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.080 
pixelated optical zoom actually focuses
in<00:00:33.590> on<00:00:33.649> a<00:00:33.710> very<00:00:34.070> specific<00:00:34.280> area<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:34.969> then

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
in on a very specific area and then

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.060 
in on a very specific area and then
greens<00:00:35.510> that<00:00:35.690> lens<00:00:35.870> forward<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:36.649> you<00:00:36.710> get<00:00:36.920> bit

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
greens that lens forward so you get bit

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.479 
greens that lens forward so you get bit
of<00:00:37.190> pictures<00:00:37.460> as<00:00:37.610> a<00:00:37.640> result<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:38.329> now<00:00:39.460> before<00:00:40.460> I

looked at shiny shiny on it I've seen a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.160 
looked at shiny shiny on it I've seen a
lot<00:01:13.130> that<00:01:13.610> always<00:01:13.820> looking<00:01:14.270> at<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.750> the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
lot that always looking at and the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.840 
lot that always looking at and the
internet<00:01:15.500> on<00:01:15.620> mobiles<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.310> it's<00:01:16.430> not<00:01:16.640> great

camera editing for things like anti-red

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.000 
camera editing for things like anti-red
are<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.480> can<00:02:30.629> add<00:02:30.750> frames<00:02:31.079> you<00:02:31.349> have<00:02:31.530> text

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
are you can add frames you have text

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.850 
are you can add frames you have text
things<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:34.319> can<00:02:34.440> also<00:02:34.590> take

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
things like that and you can also take

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.699 
things like that and you can also take
video<00:02:35.099> on<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.610> it's<00:02:36.209> 5<00:02:36.480> megapixels<00:02:37.140> it's<00:02:37.440> a

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
video on it so it's 5 megapixels it's a

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.069 
video on it so it's 5 megapixels it's a
three<00:02:37.920> times<00:02:38.129> optical<00:02:38.310> zoom<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:39.810> paper

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
three times optical zoom and so on paper

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.050 
three times optical zoom and so on paper
it<00:02:40.349> looks<00:02:40.379> like<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.709> really<00:02:40.920> good<00:02:41.099> camera<00:02:41.459> but

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
it looks like a really good camera but

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.240 
it looks like a really good camera but
it's<00:02:42.750> still<00:02:42.989> not<00:02:43.170> quite<00:02:43.319> good<00:02:43.560> enough<00:02:43.620> I'd<00:02:44.010> say

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
it's still not quite good enough I'd say

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.949 
it's still not quite good enough I'd say
to<00:02:44.310> replace<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.030> digital<00:02:45.420> camera<00:02:45.540> which<00:02:45.840> is

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
to replace the digital camera which is

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.119 
to replace the digital camera which is
annoying<00:02:46.140> because<00:02:46.349> I<00:02:46.500> really<00:02:46.739> wanted<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.069> to

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
annoying because I really wanted it to

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.330 
annoying because I really wanted it to
be<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.849> I'm<00:02:48.390> sorry<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:49.109> not<00:02:49.319> for<00:02:50.010> all<00:02:50.129> that

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
be but I'm sorry it's not for all that

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.190 
be but I'm sorry it's not for all that
even<00:02:51.060> without<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.390> camera<00:02:51.690> it's<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.959> really

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
even without the camera it's a really

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.789 
even without the camera it's a really
really<00:02:52.440> nice<00:02:52.650> phone<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.609> certainly<00:02:54.769> one<00:02:55.769> of

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
really nice phone and certainly one of

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.920 
really nice phone and certainly one of
my<00:02:56.220> top<00:02:57.590> seven<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.859> year
