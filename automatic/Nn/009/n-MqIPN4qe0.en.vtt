ion<00:02:21.590> battery<00:02:22.150> 61<00:02:23.260> x<00:02:24.260> 52<00:02:24.890> by<00:02:25.070> 12<00:02:25.550> millimeter

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
ion battery 61 x 52 by 12 millimeter

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.300 
ion battery 61 x 52 by 12 millimeter
that's<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.900> dimensions<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.590> this<00:02:27.890> product

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
that's the dimensions of this product

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.180 
that's the dimensions of this product
and<00:02:30.550> it's<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.990> capacity<00:02:32.990> is<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.200> thousand

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
and it's a capacity is a thousand

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.770 
and it's a capacity is a thousand
megahertz<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.740> it's<00:02:36.740> only<00:02:36.890> 40<00:02:37.610> grams<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
megahertz so it's only 40 grams the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.750 
megahertz so it's only 40 grams the
weight<00:02:38.959> is<00:02:39.140> 40<00:02:39.470> grams<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:43.010> feet<00:02:43.250> comes

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
weight is 40 grams and the feet comes

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.050 
weight is 40 grams and the feet comes
with<00:02:43.940> this<00:02:44.120> silicon<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.930> cover<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.380> up<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.060> no

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
with this silicon to cover it up so no

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.890 
with this silicon to cover it up so no
dust<00:02:47.360> or<00:02:47.690> whatnot<00:02:48.260> can<00:02:48.650> get<00:02:48.830> into<00:02:49.070> it<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.900> we

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
dust or whatnot can get into it and we

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.860 
dust or whatnot can get into it and we
have<00:02:51.140> here<00:02:51.739> this<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:52.940> basically<00:02:53.420> if<00:02:53.660> there's
