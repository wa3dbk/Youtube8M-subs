00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.670 
hi I'm a lassie and I'm teaching people
in<00:00:05.120> metal<00:00:05.180> shaping<00:00:05.630> and<00:00:05.990> I'm<00:00:06.109> back<00:00:06.290> here<00:00:06.319> on

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
in metal shaping and I'm back here on

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.860 
in metal shaping and I'm back here on
YouTube<00:00:07.100> with<00:00:07.370> tips<00:00:07.970> and<00:00:08.180> tricks<00:00:08.360> again<00:00:08.660> and

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
YouTube with tips and tricks again and

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.390 
YouTube with tips and tricks again and
for<00:00:09.860> this<00:00:09.949> video<00:00:10.190> we<00:00:10.610> have<00:00:10.760> something<00:00:11.299> a

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
for this video we have something a

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.369 
for this video we have something a
little<00:00:13.400> unique<00:00:13.610> I<00:00:14.059> think<00:00:14.449> it<00:00:14.779> can<00:00:14.959> be<00:00:14.990> a<00:00:15.080> good

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
little unique I think it can be a good

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.170 
little unique I think it can be a good
thing<00:00:15.590> for<00:00:15.650> you<00:00:16.039> to<00:00:16.219> see<00:00:16.400> how<00:00:16.640> that<00:00:16.880> we<00:00:17.000> can

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
thing for you to see how that we can

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.550 
thing for you to see how that we can
that<00:00:17.600> it<00:00:17.750> can<00:00:17.870> be<00:00:17.960> done<00:00:18.140> in<00:00:18.290> the<00:00:18.380> bead<00:00:18.530> roller

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
that it can be done in the bead roller

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.800 
that it can be done in the bead roller
and<00:00:19.540> I<00:00:20.740> had<00:00:21.740> an<00:00:21.890> idea<00:00:22.460> about<00:00:22.610> that<00:00:22.970> it<00:00:23.300> could<00:00:23.600> be

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
and I had an idea about that it could be

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.510 
and I had an idea about that it could be
done<00:00:24.080> in<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.410> bead<00:00:24.680> roller<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:25.250> I<00:00:25.340> thought

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
done in the bead roller and I thought

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.270 
done in the bead roller and I thought
about<00:00:25.730> it<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:26.180> I<00:00:26.300> you<00:00:26.810> know<00:00:26.930> I<00:00:26.960> can't<00:00:27.830> do<00:00:28.010> this

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
about it and I you know I can't do this

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.499 
about it and I you know I can't do this
and<00:00:29.289> so<00:00:30.289> I<00:00:30.320> needed<00:00:30.800> some<00:00:31.130> injector<00:00:31.730> stacks<00:00:32.059> for

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
and so I needed some injector stacks for

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.770 
and so I needed some injector stacks for
for<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.260> Chevy<00:00:33.500> small-block<00:00:33.829> and<00:00:34.370> I<00:00:35.329> want<00:00:35.570> to

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
for the Chevy small-block and I want to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.910 
for the Chevy small-block and I want to
make<00:00:36.050> this<00:00:36.739> flare<00:00:37.190> on<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.900> injectors<00:00:38.900> and<00:00:39.110> I

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
make this flare on the injectors and I

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.819 
make this flare on the injectors and I
needed<00:00:40.280> those<00:00:40.970> and<00:00:41.420> I<00:00:41.899> thought<00:00:42.110> about<00:00:42.470> that<00:00:42.680> it

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
needed those and I thought about that it

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.940 
needed those and I thought about that it
will<00:00:43.250> work<00:00:43.520> in<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.790> bead<00:00:43.970> roller<00:00:44.149> and<00:00:44.680> I<00:00:45.680> did<00:00:45.920> a

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
will work in the bead roller and I did a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.580 
will work in the bead roller and I did a
test<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:46.670> he<00:00:47.059> came<00:00:47.270> out<00:00:47.329> great<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.079> first<00:00:48.320> one

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
test and he came out great the first one

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.860 
test and he came out great the first one
so<00:00:49.370> let's<00:00:49.640> go<00:00:49.820> over<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.180> bead<00:00:50.329> roller<00:00:50.540> and

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
so let's go over to the bead roller and

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.290 
so let's go over to the bead roller and
I'm<00:00:51.110> going<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.380> show<00:00:51.530> you<00:00:51.559> how<00:00:51.800> to<00:00:51.829> do<00:00:52.070> that<00:00:52.300> so

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
I'm going to show you how to do that so

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.990 
I'm going to show you how to do that so
I'm<00:00:54.050> over<00:00:54.260> here<00:00:54.530> at<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.800> bead<00:00:54.980> roller<00:00:55.010> now<00:00:55.640> and

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
I'm over here at the bead roller now and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.360 
I'm over here at the bead roller now and
I'm<00:00:56.270> going<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.540> show<00:00:56.840> you<00:00:56.899> how<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:57.350> make<00:00:57.980> this

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
I'm going to show you how to make this

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.090 
I'm going to show you how to make this
injector<00:00:59.120> stack<00:00:59.570> or<00:00:59.960> if<00:01:00.440> it's<00:01:00.620> something<00:01:00.800> else

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
injector stack or if it's something else

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.740 
injector stack or if it's something else
that<00:01:01.309> you<00:01:01.399> would<00:01:01.520> like<00:01:01.700> to<00:01:01.850> use<00:01:02.030> it<00:01:02.210> for<00:01:02.450> that's

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
that you would like to use it for that's

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.160 
that you would like to use it for that's
up<00:01:03.079> to<00:01:03.260> you<00:01:03.410> and<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:04.219> want<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:04.790> inspire<00:01:05.569> you<00:01:05.959> to

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
up to you and I want to inspire you to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.379 
up to you and I want to inspire you to
think<00:01:06.200> outside<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:06.979> box<00:01:07.249> what<00:01:07.639> what<00:01:07.939> else<00:01:08.090> can

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:08.389 
think outside the box what what else can

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:10.660 
think outside the box what what else can
I<00:01:08.420> do<00:01:08.600> with<00:01:08.959> with<00:01:09.469> the<00:01:09.499> technique<00:01:10.159> that<00:01:10.399> last

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
I do with with the technique that last

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.980 
I do with with the technique that last
hit<00:01:10.880> teaching<00:01:11.569> here<00:01:12.020> on<00:01:12.170> YouTube<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.389> I<00:01:14.389> made

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
hit teaching here on YouTube so I made

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.099 
hit teaching here on YouTube so I made
those<00:01:15.229> rings<00:01:16.009> first<00:01:16.340> with<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.729> bead<00:01:16.999> and<00:01:17.329> I

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.109 
those rings first with a bead and I

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:20.410 
those rings first with a bead and I
didn't<00:01:18.799> had<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.039> die<00:01:19.219> that<00:01:19.520> was<00:01:19.700> small<00:01:20.090> enough

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
didn't had to die that was small enough

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.550 
didn't had to die that was small enough
so<00:01:20.719> I<00:01:20.779> need<00:01:20.959> to<00:01:21.139> make<00:01:21.289> a<00:01:21.649> little<00:01:22.219> smaller<00:01:22.639> die

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
so I need to make a little smaller die

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.410 
so I need to make a little smaller die
the<00:01:24.560> male<00:01:24.829> dime<00:01:25.069> that<00:01:25.100> goes<00:01:25.579> inside<00:01:25.789> here<00:01:26.029> and

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
the male dime that goes inside here and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.129 
the male dime that goes inside here and
then<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.109> female<00:01:27.350> eye<00:01:27.709> on<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.009> outside<00:01:29.109> so<00:01:30.109> I

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:30.139 
then the female eye on the outside so I

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:32.529 
then the female eye on the outside so I
did<00:01:30.349> those<00:01:30.560> first<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.159> that<00:01:31.189> is<00:01:31.490> pretty<00:01:31.729> simple

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
did those first so that is pretty simple

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.980 
did those first so that is pretty simple
to<00:01:32.689> make<00:01:32.840> in<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.170> bead<00:01:33.319> roller<00:01:34.060> but<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:35.569> part

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
to make in the bead roller but this part

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.870 
to make in the bead roller but this part
here<00:01:36.289> that<00:01:36.319> that<00:01:36.799> was<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.130> hard<00:01:37.369> part<00:01:37.459> and

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
here that that was the hard part and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.449 
here that that was the hard part and
before<00:01:38.569> I<00:01:38.599> thought<00:01:38.929> that<00:01:39.079> I<00:01:39.200> need<00:01:39.439> to<00:01:39.649> to<00:01:40.429> make

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:40.459 
before I thought that I need to to make

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.019 
before I thought that I need to to make
a<00:01:41.029> die<00:01:41.329> and<00:01:41.719> hold<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.439> in<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.889> stamping<00:01:43.579> it<00:01:43.789> or

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:44.029 
a die and hold it in and stamping it or

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:45.760 
a die and hold it in and stamping it or
putting<00:01:44.359> in<00:01:44.569> a<00:01:44.659> press<00:01:44.959> you<00:01:45.319> know<00:01:45.439> or<00:01:45.590> something

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
putting in a press you know or something

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.370 
putting in a press you know or something
like<00:01:46.039> that<00:01:46.279> but<00:01:46.549> I<00:01:46.759> had<00:01:47.569> a<00:01:47.599> feeling<00:01:47.899> that<00:01:48.109> it

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
like that but I had a feeling that it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.010 
like that but I had a feeling that it
could<00:01:48.409> be<00:01:48.709> done<00:01:48.829> in<00:01:48.889> the<00:01:49.130> bead<00:01:49.279> roller<00:01:49.539> so<00:01:50.539> I

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
could be done in the bead roller so I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.260 
could be done in the bead roller so I
had<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.770> combination<00:01:52.459> of<00:01:52.549> dies<00:01:52.759> that<00:01:53.209> is<00:01:53.419> half<00:01:54.349> a

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
had a combination of dies that is half a

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.379 
had a combination of dies that is half a
male<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.539> female<00:01:56.599> die<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:58.729> twelve<00:01:59.149> and<00:01:59.329> a

00:01:59.379 --> 00:01:59.389 
male a female die of the twelve and a

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:01.800 
male a female die of the twelve and a
half<00:01:59.419> point<00:02:00.109> five<00:02:00.469> twelve<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:01.189> a<00:02:01.249> half

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
half point five twelve and a half

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.440 
half point five twelve and a half
millimeter<00:02:02.810> radius<00:02:03.079> and<00:02:03.789> on<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:04.939> bottom<00:02:05.270> and

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
millimeter radius and on the bottom and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
millimeter radius and on the bottom and
then<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:06.200> one<00:02:06.469> on<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.739> top<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.899> I<00:02:08.899> thought

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
then this one on the top and I thought

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.570 
then this one on the top and I thought
that<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.740> could<00:02:10.070> do<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.550> this<00:02:11.270> way

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
that I could do it this way

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.330 
that I could do it this way
and<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.330> first<00:02:14.630> piece<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.470> made<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:16.010> think<00:02:16.040> it

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
and the first piece I made I think it

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.260 
and the first piece I made I think it
was<00:02:16.490> this<00:02:16.700> piece<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.570> came<00:02:17.930> out<00:02:18.080> nice<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.850> let's

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
was this piece it came out nice so let's

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.670 
was this piece it came out nice so let's
take<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.230> exhaust<00:02:22.010> pipe<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.730> just<00:02:23.230> make<00:02:24.230> one<00:02:24.470> so

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
take a exhaust pipe and just make one so

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.700 
take a exhaust pipe and just make one so
you<00:02:24.740> can<00:02:24.950> see<00:02:25.130> how<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.550> going<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.240> happen<00:02:26.710> so

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
you can see how it is going to happen so

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.470 
you can see how it is going to happen so
now<00:02:27.860> I'm<00:02:28.130> going<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.430> run<00:02:28.610> this<00:02:28.820> two<00:02:29.270> inch

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
now I'm going to run this two inch

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.860 
now I'm going to run this two inch
exhaust<00:02:30.080> pipe<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.980> make<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.270> flare<00:02:32.270> on<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.660> on

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
exhaust pipe and make a flare on it on

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.100 
exhaust pipe and make a flare on it on
this<00:02:33.410> end<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:34.090> we're<00:02:35.090> going<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.390> film<00:02:35.630> now<00:02:35.750> so

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
this end and we're going to film now so

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.260 
this end and we're going to film now so
you<00:02:36.170> can<00:02:36.440> see<00:02:36.710> from<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.160> side<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.670> goes<00:02:37.880> into

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
you can see from the side that goes into

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.500 
you can see from the side that goes into
the<00:02:38.810> machine<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.380> how<00:02:39.530> I'm<00:02:39.650> holding<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.160> and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
the machine and how I'm holding it and

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.510 
the machine and how I'm holding it and
here's<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.750> thing<00:02:42.050> is<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.320> I<00:02:42.770> learned<00:02:43.370> when

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
here's the thing is that I learned when

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.510 
here's the thing is that I learned when
I<00:02:43.580> made<00:02:44.030> those<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.190> couldn't<00:02:46.190> hold<00:02:46.370> it

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
I made those that I couldn't hold it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.850 
I made those that I couldn't hold it
straight<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.450> shaft<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.410> need

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
straight to the shaft like that I need

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.460 
straight to the shaft like that I need
to<00:02:49.040> hold<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.430> Lea<00:02:49.700> little<00:02:50.090> angle<00:02:50.480> like<00:02:50.630> this<00:02:50.660> so

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
to hold it Lea little angle like this so

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.590 
to hold it Lea little angle like this so
it's<00:02:51.620> actually<00:02:51.800> feeding<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:52.970> there<00:02:53.300> and

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
it's actually feeding it in there and

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.470 
it's actually feeding it in there and
I'm<00:02:54.500> also<00:02:54.680> using<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.280> little<00:02:55.430> more<00:02:55.670> pressure<00:02:56.090> on

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
I'm also using a little more pressure on

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:07.240 
I'm also using a little more pressure on
on<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.620> bead<00:02:57.800> roller<00:02:58.480> between<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.600> Dicer<00:03:06.250> so

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
on the bead roller between the Dicer so

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.670 
on the bead roller between the Dicer so
you<00:03:07.310> can<00:03:07.550> already<00:03:07.730> see<00:03:08.209> if<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.810> first<00:03:09.140> run

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
you can already see if the first run

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.030 
you can already see if the first run
here<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:11.270> it<00:03:11.600> actually<00:03:11.840> starts<00:03:12.320> flaring<00:03:12.709> out

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
here that it actually starts flaring out

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.580 
here that it actually starts flaring out
okay<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.700> I'm<00:03:16.760> forcing<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:17.390> little<00:03:17.930> more<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:18.530> I

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
okay so I'm forcing it little more so I

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.800 
okay so I'm forcing it little more so I
go<00:03:19.400> in<00:03:19.730> little<00:03:20.150> deeper<00:03:20.600> in<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:26.239> now<00:03:26.450> also

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
go in little deeper in and now also

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.610 
go in little deeper in and now also
lifting<00:03:27.440> up<00:03:27.650> my<00:03:27.680> hands<00:03:28.610> a<00:03:28.790> little<00:03:28.910> bit<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:30.380> gain

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
lifting up my hands a little bit to gain

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:38.860 
lifting up my hands a little bit to gain
a<00:03:30.680> little<00:03:30.890> more<00:03:31.070> flange<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:31.970> it

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.589 

so<00:03:39.530> let's<00:03:39.769> go<00:03:40.040> in<00:03:40.280> like<00:03:40.610> that<00:03:40.940> now<00:03:43.269> so<00:03:44.269> I<00:03:44.300> let<00:03:44.569> it

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
so let's go in like that now so I let it

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:51.729 
so let's go in like that now so I let it
rotate<00:03:44.989> in<00:03:45.500> my<00:03:45.680> hands<00:03:50.050> see<00:03:51.050> if<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:51.230> can<00:03:51.410> adjust

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
rotate in my hands see if I can adjust

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.199 
rotate in my hands see if I can adjust
the<00:03:51.890> pressure<00:03:52.069> a<00:03:52.370> little<00:03:52.400> more<00:03:52.730> because<00:03:52.879> what

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
the pressure a little more because what

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.110 
the pressure a little more because what
I<00:03:53.239> want<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.660> do<00:03:53.840> here<00:03:54.110> also<00:03:54.319> is<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:55.580> actually

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
I want to do here also is to actually

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.440 
I want to do here also is to actually
stretch<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:57.080> edge<00:03:57.519> more<00:03:58.519> on<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.940> edge<00:03:59.090> and

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
stretch the edge more on the edge and

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:10.120 
stretch the edge more on the edge and
less<00:03:59.690> less<00:04:00.019> the<00:04:00.379> further<00:04:00.620> in<00:04:00.799> I<00:04:01.010> go

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.400 

so<00:04:10.700> now<00:04:10.880> I'm<00:04:11.030> forcing<00:04:11.390> it<00:04:11.570> a<00:04:11.630> little<00:04:11.900> more<00:04:12.080> so

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
so now I'm forcing it a little more so

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.500 
so now I'm forcing it a little more so
it's<00:04:12.440> actually<00:04:12.800> going<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.610> little<00:04:13.910> more<00:04:14.180> on<00:04:14.390> the

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
it's actually going a little more on the

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.220 
it's actually going a little more on the
edge<00:04:14.630> there<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:19.180> if<00:04:20.180> this<00:04:20.480> is<00:04:20.660> what<00:04:20.840> you<00:04:20.989> want

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
edge there and if this is what you want

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.040 
edge there and if this is what you want
so<00:04:21.440> far<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:22.130> can<00:04:22.310> stop<00:04:22.580> here<00:04:22.940> if<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.660> want<00:04:23.900> the

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
so far you can stop here if I want the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:42.530 
so far you can stop here if I want the
more<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.350> continue<00:04:25.220> or

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.710 

so<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.380> see<00:04:43.590> I'm<00:04:43.770> almost<00:04:44.250> up<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:45.180> edge<00:04:45.450> on

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
so you see I'm almost up to that edge on

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.440 
so you see I'm almost up to that edge on
the<00:04:45.870> on<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.230> die<00:04:46.410> there<00:04:46.710> now<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:48.210> if<00:04:48.330> I

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
the on the die there now so if I

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.720 
the on the die there now so if I
continue<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:49.080> little<00:04:49.200> more<00:04:49.530> it<00:04:49.980> will<00:04:50.220> it<00:04:50.550> will

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
continue a little more it will it will

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.620 
continue a little more it will it will
go<00:04:50.790> there<00:04:54.170> so<00:04:55.170> I<00:04:55.200> had<00:04:55.440> yes<00:04:56.190> I<00:04:56.460> had<00:04:56.910> fun<00:04:57.150> again

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
go there so I had yes I had fun again
