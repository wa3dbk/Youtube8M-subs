00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.160
 Oh, what's the matter with people who tell me about 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.950
 we are in a new video this time is 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.580
 another tutorial but in this case we're going to 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.510
 solve problem of textures of 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.330
 harris mod 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.130
 Bryant who had told you that only 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.690
 I would fake a map well and the other three 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.050
 they have textures errors because 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.690
 we have the solution and well this is the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.780
 link of the download in the description 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:32.879
 to download the texture pack 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.289
 which are counter strike 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.469
 I hope they make it work so 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.659
 well let's start the whole and go 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.010
 there to start we have to go to 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:45.199
 link that I said we have the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.199
 description and it brings us here not 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.640
 we accept this and download once 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.140
 Discharged 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:00.800
 will give us this 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.370
 This dearest in winrar file and 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.129
 good 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.270
 we extract here the same one that does not happen 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.340
 nothing and once extracted that by the way 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.130
 I'm going to cancel it because this I do not 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.630
 and I do not need one I will 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.800
 leave for that because I'm going to equally 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.619
 I'm going to do the procedure so 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.330
 You will see how it is respected where we have the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.550
 vitalism me how do you ask 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.100
 desk because this is an access 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.790
 direct to be able to see it then we will have 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.039
 garries mod 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.979
 again apply rhythm and we're going to 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.800
 addons here as you can see I already have a 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.100
 folder once you have extracted 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.890
 the file folder with enter only 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.380
 you have to drag or copy and paste 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.619
 and once this is done, everything is done 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.940
 it's as easy as that is to download 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.590
 extract and drag to the folder is 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.539
 I repeat within the guerrismo return to 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.340
 put them in talons mod addons and what 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.429
 you leave there is worth here you have 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.259
 and good for you to see that it works 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.280
 we are really going to put a small 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.319
 part of a game but you will see me 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.459
 moving and you will see that I can go 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.300
 transforming the objects that I'm going 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.290
 finding so we'll see you right away 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.459
 and we're back in the game 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.110
 garries mod and let's try the maps 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.840
 as he had already said the only one 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.640
 it worked in the beginning it was this but 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.980
 let's start with office vale we're going to 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.680
 get in here and let's see if really 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.349
 It works, I bet because if yes, I do not 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.930
 you have done tutorial think it good in 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.370
 pasta where days are this and we say 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.580
 prox 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.150
 As you can see there are no mistakes and you only see 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.299
 well the textures are fine and good 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.769
 let's leave us 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.230
 we started to let the chairs fall 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.349
 but we can transform ourselves into a 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.800
 shelf we can transform into a 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.900
 table 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.110
 in a chair it was not shown to form what 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.340
 remove chair 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.340
 we see ourselves transform in 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.280
 we are going to form in a projector 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.840
 yupi and good to us as these are framework 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.890
 virtually all filers 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.500
 to catch a chair that are more 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.069
 manageable right now on a sofa too 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.409
 we can transform you but also 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:31.040
 We can affirmed us in the typical machine 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:33.530
 of soft drinks plus filing cabinets the sofa 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.349
 I'm stuck late 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.079
 stuck in the fucking couch goes up raisin 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.489
 for getting too close but good 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.349
 you see that this map all the victories 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.640
 they're fine let's try another one for 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.439
 that you see that it does not just work as if 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.140
 we did not know 3 the other two 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:52.540
 remaining we're going to get in here 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.540
 that start in the the 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.560
 we have to take plot and here too 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.970
 we see that the textures are fine now 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.370
 I have a curiosity that before in the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.370
 the tester is the bike reform 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.420
 I am now a bike as you see you 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.840
 Paint can transform after 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.250
 transform something product we 're going to 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.900
 form in a brick we can 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.389
 transform what we see here 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.340
 to transform a bottle 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.670
 it does not let me transform myself into a very 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.320
 rich 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.150
 frost 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.110
 the times before left me 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.110
 in a bottle of bleach 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.330
 it does not let me 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.770
 how strange that does not leave me 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:44.819
 now let me transform yellow 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.580
 after what the trash do not know if this 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:49.129
 bottle is alone you see it now like this 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.110
 as there are some bottles now I'm left 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:54.689
 it looks like there's a lot of trash 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.809
 he would not let me but hey 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:05:00.360
 as you see here also the texture is 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:01.919
 well it works fine all right we go 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.739
 transform what we see we want 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:08.839
 we can transform into this but if I 

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:08.839
 I transform long I would bet 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.969
 a melon 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:21.249
 a wheelbarrow 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:23.379
 we even trained in this and this 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:25.739
 we can transform ourselves into really what 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.739
 let's see 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:34.710
 and bunk beds but for example these and this 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.880
 also what is formed in almost 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:42.040
 everything there is so 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.960
 they transform me so good that the 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.710
 tire in everything but good we go 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.330
 also to try the other map so you will see 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.560
 which is not a matter of salary is a 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.710
 person faces all the maps 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.390
 functional the first map I already showed it 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.370
 in another video you have the video 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.870
 description and in the description of 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.350
 video that is in the description you have 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.350
 this video 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:10.250
 let's leave it like that 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.250
 and good 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.070
 this area 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.050
 mother 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.240
 let's see your hands 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.500
 what is this 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.500
 in the bottle 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.520
 very ugly but transformed into the 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.520
 little bottle in a barrel 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.140
 s 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:44.509
 I think we see is protect and we 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.099
 show what we want in the form 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:48.460
 car too but before he tried the 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:51.539
 lawyer and what happened 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.539
 in something from here 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:59.480
 I am a good rat and you see that they work 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.950
 all maps 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.710
 it also works in almost all 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.710
 objects I do not want to be I want that 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
 you 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:19.930
 good in all this not because it would be a 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.960
 very rare thing but in the things that yes 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.400
 normal and of your way 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.110
 then transform you stay here 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.150
 still and you're watching people go by 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.750
 I'm playing just repeats it 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:34.000
 memories and as you can see this works not 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.349
 there's more so we've liked that 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.240
 I have served you a lie that does not cost 

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:40.770
 nothing to subscribe but if it is the 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.770
 next video until next time
