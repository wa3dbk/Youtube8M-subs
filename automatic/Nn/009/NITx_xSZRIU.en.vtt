00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.799
 yes hello must be counted as 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.590
 arbours 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:15.080
 good evening I have to come get 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.910
 me cuma when can I 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.790
 spend tomorrow morning you're open or 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.250
 not good and ben ali I 'll be there 14 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.250
 hours yeah go 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.010
 if you are on the hedge farm 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.629
 then the farm of the bower is a 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.000
 old organic farms 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.070
 I am the third generation for 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.739
 so to say with a break in the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.790
 diagram there yal I resumed as a result 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.790
 already 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.140
 it's a farm that went away 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.920
 dairy processing in the years 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.540
 55 and organic agrium in 65 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.960
 so this is the first organic farm of 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.960
 department 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.010
 on this production not we 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.410
 turns about 100,000 said milk 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.020
 yoghurt curd dairy dessert the 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.720
 pigeons pass attaches a lot 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.950
 of importance to crop rotation 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.870
 to try to be the most autonomous 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.700
 possible on animal feed 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.990
 so that's an absolute reality a 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.430
 Autonomous bios is the key word the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.440
 presence of animals to make 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.970
 compost and cereals to use the 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.880
 compost and to give back to eat at 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.320
 animals is the virtuous circle 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.250
 otherwise on the feat of which there is 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.890
 several small workshops 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.110
 complementary that are hyper coherent 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.119
 including a small pig farm 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.360
 that values electrical waste 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.490
 so the whey there are some pots 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.440
 of layers that values ​​some of the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.479
 cereals and the other part of cereals 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.009
 so he's transformed on the exploit 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.960
 and it allows me to sell and the 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.869
 homemade flour and and make a small 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.490
 little bread - making on a Friday 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.670
 vast majority of products are sold 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.479
 the store on the farm 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.170
 the other part is communities 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.960
 will stay corporate 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.000
 and then the big surfaces of the corner and 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.220
 I insist that my tour of 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.080
 marketing is only 40 km 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.929
 here it is super important for me 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.400
 I do not pretend to transform 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.350
 all the milk I produce today 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.940
 that would force me to increase my 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.260
 distances of lio reason and that 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.060
 would become I think incoherent 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.830
 so there is a term that is commonly 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.650
 used by farmers 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.780
 it is I produce I transform and I 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.790
 sell and that yeah that makes sense 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.590
 it's really that aspect that I 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.370
 found really super interesting in 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.370
 the resumption of construction sites
