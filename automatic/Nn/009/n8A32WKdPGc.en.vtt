00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
it'll be sticky at first the longer it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.059 
it'll be sticky at first the longer it
sits<00:02:00.409> out<00:02:00.859> the<00:02:01.789> less<00:02:01.969> sticky<00:02:02.209> it'll<00:02:02.450> be<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:03.069> made

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
sits out the less sticky it'll be I made

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.899 
sits out the less sticky it'll be I made
24<00:02:04.669> of<00:02:04.819> these<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.529> divide<00:02:06.529> that<00:02:06.799> by<00:02:07.069> 24<00:02:07.639> because

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
24 of these so divide that by 24 because

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.760 
24 of these so divide that by 24 because
that's<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.239> whole<00:02:08.390> recipe<00:02:08.750> comes<00:02:09.410> out<00:02:09.619> to

that's the whole recipe comes out to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
that's the whole recipe comes out to
about<00:02:09.860> 86<00:02:10.520> calories<00:02:11.000> per<00:02:11.180> ball<00:02:12.580> alright<00:02:13.580> guys

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
about 86 calories per ball alright guys

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.350 
about 86 calories per ball alright guys
I'll<00:02:14.120> see<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.540> tomorrow<00:02:14.739> keep<00:02:15.739> training<00:02:16.010> and
