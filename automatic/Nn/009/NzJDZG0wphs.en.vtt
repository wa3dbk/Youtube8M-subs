00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
every time I'm on the run I feel like I

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.000 
every time I'm on the run I feel like I
can<00:03:33.390> place<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.840> ball<00:03:33.990> where<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.290> want<00:03:34.560> it

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
before I wrap it i feel the ball it's

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.090 
before I wrap it i feel the ball it's
really<00:03:42.270> having<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.660> long<00:03:42.870> path<00:03:43.200> in<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.680> air<00:03:43.800> and

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
really having a long path in the air and

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.860 
really having a long path in the air and
it<00:03:44.220> makes<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.610> more<00:03:44.760> difficult<00:03:44.940> for<00:03:45.360> they<00:03:45.600> open

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
it makes it more difficult for they open

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.740 
it makes it more difficult for they open
them<00:03:45.990> to<00:03:46.200> hit<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.920> balls<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.430> i<00:03:47.490> hit<00:03:47.760> deep

into<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:49.530> corners<00:03:50.010> i<00:03:50.790> can<00:03:51.240> also<00:03:51.390> play<00:03:51.720> it

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
into the corners i can also play it

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.570 
into the corners i can also play it
short<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.620> make<00:03:52.890> me<00:03:53.070> hopefully<00:03:53.370> run

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580
