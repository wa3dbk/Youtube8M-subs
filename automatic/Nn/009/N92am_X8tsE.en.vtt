 the greatest possible role for us 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.080
 this will be the case , for example 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.030
 of a patient by fixed 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.380
 steps a patient confused 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.210
 almost impossible 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.040
