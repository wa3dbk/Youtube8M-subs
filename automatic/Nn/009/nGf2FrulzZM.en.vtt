00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:09.110
 on microblog how are you going to find 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:14.450
 in leroy I do not know not but the material is 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.340
 This is you and if I bought this 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.130
 Create alert 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:28.779
 as I said here in the previous topic but it is 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.779
 that's the way it is, I have it with my hand 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.300
 This paper, the little one here, you take it out. 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:50.620
 for you could bag and behind is darn 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:50.620
 think a bag without good is here 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.980
 I have a small mdf disk that is 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.670
 that puts everything old 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.759
 to fill everything, but then I discovered 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.060
 that it is difficult even for you to take 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.649
 if you want colatto it is preferable 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.149
 paste only one piece 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:19.490
 this is a small disk where 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.579
 I got smaller the bigger it was 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:28.999
 this right here is 15 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:30.069
 but here a big is a big no bigger 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:35.780
 results 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:42.859
 this one is 20 and is already few of the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:46.929
 another legend sander is just getting there and 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:52.780
 because the piece is damaged by 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:02:00.409
 strong you put here 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:07.999
 just pointed out that I do not even use in 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:10.150
 several are here in this greater line here and 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.829
 all like this 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.590
 now how's the name is certain 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:18.109
 I know that Paul is easy people. 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.200
 find and here at leroy is also at 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:24.249
 usually not usually every time 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.269
 that I bought is in the 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:30.950
 tools 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:33.590
 it's there in the tool section. 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.659
 along with a nail and etc and such I do not 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.639
 I know if it's the same as an action by leroy in 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:42.650
 any place but this is there and there is 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:46.269
 the two male and female with glue 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:50.090
 just ask for several thicknesses only 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.340
 seeing that this one is thicker should 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.579
 have noticed it thicker and this here already 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.799
 acquiring finer than is equal to that 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.159
 that I understand in SÃ£o Paulo and are 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:05.000
 paulo with subtracts real a in leroy 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.980
 It cost 10 but you use very little right. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.669
 the amount that we are going to use a lot 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.669
 A little then I think you buy a 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:18.079
 10 reais and there it is 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:21.019
 or take a look at the internet 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:26.709
 I do not have the direction from where you bought it. 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:31.400
 I went there in the street, where you have the 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.769
 house of the mountains and other sao paulo more 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.780
 Yours truly do not have store directions. 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.709
 you can buy over the internet and 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.479
 telesales 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:56.930
 But the stuff is this right. 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:04:06.199
 and it 's good if I were Sao Paulo 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:08.389
 prove that you send it so you know 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:13.579
 someone who is worth the gasometer just ask 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:16.009
 to buy a veil with a sticker on 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:19.930
 israel with adhesive behind this ribbon 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.930
 White that has a sticker, that's it.
