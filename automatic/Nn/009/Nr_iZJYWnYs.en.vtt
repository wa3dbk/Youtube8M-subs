original long time ago well actually we

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.069 
original long time ago well actually we
swapped<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.520> an<00:01:41.670> nes<00:01:42.000> which<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> bit

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079

silly early singers our console was

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.639 
silly early singers our console was
fully<00:01:46.890> boxed<00:01:47.159> but<00:01:47.759> i've<00:01:48.240> got<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.930> now<00:01:49.229> which

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
fully boxed but i've got this now which

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.280 
fully boxed but i've got this now which
is<00:01:50.180> as<00:01:51.180> good<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.600> original<00:01:51.720> as<00:01:52.079> you're<00:01:52.200> going

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
is as good as original as you're going

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.090 
is as good as original as you're going
to<00:01:52.380> get<00:01:52.610> this<00:01:53.610> has<00:01:53.850> never<00:01:54.030> been<00:01:54.180> used<00:01:54.360> its<00:01:55.100> if

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
to get this has never been used its if

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.069 
to get this has never been used its if
you<00:01:56.219> look<00:01:56.399> at<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.579> how<00:01:57.360> crisp<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> poly

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
you look at the how crisp the poly

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.350 
you look at the how crisp the poly
inserts<00:01:58.530> look<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:59.070> completely<00:01:59.640> bagged<00:02:00.829> it's

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
inserts look it's completely bagged it's

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.240 
inserts look it's completely bagged it's
the<00:02:03.360> consoles<00:02:03.780> even<00:02:04.079> them<00:02:04.259> taped<00:02:04.920> up<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.189> this

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the consoles even them taped up in this

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.330 
the consoles even them taped up in this
bag<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.640> original<00:02:06.740> sort<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.799> scotch<00:02:08.069> tape

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
bag with original sort of scotch tape

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.059 
bag with original sort of scotch tape
that<00:02:08.459> holds<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> cartridge<00:02:09.720> lid<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.080> place<00:02:10.110> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
that holds the cartridge lid in place to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.490 
that holds the cartridge lid in place to
stop<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.489> moving<00:02:11.790> about<00:02:12.090> join<00:02:12.360> transit

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
stop it moving about join transit

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.360 
stop it moving about join transit
that's<00:02:13.620> all<00:02:14.510> basically<00:02:15.510> factoring<00:02:15.960> you<00:02:16.140> I

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
that's all basically factoring you I
