00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
lick the first part is all chromatic

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:12.890 
lick the first part is all chromatic
we're<00:03:06.010> using<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.459> same<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:11.010> arpeggio<00:03:12.010> and

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
we're using that same a arpeggio and

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.590 
we're using that same a arpeggio and
adding<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.959> tap<00:03:14.250> at<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.340> 17th<00:03:16.060> fret<00:03:16.330> and

adding a tap at the 17th fret and

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.320 
adding a tap at the 17th fret and
basically<00:03:17.410> moving<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.010> down<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.459> half<00:03:18.670> step<00:03:18.880> a

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
basically moving it down a half step a

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.979 
basically moving it down a half step a
half<00:03:19.630> step<00:03:19.900> half<00:03:20.530> step<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:22.630> goes<00:03:22.810> like

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
half step half step and it goes like

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:42.720 
half step half step and it goes like
this

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.100 

so<00:03:43.730> you<00:03:43.819> got<00:03:43.970> some<00:03:44.150> open<00:03:44.330> strings<00:03:44.599> in<00:03:44.959> there

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
so you got some open strings in there

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.649 
so you got some open strings in there
too<00:03:45.319> with<00:03:45.920> some<00:03:46.760> pull<00:03:46.970> off<00:03:48.400> at<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:50.090> end<00:03:50.299> of

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
too with some pull off at the end of

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:56.770 
too with some pull off at the end of
their<00:03:51.049> position<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:54.519> what<00:03:55.519> I<00:03:55.549> do<00:03:55.670> to<00:03:56.629> make

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
their position and what I do to make

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.259 
their position and what I do to make
sure<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:57.110> I'm<00:03:57.560> not<00:03:57.739> losing<00:03:57.849> you<00:03:58.849> know<00:03:58.970> the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
not you know my notes aren't going to

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:19.479 
not you know my notes aren't going to
die<00:04:09.829> out<00:04:09.859> so<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:16.989> rake<00:04:17.989> that<00:04:18.229> down<00:04:18.500> just<00:04:18.769> so<00:04:19.370> I'm

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
die out so I rake that down just so I'm

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.330 
die out so I rake that down just so I'm
like<00:04:19.729> starting<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.900> cycle<00:04:21.560> you<00:04:21.739> know<00:04:22.070> all

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
like starting the cycle you know all

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.230 
like starting the cycle you know all
over<00:04:22.400> again<00:04:23.380> moving<00:04:24.380> on<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:25.280> all<00:04:25.610> tap<00:04:25.940> lick

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
over again moving on to the all tap lick

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.529 
over again moving on to the all tap lick
with<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.840> string<00:04:27.080> skipping<00:04:27.669> its<00:04:28.669> string

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
with the string skipping its string

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.510 
with the string skipping its string
skipping<00:04:29.720> pulling<00:04:30.320> off<00:04:30.470> tapping<00:04:30.949> all<00:04:31.160> the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
skipping pulling off tapping all the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:42.469 
skipping pulling off tapping all the
stuff<00:04:31.970> combined<00:04:32.389> and<00:04:32.680> it<00:04:33.680> goes<00:04:33.830> like<00:04:33.889> this

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.570 

so<00:04:43.479> basically<00:04:43.900> what's<00:04:44.500> going<00:04:44.710> on<00:04:44.979> there<00:04:45.340> is

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
so basically what's going on there is

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.490 
so basically what's going on there is
you're<00:04:46.360> doing<00:04:46.509> pull<00:04:46.990> offs

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
you're doing pull offs

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.339 
you're doing pull offs
and<00:04:47.710> tapping<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:49.090> string<00:04:49.389> skipping<00:04:49.569> all<00:04:50.259> at

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
and tapping and string skipping all at

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:56.850 
and tapping and string skipping all at
the<00:04:50.440> same<00:04:50.620> time<00:04:50.889> and<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:52.530> last<00:04:54.150> part<00:04:55.289> the<00:04:56.289> the

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
the same time and the last part the the

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.059 
the same time and the last part the the
way<00:04:57.460> that<00:04:57.849> I<00:04:57.879> resolve<00:04:58.449> it<00:04:58.659> I<00:04:58.870> use<00:04:59.650> a<00:04:59.680> different

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
way that I resolve it I use a different

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:03.960 
way that I resolve it I use a different
rhythm<00:05:01.530> to<00:05:02.530> break<00:05:03.069> it<00:05:03.220> up<00:05:03.310> from<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.580> rest<00:05:03.789> of

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
rhythm to break it up from the rest of

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
rhythm to break it up from the rest of
the<00:05:04.449> lick<00:05:04.659> and<00:05:05.099> I'll<00:05:06.099> give<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:06.780> one<00:05:07.780> more

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
the lick and I'll give you one more

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:20.339 
the lick and I'll give you one more
example<00:05:15.870> so<00:05:16.870> adding<00:05:17.229> that<00:05:17.259> rhythm<00:05:18.150> at<00:05:19.169> on<00:05:20.169> the

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
example so adding that rhythm at on the

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:20.909 
example so adding that rhythm at on the
g-string

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
g-string

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.399 
g-string
to<00:05:21.190> resolve<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.759> lick<00:05:22.000> is<00:05:22.210> just<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.199> way<00:05:23.380> of

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
to resolve the lick is just a way of

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.730 
to resolve the lick is just a way of
breaking<00:05:23.740> up<00:05:24.039> the<00:05:24.099> rest<00:05:24.430> of<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:25.330> of<00:05:25.659> that<00:05:26.500> lick

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
breaking up the rest of the of that lick

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.980 
breaking up the rest of the of that lick
that's<00:05:26.979> section<00:05:27.490> and<00:05:27.699> I<00:05:28.449> thought<00:05:28.599> it<00:05:28.720> would<00:05:28.840> be

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
that's section and I thought it would be

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.279 
that's section and I thought it would be
pretty<00:05:29.590> neat<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:31.090> that<00:05:31.270> that's<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:31.990> end<00:05:32.139> of

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
pretty neat so that that's the end of

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.430 
pretty neat so that that's the end of
chasing<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.219> edge<00:05:33.310> solo<00:05:33.639> I<00:05:34.000> hope<00:05:34.990> you<00:05:35.110> enjoyed
