house new lab anyway I took our doorbell

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.170 
house new lab anyway I took our doorbell
apart<00:00:16.850> and<00:00:17.560> I<00:00:18.560> can<00:00:19.010> fitted<00:00:19.310> one<00:00:19.460> of<00:00:19.580> my<00:00:19.760> custom

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
apart and I can fitted one of my custom

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.170 
apart and I can fitted one of my custom
doorbells<00:00:20.540> that<00:00:20.779> happens<00:00:21.080> to<00:00:21.320> play<00:00:22.180> three

volts<00:00:28.880> AC<00:00:29.680> rectified<00:00:30.680> there<00:00:30.950> was<00:00:31.040> an<00:00:31.130> onboard

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
volts AC rectified there was an onboard

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.120 
volts AC rectified there was an onboard
audio<00:00:31.759> amplifier<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:33.410> so<00:00:33.560> what<00:00:33.710> I<00:00:33.739> did<00:00:33.829> was<00:00:34.070> I

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
audio amplifier and so what I did was I

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.160 
audio amplifier and so what I did was I
took<00:00:34.250> one<00:00:34.489> of<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:34.640> doorbell<00:00:35.020> modules<00:00:36.020> you

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
took one of the doorbell modules you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.510 
took one of the doorbell modules you
can't<00:00:36.410> see<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:36.710> very<00:00:36.829> well<00:00:36.950> probably<00:00:37.250> in<00:00:37.430> this

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
can't see it very well probably in this

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.760 
can't see it very well probably in this
horrible<00:00:38.000> lighting<00:00:38.180> but<00:00:39.050> that's<00:00:39.410> right<00:00:39.590> here

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
horrible lighting but that's right here

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.770 
horrible lighting but that's right here
so<00:00:39.890> I<00:00:39.950> can<00:00:40.010> interchange<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:40.790> chip<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:41.270> make

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
so I can interchange the chip and make

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.020 
so I can interchange the chip and make
any<00:00:42.050> doorbell<00:00:42.530> I<00:00:42.710> want<00:00:43.010> extremely<00:00:43.670> easily

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
any doorbell I want extremely easily

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.090 
any doorbell I want extremely easily
just<00:00:44.180> by<00:00:44.270> popping<00:00:44.510> in<00:00:44.780> a<00:00:44.840> new<00:00:44.960> chip<00:00:45.230> there's<00:00:45.950> a

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
just by popping in a new chip there's a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.840 
just by popping in a new chip there's a
five<00:00:46.340> volt<00:00:46.520> regulator<00:00:46.850> on<00:00:47.090> a<00:00:47.240> heatsink

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
five volt regulator on a heatsink

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.730 
five volt regulator on a heatsink
I'm<00:00:49.850> going<00:00:50.060> to<00:00:50.120> add<00:00:50.240> this<00:00:50.450> to<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.960> doorbell

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
I'm going to add this to the doorbell

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.940 
I'm going to add this to the doorbell
switch<00:00:52.130> and<00:00:52.520> when<00:00:53.300> those<00:00:53.420> contacts<00:00:53.930> make<00:00:54.170> when

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
switch and when those contacts make when

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.140 
switch and when those contacts make when
those<00:00:55.100> contacts<00:00:55.520> are<00:00:55.730> connected<00:00:56.240> the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
those contacts are connected the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.280 
those contacts are connected the
doorbell<00:00:59.150> activates<00:00:59.600> I'll<00:00:59.780> give<00:00:59.930> it<00:01:00.020> a<00:01:00.110> minute

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
doorbell activates I'll give it a minute

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.440 
doorbell activates I'll give it a minute
when<00:01:00.890> I<00:01:00.920> hook<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:01.190> up<00:01:01.310> those<00:01:01.910> two<00:01:02.090> wires<00:01:02.270> right

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
when I hook it up those two wires right

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.280 
when I hook it up those two wires right
here<00:01:02.510> are<00:01:02.870> for<00:01:03.079> 22<00:01:03.560> volts<00:01:03.739> ac<00:01:04.720> it's<00:01:05.720> rectified

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
here are for 22 volts ac it's rectified

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.960 
here are for 22 volts ac it's rectified
and<00:01:06.560> step<00:01:06.829> down<00:01:07.659> by<00:01:08.659> this<00:01:09.579> LM<00:01:10.579> two<00:01:10.759> five<00:01:10.939> nine

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
and step down by this LM two five nine

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.999 
and step down by this LM two five nine
eight<00:01:11.299> step-down<00:01:11.630> converter<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.409> those<00:01:12.560> those

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
eight step-down converter so those those

there's the 0.5 watt 8 ohm speaker so

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.800 
there's the 0.5 watt 8 ohm speaker so
I'm<00:01:19.700> going<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.880> go<00:01:19.970> set<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.270> up<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.600> give<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:20.780> a

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
I'm going to go set it up and give you a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.780 
I'm going to go set it up and give you a
demonstration<00:01:20.960> okay<00:01:21.830> just<00:01:22.159> to<00:01:22.250> cluster<00:01:22.670> of

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
demonstration okay just to cluster of

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.700 
demonstration okay just to cluster of
wires<00:01:23.000> but<00:01:23.420> what<00:01:23.600> I<00:01:23.630> can<00:01:23.810> do<00:01:23.960> is<00:01:24.140> I<00:01:24.260> can<00:01:24.320> replace

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
wires but what I can do is I can replace

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.000 
wires but what I can do is I can replace
the<00:01:24.920> chip<00:01:25.510> relatively<00:01:26.510> easily<00:01:26.830> so<00:01:27.830> what<00:01:27.950> I'm

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
the chip relatively easily so what I'm

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.010 
the chip relatively easily so what I'm
gonna<00:01:28.100> do<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.340> I'm<00:01:28.430> going<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.610> put<00:01:28.760> the<00:01:28.970> face<00:01:29.810> on

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
gonna do is I'm going to put the face on

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.630 
gonna do is I'm going to put the face on
it<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.380> I'm<00:01:30.620> gonna<00:01:30.710> go<00:01:30.860> side<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.310> bring<00:01:31.580> the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
it and I'm gonna go side and bring the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:48.100 
it and I'm gonna go side and bring the
doorbell<00:01:32.260> ring<00:01:33.260> one<00:01:35.440> two<00:01:39.400> three

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that last one isn't too loud I'm going

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.080 
that last one isn't too loud I'm going
to<00:01:51.600> reprogram<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.170> chip<00:01:52.260> to<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:53.400> all<00:01:53.580> sorts<00:01:54.030> of
