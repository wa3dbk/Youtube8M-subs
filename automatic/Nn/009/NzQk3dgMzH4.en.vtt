00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.940
 with short hair glasses that is there in 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:04.940
 that side 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.500
 We have been working together since I 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.660
 I have 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.670
 since I have 16 friends 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.670
 good for me 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.039
 is let's say as that example to imitate that 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.640
 woman 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.589
 that woman always said to the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.589
 that you can be saying 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.190
 if she says something that 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.070
 and there is no more 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.360
 at a certain moment he said I'm going 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.360
 to do a well-known sports 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:00.600
 it's a little French to her but difficult 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.309
 what are we going to do a palace of courteous and 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.790
 I said already see every software rose 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.790
 November 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.390
 when 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.990
 we were in that concert says 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:27.010
 and better 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:29.440
 and thinking what is 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.649
 and I say 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.950
 start 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.950
 and it tells me the best thing we're going to do 2 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.950
 and that's when I said 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:53.780
 I have trusted you for more than half 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.780
 life but at this moment I think it was 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.530
 it's making you feel bad 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:06.310
 we're going to have to start checking that 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:09.310
 which it has been not I now let 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.310
 we go 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.680
 please you're crazy but he told me 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.680
 Yes, well, here we are two days 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.430
 so keep picking up on it until 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.430
 that you 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.260
 good good 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.579
 and we are going to sing that what we are given 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.769
 well and we are going to delay this as I continue 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.430
 counting is that they are small things that 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.920
 you would never know the cons 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.980
 I would have never done two palaces of 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.090
 sports will not live would not have had 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.090
 value ever 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.870
 for her 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.740
 now 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.260
 but that lady 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.880
 ah 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.880
 3 let's let it be there 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.090
 we keep following what 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.090
 that those songs
