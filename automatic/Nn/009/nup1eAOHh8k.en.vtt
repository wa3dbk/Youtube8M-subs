00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.650
 people will then continue our 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.840
 studies on the origin of life 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.160
 we have already seen how the first 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.080
 Life forms 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.930
 we have already seen how the evolution of 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.730
 metabolism and personal now we will 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.669
 see how they were in fact the first 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.339
 cells as it is in the first living beings 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:31.939
 Well, do you believe that? 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.170
 environment generates enough we ask the 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.250
 first nascent life forms 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.059
 simple was actually unicellular joins 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.100
 means cell phone remembers cell or 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.520
 whether the first living beings were 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.350
 formed by only one cell but one 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.969
 which were complicating little by little the 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.550
 We know people from the first beings. 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.649
 they were procare 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.809
 that is, they arose very 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.730
 probably before a membrane that 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.960
 protects the dna that we call charge 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.699
 teak are these simple cells they are 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.130
 very similar to the bacteria that the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.040
 people know these days but in that 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.620
 then at that time one of two Andrew 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.710
 or she did not have a cell phone as 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.690
 It happens with bacteria nato materials 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.730
 current cells have a cell wall in the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.930
 house at that time probably not 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.510
 I had no cell phone and I do not know 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.070
 What is or is it simply not the membrane 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.030
 for mobile came from an event 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.590
 or personal injury she has lost so that 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.910
 to get these events over 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.580
 happening 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:42.620
 look how the cell appeared then 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.240
 eukaryotic cells or the cell that is more 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.400
 similar to the animal sky with cells 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.620
 from a room of its own 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.360
 logic is so simple right? 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.920
 Do you believe that the cell was 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.580
 more or less so had membrane 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.610
 dna cause is a dna 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.280
 dna circular molecule closed and 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:06.260
 that there were some roosters that do not have 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.550
 membrane than the case of ribosomes in 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.849
 some moment in the history of the planet 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.819
 land with the naked eye he began to 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.300
 scarce personal and this cell she 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.210
 started at 1 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.190
 has launched its membrane surface that 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.770
 believes in a clear that it is only a hypothesis 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.090
 but this may have happened to 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.800
 that it could increase the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.630
 surface of nutrient absorption 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.280
 available in the environment 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.110
 let's agree that this surface here 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.320
 she has much more contact with the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.980
 external environment than the one right here 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.440
 so tomorrow the content between 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.530
 cell in dna molecules to your name 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.240
 was inside got to the most space 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.640
 while these membranes were 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.950
 increasing this process 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.650
 remains personal for a long time 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.230
 It's until a moment has arrived that the dna 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.290
 limeira began to contain 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.520
 compartment in the middle between 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.480
 memories and believes that this 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.260
 compartmentalized 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.660
 to the core that we know 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.450
 today in the eukaryotic cells 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.300
 Sunday neckermann core was for you 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.100
 It's called technical failure. 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.459
 inside we will have material 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.580
 genetic guardadinho nÃ© and staff 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.739
 from this event here of increase in 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.360
 surface of the membrane has not only 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.220
 each key but also all other keys 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.860
 criminal organizations that we have 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.890
 in eukaryotic cells for example 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.260
 When was it ethical? 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.940
 There are two types of endoplasmic 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.070
 cuticle and proud of their 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.290
 Enjoyment has to meet and slide 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:51.420
 no, no, this would not be less 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.190
 region here several other organelles 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.989
 would have emerged as a result of 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.720
 For example, the lysosomes 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.209
 golgi organelas that there are no people 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.390
 to look for us where we are until today 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.760
 the bacteria does not have any type 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.500
 of organism menozzi with salvo 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.709
 very few exceptions such as the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.269
 ourselves are but these are scenes of 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.160
 next chapters 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.959
 so basically people are believed 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.260
 nowadays your car and others 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.610
 emerged from a pilot project 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.219
 ancestral 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.830
 were from Rio de Janeiro 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:32.639
 membrane teak loading event 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.330
 involves the dn the series people 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.330
 until the next
