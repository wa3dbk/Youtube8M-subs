of<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:33.820> second<00:01:34.690> night<00:01:34.780> we<00:01:34.810> could<00:01:34.990> cut<00:01:35.140> down<00:01:35.290> a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
of that second night we could cut down a

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.170 
of that second night we could cut down a
tire<00:01:35.620> I<00:01:35.890> mean<00:01:36.130> it<00:01:36.220> was<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.370> grainy<00:01:36.580> leading<00:01:37.090> and
