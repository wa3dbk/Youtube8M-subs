another<00:00:03.720> blender<00:00:04.259> tutorial<00:00:04.710> so<00:00:05.430> today<00:00:06.330> this

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
another blender tutorial so today this

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.660 
another blender tutorial so today this
is<00:00:06.750> part<00:00:07.049> three<00:00:07.379> of<00:00:07.410> our<00:00:07.680> vector<00:00:08.250> image

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
is part three of our vector image

thingy

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
thingy

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.509 
thingy
don't<00:00:13.469> really<00:00:13.650> know<00:00:13.799> what<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.009> call<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.280> and

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
don't really know what to call it and

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.799 
don't really know what to call it and
just<00:00:14.670> kind<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.880> came<00:00:15.150> off<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.450> bat<00:00:15.599> there

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
just kind of came off the bat there

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.760 
just kind of came off the bat there
probably<00:00:16.199> should<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.410> thought<00:00:16.500> about<00:00:16.560> that

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
probably should have thought about that

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.650 
probably should have thought about that
before<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.160> started<00:00:17.250> recording<00:00:17.520> but<00:00:18.029> whatever

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
before I started recording but whatever

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.080 
before I started recording but whatever
so<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.830> previously<00:00:20.789> edited<00:00:21.570> at<00:00:21.960> our<00:00:22.880> PNG<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.060> a

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
so we previously edited at our PNG to a

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.150 
so we previously edited at our PNG to a
JPEG<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.720> GIMP<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.230> did<00:00:25.680> some<00:00:25.890> fine-tuning

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
JPEG and GIMP and did some fine-tuning

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.470 
JPEG and GIMP and did some fine-tuning
with<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.730> then<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.060> took<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.359> into

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
with it and then we took it into

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.689 
with it and then we took it into
Inkscape<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.109> made<00:00:28.289> an<00:00:28.410> SVG<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.099> scalable

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
Inkscape and made an SVG a scalable

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.580 
Inkscape and made an SVG a scalable
vector<00:00:29.820> graphic<00:00:30.390> out<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.380> time

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
vector graphic out of it and this time

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.870 
vector graphic out of it and this time
we're<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.040> be<00:00:32.189> importing<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.820> into

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
we're going to be importing it into

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.790 
we're going to be importing it into
blender<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.809> last<00:00:34.200> time<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.380> left<00:00:34.559> off<00:00:34.680> with

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
blender so last time we left off with

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.170 
blender so last time we left off with
this<00:00:34.860> window<00:00:35.130> open<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.610> don't<00:00:35.670> need<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> do

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
this window open I don't need to do

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.310 
this window open I don't need to do
anything<00:00:36.329> else<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.660> I'm<00:00:36.719> just<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.140> close

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
anything else so I'm just going to close

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.280 
anything else so I'm just going to close
it<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:38.579> gonna<00:00:38.700> close<00:00:38.940> these<00:00:39.149> windows

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
it and just gonna close these windows

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.330 
it and just gonna close these windows
Explorers<00:00:40.290> I'll<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.710> minimize<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
Explorers I'll just to minimize the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.580 
Explorers I'll just to minimize the
amount<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.579> processing<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.210> my<00:00:42.300> RAM<00:00:42.510> um<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
amount of processing on my RAM um and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.990 
amount of processing on my RAM um and
now<00:00:43.770> we're<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.190> go<00:00:44.309> into<00:00:44.460> blender<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:44.969> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
now we're going to go into blender so I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
now we're going to go into blender so I
have<00:00:45.210> blender<00:00:45.510> open<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:45.840> my<00:00:45.930> default<00:00:46.260> your

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
have blender open at my default your

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.690 
have blender open at my default your
default<00:00:46.890> may<00:00:46.980> look<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> little<00:00:47.309> bit<00:00:47.460> different

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
default may look a little bit different

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430 
default may look a little bit different
than<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.020> start<00:00:49.140> off<00:00:49.289> in

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
than this I just like to start off in

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.930 
than this I just like to start off in
this<00:00:49.559> view<00:00:49.770> usually<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.520> these<00:00:50.640> settings

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
this view usually it with these settings

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.910 
this view usually it with these settings
so<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:52.050> don't<00:00:52.140> worry<00:00:52.320> if<00:00:52.590> there's<00:00:52.800> any

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
so but don't worry if there's any

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040 
so but don't worry if there's any
settings<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.370> need<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.149> set<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.600> will<00:00:54.899> be

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
settings that need to be set I will be

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.590 
settings that need to be set I will be
able<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.379> specify<00:00:55.620> them<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.570> with<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
able to specify them for you so with a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.810 
able to specify them for you so with a
clear<00:00:58.199> clean<00:00:58.620> slate<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.010> we're<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.699> go

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
clear clean slate here we're going to go

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.009 
clear clean slate here we're going to go
to<00:00:59.879> file<00:01:00.510> import<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:02.280> down<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.840> will

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
to file import and down here you will

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.990 
to file import and down here you will
see<00:01:04.229> scalable<00:01:05.010> vector<00:01:05.159> graphics<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.880> an

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
see scalable vector graphics as an

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.880 
see scalable vector graphics as an
import<00:01:06.299> option<00:01:06.570> now<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.200> isn't<00:01:07.409> an<00:01:07.560> import

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
import option now this isn't an import

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.770 
import option now this isn't an import
option<00:01:08.159> don't<00:01:08.430> worry<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.299> go<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> user

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
option don't worry if you go to user

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.240 
option don't worry if you go to user
preferences<00:01:10.409> add-ons<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.670> then

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
preferences add-ons and then

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.980 
preferences add-ons and then
import/export<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.210> search<00:01:15.630> for

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
import/export and then you search for

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.010 
import/export and then you search for
dot<00:01:16.820> SVG<00:01:17.820> or<00:01:18.000> no<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.509> guess<00:01:18.810> not

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
dot SVG or no I guess not

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.940 
dot SVG or no I guess not
maybe<00:01:19.560> SVG<00:01:20.900> yes<00:01:21.930> SVG<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.650> you'll<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:22.890> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
maybe SVG yes SVG so you'll see I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.140 
maybe SVG yes SVG so you'll see I
already<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> selected<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.850> but<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.060> you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
already have it selected here but if you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.429 
already have it selected here but if you
don't<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.630> checked<00:01:24.960> it'll<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.290> you

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
don't have this checked it'll be you

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.200 
don't have this checked it'll be you
know<00:01:25.530> slightly<00:01:25.860> lighter<00:01:26.130> gray<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.970> just

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
know slightly lighter gray you just

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.600 
know slightly lighter gray you just
select<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:29.250> might<00:01:29.369> take<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
select that and then it might take a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.830 
select that and then it might take a
second<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> load<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.450> your<00:01:30.509> computer

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
second for it to load on your computer

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.030 
second for it to load on your computer
depending<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.229> how<00:01:31.320> fast<00:01:31.500> your<00:01:31.680> computer<00:01:31.740> is

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
depending on how fast your computer is

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.399 
depending on how fast your computer is
then<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:32.970> click<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> X<00:01:33.390> button<00:01:33.720> or<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
then you just click the X button or you

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.390 
then you just click the X button or you
may<00:01:34.500> want<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.710> save<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.100> default

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
may want to save it as the default

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.090 
may want to save it as the default
depending<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.420> what<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.350> currently<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.799> in

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
depending on what you currently have in

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.249 
depending on what you currently have in
here<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.509> selected<00:01:39.810> then

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
here so now we have that selected then

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.719 
here so now we have that selected then
you<00:01:40.439> should<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.920> here<00:01:41.189> if<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.430> don't

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you should have this here if you don't

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.550 
you should have this here if you don't
you<00:01:42.090> may<00:01:42.299> want<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.720> different<00:01:42.960> build<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
you may want to get a different build a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.840 
you may want to get a different build a
blender<00:01:43.860> some<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.159> your<00:01:44.340> build<00:01:44.549> may<00:01:44.700> not

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
blender some of your build may not

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490 
blender some of your build may not
support<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.299> specific<00:01:45.869> script<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.439> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
support that specific script so you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.719 
support that specific script so you
should<00:01:46.680> check<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.369> main<00:01:47.520> website

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
should check that on the main website

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.370 
should check that on the main website
but<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> think<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.479> comes<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.020> trunk<00:01:49.320> so

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
but I think this comes in the trunk so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.289 
but I think this comes in the trunk so
it<00:01:49.560> should<00:01:49.860> still<00:01:50.100> work<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:51.090> we're<00:01:51.210> gonna

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
it should still work so we're gonna

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.330 
it should still work so we're gonna
click<00:01:51.509> import<00:01:51.899> scalable<00:01:52.619> vector<00:01:52.740> graphics

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
click import scalable vector graphics

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.340 
click import scalable vector graphics
and<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:53.970> we're<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.630> navigate<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
and then we're going to just navigate to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.260 
and then we're going to just navigate to
it<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.560> my<00:01:55.710> confusing<00:01:56.280> array<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.729> everything

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it in my confusing array of everything

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.889 
it in my confusing array of everything
and<00:01:57.420> you'll<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:57.960> here<00:01:58.159> woman-101<00:01:59.329> SVG<00:02:00.329> 3

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
and you'll see here woman-101 SVG 3

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.539 
and you'll see here woman-101 SVG 3
kilobytes<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.950> very<00:02:02.159> big<00:02:02.340> files

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
kilobytes it's not very big files

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.280 
kilobytes it's not very big files
because<00:02:02.939> they're<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.329> basically<00:02:03.689> packs<00:02:03.990> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
because they're just basically packs and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.289 
because they're just basically packs and
then<00:02:04.439> we're<00:02:04.530> gonna<00:02:04.619> click<00:02:04.770> import<00:02:05.130> SVG<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.880> it

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
then we're gonna click import SVG and it

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.340 
then we're gonna click import SVG and it
might<00:02:06.420> take<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.630> second<00:02:06.960> now<00:02:07.079> you're<00:02:07.200> probably

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
might take a second now you're probably

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.630 
might take a second now you're probably
saying<00:02:07.500> well<00:02:07.770> where<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.099> my<00:02:08.250> woman

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
saying well where is my woman

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.369 
saying well where is my woman
well<00:02:10.280> SVG's<00:02:11.280> by<00:02:11.879> default<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.690> Inkscape<00:02:13.200> are

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
well SVG's by default in Inkscape are

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.940 
well SVG's by default in Inkscape are

small<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.150> one<00:02:15.480> way<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.660> do<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.380> go

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
small so one way to do this is to go

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.140 
small so one way to do this is to go
into<00:02:16.650> Inkscape<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.310> scale<00:02:17.520> up<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.880> image

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
into Inkscape and scale up the image

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.760 
into Inkscape and scale up the image
until<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:18.630> really<00:02:18.840> big<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.260> then<00:02:19.349> import<00:02:19.680> it

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
until it's really big and then import it

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.960 
until it's really big and then import it
in<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.890> blender<00:02:20.040> because<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:20.580> it'll<00:02:20.730> be<00:02:20.849> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
in a blender because then it'll be the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.570 
in a blender because then it'll be the
correct<00:02:21.180> size<00:02:21.300> but<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.709> can<00:02:22.739> also<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:23.310> do<00:02:23.459> it

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
correct size but you can also just do it

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.070 
correct size but you can also just do it
in<00:02:23.670> blender<00:02:23.940> using<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.300> scale<00:02:24.569> option<00:02:24.959> so

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
in blender using the scale option so

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.610 
in blender using the scale option so
we're<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.230> gonna<00:02:25.380> scale<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:26.690> 505<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.230> I

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
we're just gonna scale this 505 and I

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.320 
we're just gonna scale this 505 and I
think<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.160> should<00:02:29.370> yeah<00:02:29.700> will<00:02:29.880> scale<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.120> one

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
think that should yeah will scale it one

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.420 
think that should yeah will scale it one
more<00:02:30.480> time<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.989> okay<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.160> then<00:02:32.190> we're

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
more time to okay so and then we're

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.699 
more time to okay so and then we're
gonna<00:02:32.580> move<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.970> origin<00:02:33.239> over<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:34.260> geometry

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
gonna move the origin over to geometry

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.940 
gonna move the origin over to geometry
and<00:02:35.160> then<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.330> selection<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.170> cursor<00:02:37.290> and

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
and then this selection to cursor and

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.550 
and then this selection to cursor and
now<00:02:38.370> if<00:02:38.640> we<00:02:38.670> tab<00:02:39.060> into<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.110> see<00:02:40.290> that

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
now if we tab into it you can see that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.430 
now if we tab into it you can see that
yep<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.160> full<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:42.180> like<00:02:42.239> an<00:02:42.480> Inkscape<00:02:42.959> it

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
yep it's full just like an Inkscape it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.830 
yep it's full just like an Inkscape it
is<00:02:43.739> full<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.400> paths<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.330> really<00:02:45.690> cool

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
is full of paths and this is really cool

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.870 
is full of paths and this is really cool
it<00:02:46.080> does<00:02:46.440> get<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> little<00:02:46.980> buggy<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.640> blender

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
it does get a little buggy and blender

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.670 
it does get a little buggy and blender
but<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.300> more<00:02:48.540> blenders<00:02:48.989> path<00:02:49.230> code<00:02:49.530> and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
but this is more blenders path code and

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.460 
but this is more blenders path code and
not<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.950> SVG<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:51.269> this<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> path<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.319> you're

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
not the SVG so this is a path and you're

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.840 
not the SVG so this is a path and you're
probably<00:02:52.560> saying<00:02:52.769> well<00:02:53.069> what<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.549> do<00:02:53.610> with

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
probably saying well what can I do with

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.520 
probably saying well what can I do with
this<00:02:53.970> yes<00:02:54.269> it's<00:02:54.450> here<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.900> maybe<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.410> could

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
this yes it's here and maybe I could

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.740 
this yes it's here and maybe I could
convert<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.280> mesh<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.819> extrude<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.480> but

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
convert it to a mesh and extrude it but

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.270 
convert it to a mesh and extrude it but
that<00:02:58.230> wouldn't<00:02:58.470> really<00:02:58.590> help<00:02:58.799> me<00:02:58.980> now<00:02:59.100> would

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
that wouldn't really help me now would

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.940 
that wouldn't really help me now would
it<00:02:59.310> no<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.510> wouldn't<00:03:00.840> but<00:03:01.110> we<00:03:01.350> can<00:03:01.590> convert<00:03:01.860> it

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
it no it wouldn't but we can convert it

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.080 
it no it wouldn't but we can convert it
to<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.069> mesh<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.400> do<00:03:02.489> something<00:03:02.790> else<00:03:02.910> with<00:03:03.060> it

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
to a mesh and do something else with it

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.509 
to a mesh and do something else with it
animate<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.620> what<00:03:04.950> we're<00:03:05.069> first<00:03:05.220> going<00:03:05.459> to

annoying<00:03:20.720> Z's<00:03:21.720> here<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:23.010> because

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
annoying Z's here and this is because

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.740 
annoying Z's here and this is because
it's<00:03:23.430> converted<00:03:23.910> at<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> old<00:03:24.269> fashioned<00:03:24.630> way

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
it's converted at the old fashioned way

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.810 
it's converted at the old fashioned way

which<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.299> new<00:03:27.510> modeling<00:03:27.900> tool<00:03:28.109> in

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
which is the new modeling tool in

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.259 
which is the new modeling tool in
blender<00:03:28.500> has<00:03:28.680> not<00:03:28.890> yet<00:03:29.100> updated<00:03:29.609> to<00:03:29.820> fix<00:03:30.120> this

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
blender has not yet updated to fix this

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.720 
blender has not yet updated to fix this
but<00:03:30.750> I'm<00:03:30.840> sure<00:03:30.870> at<00:03:31.140> some<00:03:31.200> point<00:03:31.380> they<00:03:31.680> will<00:03:31.859> now

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
but I'm sure at some point they will now

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.460 
but I'm sure at some point they will now
if<00:03:33.120> we<00:03:33.299> were<00:03:33.390> going<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.660> animate<00:03:33.959> this<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.380> add

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
if we were going to animate this and add

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.009 
if we were going to animate this and add
real<00:03:35.040> armature<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.420> make<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.870> all

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
real armature to it and make it all

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.710 
real armature to it and make it all
fancy<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:38.220> would<00:03:38.400> take<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.579> while<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.480> would<00:03:39.540> be

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
fancy it would take a while it would be

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.599 
fancy it would take a while it would be
annoying<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.709> we<00:03:40.859> would<00:03:41.130> probably<00:03:41.310> want<00:03:41.459> to

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
annoying and we would probably want to

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.729 
annoying and we would probably want to
go<00:03:41.670> back<00:03:41.850> in<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.390> know<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:43.109> read<00:03:43.260> all<00:03:43.500> of

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
go back in and you know to read all of

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.000 
go back in and you know to read all of
these<00:03:43.890> um<00:03:44.480> all<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.660> these<00:03:45.810> just<00:03:46.709> really

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
these um all of these just really

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.130 
these um all of these just really
annoying<00:03:47.370> edges<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.510> go<00:03:48.720> ahead<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:48.989> do<00:03:49.049> it

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
annoying edges and go ahead and do it

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
annoying edges and go ahead and do it
ourselves<00:03:49.230> that's<00:03:49.799> not<00:03:50.010> even<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.280> do<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.920> we

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
could do that you know go back and do it

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.449 
could do that you know go back and do it
manually<00:03:54.720> but<00:03:54.989> right<00:03:55.650> now<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:55.980> is<00:03:56.130> all<00:03:56.280> we

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
need just for a basic quick animation

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.039 
need just for a basic quick animation
just<00:03:58.590> show<00:03:58.739> you<00:03:58.799> all<00:03:59.010> what's<00:03:59.220> what<00:03:59.430> so<00:04:00.120> if<00:04:00.750> you

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
wanted to you could add an empty here

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.349

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
add plane accesses we're gonna go over

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.289 
add plane accesses we're gonna go over
here<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.549> we're<00:04:08.640> gonna<00:04:08.700> move<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.090> down<00:04:09.269> to

where the stand is they're going to go

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.150 
where the stand is they're going to go
into<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.609> hand<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:12.060> we're<00:04:12.569> going<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.840> Z<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.040> we

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
into the hand and we're going to Z so we

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.530 
into the hand and we're going to Z so we
can<00:04:14.280> see<00:04:14.549> in<00:04:14.670> wireframe<00:04:14.910> mode<00:04:15.120> we're<00:04:15.450> gonna

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
can see in wireframe mode we're gonna

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.240 
can see in wireframe mode we're gonna
press<00:04:15.780> C<00:04:16.019> we're<00:04:16.260> gonna<00:04:16.380> scale<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:16.859> up<00:04:17.039> and

this<00:04:42.730> empty<00:04:43.270> here<00:04:43.720> and<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:44.530> move<00:04:44.830> it<00:04:44.950> around

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
this empty here and you move it around

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.980 
this empty here and you move it around
you'll<00:04:45.910> notice<00:04:46.000> it<00:04:46.300> kind<00:04:46.420> of<00:04:46.540> picks<00:04:46.780> up<00:04:46.900> the

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
you'll notice it kind of picks up the

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.980 
you'll notice it kind of picks up the
hand<00:04:47.200> it's<00:04:47.410> not<00:04:47.530> very<00:04:48.520> clean<00:04:49.450> but<00:04:49.840> it

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
hand it's not very clean but it

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.230 
hand it's not very clean but it
definitely<00:04:50.380> does<00:04:50.500> work<00:04:50.530> so<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.760> can<00:04:51.910> also<00:04:52.030> do

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
definitely does work so you can also do

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.020 
definitely does work so you can also do
is<00:04:52.360> you<00:04:52.480> can<00:04:52.510> rotate<00:04:52.840> this<00:04:53.230> like<00:04:53.410> an<00:04:53.530> X<00:04:54.030> that

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
is you can rotate this like an X that

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.140 
is you can rotate this like an X that
works<00:04:55.960> yes<00:04:56.320> but<00:04:56.680> not<00:04:56.860> perfectly<00:04:57.400> if<00:04:57.640> we<00:04:57.880> want

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
works yes but not perfectly if we want

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.760 
works yes but not perfectly if we want
to<00:04:58.270> we<00:04:58.420> can<00:04:58.450> actually<00:04:58.600> go<00:04:59.020> back<00:04:59.200> in<00:04:59.380> here<00:04:59.620> and

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
to we can actually go back in here and

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.570 
to we can actually go back in here and
we<00:05:00.040> can<00:05:00.250> select<00:05:01.060> these<00:05:01.450> two<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:02.340> cursor<00:05:03.340> to

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
we can select these two and cursor to

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.120 
we can select these two and cursor to
selected<00:05:04.030> and<00:05:04.270> then<00:05:04.750> we<00:05:05.200> can<00:05:05.410> go<00:05:05.590> back<00:05:05.860> here

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
selected and then we can go back here

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.370 
selected and then we can go back here
and<00:05:06.310> delete<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.360> current<00:05:07.600> hook<00:05:07.870> it's<00:05:08.110> over

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
and delete the current hook it's over

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.750 
and delete the current hook it's over
here<00:05:08.530> no<00:05:08.650> modifiers<00:05:09.040> to<00:05:09.250> have<00:05:09.340> you<00:05:09.490> can<00:05:09.640> also

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
here no modifiers to have you can also

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.980 
here no modifiers to have you can also
just<00:05:10.000> do<00:05:10.120> this<00:05:10.210> directly<00:05:10.510> from<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.690> modifiers

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
just do this directly from the modifiers

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.800 
just do this directly from the modifiers
tab<00:05:11.200> but<00:05:11.950> I<00:05:12.340> just<00:05:12.730> do<00:05:13.000> it<00:05:13.030> the<00:05:13.330> old<00:05:13.540> way<00:05:13.660> I

tab but I just do it the old way I
learned<00:05:14.200> it<00:05:14.350> which<00:05:14.530> day<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:14.890> while<00:05:15.250> ago<00:05:15.550> so<00:05:15.880> that

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
learned it which day a while ago so that

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.030 
learned it which day a while ago so that
it<00:05:16.600> did<00:05:17.050> not<00:05:17.080> used<00:05:17.380> to<00:05:17.410> be<00:05:17.470> a<00:05:17.560> modifier<00:05:17.830> used<00:05:17.980> to

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
it did not used to be a modifier used to

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.070 
it did not used to be a modifier used to
be<00:05:18.160> a<00:05:18.190> sort<00:05:18.670> of<00:05:18.730> parent<00:05:19.120> entity<00:05:19.300> kind<00:05:19.840> of<00:05:19.900> thing

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
be a sort of parent entity kind of thing

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.240 
be a sort of parent entity kind of thing
so<00:05:20.770> I'm<00:05:20.950> gonna<00:05:21.130> select<00:05:21.280> these<00:05:21.520> back<00:05:21.730> and

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
so I'm gonna select these back and

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.230 
so I'm gonna select these back and
select<00:05:24.250> this<00:05:24.400> you<00:05:24.640> know<00:05:24.730> do<00:05:24.850> the<00:05:24.940> same<00:05:24.970> thing

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
select this you know do the same thing

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.530 
select this you know do the same thing
again<00:05:25.510> trol<00:05:26.320> h<00:05:26.590> click<00:05:27.400> to<00:05:27.610> selected<00:05:27.940> object<00:05:28.030> so

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
again trol h click to selected object so

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.880 
again trol h click to selected object so
now<00:05:28.660> if<00:05:28.780> i<00:05:28.840> go<00:05:28.870> back<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.110> my<00:05:29.200> selected<00:05:29.530> object

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
now if i go back to my selected object

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.770 
now if i go back to my selected object
it<00:05:30.010> should<00:05:30.190> do<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:30.640> more<00:05:30.910> natural<00:05:31.300> turn<00:05:31.540> with<00:05:31.750> it

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
it should do a more natural turn with it

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.670 
it should do a more natural turn with it
and<00:05:32.080> you<00:05:32.290> see<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.500> little<00:05:32.650> hand<00:05:32.770> there<00:05:33.130> oh

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
and you see the little hand there oh

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.790 
and you see the little hand there oh
sorry

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
sorry

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.890 
sorry
yet<00:05:36.220> so<00:05:36.460> there's<00:05:36.760> that<00:05:36.970> um<00:05:37.210> you<00:05:37.570> could<00:05:37.750> also

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
yet so there's that um you could also

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.960 
yet so there's that um you could also
wait<00:05:38.290> paint<00:05:38.620> this<00:05:38.800> hook<00:05:39.010> with<00:05:39.580> the<00:05:39.670> vertex

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
wait paint this hook with the vertex

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.930 
wait paint this hook with the vertex
group<00:05:40.330> you<00:05:40.630> can<00:05:40.780> do<00:05:41.440> weight<00:05:42.400> painting<00:05:42.790> where

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
group you can do weight painting where

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.330 
group you can do weight painting where
you<00:05:43.030> basically<00:05:43.210> just<00:05:43.720> paint<00:05:44.560> this<00:05:44.860> over

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
you basically just paint this over

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.190 
you basically just paint this over
that's<00:05:45.880> you<00:05:46.060> see<00:05:46.210> that's<00:05:46.390> the<00:05:46.570> problem<00:05:46.870> with

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
that's you see that's the problem with

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.020 
that's you see that's the problem with
them<00:05:47.410> having<00:05:47.890> these<00:05:48.070> vertices<00:05:48.700> not<00:05:48.850> be

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
them having these vertices not be

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.660 
them having these vertices not be
correct<00:05:49.360> is<00:05:49.600> that<00:05:50.280> really<00:05:51.280> what's<00:05:51.550> gonna

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
correct is that really what's gonna

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.910 
correct is that really what's gonna
happen<00:05:52.030> is<00:05:52.150> you're<00:05:52.930> gonna<00:05:53.050> get<00:05:53.290> this<00:05:53.440> weird

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
happen is you're gonna get this weird

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.850 
happen is you're gonna get this weird
thing<00:05:54.220> just<00:05:54.600> it's<00:05:55.600> not<00:05:56.110> gonna<00:05:56.260> look<00:05:56.500> right<00:05:56.710> it

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
thing just it's not gonna look right it

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.130 
thing just it's not gonna look right it
looks<00:05:57.040> a<00:05:57.160> bit<00:05:57.190> odd<00:05:57.490> I<00:05:57.850> see<00:05:57.910> I<00:05:58.060> keep<00:05:58.270> actually

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
looks a bit odd I see I keep actually

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.510 
looks a bit odd I see I keep actually
going<00:05:59.260> over<00:05:59.410> there<00:05:59.650> but<00:05:59.830> you<00:05:59.860> can<00:06:00.070> wait<00:06:00.220> paint

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
going over there but you can wait paint

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.770 
going over there but you can wait paint
it<00:06:00.610> and<00:06:00.700> then<00:06:00.820> use<00:06:01.000> the<00:06:01.150> weight<00:06:01.300> paint<00:06:01.570> to

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
it and then use the weight paint to

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.660 
it and then use the weight paint to
influence<00:06:02.440> how<00:06:02.590> much<00:06:02.620> this<00:06:03.040> will<00:06:03.190> affect<00:06:03.520> it

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
influence how much this will affect it

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.460 
influence how much this will affect it
which<00:06:04.090> makes<00:06:04.330> it<00:06:04.420> a<00:06:04.480> more<00:06:04.600> natural<00:06:04.660> bending

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
which makes it a more natural bending

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.140 
which makes it a more natural bending
you<00:06:05.890> can<00:06:06.040> also<00:06:06.160> add<00:06:06.340> an<00:06:06.430> armature<00:06:06.760> to<00:06:07.000> this

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
you can also add an armature to this

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.300 
you can also add an armature to this
which<00:06:07.510> will<00:06:07.660> make<00:06:07.840> it<00:06:08.020> just<00:06:08.740> move<00:06:08.950> more

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
which will make it just move more

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.190 
which will make it just move more
natural<00:06:09.790> and<00:06:10.390> use<00:06:10.540> weight<00:06:10.750> paints<00:06:10.990> with<00:06:11.080> your

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
natural and use weight paints with your

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.080 
natural and use weight paints with your
armature<00:06:11.410> as<00:06:11.560> well<00:06:11.800> that's<00:06:12.430> another<00:06:12.610> tutorial

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
armature as well that's another tutorial

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.000 
armature as well that's another tutorial
and<00:06:13.360> it's<00:06:13.450> self<00:06:13.660> armatures<00:06:14.140> is<00:06:14.320> a<00:06:14.350> big<00:06:14.680> big

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
and it's self armatures is a big big

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.530 
and it's self armatures is a big big
thing<00:06:15.040> that<00:06:15.340> i<00:06:15.520> could<00:06:15.610> not<00:06:15.880> cover<00:06:16.120> in<00:06:16.360> this

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
thing that i could not cover in this

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.860 
thing that i could not cover in this
small<00:06:16.990> tutorial<00:06:17.200> alone<00:06:17.770> alright<00:06:18.550> so<00:06:19.030> that's

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
small tutorial alone alright so that's
