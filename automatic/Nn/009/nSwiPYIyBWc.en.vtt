that i'm doing is has been been shaped a

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.310 
that i'm doing is has been been shaped a
bit<00:00:23.630> it's<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> bit<00:00:24.810> more<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:25.980> shaft<00:00:26.250> ready

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320

bit it's a bit more on the shaft ready
this<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.769> looks<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:30.980> I<00:00:31.980> don't

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
this is what it looks like and I don't

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.350 
this is what it looks like and I don't
know<00:00:32.579> if<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.230> much<00:00:34.440> different<00:00:35.280> than<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
know if it's so much different than the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.270 
know if it's so much different than the
last<00:00:36.390> video<00:00:37.040> at<00:00:38.040> last<00:00:38.309> at<00:00:38.670> least<00:00:38.850> them<00:00:39.329> i<00:00:40.280> have

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
last video at last at least them i have

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.299 
last video at last at least them i have
taken<00:00:42.180> away<00:00:42.480> some<00:00:42.780> some<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> they<00:00:44.129> would

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
taken away some some of the they would

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.200 
taken away some some of the they would
here<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> sides<00:00:45.770> it<00:00:46.770> has<00:00:47.010> become<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.760> bit

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
here on the sides it has become a bit

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.670 
here on the sides it has become a bit
more<00:00:48.890> like<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> knife<00:00:51.170> at<00:00:52.170> least<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> knife

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
more like a knife at least a knife

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.450 
more like a knife at least a knife
handle<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:54.320> this<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.620> look<00:00:55.829> what<00:00:56.370> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
handle so this is what look what it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.430 
handle so this is what look what it
looks<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.809> moment<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:59.300> i<00:01:00.320> have<00:01:01.320> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
looks like at the moment and i have to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.789 
looks like at the moment and i have to
compare<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.859> my<00:01:01.980> sketch<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:03.500> there<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:06.799> for

to show at the moment of course you can
see<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.310> extra<00:02:00.180> break<00:02:00.719> i<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.110> put<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.710> here

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
see this extra break i have put in here

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.490 
see this extra break i have put in here
in<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> handle<00:02:02.399> handle<00:02:03.320> this<00:02:04.320> product<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.280> oak

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
in the handle handle this product of oak

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.740 
in the handle handle this product of oak
what<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> think<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:08.099> pretty<00:02:08.819> pretty

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
what I think it's pretty pretty

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.969 
what I think it's pretty pretty
difficult<00:02:09.929> about<00:02:10.410> this

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
difficult about this

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.979 
difficult about this
is<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:13.140> part<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.129> I'm<00:02:14.220> using<00:02:14.519> is<00:02:14.989> much

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
is that the part that I'm using is much

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.000 
is that the part that I'm using is much
softer<00:02:16.349> than<00:02:16.650> then<00:02:17.659> this<00:02:18.659> African<00:02:19.590> hardwood

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
softer than then this African hardwood

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.570 
softer than then this African hardwood
and<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:21.319> Swedish<00:02:22.319> oak<00:02:22.530> care<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:25.580> it

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
and this Swedish oak care and so it

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.770 
and this Swedish oak care and so it
takes<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:27.150> much<00:02:27.510> more<00:02:27.980> long<00:02:28.980> time<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:30.510> grind

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
takes a much more long time to to grind

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.530 
takes a much more long time to to grind
these<00:02:30.989> parts<00:02:31.530> down<00:02:32.099> than<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.120> rest<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
these parts down than the rest of the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.150 
these parts down than the rest of the
handle<00:02:33.900> which<00:02:34.290> can<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:35.000> pretty<00:02:36.000> frustrating

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
handle which can be pretty frustrating

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.030 
handle which can be pretty frustrating
frustrating<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.299> wrong<00:02:39.480> word<00:02:39.660> because

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
frustrating is is the wrong word because

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.670 
frustrating is is the wrong word because
all<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.549> about<00:02:41.730> joy<00:02:42.269> of<00:02:42.780> course<00:02:43.110> but<00:02:44.299> but

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
all this is about joy of course but but

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.270 
all this is about joy of course but but
you<00:02:46.680> can<00:02:46.860> shape<00:02:47.069> this<00:02:47.310> part<00:02:48.590> pretty<00:02:49.590> fast<00:02:49.980> and

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
you can shape this part pretty fast and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.360 
you can shape this part pretty fast and
then<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.519> have<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.900> put<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.530> lot<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.769> more

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
then you have to to put a lot of more

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.650 
then you have to to put a lot of more
effort<00:02:53.730> into<00:02:53.879> these<00:02:54.480> harder<00:02:55.410> parts<00:02:56.150> but<00:02:57.150> I

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
effort into these harder parts but I

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.839 
effort into these harder parts but I
think<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.170> will<00:02:58.290> come<00:02:58.470> out<00:02:58.530> pretty<00:02:59.160> well<00:02:59.310> when

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
think it will come out pretty well when

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.979 
think it will come out pretty well when
it's<00:02:59.970> finished<00:03:00.620> at<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.680> moment<00:03:02.099> it's<00:03:02.989> it's

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
it's finished at the moment it's it's

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.660 
it's finished at the moment it's it's
not<00:03:04.200> straight<00:03:04.590> everywhere<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:06.200> have<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.670> take

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
not straight everywhere I have to take

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.660 
not straight everywhere I have to take
away<00:03:09.140> bit<00:03:10.140> more<00:03:10.379> here<00:03:11.000> than<00:03:12.000> there<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.670> the

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
away bit more here than there and the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.620 
away bit more here than there and the
end<00:03:15.389> part<00:03:16.109> here<00:03:16.380> isn't<00:03:17.180> absolutely<00:03:18.180> straight

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
end part here isn't absolutely straight
