to school looks really good i think i

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.100 
to school looks really good i think i
think<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:09.090> little<00:02:09.390> piece<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.810> hanging

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
think this little piece just hanging

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.410 
think this little piece just hanging
down<00:02:10.289> adds<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.770> little<00:02:10.890> like<00:02:11.160> bohemian<00:02:11.670> vibe<00:02:12.150> to

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
down adds a little like bohemian vibe to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.150 
down adds a little like bohemian vibe to
it

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.480 
it
but<00:02:13.310> now<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.460> want<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.790> split<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.210> into

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
but now you want to split this into

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.730 
but now you want to split this into
sections<00:02:16.490> i<00:02:16.760> usually<00:02:17.120> do<00:02:17.270> like<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.870> guess<00:02:18.350> this

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
sections i usually do like I guess this

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.390 
sections i usually do like I guess this
would<00:02:18.890> be<00:02:18.980> like<00:02:19.010> an<00:02:19.250> inch<00:02:19.430> section<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:22.280> then

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
would be like an inch section and then

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.770 
would be like an inch section and then
you<00:02:22.490> want<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.670> take<00:02:22.760> your<00:02:22.910> curling<00:02:23.240> iron<00:02:23.390> make

sure it's heated up and wrap up the
curling<00:02:30.380> iron<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:32.020> usually<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.050> like<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.440> UM<00:02:34.720> go

head and wrap it around the other side

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.320 
head and wrap it around the other side
if<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.070> know<00:02:43.190> what<00:02:43.280> I<00:02:43.340> mean<00:02:43.370> I'll<00:02:43.790> display

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
if you know what I mean I'll display

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.670 
if you know what I mean I'll display
that<00:02:44.510> in<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.690> second<00:02:45.050> but<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.320> just<00:02:45.470> want<00:02:45.650> to

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
that in a second but you just want to

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.040 
that in a second but you just want to
let<00:02:45.770> it<00:02:45.830> sit<00:02:46.130> for<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.310> second<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.840> comes

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
let it sit for a second and it comes

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.810 
let it sit for a second and it comes
with<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.290> glove<00:02:48.530> but<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:48.980> don't<00:02:49.130> like<00:02:49.340> using<00:02:49.520> the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
with a glove but I don't like using the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.820 
with a glove but I don't like using the
glove<00:02:49.970> because<00:02:50.270> I<00:02:50.630> just<00:02:50.840> feel<00:02:51.020> like<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:51.560> makes

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
glove because I just feel like it makes

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.440 
glove because I just feel like it makes
your<00:02:52.010> hair<00:02:52.250> really<00:02:52.370> staticy<00:02:52.730> well<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:53.240> haven't

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
even tried it but I just feel like a

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.200 
even tried it but I just feel like a
glove<00:02:54.920> would<00:02:55.250> make<00:02:55.400> your<00:02:55.550> hair<00:02:55.730> staticky<00:02:56.380> so

glove would make your hair staticky so

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.370 
glove would make your hair staticky so

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
you can let it down and it's just a cute

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.160 
you can let it down and it's just a cute
little<00:03:03.470> car<00:03:03.740> like<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:05.020> ok<00:03:06.020> ok<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:07.850> now<00:03:08.170> I'm

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
little car like that ok ok so now I'm

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.620 
little car like that ok ok so now I'm
going<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.380> take<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.680> other<00:03:09.830> section<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:11.420> do

going to take the other section and do

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
the same oh wait I want I demonstrate

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.550 
the same oh wait I want I demonstrate
like<00:03:13.460> usually<00:03:14.000> with<00:03:14.180> Columbus<00:03:15.080> curling<00:03:15.440> iron

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
like usually with Columbus curling iron

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.220 
like usually with Columbus curling iron
do<00:03:15.710> you<00:03:15.770> want<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:15.980> go<00:03:16.070> like<00:03:16.250> around<00:03:16.280> like<00:03:16.880> this

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
do you want to go like around like this

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.570 
do you want to go like around like this
but<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.290> just<00:03:18.560> find<00:03:18.740> that<00:03:18.830> this<00:03:19.010> way<00:03:19.220> is<00:03:19.280> easier

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
but I just find that this way is easier

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.570 
but I just find that this way is easier
and<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.030> looks<00:03:20.209> good<00:03:20.420> too<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:21.340> then<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:22.459> can

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
and it looks good too and then you can

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.870 
and it looks good too and then you can
just<00:03:22.820> kind<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.030> like<00:03:23.150> roll<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.570> up<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.230> root

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
just kind of like roll it up to the root

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.990 
just kind of like roll it up to the root
because<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.750> has<00:03:26.930> like<00:03:27.400> spinning<00:03:28.400> technology

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
because it has like spinning technology

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.660 
because it has like spinning technology
almost<00:03:29.200> like<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.380> barrel<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.130> handle

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
almost like the barrel and the handle

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.090 
almost like the barrel and the handle
spin<00:03:32.090> I'm<00:03:32.930> not<00:03:33.110> sure<00:03:33.260> how<00:03:33.410> much<00:03:33.560> this<00:03:33.740> one<00:03:33.950> is

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
spin I'm not sure how much this one is

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.150 
spin I'm not sure how much this one is
but<00:03:34.490> I<00:03:34.730> know<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.330> can<00:03:35.480> get<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:36.160> conair

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
but I know that you can get the conair

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.250 
but I know that you can get the conair
you<00:03:37.430> curl<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:38.000> meganheartsmakeup<00:03:38.330> uses<00:03:39.110> all

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
you curl that meganheartsmakeup uses all

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.770 
you curl that meganheartsmakeup uses all

the time for forty dollars at rite aid i

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.440 
the time for forty dollars at rite aid i
think<00:03:42.200> or<00:03:42.530> probably<00:03:43.430> like<00:03:43.550> Walgreens<00:03:44.150> Walmart

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
think or probably like Walgreens Walmart

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.410 
think or probably like Walgreens Walmart
and<00:03:45.110> also<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:46.010> think<00:03:46.070> that's<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:46.610> see<00:03:46.850> CEO<00:03:47.120> has<00:03:47.390> a

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
and also I think that's so see CEO has a

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.570 
and also I think that's so see CEO has a
video<00:03:47.690> about<00:03:48.170> how<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.500> turn<00:03:49.010> your<00:03:49.040> clamp

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
video about how to turn your clamp

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.760 
video about how to turn your clamp
curling<00:03:50.180> iron<00:03:50.330> into<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:50.690> clam<00:03:50.959> plus<00:03:51.170> one<00:03:51.410> but

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
curling iron into a clam plus one but

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.680 
curling iron into a clam plus one but
the<00:03:52.400> one<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:52.670> I<00:03:52.730> have<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.180> can't<00:03:53.390> do<00:03:53.540> that

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
the one that I have you can't do that

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.479 
the one that I have you can't do that
with<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.230> definitely<00:03:54.830> go<00:03:54.890> check<00:03:55.010> that<00:03:55.280> one<00:03:55.400> out

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
with so definitely go check that one out

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.949 
with so definitely go check that one out
i'll<00:03:55.700> try<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.060> find<00:03:56.270> it<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.510> link<00:03:56.630> it<00:03:56.720> in<00:03:56.780> the

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
i'll try to find it and link it in the

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:18.539 
i'll try to find it and link it in the
bottom<00:03:57.200> bar<00:03:57.320> if<00:03:57.440> i<00:03:57.530> can

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.129 

ok<00:04:19.549> so<00:04:19.609> i<00:04:20.090> guess<00:04:20.120> i<00:04:20.389> want<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.630> talk<00:04:20.780> about<00:04:20.810> like

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
ok so i guess i want to talk about like

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.200 
ok so i guess i want to talk about like
the<00:04:21.290> cons<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.160> pros<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.460> this<00:04:22.850> curling

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
the cons and the pros of this curling

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.680 
the cons and the pros of this curling
iron<00:04:23.419> because<00:04:23.750> i'm<00:04:23.960> not<00:04:24.110> sure<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:26.150> one<00:04:26.449> would

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
iron because i'm not sure this one would

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.860 
iron because i'm not sure this one would
be<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:27.229> one<00:04:27.970> that<00:04:28.970> i<00:04:29.000> would<00:04:29.210> recommend<00:04:29.690> to

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
be the one that i would recommend to

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.950 
be the one that i would recommend to
people<00:04:30.669> but<00:04:31.669> i<00:04:31.729> haven't<00:04:32.090> used<00:04:32.210> other<00:04:32.479> clampus

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
people but i haven't used other clampus

people but i haven't used other clampus
curling<00:04:33.350> iron<00:04:33.500> so<00:04:33.889> it's<00:04:34.430> kind<00:04:34.639> of<00:04:34.700> difficult

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
curling iron so it's kind of difficult

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.090

what I do like about it so what I don't
like<00:04:41.030> about<00:04:41.150> it<00:04:41.419> or<00:04:41.990> let's<00:04:42.350> start<00:04:42.590> with

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
like about it or let's start with

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.920 
like about it or let's start with
positive<00:04:43.250> because<00:04:43.490> it's<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.479> morning<00:04:44.840> we

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
positive because it's the morning we

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.550 
positive because it's the morning we
need<00:04:45.050> some<00:04:45.229> positivity<00:04:45.700> um<00:04:46.700> I<00:04:46.790> really<00:04:47.120> like

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
need some positivity um I really like

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.230 
need some positivity um I really like
the<00:04:48.560> way<00:04:49.010> that<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.490> makes<00:04:49.639> your<00:04:49.790> hair<00:04:50.030> because

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
the way that it makes your hair because

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.870 
the way that it makes your hair because
it's<00:04:50.590> tourmaline<00:04:51.590> term<00:04:52.010> align<00:04:52.310> tourmaline

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
it's tourmaline term align tourmaline

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.900 
it's tourmaline term align tourmaline
and<00:04:53.060> ceramic<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:55.010> it<00:04:55.160> like<00:04:55.280> Defra's<00:04:55.760> is

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
and ceramic and so it like Defra's is

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.430 
and ceramic and so it like Defra's is
your<00:04:56.060> hair<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.360> makes<00:04:56.539> it<00:04:56.690> really<00:04:56.900> smooth<00:04:57.320> and

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
your hair and makes it really smooth and

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.129 
your hair and makes it really smooth and
really<00:04:57.740> soft<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:58.370> I<00:04:58.490> definitely<00:04:58.850> agree<00:04:59.720> with

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
really soft and I definitely agree with

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.260 
really soft and I definitely agree with
that<00:05:00.169> and<00:05:00.440> noticed<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:01.039> because<00:05:01.220> using<00:05:02.000> the

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
that and noticed it because using the

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.930 
that and noticed it because using the
other<00:05:02.419> curling<00:05:02.870> iron<00:05:03.199> I<00:05:03.490> didn't<00:05:04.490> get<00:05:04.610> like<00:05:04.820> the

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
other curling iron I didn't get like the

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.360 
other curling iron I didn't get like the
same<00:05:05.150> soft<00:05:05.539> curls<00:05:06.350> that<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:06.680> do<00:05:06.770> with<00:05:07.010> this<00:05:07.130> one

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
same soft curls that I do with this one

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.610 
same soft curls that I do with this one
I<00:05:07.580> like<00:05:08.270> that<00:05:08.300> it<00:05:08.510> heats<00:05:08.690> up<00:05:08.810> really<00:05:09.050> fast<00:05:09.289> it

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
I like that it heats up really fast it

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.029 
I like that it heats up really fast it
heats<00:05:09.770> up<00:05:09.919> in<00:05:10.070> like<00:05:10.930> 30<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:12.169> 60<00:05:12.530> seconds<00:05:12.919> I'd

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
heats up in like 30 to 60 seconds I'd

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.100 
heats up in like 30 to 60 seconds I'd
say<00:05:13.250> I<00:05:13.520> like<00:05:13.970> that<00:05:14.150> it's<00:05:14.330> just<00:05:14.419> really<00:05:14.720> easy

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
say I like that it's just really easy

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.260 
say I like that it's just really easy
and<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:16.280> don't<00:05:16.430> really<00:05:16.520> have<00:05:16.729> to<00:05:16.789> leave<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.210> on

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
and you don't really have to leave it on

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.020 
and you don't really have to leave it on
the<00:05:17.389> barrel<00:05:17.630> very<00:05:17.960> long<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:21.760> what<00:05:22.760> i<00:05:22.789> don't

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
the barrel very long and what i don't

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.969 
the barrel very long and what i don't
like<00:05:23.090> about<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.419> is<00:05:23.690> that<00:05:23.720> it<00:05:24.080> doesn't<00:05:24.349> have<00:05:24.560> a

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
like about it is that it doesn't have a

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.969 
like about it is that it doesn't have a
heat<00:05:25.910> temperature<00:05:26.389> like<00:05:26.780> gauge<00:05:27.229> things<00:05:27.680> you

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
heat temperature like gauge things you

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.920 
heat temperature like gauge things you
can't<00:05:28.190> change<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.610> temperature<00:05:28.880> and<00:05:29.389> I<00:05:29.780> don't

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
can't change the temperature and I don't

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.089 
can't change the temperature and I don't
like<00:05:30.050> that<00:05:30.200> it<00:05:30.289> doesn't<00:05:30.320> have<00:05:30.590> like<00:05:30.740> a<00:05:30.770> light

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
like that it doesn't have like a light

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.890 
like that it doesn't have like a light
or<00:05:31.310> something<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.789> tell<00:05:31.970> you<00:05:32.090> that<00:05:32.270> it's<00:05:32.419> done

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
or something to tell you that it's done

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.409 
or something to tell you that it's done
heating<00:05:33.349> up<00:05:33.500> or<00:05:33.800> like<00:05:33.979> anything<00:05:34.760> so<00:05:35.180> when<00:05:35.330> you

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
heating up or like anything so when you

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.409 
heating up or like anything so when you
turn<00:05:35.630> it<00:05:35.660> on<00:05:35.870> you<00:05:36.050> just<00:05:36.080> flip<00:05:36.470> the<00:05:36.620> switch<00:05:36.889> and

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
turn it on you just flip the switch and

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.409 
turn it on you just flip the switch and
you<00:05:38.419> just<00:05:38.539> have<00:05:38.690> to<00:05:38.810> wait<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.020> guess<00:05:39.380> so<00:05:40.419> that's

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
you just have to wait I guess so that's

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.969 
you just have to wait I guess so that's
something<00:05:41.660> that<00:05:41.840> I<00:05:41.960> don't<00:05:42.169> like<00:05:42.289> about<00:05:42.349> it<00:05:42.620> and

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
something that I don't like about it and

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.580 
something that I don't like about it and
