00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.330
 and today we will talk about him 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.330
 triangle of exposure 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.490
 Hello 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.130
 how are you taking the photo with the camera 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.760
 you are not seeing but what configuration 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.210
 you use 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.169
 configuration 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.789
 but take photo in manual apt mode of 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:35.610
 they took them as use the green box 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.260
 in automatic luxury manual 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.330
 I remember when I started the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.450
 photography used to have a camera one 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.730
 power sad canon pretty small that 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.220
 I had the manual mode however I do not 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.560
 I used to occupy it because I did not know or it scares me 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.090
 use it so I took pictures in 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.010
 automatic 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.930
 when taking the photo of the automatic I 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.630
 I say to the camera ok camera I trust you 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.520
 you take the pictures to as much as you think 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.989
 that are correct however with the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.270
 I was giving me time that no 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.489
 always in the camera was right already 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.100
 there were photos in which I wanted 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.550
 expose certain things and the camera does not 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.210
 I saw so I started using manual and the 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.070
 to the manual 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.680
 I began to understand what was the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.300
 triangle of exposure the triangle 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.160
 of the exhibition are simply three 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.550
 terms that is the 12th floor the opening 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.259
 of the entity and 3 the shutter speed 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.170
 he did is the sensitivity that the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.229
 camera to capture light speed 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.290
 shutter does not do was the 3 the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.060
 opening or she fragma is the amount of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.070
 light that the lens lets enter the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.700
 camera may the lens let in 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.710
 a lot of light or little volume and wichÃ­ and 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.140
 we have the shutter speed that 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.600
 is the amount of time that the lens 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.200
 remains open can be from 30 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.940
 seconds or more 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.090
 up to 4 my side of a second or more 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.310
 as you want so having these three 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.650
 intercepted items we have a 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.440
 exposure is correct or incorrect 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.440
 there is an image 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.810
 it's going to depend on us to use these 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.280
 three elements to have the exhibition 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.980
 that we want according to the image 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.320
 that we want in the next block is 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.450
 that it was a photograph I will show you 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.240
 I will change each element to see what 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.040
 what happens if I change smooth what happens if 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.590
 change ready or speed duration 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.380
 what happens if I raise the opening to the downside 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.430
 let's see what the effects are like 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.950
 that I invite you to do these 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.260
 images now I'm going to show you what 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.520
 happens when the parameters of 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.080
 the picture 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.330
 what happens if I just change one and left the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.300
 two other prelates or if I change 2 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.020
 the first one that pulls images 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.870
 simply I changed the iso I started with 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.680
 an iso 100 to greece obturation 160 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.420
 640 and second and an opening 2.8 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.299
 the operating speed in the opening 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.310
 the constant equal and also made 200 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.910
 and they see that the image was immediately 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.760
 efe - there is more light 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.380
 the camera is capturing a lot with light the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.990
 next image is miso of 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.370
 800 and you see that if I do not change the 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.990
 two other parameters the image is me 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.710
 the control is coming out and I'm 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.540
 having a totally bad picture with 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.480
 much what probably will not be 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.540
 will fix the computer and end a 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.220
 iso of 3200 and you will see that the image is 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.110
 frightening with this can not be done 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.030
 much 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.710
 following with the images in the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.190
 following just simply also the 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.740
 shutter speed and let the iso 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.050
 constant or equal opening and they will see 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.210
 we started with that they said but if I act 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.720
 action one 640 two seconds and one 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.030
 opening of 2.8 and here the little frog also 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.720
 answer if we change or change the 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.790
 speed duration to a minimum of 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.370
 seconds 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.900
 and every time the image is getting more 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.609
 and blacker in fact I had to change the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.329
 color of the letter because otherwise it would be 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:11.310
 black decade I am not also notions 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.950
 revelation duration of 13 thousand teacher 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.130
 I make seconds more and more 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.609
 dark because because here the camera 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.539
 between less and less light to the camera 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.539
 and finally 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.030
 and now I 'm just going to show you what happens 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.010
 if I only change the 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.340
 the opening of the entity we started with a 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.920
 2.8 opening simply what the 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.110
 wider or as big as the 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.540
 opening after we are changing the 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.850
 opening to 3.5 the image is 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.770
 relatively similar to the 100 more 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.810
 background details 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.090
 and here we are going to move to an opening 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.419
 7.1 and the amount of light that enters the 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.419
 camera 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.360
 in much less because the image is 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.190
 much darker here the opening and f-22 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.800
 here the opening is the opening more 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.970
 small that lets me get the lens and 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.370
 the amount of light wants to enter 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.290
 it really is very low 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.150
 the next strip of hill images 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.860
 he did constant at 100 and he was changing the 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.220
 speed duration and opening and 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.220
 although more 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.610
 you deserved duration 400 seconds and 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:24.069
 opening two points 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.479
 the answer the next image the 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.759
 tool is still well exposed 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.830
 but the opening changed to 5 and the 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.409
 speed of 1 107 present water and 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.690
 second but fine every time the 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.260
 opening and the speed duration I'll 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.230
 getting more details of the fund 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:44.430
 because the depth of field is greater 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:47.910
 and greater good here in this margin of 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.490
 opening 22 I see absolutely everything but 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.230
 I see well from the twig the twig is 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.620
 full seal as well as the building that is 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.560
 the bottom 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.840
 this is not going to be the first image if 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.880
 can see in the first image the 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.550
 tool is well exposed and well 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.600
 focused and the brain bottom does not look the 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.520
 background 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.100
 in the following has images only 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.530
 let the constant opening was also 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.150
 smoothly changing the speed per action and 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.560
 you will see that when changing the smooth I have to 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.480
 change the shutter speed to 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.080
 have the tool well exposed here 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.900
 are and social a 15 Aug of second the 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.970
 next picture he also did 400 and I had 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.560
 that make the speed last a lot 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:32.550
 faster 60 seconds 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:35.160
 then upload the iso to 1,600 and I had to 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.400
 raise the speed to a 250 I do 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.540
 seconds are a pretty fast image 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.550
 and the end used an iso of 6400 and I had to 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.100
 go up a lot and ready for the rent 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.310
 personally exposed to me I do not 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.450
 like to climb seen beyond 800 because 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:56.820
 because he made beyond 800 in 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.400
 cameras like mine which is the t3 produces 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.050
 noisy 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.180
 the images are seen with many granites 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.730
 I do not like you, I can not find the 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.170
 people after these charges and I hope that 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.300
 have understood what the triangle is 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.060
 of the position the three elements and their 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.960
 opening and speed duration and the 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.569
 challenges 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.580
 not that you throw in ice water but 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:21.880
 that come out of the non-automatic and take out 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.820
 photos in manual risk are given 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:28.070
 that step 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.070
 and see you next time 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:37.370
 I changed the manual
