 have a clock to 10 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.840
 if we have the 0 to 10 right 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.810
 1 1 met with a revolution left 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.300

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.079
 position changes see you when i am 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.360
 Here, the breadth of breadth for larger of 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.700
 Now pay attention to the needle position 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:56.120
 the moves to stop when I 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.120
 step width now set to 55 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:10.200
 then i could never walk to the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.360
 food position exactly and wittlich if 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.369
 They take for instance for patchwork 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.159
 and they have the automatic close 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.869
 None of this quarter is called for 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.659
 Take a wide if you are patchwork in the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.520
 want to take metric and 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.890
 not a similar then they ask 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.220
 is wide at 45 1 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.790
 then you automatically have all cantons 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.810
 walk to the close position 0 75 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.140
 centimeters in general with patchwork 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.740
 on the rose length from 2 5 to 2 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.740
 reduced 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.980
 if you have a machine here the parks 53 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.380
 then they will notice this 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.280
 has several graphics with the channel 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.880
 opposition 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:07.670
 There are 1 and 22 22 cities 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.670
 Must the p stands for patchwork 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.060
 I had to 22 rooms automatically 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.460
 the vote already at two kilometers 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.100
 is provided which is often changed 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.890
 at patchwork also here i can do the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.090
 change stitch width now 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:31.050
 on 55 so I in the quarter close to 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.940
 admit to having recognized foot better 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.400
 position on accumulator button and 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.110
 Now this setting is saved 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.780
 and 22 so if I'm a normal left 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.820
 opposition need action then 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:54.000
 really 1 and can make difficult 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.610
 I switch 22 a provided it is 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.530
 saved even if you have the machine 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.420
 switch off resumes 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.420
 this saved in the machine 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:18.299
 An alternative is the first number 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:21.060
 a quarter in jazz rap foot at this 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.700
 song foot you only have a small one 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.209
 Opening another bet and you have to 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.569
 so stitch two middle needle position 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.060
 4 instantly on a small opening is that 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.720
 material is pressed very well 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.760
 against the plate stands and transporter 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:47.190
 now is the distance of this 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:51.329
 recognized is the name position is still 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:56.239
 another alternative is the 57th 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.239
 is a company spokesman walking with leadership 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.060
 here 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:13.320
 the middle position position here 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.180
 these levels have a leadership and such 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.280
 they can be accurately called 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.280
 fast access to these could
