00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.680 
now I i think i can just kill them by
showing<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.880> lightsaber<00:04:13.000> that's<00:04:14.000> almost

showing the lightsaber that's almost

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:23.680 
showing the lightsaber that's almost
cheap<00:04:15.319> but<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:16.609> works

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
no way they're they're more difficult

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.439 
no way they're they're more difficult
because<00:04:33.240> they<00:04:33.659> can<00:04:33.900> slice<00:04:34.349> me<00:04:34.650> up<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:35.449> yeah

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449
