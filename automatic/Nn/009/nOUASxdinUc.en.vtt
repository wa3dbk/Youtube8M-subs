I<00:00:16.379> showed<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.190> tutorial<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.760> how<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.940> download<00:00:18.150> a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
I showed a tutorial on how to download a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.990 
I showed a tutorial on how to download a
program<00:00:19.050> called<00:00:19.260> Inkscape<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.310> little<00:00:20.850> while

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
program called Inkscape a little while

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.439 
program called Inkscape a little while
back<00:00:21.270> but<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.980> couldn't<00:00:23.699> figure<00:00:23.939> out<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
back but I just couldn't figure out the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.269 
back but I just couldn't figure out the
best<00:00:24.720> way<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.010> this

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
best way to do it on that one and this

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.419 
best way to do it on that one and this
is<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.000> lot<00:00:27.330> easier<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.529> tutorial<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.310> I

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
is a lot easier of a tutorial and I

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.189 
is a lot easier of a tutorial and I
figured<00:00:29.760> might<00:00:30.269> as<00:00:30.330> well<00:00:30.449> start<00:00:30.720> easy<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
figured might as well start easy and

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.680 
figured might as well start easy and
then<00:00:31.320> progress<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:32.149> progress<00:00:33.149> with<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
then progress of progress with like the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.420 
then progress of progress with like the
challenge<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.290> start<00:00:34.530> off<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.829> design<00:00:35.190> has<00:00:35.399> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
challenge to start off this design has a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.940 
challenge to start off this design has a
lot<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.760> even<00:00:36.600> crisp<00:00:36.930> lines<00:00:37.230> which<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.680> very

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
lot of even crisp lines which is very

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.090 
lot of even crisp lines which is very
good<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:39.090> process<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:39.899> if<00:00:40.050> your<00:00:40.800> design

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
good for the process but if your design

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.950 
good for the process but if your design
doesn't<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.640> them<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.090> know<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.750> work

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
doesn't have them you know you can work

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.799 
doesn't have them you know you can work
around<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.430> picture<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.879> fairly

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
around it so this picture is fairly

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.270 
around it so this picture is fairly
optimal<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.559> know<00:00:46.680> there<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.010> background

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
optimal you know there is background

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.040 
optimal you know there is background
because<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> UPS<00:00:49.079> slap<00:00:49.980> so

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
because it is on a UPS slap so

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
because it is on a UPS slap so
well<00:00:52.050> you're<00:00:52.199> first<00:00:52.440> gonna<00:00:52.559> want<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.890> start

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
well you're first gonna want to start

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.100 
well you're first gonna want to start
off<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.520> select<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.030> pen<00:00:54.329> tool<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.899> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
off is to select the pen tool it is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.099 
off is to select the pen tool it is
right<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.390> can<00:00:57.390> also<00:00:57.539> select<00:00:57.840> your

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
right here you can also select your

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.650 
right here you can also select your
stroke<00:00:58.440> fill<00:00:59.129> or<00:00:59.340> whatever<00:00:59.670> by<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.480> clicking

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
stroke fill or whatever by just clicking

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.220 
stroke fill or whatever by just clicking
on<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
on it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.110 
on it
I'm<00:01:01.289> good<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:01.829> black<00:01:02.070> right<00:01:02.370> now<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.820> that's

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
I'm good with black right now as that's

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.539 
I'm good with black right now as that's
what<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.449> design<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
what the design is going to be so you

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.580 
what the design is going to be so you
can<00:01:05.729> zoom<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.240> by<00:01:06.810> holding<00:01:08.659> ctrl<00:01:09.659> +<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.320> think

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
can zoom in by holding ctrl + I think

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.730 
can zoom in by holding ctrl + I think
but<00:01:10.920> uh<00:01:11.090> it's<00:01:12.090> not<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.450> working<00:01:15.439> just<00:01:16.439> +

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
but uh it's not really working just +

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710 
but uh it's not really working just +
should<00:01:17.070> zoom<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.119> doesn't<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.600> do

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
should zoom in but it doesn't want to do

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.030 
should zoom in but it doesn't want to do
that<00:01:18.750> right<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:21.530> we'll<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.680> go<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:23.009> it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
that right now so we'll just go with it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.490 
that right now so we'll just go with it
from<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.080> you're<00:01:25.170> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> want

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
from here so what you're going to want

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.460 
from here so what you're going to want
to<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.009> select<00:01:26.759> your<00:01:27.240> pen<00:01:27.479> tool<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
to do is select your pen tool and the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.020 
to do is select your pen tool and the
color<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.890> want<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.250> stroke<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.820> and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
color you want your stroke to be and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.240 
color you want your stroke to be and
then<00:01:30.630> simply<00:01:31.170> put<00:01:31.409> two<00:01:31.619> points<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:34.250> two

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
then simply put two points on the two

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.899 
then simply put two points on the two
points<00:01:35.610> down<00:01:35.790> now<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.400> ranging

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
points down now the this can be ranging

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.300 
points down now the this can be ranging
from<00:01:39.259> wherever<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.439> want<00:01:40.619> since<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.009> want<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
from wherever you want since I want a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.609 
from wherever you want since I want a
circle<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.079> want<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.320> curved<00:01:43.590> line

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
circle or if you want a curved line

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.319 
circle or if you want a curved line
you're<00:01:43.979> gonna<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.369> put<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> point<00:01:45.090> down

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
you're gonna have to put a point down

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.859 
you're gonna have to put a point down
while<00:01:45.780> holding<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:47.250> move<00:01:47.820> right<00:01:48.659> or

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
while holding it and then move right or

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.889 
while holding it and then move right or
left<00:01:49.110> depending<00:01:49.829> now<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.899> acquired

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
left depending now this is a acquired

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.450 
left depending now this is a acquired
skill<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:54.060> type<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.530> curve<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
skill to like get this type of curve the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.310 
skill to like get this type of curve the
way<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.670> want<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> lay<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.110> you're<00:01:58.259> just

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
way you want it to lay so you're just

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.929 
way you want it to lay so you're just
gonna<00:01:58.439> press<00:01:58.770> down<00:01:59.009> once<00:01:59.219> again<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.640> hold<00:01:59.820> it

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
gonna press down once again and hold it

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.690 
gonna press down once again and hold it
and<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:00.719> see<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.920> kind<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.280> made<00:02:02.490> this

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
and as you can see it kind of made this

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.819 
and as you can see it kind of made this
really<00:02:03.180> extreme<00:02:03.780> bump<00:02:04.200> right<00:02:04.350> here<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.740> you

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
really extreme bump right here and you

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.069 
really extreme bump right here and you
don't<00:02:04.920> want<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.270> conjoint<00:02:06.689> can

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
don't want that so you can conjoint can

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.020 
don't want that so you can conjoint can
kind<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.560> control<00:02:07.950> Z<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.489> let<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.879> do

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
kind of just control Z and let it do

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.510 
kind of just control Z and let it do
what<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.840> does<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.259> then<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:11.039> once<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.489> a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
what it does and then so once you have a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.370 
what it does and then so once you have a
line<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.209> want<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.599> keep<00:02:12.810> like<00:02:13.680> set

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
line that you want to keep like set

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.740 
line that you want to keep like set
you're<00:02:14.470> gonna<00:02:14.560> hit<00:02:14.770> stroke<00:02:15.430> path<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.120> then

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
you're gonna hit stroke path and then

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.350 
you're gonna hit stroke path and then
choose<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.680> line<00:02:17.890> with<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.460> everything<00:02:19.030> so

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
choose the line with and everything so

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.340 
choose the line with and everything so
I'm<00:02:19.480> gonna<00:02:19.600> bump<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.080> up<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.290> little<00:02:20.560> bit<00:02:20.680> larger

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
I'm gonna bump it up a little bit larger

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.620 
I'm gonna bump it up a little bit larger
just<00:02:23.350> then<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.740> was<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.820> I'm<00:02:24.940> at<00:02:25.090> ten<00:02:25.390> right<00:02:25.600> now

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
just then it was so I'm at ten right now

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.560 
just then it was so I'm at ten right now
and<00:02:26.080> then<00:02:26.710> as<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.100> can<00:02:27.220> see<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.940> put<00:02:28.450> the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
and then as you can see it just put the

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.930 
and then as you can see it just put the
stroke<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.220> I'm<00:02:30.640> just<00:02:30.670> going<00:02:30.910> to

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
stroke in and you can I'm just going to

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.880 
stroke in and you can I'm just going to
change<00:02:31.180> tools<00:02:31.600> real<00:02:31.870> quick<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.650> can<00:02:32.740> see

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
change tools real quick so you can see

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.670 
change tools real quick so you can see
the<00:02:33.310> black<00:02:33.640> line<00:02:33.700> right<00:02:34.420> there<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:34.990> if<00:02:35.590> you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
the black line right there and if you

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.900 
the black line right there and if you
already<00:02:35.860> have<00:02:36.100> them<00:02:36.190> make<00:02:36.400> sure<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.640> put<00:02:36.790> this

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
already have them make sure you put this

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.390 
already have them make sure you put this
in<00:02:37.090> full<00:02:37.330> screen<00:02:37.570> as<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.140> will<00:02:38.290> cut<00:02:39.190> down<00:02:39.220> on

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
in full screen as it will cut down on

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.970 
in full screen as it will cut down on
the<00:02:39.640> choppiness<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.980> recording

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
the choppiness of the of the recording

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.510 
the choppiness of the of the recording
but<00:02:45.310> uh<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:46.000> I'm<00:02:46.330> just<00:02:46.510> gonna<00:02:47.250> zoom<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.490> a

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
but uh so I'm just gonna zoom in a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.890 
but uh so I'm just gonna zoom in a
little<00:02:48.760> bit<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.700> cannot<00:02:52.120> get<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.420> better<00:02:52.600> view

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
little bit so I cannot get a better view

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.590 
little bit so I cannot get a better view
and<00:02:53.140> then<00:02:53.680> simply<00:02:54.670> just<00:02:54.700> start<00:02:55.000> up<00:02:55.300> again

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
and then simply just start up again

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.940 
and then simply just start up again
where<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.410> want<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:59.370> keep<00:03:00.370> going<00:03:01.950> with

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
where you want to and keep going with

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.250 
where you want to and keep going with
this<00:03:03.400> program<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.060> does<00:03:04.270> tend<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.810> have<00:03:04.990> these

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
this program it does tend to have these

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.250 
this program it does tend to have these
really<00:03:05.560> extreme<00:03:06.360> bumps<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.660> but<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.080> can

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
really extreme bumps in it but you can

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.880 
really extreme bumps in it but you can
really<00:03:08.470> smooth<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:08.980> out<00:03:09.070> by<00:03:09.250> just<00:03:10.260> clicking<00:03:11.260> on

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
really smooth it out by just clicking on

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.720 
really smooth it out by just clicking on
the<00:03:12.520> line<00:03:13.240> itself<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:14.280> letting<00:03:15.280> that<00:03:15.430> apply

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
the line itself and letting that apply

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.210 
the line itself and letting that apply
and<00:03:16.090> then<00:03:16.270> once<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.660> have<00:03:16.810> these<00:03:17.260> set<00:03:17.650> just

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
and then once you have these set just

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.550 
and then once you have these set just
hit<00:03:18.400> stroke<00:03:18.700> path<00:03:18.940> again<00:03:19.270> and<00:03:19.510> hit<00:03:19.960> stroke<00:03:20.320> and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
hit stroke path again and hit stroke and

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.010 
hit stroke path again and hit stroke and
it'll<00:03:21.340> pop<00:03:21.700> up<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:22.210> I'll<00:03:22.300> just<00:03:22.480> switch<00:03:22.690> tools

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
it'll pop up and I'll just switch tools

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.170 
it'll pop up and I'll just switch tools
so<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.260> can<00:03:23.350> see<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.770> so<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:24.700> really<00:03:25.030> get<00:03:25.120> the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
so you can see it so you really get the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.050 
so you can see it so you really get the
gist<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.810> obviously<00:03:26.800> this<00:03:27.280> program<00:03:27.670> is<00:03:27.850> not

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
gist of it obviously this program is not

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.910 
gist of it obviously this program is not
the<00:03:28.360> best<00:03:28.600> for<00:03:30.690> for<00:03:31.690> this<00:03:31.900> there<00:03:32.470> are<00:03:32.710> better

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
the best for for this there are better

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.420 
the best for for this there are better
programs<00:03:33.490> I<00:03:33.790> use<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.170> Corel<00:03:35.170> PaintShop<00:03:35.560> Pro<00:03:35.740> and

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
programs I use a Corel PaintShop Pro and

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.050 
programs I use a Corel PaintShop Pro and
that<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:37.720> runs<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.020> about<00:03:38.260> $60<00:03:39.100> but<00:03:39.460> it<00:03:39.730> is

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
that that runs you about $60 but it is

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.850 
that that runs you about $60 but it is
well<00:03:40.540> worth<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:41.020> if<00:03:41.170> you're<00:03:41.350> going<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.710> be

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
well worth it if you're going to be

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.550 
well worth it if you're going to be
doing<00:03:42.040> uh<00:03:42.220> doing<00:03:42.750> these<00:03:43.750> relatively

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
doing uh doing these relatively

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.500 
doing uh doing these relatively
frequently<00:03:45.430> or<00:03:45.670> whatever<00:03:46.140> but<00:03:47.140> uh<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:48.510> you

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
frequently or whatever but uh so you

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.830 
frequently or whatever but uh so you
didn't<00:03:50.050> want<00:03:50.080> to<00:03:50.230> do<00:03:50.350> that<00:03:50.380> but<00:03:51.100> definitely

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
didn't want to do that but definitely

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.390 
didn't want to do that but definitely
consider<00:03:52.840> what<00:03:53.680> you<00:03:53.800> want<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.010> do<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:54.280> might

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
consider what you want to do you might

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.570 
consider what you want to do you might
want<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.120> try<00:03:55.830> definitely<00:03:56.830> this<00:03:56.980> out<00:03:57.190> before

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
want to try definitely this out before

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.020 
want to try definitely this out before
you<00:03:57.670> go<00:03:57.820> and<00:03:57.970> buy<00:03:59.190> any<00:04:00.190> program<00:04:00.790> like

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
you go and buy any program like

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.990 
you go and buy any program like
