I don't know how to say it central guys
name<00:00:11.519> because<00:00:12.440> it's<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:13.769> weird<00:00:14.360> anyways<00:00:15.360> first

one<00:00:15.900> would<00:00:15.960> evolve<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.949> center<00:00:17.550> guy<00:00:17.760> so

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
one would evolve is the center guy so

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.150 
one would evolve is the center guy so
I've<00:00:18.600> got<00:00:18.720> two<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.199> them<00:00:19.350> as<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.830> can<00:00:19.949> see

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
summoning I summon another one else

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.880 
summoning I summon another one else
breaker<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.630> I'm<00:00:30.929> gonna<00:00:31.050> actually<00:00:31.380> evolve<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
breaker so I'm gonna actually evolve the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.740 
breaker so I'm gonna actually evolve the
breaker<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.460> because<00:00:32.880> i<00:00:33.090> don't<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.420> Lord

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
breaker one because i don't like Lord

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.780 
breaker one because i don't like Lord
units<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.260> feel<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.649> they<00:00:35.489> don't<00:00:35.640> really

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
units I feel like they don't really

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.290 
units I feel like they don't really
aspire<00:00:36.780> or<00:00:37.110> they<00:00:37.350> they're<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:37.649> really<00:00:38.300> going

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
aspire or they they're not really going

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.510 
aspire or they they're not really going
for<00:00:39.540> anything<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.320> breaker<00:00:40.590> it's

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
for anything because with breaker it's

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.920 
for anything because with breaker it's
the<00:00:41.670> best<00:00:41.879> you're<00:00:41.940> gonna<00:00:42.120> get<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.540> terms<00:00:42.750> of

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
the best you're gonna get in terms of

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.860 
the best you're gonna get in terms of
attack<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.980> unit<00:00:44.280> Lord<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.300> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.690> be

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
attack for that unit Lord is going to be

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.450 
attack for that unit Lord is going to be
kind<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.500> middle<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.370> got

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
kind of in the middle and if you got

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.040 
kind of in the middle and if you got
animals<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> best<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.809> terms

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
animals like the best you get in terms

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.930 
animals like the best you get in terms
of<00:00:49.140> survivability<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.340> always<00:00:50.579> want<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> go

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
of survivability so I always want to go

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.090 
of survivability so I always want to go
for<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> best<00:00:51.420> either<00:00:51.780> I'm<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> best

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
for the best either I'm have the best

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.360 
for the best either I'm have the best
attacker<00:00:53.430> or<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.969> best<00:00:54.829> for<00:00:55.829> survivability

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
attacker or the best for survivability

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.310 
attacker or the best for survivability
so<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> decided<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.600> live<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> breaker<00:00:58.170> one

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so I decided to live all the breaker one

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.720 
so I decided to live all the breaker one
there<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.770> ever<00:00:58.859> get<00:00:59.010> an<00:00:59.129> animal<00:00:59.430> 1<00:00:59.579> i'll

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
there if I ever get an animal 1 i'll

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.020 
there if I ever get an animal 1 i'll
probably<00:00:59.969> end<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.300> maxing<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.379> well<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.030> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
probably end up maxing it as well so the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.649 
probably end up maxing it as well so the
next<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:03.390> I'm<00:01:03.690> gonna<00:01:04.489> evolve<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
next one I'm gonna evolve it's going to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.320 
next one I'm gonna evolve it's going to
be<00:01:07.040> libra<00:01:08.040> because<00:01:08.670> when<00:01:09.060> i<00:01:09.090> was<00:01:09.180> recording

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
be libra because when i was recording

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.149 
be libra because when i was recording
this<00:01:09.540> video<00:01:09.689> i<00:01:09.869> forgot<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.380> golem<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.040> a

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
this video i forgot that golem was a

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.120 
this video i forgot that golem was a
unit<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.450> i<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.689> go<00:01:12.840> past<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:14.100> you

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
unit and i just go past it and there you

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.010 
unit and i just go past it and there you
go<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.030> six<00:01:15.600> libras

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
go so you can see have like six libras

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.690 
go so you can see have like six libras
so<00:01:16.259> i<00:01:16.290> maxed<00:01:16.590> two<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.770> them<00:01:16.890> i'm<00:01:17.040> an<00:01:17.159> animal<00:01:17.369> one

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
so i maxed two of them i'm an animal one

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.340 
so i maxed two of them i'm an animal one
and<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.210> breaker<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.900> as<00:01:19.110> well<00:01:19.549> just<00:01:20.549> because

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
and a breaker one as well just because

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.039 
and a breaker one as well just because
anima<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.409> more<00:01:22.619> useful<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.250> terms<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:24.049> content

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
anima is more useful in terms of content

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.760 
anima is more useful in terms of content
i<00:01:25.259> mean<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.560> works<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.520> better<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.689> general

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
i mean it works it's better in general

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.280 
i mean it works it's better in general
because<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> survivability<00:01:29.570> OMX<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:30.960> level

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
because the survivability OMX or level

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.910 
because the survivability OMX or level
the<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:31.740> sorry<00:01:32.189> evolve<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.909> animal<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.920> so

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the or sorry evolve the animal one so

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.370 
the or sorry evolve the animal one so
here<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.220> go<00:01:35.250> six<00:01:36.030> star<00:01:36.270> anima<00:01:36.659> libera<00:01:37.020> he

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
here we go six star anima libera he

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.539 
here we go six star anima libera he
actually<00:01:37.530> looks<00:01:37.740> pretty<00:01:38.130> crazy<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:39.270> wow<00:01:40.549> yep

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
actually looks pretty crazy like wow yep

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.910 
actually looks pretty crazy like wow yep
that's<00:01:42.479> that's<00:01:42.990> pretty<00:01:43.200> crazy<00:01:43.380> compared<00:01:43.829> to

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that's that's pretty crazy compared to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.929 
that's that's pretty crazy compared to
his<00:01:44.009> five<00:01:44.159> star<00:01:44.460> form<00:01:46.040> yeah<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.460> send<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> and

animal one imax a break or one first
that's<00:02:08.190> what<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.369> got<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.940> then<00:02:09.119> i<00:02:09.209> also<00:02:09.239> have

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
that's what I got and then i also have

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.670 
that's what I got and then i also have
an<00:02:09.660> animal<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:11.129> terms<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.330> unit<00:02:12.690> I

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
an animal one in terms of this unit I

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.649 
an animal one in terms of this unit I
I<00:02:13.799> probably<00:02:14.129> going<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.459> end<00:02:14.579> up<00:02:15.060> evolving<00:02:15.359> both

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
I probably going to end up evolving both

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.030 
I probably going to end up evolving both
of<00:02:15.780> them<00:02:15.930> once<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.200> have<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.500> materials<00:02:17.010> for

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
of them once I have the materials for

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.369 
of them once I have the materials for
them<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:18.060> I'm<00:02:18.150> gonna<00:02:18.269> do<00:02:18.689> Adam<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.049> first<00:02:19.290> just

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
them but I'm gonna do Adam I first just

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.199 
them but I'm gonna do Adam I first just
because<00:02:19.469> in<00:02:19.980> general<00:02:20.099> again<00:02:20.609> Adam<00:02:20.909> was<00:02:21.030> better

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
because in general again Adam was better

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.880 
because in general again Adam was better
survivability<00:02:21.689> realize<00:02:22.530> didn't<00:02:22.739> have<00:02:22.829> a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
survivability realize didn't have a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.940 
survivability realize didn't have a
earth<00:02:23.069> pot<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:24.269> I<00:02:24.329> ended<00:02:24.599> this<00:02:24.659> video<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.680> but

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
earth pot so I ended this video here but

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.039 
earth pot so I ended this video here but
then<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.430> ended<00:02:27.239> up<00:02:27.359> grinding<00:02:27.629> for<00:02:27.959> like

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
then I ended up grinding for like

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.020 
then I ended up grinding for like
another<00:02:28.230> two<00:02:28.590> hours<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.280> can<00:02:29.400> see<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:29.549> used<00:02:29.640> two

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
another two hours you can see I used two

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.240 
another two hours you can see I used two
gems<00:02:30.329> that<00:02:30.450> I'm<00:02:30.569> almost<00:02:30.750> level<00:02:31.049> 215<00:02:31.799> so<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.040> went

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
gems that I'm almost level 215 so I went

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.979 
gems that I'm almost level 215 so I went
up<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.760> entire<00:02:33.000> experience<00:02:33.420> mark<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.870> as

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
up like the entire experience mark is as

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.479 
up like the entire experience mark is as
empty<00:02:34.200> before<00:02:34.819> doing<00:02:35.819> pal<00:02:36.359> pal<00:02:37.049> Nia<00:02:37.489> that

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
empty before doing pal pal Nia that

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.670 
empty before doing pal pal Nia that
earth<00:02:38.790> place<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.689> I<00:02:39.900> finally<00:02:40.170> got<00:02:40.260> earth<00:02:40.439> pot

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
earth place and I finally got earth pot

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.160 
earth place and I finally got earth pot
after<00:02:41.219> however<00:02:42.209> many<00:02:42.359> runs<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.959> was

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
after however many runs that was

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.520 
after however many runs that was
probably<00:02:43.769> like<00:02:44.150> 20<00:02:45.150> runs<00:02:45.329> or<00:02:45.480> something<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.439> I

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
probably like 20 runs or something and I

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.679 
probably like 20 runs or something and I
evolved<00:02:46.919> my<00:02:47.069> golem<00:02:47.459> into<00:02:47.669> a<00:02:47.760> six-star<00:02:48.299> units

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
evolved my golem into a six-star units

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.309 
evolved my golem into a six-star units
and<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.760> end<00:02:50.909> of<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.629> so<00:02:52.139> that's

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
and that is the end of that so that's

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.369 
and that is the end of that so that's
