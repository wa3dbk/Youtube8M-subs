liquid<00:00:05.879> you<00:00:06.029> know<00:00:06.180> we're<00:00:07.130> very<00:00:08.130> similar<00:00:08.790> to

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
liquid you know we're very similar to

this<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.920> take<00:00:17.250> those<00:00:17.460> parts<00:00:17.940> of

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
this you can take those parts of

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.790 
this you can take those parts of
estimate<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.660> amount<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.990> weight<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.410> your

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
estimate the amount of weight and your

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.120 
estimate the amount of weight and your
trace<00:00:20.070> imaginary<00:00:20.789> it's<00:00:21.570> something<00:00:21.990> Tony<00:00:22.470> so

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
trace imaginary it's something Tony so

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.800 
trace imaginary it's something Tony so
I'm<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.640> get<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> first<00:00:24.210> step<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.600> about

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
I'm just to get the first step is about

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.929 
I'm just to get the first step is about
one<00:00:25.380> faisal<00:00:25.800> Grail<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.369> might<00:00:26.550> see<00:00:26.730> very

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
one faisal Grail that you might see very

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.169 
one faisal Grail that you might see very
automated<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:28.039> to<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> list<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:29.910> what's

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
automated so to the list you but what's

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.350 
automated so to the list you but what's
doing<00:00:30.630> g<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:32.040> mostly<00:00:32.369> refer<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:32.940> as<00:00:33.090> some

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
doing g we mostly refer to this as some

doing g we mostly refer to this as some
box<00:00:33.600> rails<00:00:33.989> where<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.860> three<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.520> box<00:00:35.850> in

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
box rails where you have three a box in

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.380 
box rails where you have three a box in
front<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.809> jus<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.620> rectangular<00:00:38.460> shape<00:00:38.760> and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
front of jus a rectangular shape and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.930 
front of jus a rectangular shape and
it's<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.809> your<00:00:39.989> hands<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.620> trace<00:00:41.010> around

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
it's in your hands and you trace around

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.979 
it's in your hands and you trace around
that<00:00:42.300> box<00:00:43.430> just<00:00:44.430> one<00:00:44.760> very<00:00:45.210> simple<00:00:45.539> variation

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
that box just one very simple variation

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.650 
that box just one very simple variation
of<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.440> would<00:00:47.219> be<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.579> trace<00:00:47.850> around<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> box

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
of that would be to trace around the box

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.990 
of that would be to trace around the box
so<00:00:49.170> easily<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.160> trace<00:00:50.489> around<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
so easily and then trace around the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.750 
so easily and then trace around the
bottom<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> bottle<00:00:54.020> that's<00:00:55.100> one<00:00:56.100> basic

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
bottom of the bottle that's one basic

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.209 
bottom of the bottle that's one basic
rail<00:00:57.000> another<00:00:57.570> simple<00:00:58.350> rail<00:00:58.739> would<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
rail another simple rail would be the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.389 
rail another simple rail would be the
stair<00:00:59.520> several<00:01:00.059> degrees<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:01.199> night<00:01:01.469> i<00:01:02.219> guess

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
stair several degrees that night i guess

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.109 
stair several degrees that night i guess
i<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.699> credit<00:01:02.879> ele<00:01:03.530> shows<00:01:04.530> me<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.909> just

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
i can credit ele shows me but it's just

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.390 
i can credit ele shows me but it's just
to<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> concept<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.320> incoming<00:01:07.860> moving

your hands the harder it is going to be

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:32.240 
your hands the harder it is going to be
to<00:01:20.460> maintain<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.119> illusion<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.650> rail<00:01:31.250> so

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
to maintain the illusion of this rail so

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.069 
to maintain the illusion of this rail so
that's<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.549> bigger<00:01:32.790> pocket<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.509> bigger<00:01:33.750> head

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
that's a bigger pocket with bigger head

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.170 
that's a bigger pocket with bigger head
justice<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.150> also<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.729> hands<00:01:38.729> or

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
justice you can also have your hands or

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.590 
justice you can also have your hands or
body<00:01:39.450> works<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.990> into<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.380> face<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.890> happy<00:01:41.880> up

past<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.680> book<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.549> instance<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.970> have

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
past that book so for instance you have

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.830 
past that book so for instance you have
the<00:01:45.689> standard<00:01:46.259> Bach<00:01:46.560> rail<00:01:47.240> but<00:01:48.240> now<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.689> you

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the standard Bach rail but now if you

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.780 
the standard Bach rail but now if you
were<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:50.070> go<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
were to take it and just go up with it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.660 
were to take it and just go up with it
and<00:01:51.180> move<00:01:51.540> power<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.040> would<00:01:53.159> kind<00:01:53.400> of<00:01:53.490> be

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and move power and it would kind of be

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.480 
and move power and it would kind of be
that<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.420> box<00:01:54.810> kind<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.409> moved<00:01:55.680> over<00:01:56.159> or<00:01:56.460> just

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that this box kind of moved over or just

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.969 
that this box kind of moved over or just
stand<00:01:56.970> right<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.360> despite<00:01:58.080> connected<00:01:58.770> time

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
stand right here despite connected time

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.410 
stand right here despite connected time
and<00:01:59.399> head<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.700> would<00:01:59.790> be<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.240> bottom

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and head it would be like the bottom

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.969 
and head it would be like the bottom

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
line there Matt admit you're and then we

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.300 
line there Matt admit you're and then we
do<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:03.080> real<00:02:04.080> another<00:02:04.590> way<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:04.860> look<00:02:04.979> at<00:02:05.130> real

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
do it real another way to look at real

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.749 
do it real another way to look at real
steel<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.420> say<00:02:07.140> yes<00:02:07.320> follow<00:02:07.649> chasing<00:02:08.610> men

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
steel as I say yes follow chasing men

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.590 
steel as I say yes follow chasing men
Jacobs<00:02:10.580> something<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.850> think<00:02:12.180> like<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
Jacobs something that I think like to

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.590 
Jacobs something that I think like to
forget<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:13.830> even<00:02:14.550> though<00:02:14.760> those<00:02:15.180> it's

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
forget is that even though those it's

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.500 
forget is that even though those it's
not<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> way<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:17.610> can<00:02:17.760> use<00:02:17.910> your<00:02:18.060> just<00:02:18.390> your
