very<00:02:08.940> straightforward<00:02:09.629> we<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.530> three

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
very straightforward we have three

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.380 
very straightforward we have three
volume<00:02:11.129> knobs<00:02:11.250> including<00:02:11.610> channel<00:02:11.879> 1<00:02:12.090> 2<00:02:12.540> &amp;<00:02:12.810> 3

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
volume knobs including channel 1 2 &amp; 3

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.450 
volume knobs including channel 1 2 &amp; 3
for<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:14.050> nice<00:02:14.200> thing<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.590> all<00:02:14.620> those<00:02:14.980> volume

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
for the nice thing is all those volume

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.670 
for the nice thing is all those volume
knobs<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:16.240> easily<00:02:16.690> be<00:02:16.840> turned<00:02:17.020> easily<00:02:17.260> be

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
knobs can easily be turned easily be

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.199 
knobs can easily be turned easily be
seen<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:18.040> also<00:02:18.160> protected<00:02:18.730> by<00:02:18.819> these<00:02:18.880> metal

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
seen it also protected by these metal

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.580 
seen it also protected by these metal
bars<00:02:19.480> on<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.750> outside<00:02:20.020> in<00:02:20.170> case<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.410> were<00:02:20.500> to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
bars on the outside in case you were to

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.410 
bars on the outside in case you were to
drop<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:21.010> there<00:02:21.340> also<00:02:21.490> is<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.730> peak<00:02:22.000> indicator

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
drop it there also is a peak indicator

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.730 
drop it there also is a peak indicator
so<00:02:22.630> in<00:02:22.720> case<00:02:22.900> you're<00:02:23.080> trying<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.410> figure<00:02:23.620> out

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
so in case you're trying to figure out

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.990 
so in case you're trying to figure out
whether<00:02:23.860> or<00:02:23.980> not<00:02:24.040> your<00:02:24.250> audio<00:02:24.550> is<00:02:24.610> peaking<00:02:24.940> or

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
whether or not your audio is peaking or

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.210 
whether or not your audio is peaking or
not<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.360> red<00:02:25.720> light<00:02:25.959> will<00:02:26.110> flash<00:02:26.319> if<00:02:26.740> your<00:02:26.920> audio

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
not a red light will flash if your audio

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.350 
not a red light will flash if your audio
starting<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.610> peak<00:02:27.790> one<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.120> things<00:02:28.240> I

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
starting to peak one of the things I

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.150 
starting to peak one of the things I
don't<00:02:28.600> really<00:02:28.750> like<00:02:28.870> about<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.170> dr-60d<00:02:29.830> mark

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
don't really like about the dr-60d mark

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.940 
don't really like about the dr-60d mark
2<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.790> that<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.540> audio<00:02:31.870> levels<00:02:32.230> are<00:02:32.350> very<00:02:32.650> hard

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
2 is that the audio levels are very hard

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.760 
2 is that the audio levels are very hard
to<00:02:33.130> read<00:02:33.340> there's<00:02:33.850> no<00:02:34.090> numbers<00:02:34.510> all<00:02:35.470> there<00:02:35.680> is

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
to read there's no numbers all there is

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.190 
to read there's no numbers all there is
is<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.040> little<00:02:36.370> triangle<00:02:37.360> basically<00:02:37.900> pointing

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
is a little triangle basically pointing

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.530 
is a little triangle basically pointing
down<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:39.010> triangle<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.060> negative

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
down and that triangle is the negative

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.440 
down and that triangle is the negative
12<00:02:40.900> DB<00:02:41.350> mark<00:02:41.730> originally<00:02:42.730> when<00:02:42.850> I<00:02:42.880> set<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.239> up<00:02:43.300> I

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
12 DB mark originally when I set it up I

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.670 
12 DB mark originally when I set it up I
kind<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.690> thought<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:43.930> was<00:02:44.140> like<00:02:44.530> the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
kind of thought that was like the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.340 
kind of thought that was like the
negative<00:02:44.830> 3<00:02:45.310> negative<00:02:45.520> 6<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.810> was<00:02:46.989> kind<00:02:47.260> of

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
negative 3 negative 6 so I was kind of

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.650 
negative 3 negative 6 so I was kind of
doing<00:02:47.560> mine<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.739> little<00:02:47.950> too<00:02:48.160> low<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:49.420> now<00:02:49.510> that

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
doing mine a little too low but now that

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.120 
doing mine a little too low but now that
I<00:02:49.690> figured<00:02:49.959> that<00:02:50.050> out<00:02:50.080> it's<00:02:50.350> much<00:02:50.620> easier<00:02:50.980> so

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
I figured that out it's much easier so

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.130 
I figured that out it's much easier so
definitely<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:51.670> want<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.880> set<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.269> where

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
definitely you want to set it to where

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.479 
definitely you want to set it to where
you're<00:02:53.350> you<00:02:53.620> know<00:02:53.709> obviously<00:02:54.100> above<00:02:54.370> that

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
you're you know obviously above that

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.220 
you're you know obviously above that
negative<00:02:54.880> 12<00:02:55.090> mark<00:02:55.300> one<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:55.989> things<00:02:56.140> I

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
negative 12 mark one of the things I

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.449 
negative 12 mark one of the things I
noticed<00:02:56.500> when<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.620> originally<00:02:56.950> got<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.100> device

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
noticed when I originally got the device

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.220 
noticed when I originally got the device
is<00:02:57.610> that<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.730> was<00:02:57.850> very<00:02:58.180> quiet<00:02:58.570> out<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.019> box

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
is that it was very quiet out of the box

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.380 
is that it was very quiet out of the box
but<00:02:59.739> I<00:02:59.800> didn't<00:03:00.190> realize<00:03:00.459> is<00:03:00.640> in<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.060> menu

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
but I didn't realize is in the menu

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.270 
but I didn't realize is in the menu
system<00:03:01.540> there's<00:03:01.900> actually<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> menu<00:03:02.709> preamp

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
system there's actually a menu preamp

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.960 
system there's actually a menu preamp
volume<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:05.140> for<00:03:05.380> me<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.769> put<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.519> medium

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
volume so for me I put that medium

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.060 
volume so for me I put that medium
preamp<00:03:07.390> there<00:03:07.930> also<00:03:08.110> is<00:03:08.350> low<00:03:08.590> which<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
preamp there also is low which is the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.680 
preamp there also is low which is the
default<00:03:09.190> there's<00:03:09.670> medium<00:03:10.060> there's<00:03:10.330> high<00:03:10.510> and

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
default there's medium there's high and

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.100 
default there's medium there's high and
there's<00:03:10.840> Ultra<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.500> don't<00:03:12.370> see<00:03:12.940> where<00:03:13.630> high<00:03:13.930> and

it up and post anyway that way have a
little<00:03:22.120> more<00:03:22.269> control<00:03:22.390> we're<00:03:22.750> not<00:03:22.870> peeking

little more control we're not peeking
now<00:03:24.040> speaking<00:03:24.459> of<00:03:24.610> peaking<00:03:24.940> there<00:03:25.060> also<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:25.420> a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
now speaking of peaking there also is a

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.240 
now speaking of peaking there also is a
limiter<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:25.900> here<00:03:26.140> which<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:26.530> really<00:03:26.829> great<00:03:26.980> if

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
limiter on here which is really great if

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.530 
limiter on here which is really great if
you're<00:03:27.370> gonna<00:03:27.459> be<00:03:27.640> recording<00:03:28.060> somewhere<00:03:28.360> like

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
you're gonna be recording somewhere like

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.300 
you're gonna be recording somewhere like
a<00:03:28.570> wedding<00:03:28.840> or<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:29.530> don't<00:03:29.680> really<00:03:29.980> know<00:03:30.130> what

a wedding or you don't really know what
the<00:03:30.430> volumes<00:03:30.880> of<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.180> atmosphere<00:03:31.810> could<00:03:31.989> be

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
the volumes of the atmosphere could be

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.900 
the volumes of the atmosphere could be
they<00:03:32.620> could<00:03:32.769> go<00:03:32.860> from<00:03:33.040> high<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.220> low<00:03:33.489> they

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
they could go from high to low they

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.699 
they could go from high to low they
could<00:03:34.030> also<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.510> know<00:03:34.540> peaking<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.410> spiking

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
could also you know peaking and spiking

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.500 
could also you know peaking and spiking
here<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.160> there<00:03:36.280> so<00:03:36.850> that's<00:03:37.000> also<00:03:37.150> one<00:03:37.360> of<00:03:37.390> the

tascam dr-60d mark ii runs on batteries
for<00:03:51.940> double-a<00:03:52.450> batteries<00:03:52.900> but<00:03:53.320> one<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.500> the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
for double-a batteries but one of the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.080 
for double-a batteries but one of the
greatest<00:03:53.860> things<00:03:54.190> about<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.489> too<00:03:54.640> is<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:54.850> can

it<00:04:43.680> this<00:04:44.680> thing<00:04:44.950> I<00:04:45.250> have<00:04:45.610> not<00:04:46.330> yet<00:04:46.690> got<00:04:46.750> even

it this thing I have not yet got even

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.320 
it this thing I have not yet got even
close<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:47.890> running<00:04:48.040> out<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.310> battery<00:04:48.640> on<00:04:48.790> so

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
close to running out the battery on so

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.800 
close to running out the battery on so
I'm<00:04:49.480> assuming<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.050> could<00:04:50.200> probably<00:04:50.410> shoot<00:04:51.810> 14

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
I'm assuming you could probably shoot 14

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.360 
I'm assuming you could probably shoot 14

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
this now the dr-60d also does take SD

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.710 
this now the dr-60d also does take SD
cards<00:04:57.610> which<00:04:57.700> is<00:04:57.850> very<00:04:58.060> nice<00:04:58.240> because<00:04:58.450> of

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
cards which is very nice because of

course as a videographer you have a lot

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.860 
course as a videographer you have a lot
laying<00:05:00.340> around<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:01.090> cool<00:05:01.300> thing<00:05:01.480> is<00:05:01.540> too<00:05:01.750> is

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
laying around the cool thing is too is

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.750 
laying around the cool thing is too is
if<00:05:02.020> you're<00:05:02.140> doing<00:05:02.350> sound<00:05:02.590> design<00:05:03.010> this<00:05:03.580> is

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
if you're doing sound design this is

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.730 
if you're doing sound design this is
awesome<00:05:04.270> two<00:05:04.420> runs<00:05:04.690> on<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.930> SD<00:05:05.260> card<00:05:05.500> but<00:05:05.620> the

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
awesome two runs on the SD card but the

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.350 
awesome two runs on the SD card but the
batteries<00:05:06.160> it's<00:05:06.310> gonna<00:05:06.400> last<00:05:06.700> a<00:05:06.820> long<00:05:07.060> long

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
batteries it's gonna last a long long

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.320 
batteries it's gonna last a long long
time<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:08.620> don't<00:05:09.130> have<00:05:09.340> a<00:05:09.370> built-in<00:05:09.910> mic<00:05:10.120> like

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
time you don't have a built-in mic like

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.680 
time you don't have a built-in mic like
the<00:05:10.450> zoom<00:05:10.660> h4n<00:05:10.900> or<00:05:11.440> h6<00:05:12.070> or<00:05:12.220> 85<00:05:12.580> so<00:05:13.450> that's<00:05:13.600> a

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
the zoom h4n or h6 or 85 so that's a

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.330 
the zoom h4n or h6 or 85 so that's a
little<00:05:13.900> bit<00:05:14.050> of<00:05:14.140> a<00:05:14.200> downside<00:05:14.380> but<00:05:14.860> if<00:05:14.980> you<00:05:15.070> step

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
little bit of a downside but if you step

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.660 
little bit of a downside but if you step
up<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.820> dr<00:05:16.540> 70d<00:05:17.320> there<00:05:17.860> is<00:05:18.010> built-in<00:05:18.430> mics

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
up to the dr 70d there is built-in mics

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.360 
up to the dr 70d there is built-in mics
the<00:05:19.660> menus<00:05:19.960> are<00:05:20.080> very<00:05:20.260> easy<00:05:20.500> on<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.770> dr-60d
