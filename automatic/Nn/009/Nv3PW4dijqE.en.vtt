especially if you don't like coffee
that's<00:02:48.709> great<00:02:49.070> but<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.670> personally<00:02:50.270> really

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
that's great but I personally really

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.780 
that's great but I personally really
like<00:02:50.930> coffee<00:02:51.350> like<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:51.830> said<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.070> like<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.580> taste

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
like coffee like I said I like the taste

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.080 
like coffee like I said I like the taste
so<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:54.080> think<00:02:54.230> coffee<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.280> moderation<00:02:55.640> is

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
so I think coffee and moderation is

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.190 
so I think coffee and moderation is
totally<00:02:56.630> fine

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
totally fine

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.310 
totally fine
