 I am brand pony good and welcome to a 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.910
 Quick tip is a tip if I say yes 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.099
 they want to apply those that are good if they do not take 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.880
 from malaga you know, I say no problem 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.660
 it is worth and good here they will see the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.660
 cortitos 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.560
 to recommend a cyst and gentlemen 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.349
 many these weeks kits this good 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.520
 scores tricks are hardly used by race and 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.559
 good gentlemen is the one of machine the subject 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.020
 china is a sneaky traitor soto all 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.489
 it's ok it's like a carling or not but 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.190
 which is called the machine here I do not know why 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.379
 what and it's fine two years to whom 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.059
 it's the thing 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.950
 manageable and because it is chingÃ³n 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.350
 well I will explain the des machines 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.570
 gentlemen here and also the war machine 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.050
 any two this does the function 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.969
 to have a secondary weapon 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.890
 but a good gun cracker na na 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.590
 in situ you basically get more 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.360
 of 300 bullets and this is going to last you 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.670
 for a long time and now until the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.340
 quick bullets is not so bullets you 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.780
 They last a shit but it helps you carry 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.140
 a secondary weapon then for example 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.460
 complete classes like the ones that I use with 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.470
 you throw in villajovita that I am 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.080
 pulling out of good diamond that I want 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.670
 They take diamond strap because they have 6 perks 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.100
 and I have 5 but if they have the weapon 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.920
 combined with two attacks and I'm already 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.460
 they filled 16 2 ok then I having 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.100
 this one you say that this score is 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.770
 meditate more I do not accustom through 216 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.140
 this but stopping this this is 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.149
 build which is the best does not give you the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.130
 freedom to change to a weapon and a weapon 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.750
 that is many galletons take out the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.390
 back because it is very heavy and little 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.070
 movement but here comes the advice if 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.350
 you have stream conditioning and 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.870
 apart team lightweight believe me in the 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.390
 ring 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.940
 more is easy to move has no 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.100
 no complication and apart is very 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.200
 useful gentlemen who only have 25 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.550
 25 deaths but this combination of 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.170
 Scottish that brings here that was the 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.060
 helicopter on the reel I put it on 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.650
 obama but the counter and with the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.479
 machine works very well for the public 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.000
 is coming while you are giving 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.860
 steps gum with that mother and apart what 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.690
 they listen and like everyone says to the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.550
 mother and they start to run and good to 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.870
 recite this was the advice of whites 2 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.040
 but that you like if you like this 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.990
 kind of advice and ccoo say that 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.460
 try random warn me and with everything 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.660
 I recommend it to you later 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.290
 reciting 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.290
 and such 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 ah 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.860
