00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
hey guys this is Michael Tala with click

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.520 
hey guys this is Michael Tala with click
so<00:00:11.700> recently<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.300> was<00:00:12.570> asked<00:00:12.929> how<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.110> was<00:00:13.410> able

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
so recently I was asked how I was able

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.430 
so recently I was asked how I was able
to<00:00:13.740> get<00:00:13.860> these<00:00:14.009> images<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.849> fit<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.299> perfectly

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
to get these images to fit so perfectly

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.830 
to get these images to fit so perfectly
within<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.740> thumbnail<00:00:17.279> placeholders<00:00:18.000> used

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
within the thumbnail placeholders used

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.170 
within the thumbnail placeholders used
to<00:00:18.960> represent<00:00:19.140> apps<00:00:19.619> within<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.609> desktop<00:00:20.760> hub

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
to represent apps within the desktop hub

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.330 
to represent apps within the desktop hub
of<00:00:21.420> clixsense<00:00:21.960> desktop<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.710> figured<00:00:23.250> I'd

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
of clixsense desktop I figured I'd

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.740 
of clixsense desktop I figured I'd
create<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> quick<00:00:23.820> video<00:00:23.970> just<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.449> show<00:00:24.510> you

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
create a quick video just to show you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.950 
create a quick video just to show you
some<00:00:25.260> tips<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.130> techniques<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.119> use<00:00:27.210> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
some tips and techniques that I use to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.990 
some tips and techniques that I use to
get<00:00:28.109> images<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.740> all<00:00:28.980> sizes<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.460> fit<00:00:29.640> that

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
get images of all sizes to fit that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.150 
get images of all sizes to fit that
perfectly<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.840> technique<00:00:31.230> also<00:00:31.590> probably

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
perfectly this technique also probably

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.799 
perfectly this technique also probably
work<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.520> lot<00:00:32.669> better<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.090> images<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.510> are

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
work a lot better with images that are

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.260 
work a lot better with images that are
much<00:00:34.770> smaller<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.700> might<00:00:35.850> want<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.120> use

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
much smaller that you might want to use

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.600 
much smaller that you might want to use
for<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> thumbnails<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.370> please<00:00:38.370> be<00:00:38.520> aware

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
for the thumbnails so please be aware

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.100 
for the thumbnails so please be aware
that<00:00:38.820> within<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.420> help<00:00:39.629> site<00:00:39.840> they<00:00:40.050> do

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that within the help site they do

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.410 
that within the help site they do
describe<00:00:40.590> how<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.980> add<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.610> thumbnail<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.360> well

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
describe how to add a thumbnail as well

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.170 
describe how to add a thumbnail as well
as<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.379> optimal<00:00:43.920> aspect<00:00:44.399> ratio<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
as the optimal aspect ratio for the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.819 
as the optimal aspect ratio for the
thumbnail<00:00:45.360> also<00:00:46.079> I'd<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.500> point<00:00:46.649> out

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
thumbnail also I'd like to point out

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.680 
thumbnail also I'd like to point out
that<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.610> images<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.210> clixsense

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that all of the images with clixsense

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.170 
that all of the images with clixsense
desktop<00:00:49.260> are<00:00:49.500> put<00:00:50.430> within<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.879> default

click<00:00:54.480> sense<00:00:55.050> content<00:00:55.680> default<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.850> also

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
click sense content default we can also

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.459 
click sense content default we can also
create<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.449> number<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.870> folders<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.410> store

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
create a number of folders to store

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.150 
create a number of folders to store
images<00:00:58.800> or<00:00:59.190> organize<00:00:59.609> them<00:00:59.879> appropriately<00:01:01.160> so

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
images or organize them appropriately so

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.200 
images or organize them appropriately so
let's<00:01:02.340> say<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> create<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:04.100> factory

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
let's say I'm going to create a factory

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.370 
let's say I'm going to create a factory
application<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> want<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.810> an<00:01:06.930> image

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
application and I want to get an image

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.770 
application and I want to get an image
that<00:01:08.130> looks<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.580> factory<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.390> icon

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
that looks like a factory so this icon

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.480 
that looks like a factory so this icon
is<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.670> 256<00:01:11.670> by<00:01:11.909> 256<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.960> size<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:14.040> take<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
is a 256 by 256 in size and to take it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.999 
is a 256 by 256 in size and to take it
and<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:15.509> going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.720> save<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.080> directly<00:01:16.710> to

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and I'm going to save it directly to

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.789 
and I'm going to save it directly to
that<00:01:17.159> default<00:01:17.490> location<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.530> then<00:01:19.530> I'm<00:01:19.710> going

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
that default location and then I'm going

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.249 
that default location and then I'm going
to<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:19.950> into<00:01:20.130> clixsense<00:01:20.759> desktop<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.600> let's

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
to go into clixsense desktop and let's

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.390 
to go into clixsense desktop and let's
create<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.950> new<00:01:23.610> app<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.240> we'll<00:01:24.630> call<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.930> one

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
create a new app and we'll call this one

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.940 
create a new app and we'll call this one
factory<00:01:26.400> test<00:01:29.270> open<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> app<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.770> will

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
factory test open the app and this will

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.560 
factory test open the app and this will
bring<00:01:32.040> us<00:01:32.250> into<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> app<00:01:32.700> overview<00:01:33.299> page

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
bring us into the app overview page

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.600 
bring us into the app overview page
where<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.079> edit<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.159> title<00:01:35.340> and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
where I can edit the title and

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
where I can edit the title and
description<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:36.240> well<00:01:36.299> as<00:01:36.630> change<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
description as well as change the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.770 
description as well as change the
thumbnail<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.369> by<00:01:38.490> default<00:01:38.880> if<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.299> select<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
thumbnail so by default if I select the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.810 
thumbnail so by default if I select the
factory<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> nice<00:01:41.220> preview<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.700> that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
factory we have a nice preview of that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.580 
factory we have a nice preview of that
again<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.479> list<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.960> being<00:01:43.140> read<00:01:43.380> from<00:01:43.530> that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
again this list is being read from that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.710 
again this list is being read from that
default<00:01:44.040> directory<00:01:44.220> structure<00:01:44.759> when<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> click

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
default directory structure when I click

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.600 
default directory structure when I click
apply<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.560> stretches<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.310> fit

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
apply you can see it stretches it to fit

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.910 
apply you can see it stretches it to fit
the<00:01:47.759> space<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.329> available<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.470> we<00:01:49.740> don't

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the space that's available so we don't

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.770 
the space that's available so we don't
want<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.939> I'm<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.450> is

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
want that so what I'm going to do is

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.469 
want that so what I'm going to do is
we're<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.799> take<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.759> I'm<00:01:54.360> going

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
we're going to take this and I'm going

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.770 
we're going to take this and I'm going
to<00:01:54.540> edit<00:01:54.689> inside<00:01:55.490> fireworks<00:01:56.490> which<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
to edit inside fireworks which is just a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.200 
to edit inside fireworks which is just a
graphical<00:01:58.380> tool<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.280> use<00:01:59.640> it's<00:02:00.180> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
