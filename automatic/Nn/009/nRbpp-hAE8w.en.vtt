how<00:00:00.390> come<00:00:00.900> sometimes<00:00:01.140> your<00:00:01.560> hair<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:02.149> pink<00:00:03.149> and

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
how come sometimes your hair is pink and

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.579 
how come sometimes your hair is pink and
sometimes<00:00:04.080> is<00:00:04.910> smooth

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
sometimes is smooth

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.770 
sometimes is smooth
that's<00:00:07.589> called<00:00:07.830> shrinkage<00:00:08.639> every<00:00:09.389> grow<00:00:09.570> of

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
that's called shrinkage every grow of

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.870 
that's called shrinkage every grow of
tech<00:00:09.990> for<00:00:10.260> hair<00:00:10.500> will<00:00:10.740> find<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.309> there<00:00:11.519> has<00:00:11.700> a

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
tech for hair will find that there has a

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.660 
tech for hair will find that there has a
tendency<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:13.049> recoil<00:00:13.559> towards<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> sculpt

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
tendency to recoil towards the sculpt

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.590 
tendency to recoil towards the sculpt
the<00:00:15.420> way<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.839> prevent<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.859> shrinkage<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:18.060> to

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
the way to prevent that shrinkage is to

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.450 
the way to prevent that shrinkage is to
stretch<00:00:18.990> their<00:00:19.230> hair<00:00:19.410> by<00:00:19.859> twisting<00:00:20.369> it

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
stretch their hair by twisting it

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.269 
stretch their hair by twisting it
platting<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.810> using<00:00:22.619> some<00:00:22.800> sort<00:00:23.220> of

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
platting it or using some sort of

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.200 
platting it or using some sort of
curling<00:00:23.640> rod<00:00:24.029> or<00:00:24.240> flexi<00:00:24.720> rod<00:00:25.010> why<00:00:26.010> not<00:00:26.400> leave

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
curling rod or flexi rod why not leave

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.689 
curling rod or flexi rod why not leave
your<00:00:27.449> hair<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.170> shrunken<00:00:28.529> state<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> think

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
your hair in the shrunken state I think

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.999 
your hair in the shrunken state I think
it<00:00:29.789> looks<00:00:29.939> quite<00:00:30.359> nice<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.810> also<00:00:31.590> don't<00:00:31.830> mind

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
it looks quite nice I also don't mind

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.380 
it looks quite nice I also don't mind
shrinkage<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.980> shrunken<00:00:34.980> hair<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.520> harder<00:00:36.360> to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
shrinkage but shrunken hair is harder to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.959 
shrinkage but shrunken hair is harder to
handle<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.960> harder<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.380> style<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.520> if<00:00:38.879> you

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
handle it's harder to style so if you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.160 
handle it's harder to style so if you
want<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.329> stars<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:39.809> I've<00:00:39.930> done<00:00:40.079> today

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
want to do stars like I've done today

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
you know I twisted it up and pinned it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.260 
you know I twisted it up and pinned it
up<00:00:42.239> yeah<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:43.079> my<00:00:43.379> head<00:00:43.559> shrunken<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.190> could<00:00:44.969> not

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
up yeah if my head shrunken I could not

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.819 
up yeah if my head shrunken I could not
do<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.600> hmmm<00:00:47.210> shrunken<00:00:48.210> hair<00:00:48.450> tends<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> not

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
do that hmmm shrunken hair tends to not

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.270 
do that hmmm shrunken hair tends to not
untangle<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.670> lot<00:00:51.239> more<00:00:51.510> than<00:00:52.199> non<00:00:52.860> shrunken

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
untangle a lot more than non shrunken

untangle a lot more than non shrunken
head<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.360> prefer<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> stretch<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
head so I just prefer to stretch it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.950 
head so I just prefer to stretch it
after<00:00:56.129> you've<00:00:56.250> done<00:00:56.460> your<00:00:56.670> wash<00:00:56.969> routine<00:00:57.390> you

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
after you've done your wash routine you

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.700 
after you've done your wash routine you
weekly<00:00:58.320> wash<00:00:58.969> tap<00:00:59.969> your<00:01:00.210> hair<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.530> when

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
weekly wash tap your hair what what when

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.619 
weekly wash tap your hair what what when
I<00:01:01.739> first<00:01:01.980> went<00:01:02.160> natural<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.699> found<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.059> platic

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
I first went natural I found that platic

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.050 
I first went natural I found that platic
stretches<00:01:04.379> hair<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> most<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.790> my<00:01:05.909> hair

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
stretches hair the most now that my hair

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.230 
stretches hair the most now that my hair
is<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.210> bit<00:01:06.390> longer<00:01:07.189> twisting<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.430> okay<00:01:09.030> because

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
is a bit longer twisting is okay because

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.820 
is a bit longer twisting is okay because
even<00:01:09.540> though<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.990> doesn't<00:01:10.200> stretch<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.650> hair

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
even though it doesn't stretch the hair

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.130 
even though it doesn't stretch the hair
as<00:01:10.950> much<00:01:10.979> my<00:01:11.700> hair<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.090> still<00:01:12.270> long<00:01:12.450> enough<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
as much my hair is still long enough to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
as much my hair is still long enough to
manipulate<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.799> style<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.490> day<00:01:14.670> after<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
manipulate in style the day after and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
manipulate in style the day after and
twisting<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> lot<00:01:16.380> quicker<00:01:16.590> than<00:01:16.740> planting

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
twisting is a lot quicker than planting

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.219 
twisting is a lot quicker than planting
so<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> prefer<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.030> because<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.270> know<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.659> got<00:01:19.200> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
so I prefer it because you know I got a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.859 
so I prefer it because you know I got a
lot<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.470> things<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.220> my<00:01:20.280> time<00:01:20.670> okay

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
lot of things to do with my time okay

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.210 
lot of things to do with my time okay
yeah<00:01:22.799> that's<00:01:23.040> pretty<00:01:23.189> much<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.950 

have<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.340> ever<00:01:28.490> tried<00:01:28.729> to<00:01:28.940> stretch<00:01:29.570> your<00:01:29.750> hair

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
when I was relaxed I just use these

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.170 
when I was relaxed I just use these
velcro<00:01:36.560> rollers<00:01:37.190> rollers<00:01:37.430> that<00:01:37.610> put<00:01:37.910> a<00:01:37.940> little

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
velcro rollers rollers that put a little

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.460 
velcro rollers rollers that put a little
prickly<00:01:38.420> things<00:01:38.780> all<00:01:38.960> over<00:01:39.170> them

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.770 
oh my god when I try to use them on
natural<00:01:42.740> hair<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:43.369> could<00:01:43.970> literally<00:01:44.450> feel<00:01:44.720> my

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
natural hair I could literally feel my

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.420 
natural hair I could literally feel my
hair<00:01:45.110> going<00:01:46.240> so<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.570> just<00:01:47.869> decided<00:01:48.200> not<00:01:48.650> to

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
hair going so I just decided not to

continue<00:01:49.850> it<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.119> tried<00:01:50.390> two<00:01:50.660> patches<00:01:50.900> of

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
continue it and I tried two patches of

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.830 
continue it and I tried two patches of
hair<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:51.770> velcro<00:01:52.369> rollers<00:01:52.790> don't<00:01:53.509> use<00:01:53.660> them

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
hair so velcro rollers don't use them

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.990 
hair so velcro rollers don't use them
two<00:01:55.869> flexi<00:01:56.869> rods<00:01:57.110> are<00:01:57.800> something<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:58.729> wish
