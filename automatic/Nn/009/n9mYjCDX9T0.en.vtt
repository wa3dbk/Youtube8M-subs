00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.469
 which is the red of lips that more os 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.389
 favors for that reason today I am going to give you 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.059

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.490
 be helpful red is a classic never 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.220
 it's out of fashion but not all reds are 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.439
 The same is very flattering and feels very 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.640
 well always when we choose the red 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.919
 that best suits our 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.840
 characteristics there are two types of harmony 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.169
 that determine the red of lips that more 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.090
 we favor the quality or the cold the 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.060
 quality harmony are those skins more 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.070
 golden or yellow and red 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.050
 lips that favors them most is the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.360
 orange because it illuminates a lot this 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.940
 skin type otherwise harmony 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.520
 cold are those skins more pink or 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.670
 bluish and the red ones that favor them 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.160
 they are passion red, raspberry red or 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.350
 the red that pulls pink as you know if the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.820
 skin is warm or it is cold what you can 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.250
 to do is look inside the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.940
 dolls if the superficial veins are 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.220
 more greenish the harmony is warm you have 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.100
 a more golden skin 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.530
 or yellowish if they are otherwise 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.430
 more bluish are those white skins 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.470
 some pink or brown skins more 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.240
 Bluish another proof that you can do 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.550
 to know the kind of harmony that has 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.890
 your skin is to see what color you 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.200
 favors whether silver or gold 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.930
 You can catch a jewel that is larger than 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.720
 you have by house and compare it in front 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.390
 of the mirror if it favors more the golden 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.460
 you have a warm harmony 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.670
 if on the contrary you favor more 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.470
 silver you have a cold harmony now yes 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.100
 let's look at the red that we most 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.200
 favors 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.600
 we found warm reds and also 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.940
 cold red rivers have more 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.460
 blue pigmentation and warm reds 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.550
 they have more yellow pigmentation for 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.420
 that you understand well with these two 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:00.259
 lipsticks are both red but if you 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.479
 you fix this one here it's more orange and 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.440
 this one here more pinkish therefore 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.480
 This is ideal for warmer skins and 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.050
 this one here more pink is ideal for 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.810
 skins 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.540

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.880
 It is very easy to know what red is good for us 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.430
 more but to understand it better I'm going to 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.790
 put in situation what red lipstick you 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.680
 favors more if your hair is brown and 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.290
 your skin tone is intermediate with eyes 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.300
 You can use green or blue browns 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.520
 a wide range of colors but if not 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.280
 you know exactly what your harmony is and 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.530
 doubts in your choice a lipstick like this 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.050
 You can not miss in your basics a 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.900
 neutral red that feels good to almost everything 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.900
 the world 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900
 i 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.530
 If your skin is brown but has a sub 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.049
 yellow tone characteristic of 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.840
 Latina women you will lay great these 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:59.230
 tones the red purple of jennifer lÃ³pez 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.230
 a garnet-reddish brown or burgundy 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.709
 if you have a cold harmony you are blonde 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.720
 you have light skin, clear eyes or 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.540
 otherwise you are very dark with a your 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.480
 bluish tone choose a lip like this 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.819
 with a sub-pink tone it 's a cold red 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.629

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.629
 whites 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.600
 if you are redhead with pigmentation 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.060
 Copper or gold, the best option will be a 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.310

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.150
 but if you want a more dramatic touch 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.430
 try a little darker 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.280
 if you are redhead but with a sub tone 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.280
 cold uses a pink or coral red 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.060

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.780
