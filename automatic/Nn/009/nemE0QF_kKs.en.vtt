00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.420
 jojo second video so now it's on 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.150
 potted quite interesting and indeed 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.290
 I explained in the first video 15 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.059
 grams per kilogram of body weight 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.949
 are completely sufficient 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.210
 Now I explain why and again 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:23.130
 complains that is the interesting and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:27.090
 not just blah, first of all more 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.760
 no longer brings everyone to the solarium 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.550
 knows that 15 minutes usually 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.829
 completely sufficient if now one 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.170
 colleague says German 60 minutes 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.579
 if I am still brown then the colleague 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.840
 no idea heavy burns 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.239
 second grade at the bar about ten 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.050
 Stay at home for a while 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.809
 burns partly relatively fast 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.320
 but already needs seven to 14 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.270
 day that a sear has namely 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.320
 over the corner of the mahle germ line of 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.320
 epithelial cells 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.159
 that means no more brings more 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.979
 I explain that in mine as well 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.510
 training videos that intense her 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.100
 The more muscles you need , the more training you need 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.450
 not that you are longer or the same 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.530
 more often or more often if the protein 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.000
 Factor would be for fast muscle building 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:29.369
 then you would only bodybuilder one 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.740
 meet kitchen and not in the studio only on 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.240
 prepare food and maybe know 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.860
 you one or the other the enormous 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.369
 a lot of protein does not work that well 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.390
 looks 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.390
 now comes the reason why 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.200
 excess protein is in the 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.810
 connective tissue 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.780
 that is the fabric what the whole 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.350
 Body wrapped that's what I prefer 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.640
 with muscles organs bones tendons ligaments 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.000
 and so on without connective tissue if 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.090
 we practically collapse completely and 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.329
 what we meet with some women 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.610
 is not the so-called cellulite 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.509
 cellulitis because the android would be 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.120
 suggest what 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.670
 but it is an inflammatory disease 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.040
 rather a connective tissue weakness and that 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.890
 Connective tissue becomes weak in the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.739
 cellulite due to the storage of 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.519
 slag and due to the lack of 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.250
 vitamin C 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.790
 but that wants to know what I like now 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.920
 mine is when you mast a white 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.930
 you should just too much protein to 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.659
 built up around faster 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.680
 then you make a mistake and say that 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:43.739
 not by that very specifically says that 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:49.200
 Frankfurt doctor professor doctor 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:51.209
 med lothar wendt from 1907 to 1989 has the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.810
 Good man lived is 82 years old 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.709
 become 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.940
 ten years older than the average 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.730
 what the German team is here 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:06.840
 that is, in general, only strange 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.959
 nutrition and that has the term protein 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.510
 you make the term white 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.419
 mostly coined and that had said that 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.609
 if you eat too much of it a big one 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.019
 Part insert into the connective tissue 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.970
 you will be one or the other 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.730
 Bodybuilders have met the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.889
 Relatively short time worked properly 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.139
 but there was nothing left but there 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.599
 was nothing with definition now 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.280
 just moderately michelin-male 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.489
 become spongy which is also due 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.190
 because he would have to gain 4 grams a day 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.209
 take with eight shakes and then 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.250
 superimposed on the body enormous amounts 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.400
 excess protein in the connective tissue 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.989
 this is the garbage dump , so to speak 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.530
 of the body so that's what I say says that 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.599
 professor doctor with lothar band he was 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.949
 really in the exploration of 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:05.900
 protein metabolism groundbreaking 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.900
 on the human organism and 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.120
 it just works if only i have it 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.000
 she also medically explains now 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.280
 only protein 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.290
 the decisive factor would be for the 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.269
 Muscle building would make dirk a bodybuilder 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.880
 but in a studio meet 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.270
 generally only in the kitchen so pay attention 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.620
 on quality nutrition pay attention 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.660
 Fibers pay attention to fruits and vegetables 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.170
 pay attention to liquid that makes you 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.900
 most factor and does not go that way 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.310
 Often trained for training intensively 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.350
 loses with heavy weights 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.030
 squat in basic exercises 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.520
 Bench press cross raise or forward 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.490
 Buildings military press pull - ups 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.990
 the exercises are the ones to bring away with 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.419
 I have a cushion and at the rear 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.130
 pad in the back and I make 20 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.880
 repetitions and I again the 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.590
 adi and in peter hello how are you 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.080
 not three hours training four minutes 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.200
 56 that should be enough fun with 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.200
 the video
