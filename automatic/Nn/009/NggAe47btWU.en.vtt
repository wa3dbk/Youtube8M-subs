you stay nice and petite and ladylike on

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.479 
you stay nice and petite and ladylike on
that<00:02:37.290> note<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.890> know<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.250> lean<00:02:38.459> muscle

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
that note you know that lean muscle

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.060 
that note you know that lean muscle
takes<00:02:39.269> up<00:02:39.510> less<00:02:39.690> space<00:02:39.750> because<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.799> more

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
takes up less space because it is more

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.100 
takes up less space because it is more
dense<00:02:41.370> than<00:02:41.910> body<00:02:42.180> fat<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.690> if<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:43.080> a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
dense than body fat so if you have a

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.900 
dense than body fat so if you have a
pound<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.590> body<00:02:43.769> fat<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.160> going<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.400> be<00:02:44.519> big

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
pound of body fat it's going to be big

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.610 
pound of body fat it's going to be big
okay<00:02:45.390> it's<00:02:45.510> going<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.720> take<00:02:45.900> up<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.049> big<00:02:46.260> space

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
okay it's going to take up a big space

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.890 
okay it's going to take up a big space
this<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.220> why<00:02:47.280> we<00:02:47.400> always<00:02:47.489> tell<00:02:47.730> people

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
this is why we always tell people

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.050 
this is why we always tell people

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.559 
we need to talk about different effects
of<00:03:11.549> different<00:03:11.850> types<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.209> strength<00:03:12.420> training

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
of different types of strength training

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.479 
of different types of strength training
so<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.080> comes<00:03:13.560> down<00:03:13.709> these<00:03:13.920> two<00:03:14.130> are<00:03:14.250> kind<00:03:14.430> of

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
so this comes down these two are kind of

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.030 
so this comes down these two are kind of
a<00:03:14.580> package<00:03:15.300> deal<00:03:15.330> here<00:03:15.750> your<00:03:16.200> rep<00:03:16.470> range<00:03:16.739> and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
a package deal here your rep range and

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.190 
a package deal here your rep range and
your

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
your

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.990 
your
intensity<00:03:17.770> in<00:03:17.950> your<00:03:17.980> training<00:03:18.280> routines<00:03:18.760> are

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
intensity in your training routines are

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.449 
intensity in your training routines are
going<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.480> make<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.470> results<00:03:21.040> from<00:03:21.190> that

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
going to make the results from that

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.860 
going to make the results from that
training<00:03:21.730> very<00:03:22.060> different<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:22.569> if<00:03:22.750> you're

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
training very different so if you're

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.720 
training very different so if you're
doing<00:03:23.110> high<00:03:23.590> raveloe<00:03:24.099> weight<00:03:24.310> you're<00:03:24.550> more

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
doing high raveloe weight you're more

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.690 
doing high raveloe weight you're more
endurance<00:03:25.120> training<00:03:25.300> if<00:03:25.629> you're<00:03:25.720> doing<00:03:25.959> low

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
endurance training if you're doing low

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.400 
endurance training if you're doing low
rep<00:03:27.700> high<00:03:28.209> weight<00:03:28.540> you<00:03:28.810> are<00:03:28.840> doing<00:03:29.290> more

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
rep high weight you are doing more

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.660 
rep high weight you are doing more
strength<00:03:29.769> training<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.190> power<00:03:30.400> based

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
strength training and power based

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.910 
strength training and power based
training<00:03:30.940> more<00:03:31.450> explosive<00:03:32.019> movements<00:03:32.410> that

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
training more explosive movements that

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.009 
training more explosive movements that
is<00:03:33.160> going<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.519> increase<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.150> intensity<00:03:34.420> it's

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
is going to increase the intensity it's

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.930 
is going to increase the intensity it's
going<00:03:35.140> to<00:03:35.230> get<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.440> faster<00:03:35.950> fat<00:03:36.280> loss<00:03:36.489> results

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
going to get you faster fat loss results

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.220 
going to get you faster fat loss results
and<00:03:37.060> you're<00:03:37.150> probably<00:03:37.360> going<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.870> be<00:03:37.959> able<00:03:38.050> to

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
and you're probably going to be able to

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.570 
and you're probably going to be able to
sustain<00:03:38.620> them<00:03:38.800> longer<00:03:39.099> you're<00:03:39.280> going<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.430> get

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
that after burn effect where you're

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.410 
that after burn effect where you're
burning<00:03:41.500> calories<00:03:41.680> because<00:03:42.069> you're<00:03:42.420> making

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
burning calories because you're making

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.630

an<00:03:43.510> impact<00:03:43.780> on<00:03:43.989> your<00:03:44.080> metabolism<00:03:44.799> due<00:03:45.430> to

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
an impact on your metabolism due to

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.250 
an impact on your metabolism due to
putting<00:03:45.880> more<00:03:46.150> muscle<00:03:46.510> in<00:03:46.629> your<00:03:46.690> body<00:03:47.019> if

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
putting more muscle in your body if

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.860 
putting more muscle in your body if
you're<00:03:47.410> doing<00:03:47.680> high<00:03:48.010> rep<00:03:48.340> low<00:03:49.180> weight<00:03:49.450> more

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
you're doing high rep low weight more

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.120 
you're doing high rep low weight more
endurance<00:03:50.170> style<00:03:50.440> training<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.830> that's<00:03:50.890> all

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
endurance style training and that's all

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.920 
endurance style training and that's all
you're<00:03:51.370> doing<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.910> may<00:03:52.209> find<00:03:52.540> yourself

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
you're doing you may find yourself

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.259 
you're doing you may find yourself
plateauing<00:03:53.380> your<00:03:53.950> body<00:03:54.160> adapts<00:03:54.760> very<00:03:54.790> quickly

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
plateauing your body adapts very quickly

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.300 
plateauing your body adapts very quickly
the<00:03:55.630> intensity<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.290> lot<00:03:56.620> lower<00:03:56.829> so<00:03:56.980> you're

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
the intensity is a lot lower so you're

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.039 
the intensity is a lot lower so you're
not<00:03:57.459> really<00:03:57.730> pushing<00:03:58.000> your<00:03:58.239> anaerobic<00:03:58.540> zones

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
not really pushing your anaerobic zones

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.500 
not really pushing your anaerobic zones
and<00:03:59.290> it's<00:03:59.739> not<00:03:59.920> as<00:04:00.099> effective<00:04:00.610> as<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.760> way<00:04:00.970> to

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
and it's not as effective as a way to

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.270 
and it's not as effective as a way to
burn<00:04:01.660> fat<00:04:01.720> very<00:04:02.349> important<00:04:02.769> to<00:04:02.829> make<00:04:02.920> sure

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
burn fat very important to make sure

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.940 
burn fat very important to make sure
these<00:04:03.430> two<00:04:03.489> are<00:04:03.970> matched<00:04:04.569> up<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:04.810> your<00:04:05.680> goals

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
and last but not least let's talk about

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.289 
and last but not least let's talk about
the<00:04:07.989> scale<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.440> would<00:04:09.130> love<00:04:09.579> it<00:04:09.700> if<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:09.819> just<00:04:10.150> go

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
the scale I would love it if you just go

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.550 
the scale I would love it if you just go
take<00:04:10.510> your<00:04:10.630> scale<00:04:10.900> right<00:04:11.019> now<00:04:11.079> and<00:04:11.319> check<00:04:11.470> it

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
take your scale right now and check it

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.660 
take your scale right now and check it
out<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.739> window<00:04:11.829> because<00:04:12.130> that<00:04:12.310> thing<00:04:12.519> does

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
out the window because that thing does

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.250 
out the window because that thing does
not<00:04:12.700> matter<00:04:13.060> it's<00:04:13.510> been<00:04:13.630> knocking<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.110> down
