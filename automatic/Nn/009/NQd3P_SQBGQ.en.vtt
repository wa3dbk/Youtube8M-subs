00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
your stair designs so let's get started

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.630 
your stair designs so let's get started
and<00:00:48.360> we're<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:50.190> show<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and we're going to now just show you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.000 
and we're going to now just show you
here's<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.570> stair<00:00:52.199> design<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.620> demo<00:00:52.980> version

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
here's the stair design a demo version

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.510 
here's the stair design a demo version
window<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.680> we're<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.190> quickly

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
window and we're going to just quickly

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.150 
window and we're going to just quickly
build<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.120> staircase<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> first<00:00:58.859> thing<00:00:58.980> I'm

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
build a staircase so the first thing I'm

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.470 
build a staircase so the first thing I'm
going<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.579> I'm<00:00:59.730> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> verify<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
going to do is I'm going to verify the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.750 
going to do is I'm going to verify the
options<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.789> the<00:01:02.789> unit<00:01:03.329> menu<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:05.040> that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
options and the unit menu to see that

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.179 
options and the unit menu to see that
the<00:01:05.880> options<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> units<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:07.260> actually

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the options and the units are actually

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.399 
the options and the units are actually
set<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.700> millimeters<00:01:09.110> because<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.170> want<00:01:10.380> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
set to millimeters because I want to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.990 
set to millimeters because I want to
build<00:01:10.619> my<00:01:10.830> staircase<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.400> millimeters<00:01:11.880> so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
build my staircase in millimeters so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.219 
build my staircase in millimeters so
here<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.299> everything<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> in

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.550 
calculated the riser height of

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
whereas 162 millimeters the tread width

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.230 
whereas 162 millimeters the tread width
226<00:02:15.560> millimeters<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.220> what<00:02:16.940> they<00:02:17.060> call<00:02:17.210> a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
226 millimeters and what they call a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.620 
226 millimeters and what they call a
sterile<00:02:17.990> at<00:02:18.250> 551<00:02:19.250> millimeters<00:02:20.110> now<00:02:21.130> these

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
sterile at 551 millimeters now these

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.980 
sterile at 551 millimeters now these
these<00:02:23.630> values<00:02:24.490> don't<00:02:25.490> really<00:02:25.940> fit<00:02:26.240> to

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
these values don't really fit to

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.220 
these values don't really fit to
standard<00:02:28.330> values<00:02:29.330> for<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> staircase<00:02:29.840> the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
standard values for a staircase the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.070 
standard values for a staircase the
sterile<00:02:30.680> in<00:02:30.890> general<00:02:31.460> should<00:02:31.580> be<00:02:31.730> between<00:02:32.080> 660

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
sterile in general should be between 660

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.430 
sterile in general should be between 660
660<00:02:34.210> for<00:02:35.500> 600<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.590> 600<00:02:37.220> 40<00:02:37.670> sorry<00:02:38.440> millimeters

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
660 for 600 and 600 40 sorry millimeters

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.360 
660 for 600 and 600 40 sorry millimeters
and<00:02:40.570> so<00:02:41.570> this<00:02:42.260> era<00:02:42.560> was<00:02:42.770> not<00:02:42.920> complied<00:02:43.340> with

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
and so this era was not complied with

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.050 
and so this era was not complied with
and<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:45.710> their<00:02:46.130> case<00:02:46.340> should<00:02:46.580> really<00:02:46.940> be

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
and the their case should really be

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.810 
and the their case should really be
redesigned<00:02:47.690> with<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.960> so<00:02:48.800> what<00:02:49.250> are<00:02:49.460> going<00:02:49.730> to

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
redesigned with it so what are going to

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.360 
redesigned with it so what are going to
do<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.030> I'm<00:02:50.240> going<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.450> ask<00:02:50.630> stair<00:02:51.440> designer<00:02:51.890> to

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
do is I'm going to ask stair designer to

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.350 
do is I'm going to ask stair designer to
just<00:02:52.670> optimize<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.750> design<00:02:55.360> automatically

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
just optimize the design automatically

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.060 
just optimize the design automatically
I'm<00:02:56.840> going<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.170> click<00:02:57.290> here<00:02:57.530> on<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.740> Help
