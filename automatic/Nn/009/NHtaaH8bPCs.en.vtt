00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
about 70 so in the defense it's quite

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.140 
about 70 so in the defense it's quite
simple<00:02:57.350> just<00:02:58.490> however<00:02:59.490> many<00:02:59.670> points<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.120> have

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
simple just however many points you have

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.300 
simple just however many points you have

is<00:03:13.170> pretty<00:03:13.410> important<00:03:13.860> too<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:15.000> speed<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.780> use

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
is pretty important too so speed I use

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.500 
is pretty important too so speed I use
75<00:03:16.860> speed<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.340> start<00:03:17.580> off<00:03:17.760> my<00:03:18.060> guys<00:03:18.240> pretty

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
fast so endurance 75 balance I bring

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.980 
fast so endurance 75 balance I bring
that<00:03:23.490> up<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.760> 69<00:03:25.220> agility<00:03:26.660> 77<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.840> then

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
that up to a 69 agility 77 and then

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:35.540 
that up to a 69 agility 77 and then
acceleration<00:03:29.270> um<00:03:32.150> wait<00:03:33.150> what<00:03:33.450> was<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:33.660> oh<00:03:34.550> no

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
acceleration um wait what was it oh no

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.200 
acceleration um wait what was it oh no
oh<00:03:37.490> okay<00:03:38.490> a<00:03:38.700> jelly<00:03:39.600> was<00:03:39.840> 76<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.860> then

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
oh okay a jelly was 76 and then

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.940 
oh okay a jelly was 76 and then
acceleration<00:03:42.210> yeah<00:03:42.330> this<00:03:42.480> is<00:03:42.600> it

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
acceleration yeah this is it

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.970 
acceleration yeah this is it
acceleration<00:03:43.950> was<00:03:44.040> 72<00:03:44.580> balance<00:03:45.570> is<00:03:45.690> 69<00:03:46.200> so

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
acceleration was 72 balance is 69 so

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.980 
acceleration was 72 balance is 69 so
