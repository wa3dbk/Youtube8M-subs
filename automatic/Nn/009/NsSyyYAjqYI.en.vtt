00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.550
 Hi guys all right 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.389
 today was just you doing one thing only one 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.219
 excellent that the decor mo normal with 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.590
 a little bird 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.080
 I'm going to talk about myself now because I 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.279
 I did not dig the clever ones 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.400
 I used 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.949
 I made a chocolate cake 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.859
 I was Brigadier spoon and purposes of 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.070
 naja ghannouchi let the chocolate increase 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.649
 but you can do and kind of bitter or a 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.059
 white chocolate that is you can put 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:45.600
 dye will color a bit a 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:48.200
 chocolate is what it is not the brigadeiro 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.090
 normal take off slightly before landing 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.160
 true up close you add 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.399
 believer in the informal recipe of 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.520
 bring him is more dangerous 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.739
 So there's a difference he always takes. 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.220
 just before putting it to 37 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.920

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.180

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.369

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.280

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.440

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.620
 Spoon 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:11.110
 if you want to cover it 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.610
 with a brigadeiro and then play 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.370
 not to have so much work 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:21.370
 can also be more fun because 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:27.370
 It's just the filling and you also make the flavor 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.550
 that you want now you do not have 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.550
