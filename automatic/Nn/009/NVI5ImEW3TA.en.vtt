that gives you a closer bird's-eye view

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.600 
that gives you a closer bird's-eye view
of<00:02:58.150> some<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.959> most<00:02:59.590> important<00:03:00.220> issues

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
of some of the most important issues

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.210 
of some of the most important issues
that<00:03:01.060> are<00:03:01.180> facing<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.660> world<00:03:01.840> today<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.440> I

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
that are facing the world today and I

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.920 
that are facing the world today and I
don't<00:03:03.640> foresee<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.269> issues<00:03:04.750> are

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
don't foresee that the issues are

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.630 
don't foresee that the issues are
necessarily<00:03:05.380> going<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.829> stop<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.340> think<00:03:06.549> that

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
necessarily going to stop I think that

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.720 
necessarily going to stop I think that
that's<00:03:06.730> going<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.150> be<00:03:07.269> a<00:03:07.299> recurring<00:03:07.480> theme<00:03:08.049> and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
that's going to be a recurring theme and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.539 
that's going to be a recurring theme and
so<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:10.260> Malta<00:03:11.260> it's<00:03:11.739> like<00:03:11.890> having<00:03:12.190> front<00:03:12.400> row

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
so to Malta it's like having front row

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.949 
so to Malta it's like having front row
seats<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:15.090> geopolitics<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.630> of<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
seats to the geopolitics and of the

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.380 
seats to the geopolitics and of the
headlines<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.530> are<00:03:17.680> facing<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.220> world<00:03:18.430> this

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
headlines that are facing the world this

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.949 
headlines that are facing the world this
is<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:20.049> ideal<00:03:20.410> place<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.709> study<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.450> advice<00:03:22.450> to
