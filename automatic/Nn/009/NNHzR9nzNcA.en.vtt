afford to drop it and have it break so I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.349 
afford to drop it and have it break so I
mean<00:00:59.809> I<00:00:59.899> prefer<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:00.469> naked<00:01:00.800> feel<00:01:01.280> of<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.609> the

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
mean I prefer the naked feel of the the

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.930 
mean I prefer the naked feel of the the
device<00:01:02.719> I<00:01:03.079> mean<00:01:03.649> it's<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:03.920> nice<00:01:04.129> but<00:01:04.460> it's<00:01:04.820> just

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
device I mean it's so nice but it's just

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.820 
device I mean it's so nice but it's just
a<00:01:05.150> little<00:01:05.300> bit<00:01:05.570> unwieldy<00:01:05.870> to<00:01:06.200> hold<00:01:06.380> on<00:01:06.620> so

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
a little bit unwieldy to hold on so

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.370 
a little bit unwieldy to hold on so
anyway<00:01:07.040> so<00:01:07.100> I<00:01:07.240> went<00:01:08.240> now<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.660> I<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:09.170> first

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
anyway so I went now and I the first

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.470 
anyway so I went now and I the first
case<00:01:09.620> I<00:01:09.770> purchased<00:01:10.160> was<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.490> leather<00:01:10.730> iphone

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
case I purchased was the leather iphone

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.080 
case I purchased was the leather iphone
6<00:01:11.780> standard<00:01:12.050> Apple<00:01:12.470> case<00:01:12.760> and<00:01:13.760> this<00:01:13.910> was<00:01:14.060> a

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
6 standard Apple case and this was a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.840 
6 standard Apple case and this was a
great<00:01:14.300> case<00:01:17.650> but<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.770> leather<00:01:18.980> is<00:01:19.310> itself

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
great case but the leather is itself

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.570 
great case but the leather is itself
isn't<00:01:20.060> very<00:01:20.360> soft<00:01:20.720> it's<00:01:21.230> hard<00:01:21.890> to<00:01:22.010> see<00:01:22.220> but<00:01:22.400> it

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
isn't very soft it's hard to see but it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.090 
isn't very soft it's hard to see but it
does<00:01:22.760> say<00:01:22.970> natural<00:01:23.180> leather<00:01:23.770> so<00:01:24.770> I<00:01:24.800> think<00:01:24.980> that

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
does say natural leather so I think that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.040 
does say natural leather so I think that
means<00:01:25.250> it's<00:01:25.430> all<00:01:25.580> real<00:01:25.760> leather<00:01:25.880> anyway<00:01:26.300> the

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
means it's all real leather anyway the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.560 
means it's all real leather anyway the
inside<00:01:27.410> here<00:01:27.620> it's<00:01:27.740> almost<00:01:27.920> like<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:28.270> of<00:01:29.270> a

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
inside here it's almost like a of a

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.140 
inside here it's almost like a of a
suede<00:01:30.080> or<00:01:30.380> yeah<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.250> think<00:01:31.370> it's<00:01:31.610> like<00:01:31.760> a<00:01:31.790> suede

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
suede or yeah I think it's like a suede

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.630 
suede or yeah I think it's like a suede
but<00:01:32.690> if<00:01:32.780> this<00:01:33.020> texture<00:01:33.560> was<00:01:33.710> out<00:01:33.860> on<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.040> on

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
but if this texture was out on the on

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.520 
but if this texture was out on the on
the<00:01:34.850> outside<00:01:35.330> of<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:35.660> I<00:01:35.840> think<00:01:36.080> this<00:01:36.350> would<00:01:36.500> be

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
the outside of it I think this would be

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.580 
the outside of it I think this would be
a<00:01:36.680> really<00:01:36.890> nice<00:01:37.160> case<00:01:37.400> as<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:38.360> is<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:39.350> leather

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
a really nice case as it is the leather

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.070 
a really nice case as it is the leather
itself<00:01:40.310> isn't<00:01:40.520> very<00:01:40.820> soft<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:41.810> it's<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:41.930> little

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
itself isn't very soft so it's a little

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.810 
itself isn't very soft so it's a little
bit<00:01:42.170> disappointed<00:01:42.650> in<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:43.490> retails

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
bit disappointed in that and it retails

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.290 
bit disappointed in that and it retails
for<00:01:43.880> $45<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:44.720> it's<00:01:44.870> not<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.080> cheap<00:01:45.410> case<00:01:46.300> there's

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
for $45 so it's not a cheap case there's

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.940 
for $45 so it's not a cheap case there's
a<00:01:47.390> few<00:01:47.570> things<00:01:47.720> I<00:01:47.840> did<00:01:47.900> really<00:01:48.590> like<00:01:48.800> about

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
a few things I did really like about

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.500 
a few things I did really like about
this<00:01:49.160> case<00:01:49.400> is<00:01:49.640> I'm<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.000> know<00:01:50.090> once<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:50.360> get

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
this case is I'm you know once you get

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.540 
this case is I'm you know once you get
it<00:01:50.690> in<00:01:50.870> once<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:51.560> get<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.770> phone<00:01:51.980> in<00:01:52.160> there<00:01:52.370> it

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
it in once you get the phone in there it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.350 
it in once you get the phone in there it
does<00:01:52.700> feel<00:01:52.940> nice<00:01:53.150> in<00:01:53.210> your<00:01:53.390> hand<00:01:55.210> adds<00:01:56.210> a

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
does feel nice in your hand adds a

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.410 
does feel nice in your hand adds a
little<00:01:56.540> bit<00:01:56.660> of<00:01:56.750> weight<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.530> phone<00:01:57.740> but<00:01:58.730> it

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
little bit of weight to the phone but it

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.940 
little bit of weight to the phone but it
definitely<00:01:59.870> feels<00:02:00.110> more<00:02:00.290> grippy<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:00.830> your

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
definitely feels more grippy in your

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.620 
definitely feels more grippy in your
hands<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:01.310> that's<00:02:01.460> really<00:02:01.970> all<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.270> was<00:02:02.540> looking

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.540 
hands so that's really all I was looking

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
can lay it face down there's enough of a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.670 
can lay it face down there's enough of a
lip<00:02:06.290> on<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.920> on<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.850> edge<00:02:07.970> here<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:09.380> edges

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.670 
case with a it almost has like a
rubberized<00:03:09.180> slightly<00:03:10.180> rubber<00:03:10.420> matte<00:03:11.230> texture

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
rubberized slightly rubber matte texture

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.620 
rubberized slightly rubber matte texture
so<00:03:12.460> it<00:03:12.550> makes<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.880> grip<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.210> your<00:03:13.240> hand<00:03:13.510> which

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
so it makes it grip in your hand which

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.470 
so it makes it grip in your hand which
is<00:03:13.810> good<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:15.160> I<00:03:15.430> did<00:03:15.610> start<00:03:15.880> using<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.300> case

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
is good so I did start using that case

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.800 
is good so I did start using that case
for<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.750> few<00:03:16.810> days<00:03:17.130> but<00:03:18.130> even<00:03:18.430> this<00:03:19.440> here<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:22.480> I

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
for a few days but even this here so I

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.780 
for a few days but even this here so I
used<00:03:23.500> this<00:03:23.620> case<00:03:23.860> for<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.070> few<00:03:24.100> days<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:24.580> kind

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
used this case for a few days and I kind

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.810 
used this case for a few days and I kind
of<00:03:24.850> liked<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.860> except<00:03:26.860> for<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.310> had<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:27.580> same

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
of liked it except for it had the same

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.880 
of liked it except for it had the same
kind<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.090> issue<00:03:28.240> so<00:03:28.600> this<00:03:29.050> edge<00:03:29.320> is<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.590> little

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
kind of issue so this edge is a little

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.190 
kind of issue so this edge is a little
bit<00:03:30.010> more<00:03:30.220> off<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.700> side<00:03:30.910> but<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.900> problem

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
bit more off to the side but the problem

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.890 
bit more off to the side but the problem
is<00:03:32.290> this<00:03:32.440> edge<00:03:32.710> is<00:03:33.040> pretty<00:03:34.030> sharp<00:03:34.420> so<00:03:34.600> I<00:03:34.630> even

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
is this edge is pretty sharp so I even

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.180 
is this edge is pretty sharp so I even
filed<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.260> edge<00:03:35.350> down<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.830> it<00:03:35.890> helped<00:03:36.160> a

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
filed the edge down and it helped a

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.040 
filed the edge down and it helped a
little<00:03:36.340> bit<00:03:36.580> but<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:37.060> was<00:03:37.090> still<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.720> mean<00:03:37.990> it

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
little bit but it was still I mean it

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.290 
little bit but it was still I mean it
was<00:03:38.170> cutting<00:03:38.410> my<00:03:38.590> pinky<00:03:38.950> just<00:03:39.910> like<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.210> other

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
was cutting my pinky just like the other

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.550 
was cutting my pinky just like the other
case<00:03:40.540> was<00:03:40.810> just<00:03:40.840> in<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.200> slightly<00:03:41.380> different

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
case was just in a slightly different

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.340 
case was just in a slightly different
spot<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.940> other<00:03:43.060> thing<00:03:43.240> I<00:03:43.360> but<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:43.720> did<00:03:43.990> what<00:03:44.320> I

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
spot the other thing I but I did what I

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.810 
spot the other thing I but I did what I
did<00:03:44.440> like<00:03:44.709> about<00:03:44.770> this<00:03:44.980> case<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.310> was<00:03:45.430> only<00:03:45.640> ten

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
did like about this case I was only ten

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.370 
did like about this case I was only ten
dollars<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.480> had<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.720> button<00:03:46.930> cutaways

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
dollars and it had the button cutaways

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.190 
dollars and it had the button cutaways
and<00:03:48.220> Apple<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.300> know<00:03:49.330> obviously<00:03:49.750> spends<00:03:50.140> a

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
and Apple you know obviously spends a

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.750 
and Apple you know obviously spends a
lot<00:03:50.350> of<00:03:50.380> time<00:03:50.530> I'm<00:03:50.800> sure<00:03:51.040> on<00:03:51.220> designing<00:03:51.640> the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
lot of time I'm sure on designing the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.310 
lot of time I'm sure on designing the
buttons<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.240> how<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.450> buttons<00:03:52.810> feel<00:03:53.080> when

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
buttons and how the buttons feel when

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.290 
buttons and how the buttons feel when
you<00:03:53.410> click<00:03:53.620> them<00:03:53.770> so<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:54.820> having<00:03:55.209> those

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
you click them so to having those

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.490 
you click them so to having those
exposed<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:55.900> actually<00:03:56.140> hitting<00:03:56.320> the

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
exposed and actually hitting the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.560 
exposed and actually hitting the
physical<00:03:56.860> button<00:03:57.130> is<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:57.790> little<00:03:58.030> bit<00:03:58.209> nicer

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
physical button is a little bit nicer

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.050 
physical button is a little bit nicer
compared<00:03:58.990> to<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.260> UM<00:03:59.520> Apple<00:04:00.520> case<00:04:00.700> I<00:04:00.910> wish

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
compared to the UM Apple case I wish

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.570 
compared to the UM Apple case I wish
that<00:04:01.270> these<00:04:01.390> had<00:04:01.570> cutouts<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:02.400> think<00:04:03.400> it<00:04:03.490> would

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
that these had cutouts I think it would

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.300 
that these had cutouts I think it would
be<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:03.730> think<00:04:04.060> I'd<00:04:04.300> make<00:04:04.450> it<00:04:04.570> a<00:04:04.630> better<00:04:04.750> case<00:04:05.310> so

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
be I think I'd make it a better case so

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.620 
be I think I'd make it a better case so
and<00:04:06.550> the<00:04:06.610> other<00:04:06.730> thing<00:04:06.940> about<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.240> is<00:04:07.450> the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
and the other thing about this is the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.570 
and the other thing about this is the
lip<00:04:07.810> around<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.470> front<00:04:08.709> edge<00:04:08.890> isn't<00:04:09.370> nearly

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
lip around the front edge isn't nearly

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.330 
lip around the front edge isn't nearly
as<00:04:09.730> um<00:04:10.410> it's<00:04:11.410> probably<00:04:11.560> about<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:11.860> millimeter

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
as um it's probably about a millimeter

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.490 
as um it's probably about a millimeter
shorter<00:04:12.820> than<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.150> than<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.750> Apple<00:04:14.110> case<00:04:14.260> so

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
shorter than the than the Apple case so

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.900 
shorter than the than the Apple case so
when<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.709> put<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:14.980> facedown<00:04:15.220> on<00:04:15.670> some

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
when you put it facedown on some

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
when you put it facedown on some
services<00:04:16.420> it<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:17.290> wobbles<00:04:17.890> ever<00:04:18.100> so<00:04:18.340> slightly

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
services it it wobbles ever so slightly

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.590 
services it it wobbles ever so slightly
and<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:20.080> just<00:04:20.320> don't<00:04:20.440> feel<00:04:20.590> like<00:04:21.070> this<00:04:21.640> I<00:04:21.940> don't

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
and I just don't feel like this I don't

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.700 
and I just don't feel like this I don't
feel<00:04:22.750> a<00:04:22.780> hundred<00:04:22.870> percent<00:04:23.050> confident<00:04:23.620> that

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
feel a hundred percent confident that

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.860 
feel a hundred percent confident that
the<00:04:23.919> screen<00:04:24.220> isn't<00:04:24.430> touching<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:25.030> on

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
the screen isn't touching the on

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.910 
the screen isn't touching the on
whatever<00:04:26.200> surface<00:04:26.470> it's

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
whatever surface it's

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.340 
whatever surface it's
lay<00:04:27.010> down<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:27.580> that's<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.450> that's<00:04:28.720> a<00:04:28.960> negative

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
lay down so that's a that's a negative

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.400 
lay down so that's a that's a negative
on<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.590> case

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.520 

so<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:34.120> deal<00:04:34.450> with<00:04:34.600> this<00:04:34.750> pinkie<00:04:35.110> cutting<00:04:35.410> on

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
so I to deal with this pinkie cutting on

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.770 
so I to deal with this pinkie cutting on
the<00:04:35.650> bottom<00:04:35.950> I<00:04:36.070> was<00:04:36.280> I<00:04:36.460> went<00:04:36.940> on<00:04:37.090> Amazon<00:04:37.210> for

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
the bottom I was I went on Amazon for

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.900 
the bottom I was I went on Amazon for
another<00:04:37.990> popular<00:04:38.380> case<00:04:38.590> just<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:39.460> find<00:04:39.700> one

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
another popular case just to find one

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.330 
another popular case just to find one
that<00:04:40.090> minimalistic<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.140> that<00:04:41.380> covers<00:04:42.220> the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
that minimalistic and that covers the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.670 
that minimalistic and that covers the
whole<00:04:42.370> bottom<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.720> what<00:04:43.840> is<00:04:43.960> what<00:04:44.200> I<00:04:44.230> found<00:04:44.440> was

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
whole bottom so what is what I found was

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.400 
whole bottom so what is what I found was
this<00:04:45.220> is<00:04:45.340> called<00:04:45.580> them<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:46.210> max<00:04:46.450> boost<00:04:46.780> case

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
this is called them the max boost case

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.130 
this is called them the max boost case
it's<00:04:47.680> just<00:04:47.890> like<00:04:48.010> a<00:04:48.040> clear<00:04:48.430> max<00:04:48.910> boost<00:04:49.240> liquid

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
it's just like a clear max boost liquid

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.230 
it's just like a clear max boost liquid
skin<00:04:50.470> it's<00:04:51.040> only<00:04:51.160> ten<00:04:51.400> dollars<00:04:51.670> as<00:04:51.820> well<00:04:52.000> and

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
skin it's only ten dollars as well and

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.240 
skin it's only ten dollars as well and
then<00:04:52.390> you<00:04:52.420> can<00:04:52.540> see<00:04:52.780> it's<00:04:52.900> flexible<00:04:53.410> it<00:04:54.100> does

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
then you can see it's flexible it does

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.450 
then you can see it's flexible it does
not<00:04:54.430> have<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.850> button<00:04:55.120> cutouts<00:04:56.220> but<00:04:57.220> you<00:04:57.310> can

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
not have the button cutouts but you can

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.790 
not have the button cutouts but you can
see<00:04:57.670> the<00:04:57.790> bottom<00:04:58.120> here<00:04:58.330> is<00:04:58.450> is<00:04:58.660> is<00:04:58.930> completely

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
see the bottom here is is is completely

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.740 
see the bottom here is is is completely
enclosed<00:05:00.190> which<00:05:00.490> is<00:05:00.670> I<00:05:00.940> thought<00:05:01.570> would<00:05:01.720> be

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
enclosed which is I thought would be

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.640 
enclosed which is I thought would be
good<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:04.660> I<00:05:04.690> thought<00:05:04.930> it<00:05:05.020> would<00:05:05.110> be<00:05:05.170> good<00:05:05.320> I<00:05:05.470> got

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
good so I thought it would be good I got

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.150 
good so I thought it would be good I got
it<00:05:05.800> on<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:05.920> phone<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:07.800> it<00:05:08.800> did<00:05:08.980> definitely

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
it on the phone and it did definitely

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.080 
it on the phone and it did definitely
feel<00:05:09.640> better

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
feel better

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.810 
feel better
holding<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:11.070> but<00:05:12.070> then<00:05:12.280> the<00:05:13.060> plastic<00:05:13.330> on<00:05:13.780> here

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
holding it but then the plastic on here

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.460 
holding it but then the plastic on here
it<00:05:15.820> made<00:05:15.970> me<00:05:16.090> feel<00:05:16.240> like<00:05:16.300> it's<00:05:16.630> like<00:05:16.840> I<00:05:17.110> don't

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
it made me feel like it's like I don't

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.840 
it made me feel like it's like I don't
know<00:05:17.620> cheap<00:05:17.920> it's<00:05:18.070> a<00:05:18.220> product<00:05:18.550> I<00:05:18.610> thought<00:05:18.760> the

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
know cheap it's a product I thought the

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.370 
know cheap it's a product I thought the
clear<00:05:19.060> would<00:05:19.180> be<00:05:19.330> good<00:05:19.510> but<00:05:19.690> it<00:05:19.810> just<00:05:19.840> kind<00:05:20.320> of

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
clear would be good but it just kind of

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.680 
clear would be good but it just kind of
makes<00:05:20.620> you<00:05:20.710> feel<00:05:20.770> like<00:05:21.010> it's<00:05:21.820> putting<00:05:22.120> plastic

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
makes you feel like it's putting plastic

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.410 
makes you feel like it's putting plastic
on<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:23.170> nice<00:05:23.440> couch<00:05:23.770> and<00:05:24.640> nobody<00:05:24.940> really<00:05:24.970> likes

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
on a nice couch and nobody really likes

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.240 
on a nice couch and nobody really likes
that<00:05:25.510> so<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.350> other<00:05:26.470> thing<00:05:26.650> is<00:05:26.740> it<00:05:26.980> doesn't

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
that so the other thing is it doesn't

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.340 
that so the other thing is it doesn't
it's<00:05:27.730> kind<00:05:28.030> of<00:05:28.090> like<00:05:28.300> not<00:05:28.330> on<00:05:28.750> there<00:05:29.110> that

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
it's kind of like not on there that

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.780 
it's kind of like not on there that
tight<00:05:29.710> because<00:05:29.950> it's<00:05:30.160> so<00:05:30.340> thin<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:30.730> you

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
tight because it's so thin and you

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.140 
tight because it's so thin and you
definitely<00:05:30.970> can't<00:05:31.240> lay<00:05:31.510> it<00:05:31.660> face<00:05:31.780> down<00:05:31.840> so<00:05:33.150> I

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
definitely can't lay it face down so I

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.730 
definitely can't lay it face down so I
didn't<00:05:34.630> really<00:05:34.810> prefer<00:05:35.170> this<00:05:35.350> case<00:05:35.560> either

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
didn't really prefer this case either

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.040 
didn't really prefer this case either
unfortunately<00:05:36.490> I<00:05:36.700> mean<00:05:37.690> there's<00:05:37.870> there's

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
unfortunately I mean there's there's

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.230 
unfortunately I mean there's there's
tons<00:05:38.320> of<00:05:38.380> other<00:05:38.530> cases<00:05:38.740> online<00:05:39.250> but<00:05:39.940> these

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
tons of other cases online but these

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.400 
tons of other cases online but these
were<00:05:40.390> the<00:05:40.510> ones<00:05:40.690> that<00:05:40.840> were<00:05:40.930> like<00:05:41.050> most

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
were the ones that were like most

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.140 
were the ones that were like most
minimalistic<00:05:42.040> and<00:05:42.250> seem<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:42.460> be<00:05:42.610> popular<00:05:43.120> and

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
minimalistic and seem to be popular and

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.240 
minimalistic and seem to be popular and
had<00:05:43.360> good<00:05:43.510> reviews<00:05:43.720> on<00:05:44.050> Amazon<00:05:44.500> I<00:05:44.710> will<00:05:45.100> post

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
had good reviews on Amazon I will post

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.500 
had good reviews on Amazon I will post
the<00:05:45.370> links<00:05:45.610> down<00:05:45.790> below<00:05:45.820> to<00:05:46.090> all<00:05:46.360> the

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
the links down below to all the

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.500 
the links down below to all the
different<00:05:46.840> cases<00:05:47.470> but<00:05:47.880> I<00:05:48.880> think<00:05:48.970> if<00:05:49.270> I<00:05:49.330> had<00:05:49.420> to

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
different cases but I think if I had to

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.200 
different cases but I think if I had to
choose<00:05:49.690> one<00:05:50.190> the<00:05:51.190> leather<00:05:51.400> cases<00:05:51.850> it<00:05:52.090> the

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
choose one the leather cases it the

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.700 
choose one the leather cases it the
Apple<00:05:52.330> leather<00:05:52.600> case<00:05:52.840> is<00:05:52.990> definitely<00:05:53.380> that<00:05:53.530> is

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
Apple leather case is definitely that is

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.000 
Apple leather case is definitely that is
definitely<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.370> best<00:05:54.520> case<00:05:54.790> to<00:05:54.970> me<00:05:55.770> if<00:05:56.770> it's

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
definitely the best case to me if it's

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.320 
definitely the best case to me if it's
too<00:05:57.160> expensive<00:05:57.430> if<00:05:57.820> you<00:05:57.910> don't<00:05:58.030> want<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:58.210> spend

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
too expensive if you don't want to spend

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.860 
too expensive if you don't want to spend
$45<00:05:58.990> on<00:05:59.050> a<00:05:59.110> case<00:05:59.350> I<00:06:00.310> would<00:06:01.090> say<00:06:01.210> get<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.480> spigen

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
$45 on a case I would say get the spigen

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.690 
$45 on a case I would say get the spigen
case<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.560> the<00:06:02.890> bottom<00:06:03.190> edge<00:06:03.340> might<00:06:03.550> not

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
case the the bottom edge might not

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.920 
case the the bottom edge might not
bother<00:06:03.820> you<00:06:04.060> as<00:06:04.120> much<00:06:04.180> like<00:06:04.510> say<00:06:04.660> I<00:06:04.690> try<00:06:04.870> to

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
bother you as much like say I try to

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.540 
bother you as much like say I try to
file<00:06:05.170> it<00:06:05.350> down<00:06:05.500> it<00:06:05.680> helped<00:06:05.920> a<00:06:05.980> little<00:06:06.100> bit<00:06:06.310> but

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
file it down it helped a little bit but

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.950 
file it down it helped a little bit but
you<00:06:06.760> might<00:06:06.910> prefer<00:06:07.300> a<00:06:07.480> different<00:06:07.630> kind<00:06:07.930> of

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
you might prefer a different kind of

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.870 
you might prefer a different kind of
case<00:06:08.110> anyway<00:06:08.590> Apple<00:06:08.980> leather<00:06:09.460> case<00:06:09.700> I<00:06:09.820> think

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
case anyway Apple leather case I think

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.340 
case anyway Apple leather case I think
is<00:06:10.090> the<00:06:10.210> one<00:06:10.360> I<00:06:10.420> would<00:06:10.510> go<00:06:10.660> with<00:06:10.810> it's<00:06:11.110> a<00:06:11.140> little

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
is the one I would go with it's a little

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.070 
is the one I would go with it's a little
bit<00:06:11.440> expensive<00:06:11.740> but<00:06:11.980> I<00:06:12.460> think<00:06:12.790> it<00:06:12.910> is<00:06:13.780> the<00:06:13.960> best

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
bit expensive but I think it is the best

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.770 
bit expensive but I think it is the best
feeling<00:06:14.290> hand<00:06:14.710> overall<00:06:15.130> and<00:06:16.090> it<00:06:16.210> just<00:06:16.390> it<00:06:16.630> is

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.450 
feeling hand overall and it just it is
nice<00:06:16.990> and<00:06:17.020> you<00:06:17.290> can<00:06:17.410> lay<00:06:17.560> it<00:06:17.710> you<00:06:18.070> can<00:06:18.190> lay<00:06:18.340> it

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
nice and you can lay it you can lay it
