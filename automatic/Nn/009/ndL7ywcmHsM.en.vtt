the<00:04:19.860> air<00:04:19.980> and<00:04:20.160> take<00:04:20.340> on<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.610> top<00:04:20.880> there<00:04:21.590> I

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
the air and take on the top there I

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.930 
the air and take on the top there I
switched<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.790> around<00:04:25.130> for<00:04:26.130> some<00:04:26.370> reason
