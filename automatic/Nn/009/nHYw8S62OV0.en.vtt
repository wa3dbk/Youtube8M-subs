[MUSIC]LILLY: What’s up, guys?? It’s
me Lilly, SARAH: And me Sarah!LILLY: And

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.360
it’s time for a brand new, never before
seen episode of

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.430
The Rundown of Everything That Really Matters!

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.920
Today is all about BACK TO SCHOOL!!SARAH:
As much as I love summer vacation, I love,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.480
love, love that feeling

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.730
of going back to school!LILLY: You are such
a nerd.SARAH: No! It’s just the excitement

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.390
of new clothes, new classes,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.339
new teachers, and did I mention new clothes?
LILLY: You did. And yeah, I do know what you

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:34.339
mean.

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.550
It just feels like a new chance every time
a new school year rolls around.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.580
Uggggh, but it means more homework!!SARAH:
Yeah, let’s not think about that part. 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.379
LILLY: Deal. [to camera] Guys, go on Dream
Mining and tell us what gets you

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.959
excited about going back to school. We wanna
know!SARAH: All right, let’s talk back

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:49.959
to school trends.

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:52.480
According to 17 magazine, some of the things
to look forward to

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.069
are puffy sleeves. I like these.LILLY: Meh.
I don’t know.SARAH: All right, well, how

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.649
about this, a sleeveless blazer. LILLY:
A sleeveless blazer? You mean a vest? SARAH:

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.399
It’s not a vest. It’s totally different!
LILLY: No way. That’s like calling shorts

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.479
legless pants. SARAH: But it has lapels.
LILLY: Oh, look I’m wearing a hoodless hoodie.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.479
Oh, wait, no,

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.479
it’s really just a shirt. SARAH: Okay,
okay, fine. You don’t like the sleeveless

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.479
blazer.

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.729
What back to school items are you into?
LILLY: I thought you’d never ask. I am all

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:16.729
about the sneakers.

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.060
May I do a fashion minute?SARAH: Wow, be
my guest. LILLY: Okay, well, my standard

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.950
go-to are Chucks of course.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.149
But there are some other really cool sneakers
out there right now.

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:33.649
Like check out these old school Nikes.SARAH:
Those are pretty awesome. Not for me, but

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.299
you should definitely get a pair.Lilly:
And then these. Canvas sneakers from Urban

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.299
Outfitters--

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.450
they have really cool patterns. Sarah: I
actually would wear those!Lilly: And these

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.671
are some super sweet Hello Kitty vans!! Cuuuute!
[pause]

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:52.960
And one last sneaker: the old Reebok pump!
Sarah: What is that??Lilly: These are retro

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.259
sneakers--you’re supposed to pump air into
the soles

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.030
to make you jump higher when you’re playing
basketball or something.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.069
These are old, though, so they’re just a
fantasy.Sarah: I try to lead you in the

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.619
right direction with fashion,

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:14.530
and this is what you’re into. Why don’t
you just get some of those shoes

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.360
with skate wheels while you’re at it?
Lilly: I have some Wheelies! They’re cool!!

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.281
Sarah: Oh wow. They actually do look fun.
I admit it.

00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:23.629
Anyway, that’s our show for today.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:30.590
Tell us what you think about going BACK TO
SCHOOL!

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.849
[does ominous music noise]Lilly: Yeah! And
tell me what you think of my fashion minute!!

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.540
Sarah: I think you did a great job.Lilly:
Thanks, bud.Bye guys!!!
