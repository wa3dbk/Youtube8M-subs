standard open differential in the front
it<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.810> also<00:01:22.259> running<00:01:25.640> full<00:01:26.640> headlights<00:01:28.579> and

it is also running full headlights and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.120 
it is also running full headlights and
taillights<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:33.560> think<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.920> put

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
taillights I think I'm going to put

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.990 
taillights I think I'm going to put
strobes<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
strobes in it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.530 
strobes in it
all<00:01:36.930> right<00:01:37.079> down<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> business<00:01:37.860> end<00:01:38.040> as

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
before I stayed in the last video I will

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.190 
before I stayed in the last video I will
was<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.180> using<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.689> was<00:01:42.810> gonna<00:01:42.899> pick

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
was going to be using I was gonna pick

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.330 
was going to be using I was gonna pick
up<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.560> track<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.250> tqi<00:01:45.710> 4<00:01:46.710> channel<00:01:47.310> remote

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
up a track this tqi 4 channel remote

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.380 
up a track this tqi 4 channel remote
from<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.450> summit<00:01:50.270> there<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.450> go

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.870 

so<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.440> am<00:01:56.160> using<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.610> remote<00:01:56.850> from<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.870> summit

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
so I am using the remote from the summit

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:25.630 
so I am using the remote from the summit
this<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.120> my<00:02:00.300> angle<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.570> is<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.900> drop<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.830 

so<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:28.380> get<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.740> do<00:02:28.860> that

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
so to get it to do that

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.330 
so to get it to do that
this<00:02:30.840> original<00:02:31.290> switch<00:02:31.530> was<00:02:31.680> not<00:02:31.860> designed<00:02:32.190> to

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
this original switch was not designed to

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.690 
this original switch was not designed to
do<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:33.410> so<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.440> do<00:02:34.680> have<00:02:34.980> another<00:02:35.220> video<00:02:35.400> that

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
do that so I do have another video that

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.880 
do that so I do have another video that
I<00:02:35.730> posted<00:02:36.150> last<00:02:36.209> night<00:02:38.239> to<00:02:39.239> do<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:40.350> turn<00:02:40.620> this

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
I posted last night to do to turn this

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.150 
I posted last night to do to turn this
into<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.520> three-position<00:02:42.270> switch<00:02:42.480> run<00:02:43.440> off<00:02:43.709> one

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.850 
into a three-position switch run off one
channel<00:02:44.880> because<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:46.020> is<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> three-position

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
channel because it is a three-position

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.160 
channel because it is a three-position
switch<00:02:47.270> but<00:02:48.270> it's<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.480> three-position<00:02:48.959> switch

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
switch but it's a three-position switch

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.390

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
to run off channel 4 and channel 5 the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.920 
to run off channel 4 and channel 5 the
changes<00:02:54.000> that's<00:02:54.120> going<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.480> made<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
changes that's going to made to the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.449 
changes that's going to made to the
radio<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.610> this<00:02:56.610> would<00:02:56.820> be<00:02:56.940> channel<00:02:57.300> 4<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.720> 5

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
radio is this would be channel 4 and 5

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.520 
radio is this would be channel 4 and 5
this<00:02:59.459> would<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.880> channel<00:03:00.239> 3<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.870> my

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
this would be channel 3 in my

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.340 
this would be channel 3 in my
modification<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:04.470> becomes<00:03:05.370> channel<00:03:05.880> 3<00:03:06.350> this

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
modification this becomes channel 3 this

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.470 
modification this becomes channel 3 this
becomes<00:03:07.680> channel<00:03:08.310> 4<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.820> 5<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.890> again<00:03:11.299> so<00:03:12.299> if

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
becomes channel 4 and 5 so again so if

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.120 
becomes channel 4 and 5 so again so if
you<00:03:12.600> want<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.870> walk<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.200> video<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.100> use

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
you want to walk that video you can use

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.180 
you want to walk that video you can use
this<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.910> angle<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.360> plow<00:03:15.570> if<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:15.930> want<00:03:16.190> to

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
this to angle the plow if you want to

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.720 
this to angle the plow if you want to
use<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> scale<00:03:17.730> winch<00:03:18.060> or<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:19.680> even<00:03:19.890> use<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.430> on<00:03:20.610> a

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
crawler for a rear steering so you would

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.699 
crawler for a rear steering so you would
have<00:03:22.890> front<00:03:23.250> steering<00:03:24.920> rear<00:03:25.920> steering<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:28.440> but

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
it is easily removable so in the summer

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.870 
it is easily removable so in the summer
I<00:03:42.600> can<00:03:42.900> take<00:03:43.080> this<00:03:43.260> off<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.830> I<00:03:44.400> used<00:03:44.610> servo

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
I can take this off and I used servo

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.910 
I can take this off and I used servo
lead<00:03:45.180> extensions<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:46.200> quickly<00:03:46.470> disconnect

so<00:04:07.830> it's<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.250> quick<00:04:08.580> removal<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:10.530> if<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.740> want<00:04:10.920> to

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
so it's a quick removal so if I want to

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.430 
so it's a quick removal so if I want to
pull<00:04:11.160> this<00:04:11.310> plow<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:11.910> just<00:04:12.330> leave<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:12.750> on<00:04:12.990> I

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
pull this plow and just leave this on I

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.670 
pull this plow and just leave this on I
can<00:04:14.220> just<00:04:14.370> pull<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.730> plow<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.680> disconnect

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
can just pull the plow and disconnect

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.069 
can just pull the plow and disconnect
the<00:04:16.799> rent<00:04:16.980> from<00:04:17.100> here<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.910> this<00:04:18.120> plug<00:04:18.720> stays

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
the rent from here so this plug stays

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.620 
the rent from here so this plug stays
here<00:04:19.410> year<00:04:19.709> round<00:04:19.950> so<00:04:20.730> this<00:04:20.850> plugs<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.359> and

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
here year round so this plugs in and

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.470 
here year round so this plugs in and
that's<00:04:21.810> my<00:04:21.959> angle<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:23.639> runs<00:04:23.940> under<00:04:24.450> the

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
that's my angle and that runs under the

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.620 
that's my angle and that runs under the
truck<00:04:25.070> back<00:04:26.070> up<00:04:26.250> into<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.610> chassis<00:04:26.850> into<00:04:27.540> the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
truck back up into the chassis into the

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.420 
truck back up into the chassis into the
receiver<00:04:28.910> so<00:04:29.910> that's<00:04:30.510> how<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:30.810> was<00:04:30.900> done<00:04:31.110> and

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
receiver so that's how it was done and

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.140 
receiver so that's how it was done and
the<00:04:32.430> plow<00:04:32.639> again<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.210> just<00:04:33.240> made<00:04:33.600> it's<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:34.110> stock

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
the plow again is just made it's a stock

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.840 
the plow again is just made it's a stock
ESP<00:04:36.150> snow<00:04:36.660> plow<00:04:37.160> that's<00:04:38.160> been<00:04:38.370> modified<00:04:38.820> I

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
ESP snow plow that's been modified I

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.620 
ESP snow plow that's been modified I
have<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:40.310> servo<00:04:41.310> that's<00:04:41.550> zip<00:04:42.060> tied<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.540> the

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
have a servo that's zip tied to the

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.480 
have a servo that's zip tied to the
frame<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:43.169> know<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.740> zip<00:04:43.890> ties<00:04:44.070> are<00:04:44.250> very

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
frame I know that zip ties are very

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.430 
frame I know that zip ties are very
strong<00:04:44.850> because<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:45.360> have<00:04:45.390> my<00:04:45.810> steer<00:04:46.080> servo

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
strong because I have my steer servo

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.620 
strong because I have my steer servo
zipped<00:04:46.710> in<00:04:46.890> and<00:04:47.310> also<00:04:47.970> if<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.180> do<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.300> clausal

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
zipped in and also if you do a clausal

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.560 
zipped in and also if you do a clausal
upgrade<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:50.250> bracketry<00:04:50.760> they<00:04:50.970> give<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.330> is

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
upgrade the bracketry they give you is

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.190 
upgrade the bracketry they give you is
to<00:04:51.930> zip<00:04:52.320> tie<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.620> servo<00:04:53.160> in<00:04:53.310> so<00:04:53.700> it<00:04:54.660> does<00:04:54.930> work

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
to zip tie the servo in so it does work

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.280 
to zip tie the servo in so it does work
and<00:04:55.500> then<00:04:55.860> it's<00:04:56.070> just<00:04:56.250> corner<00:04:56.550> brackets

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
and then it's just corner brackets

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.719 
and then it's just corner brackets
bolted<00:04:58.290> to<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.470> front<00:04:58.680> of<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:58.800> plow<00:04:59.040> on<00:04:59.669> a

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
bolted to the front of the plow on a

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.530 
bolted to the front of the plow on a
5/16<00:05:00.570> rod<00:05:00.840> this<00:05:01.620> 5/16<00:05:02.370> rod<00:05:02.550> is<00:05:02.760> double<00:05:03.240> nutted

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
5/16 rod this 5/16 rod is double nutted

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.750 
5/16 rod this 5/16 rod is double nutted
on<00:05:03.630> both<00:05:03.840> sides<00:05:04.110> so<00:05:04.290> it<00:05:04.320> doesn't<00:05:04.590> spin<00:05:04.919> it<00:05:05.250> is

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
on both sides so it doesn't spin it is

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.570 
on both sides so it doesn't spin it is
also<00:05:06.360> locked<00:05:07.080> tightly<00:05:07.380> with<00:05:07.620> red<00:05:07.860> loctite<00:05:08.190> on

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
also locked tightly with red loctite on

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.140 
also locked tightly with red loctite on
both<00:05:08.910> sides<00:05:09.290> so<00:05:10.610> this<00:05:11.610> will<00:05:11.850> pretty<00:05:12.060> much

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
both sides so this will pretty much

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.180 
both sides so this will pretty much
never<00:05:12.540> come<00:05:12.840> off<00:05:13.020> of<00:05:13.229> here<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:13.440> use<00:05:13.740> so<00:05:13.950> much

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
never come off of here I use so much

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.430 
never come off of here I use so much
that<00:05:14.460> if<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:14.729> try<00:05:14.910> to<00:05:14.970> turn<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.540> would<00:05:15.990> physically

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
that if I try to turn I would physically

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.930 
that if I try to turn I would physically
have<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:16.800> heat<00:05:16.979> these<00:05:17.100> up<00:05:17.160> with<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.490> butane

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
have to heat these up with a butane

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.960 
have to heat these up with a butane
torch<00:05:18.180> to<00:05:19.020> break<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.380> lock<00:05:19.560> type<00:05:19.830> so<00:05:20.790> that's
