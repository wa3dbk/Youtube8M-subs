00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:14.280
 This time I will explain about balance adjustment of muscle and skeleton . 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.470
 First of all this and the Tteyuu distortion then the imbalance of the skeleton or say has become what mind 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.390
 Is a muscle imbalance 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.960
 After all it is around that supporting the bone 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:31.500
 The muscles, for example, in the muscles are supported 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:35.410
 If it becomes unbalanced on the left and right or unbalanced on the front and back, it is pulled 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.540
 To be distorted even afterward 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:44.200
 Cause body imbalance 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:47.380
 When there is a cat imbalance, the body responds to it as stress, so that body 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.970
 All when I feel stressed 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:56.520
 In the phenomenon of muscle strength resulting in I'm predecessor occurs 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:59.420
 There is only 100 percent more by eliminating the distortion 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.449
 It becomes important in thing close 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:09.649
 Today is an example of that 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:11.119
 I will try to improve the pelvic strain day and leg length as an example. 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.560
 I think 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:19.000
 What is the state of the pelvis by comparing the leg length of the mother ace 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.000
 We will check this 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.100
 Sitting like this in a long seat attitude 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.140
 Foot 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.880
 I think that was seen in the attached state 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 Give corresponding day opening 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.250
 At that moment 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.350
 The left or the position of the ankle is that it Miyamae is doubled Dolphins 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.790
 Please try a villain 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:46.020
 Right foot was short 0 this time 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:50.780
 The soles of the short legs at this time 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:54.490
 And we are the front and back of even the front side of Nagoya 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.729
 Is thought to be tense 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:04.970
 If the waist pelvis is short back 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:08.759
 Since I have caused such distortion to a long Obama, I will go down to the length of my leg 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:14.330
 First of all, the short legs 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:18.300
 So that shorter was better back side of the foot of extending 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.170
 My heart was short with Jesus and his right foot 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.580
 Behind the tea 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:30.870
 Perform a hamstring stretch 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:32.090
 The legs of what I bought are folded inward and I say the short legs before 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.270
 And 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.230
 Bell took 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.230
 It is a forward bending exercise 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.110
 I'm firmly behind the back 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.850
 Stretch effect has come out by performing time is I have to know the basic 1 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.360
 I really need your help 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.400
 Ooh 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.819
 The broadcast was long 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.770
 Stretch of one front side of the foot 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.800
 First of all, let's go into the attitude when choosing 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.490
 Have behind 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:11.520
 And here the pelvis and before Gu' 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.520
 I will continue to stretch this girl by pushing it out 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.950
 Let's apply for yes not too painful 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.150
 Such as Te door shorter person was longer in the - eating 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.500
 When stretching 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.760
 Then there is a balance in January 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:38.750
 And go after that 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:41.140
 If the back side of the foot of the person who was long there was a possibility that has been in a state of relaxed muscle it is hard to shrink 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.140
 Living 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:49.980
 Such a long leg 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.980
 The back of the train is in a state of tightening the training 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:04:00.310
 Go attracted to the chest the foot of the person also was short my legs of the person did not have 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.260
 Ui' in no state 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.260
 And Tei train the muscles of the bra 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.440
 Let's get rid of it too slowly about 10 times 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.030
 While attracting this well 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.030
 I will meet you 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:34.220
 After adjusting the muscle balance in this way again 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:38.150
 Because in a try to compare the position of the pelvis is in many cases uniform length of the foot 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.610
 Even if I was not aligned this time, I was gradually balancing my muscles 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.479
 One Tsu to continue if 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.770
 And prepare the pelvis and draw little by little 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.160
 Money 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.169
 Because I dance by having my own balance 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.860
 a 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.800
 What kind of approach 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:59.270
 Higher performance 4 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.870
 Called the try performed while taking that went by all means this because the body, such as the mind comes to hand 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.870
 I think that
