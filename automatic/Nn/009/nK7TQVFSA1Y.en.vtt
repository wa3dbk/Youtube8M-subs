you<00:00:00.210> would<00:00:00.329> keyboard<00:00:01.170> these<00:00:01.350> commands<00:00:01.829> in<00:00:02.100> and

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
you would keyboard these commands in and

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.770 
you would keyboard these commands in and
then<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.730> would<00:00:02.850> wait<00:00:03.060> for<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.330> while<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:03.510> then

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
then you would wait for a while and then

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.380 
then you would wait for a while and then
the<00:00:03.899> thing<00:00:04.049> will<00:00:04.080> go<00:00:04.670> that<00:00:05.670> would<00:00:05.879> tell<00:00:06.270> you

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
the thing will go that would tell you

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.950 
the thing will go that would tell you
something<00:00:06.750> out<00:00:07.099> but<00:00:08.300> even<00:00:09.300> with<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.840> was

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
something out but even with that it was

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.200 
something out but even with that it was
still<00:00:10.370> remarkable<00:00:11.370> especially<00:00:11.759> for<00:00:12.179> a

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
still remarkable especially for a

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.730 
still remarkable especially for a
ten-year-old<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.290> could<00:00:13.469> write<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
ten-year-old that you could write a

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.369 
ten-year-old that you could write a
program<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.580> basic<00:00:15.030> let's<00:00:15.240> say<00:00:15.480> or<00:00:15.690> Fortran

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
program and basic let's say or Fortran

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.050 
program and basic let's say or Fortran
and<00:00:16.910> actually<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.779> machine<00:00:19.320> would<00:00:19.970> sort<00:00:20.970> of

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and actually this machine would sort of

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.349 
and actually this machine would sort of
take<00:00:21.330> your<00:00:22.310> idea<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.750> it<00:00:25.760> would<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.210> would

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
take your idea and it would it would

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.450 
take your idea and it would it would
sort<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.660> execute<00:00:28.260> your<00:00:28.410> idea<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.039> give<00:00:29.340> you

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
sort of execute your idea and give you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.550 
sort of execute your idea and give you
back<00:00:29.699> some<00:00:30.000> results<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.660> if<00:00:31.199> they<00:00:31.320> were<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
back some results and if they were the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.200 
back some results and if they were the
results<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.160> predicted<00:00:32.669> your<00:00:32.820> program

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
results that you predicted your program

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.490 
results that you predicted your program
really<00:00:33.420> worked<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:33.899> an<00:00:34.050> incredibly

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
really worked it was an incredibly

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.950 
really worked it was an incredibly
thrilling<00:00:34.829> experience<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.610> mean<00:00:36.300> Picasso<00:00:36.809> had

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
thrilling experience I mean Picasso had

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.049 
thrilling experience I mean Picasso had
a<00:00:36.989> saying<00:00:37.290> he<00:00:37.469> said<00:00:37.649> good<00:00:38.190> artists<00:00:38.520> copy<00:00:38.610> great

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
a saying he said good artists copy great

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.010 
a saying he said good artists copy great
artists<00:00:39.960> steal<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:41.390> we<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.989> know

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
artists steal and we have you know

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.500 
artists steal and we have you know
always<00:00:43.350> been<00:00:44.309> shameless<00:00:44.940> about<00:00:45.210> stealing

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
always been shameless about stealing

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.069 
always been shameless about stealing
great<00:00:45.840> ideas<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:47.390> I'm<00:00:48.390> also<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.930> these

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
great ideas and I'm also one of these

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.500 
great ideas and I'm also one of these
people<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.680> don't<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:51.030> care<00:00:51.300> about

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
people that I don't really care about

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.250 
people that I don't really care about
being<00:00:51.750> right<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.860> know<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.879> care<00:00:54.120> about

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
being right you know I just care about

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.369 
being right you know I just care about
success<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.469> they<00:00:56.370> showed<00:00:56.670> me<00:00:56.940> really<00:00:57.379> three

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
success and they showed me really three

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.420 
success and they showed me really three
things<00:00:59.270> but<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.300> was<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.750> blinded<00:01:01.440> by<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.859> first

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
things but I was so blinded by the first

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.310 
things but I was so blinded by the first
one<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> didn't<00:01:03.090> even<00:01:03.180> really<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
one that I didn't even really see the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.179 
one that I didn't even really see the
other<00:01:04.500> two<00:01:06.409> one<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> things<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:07.950> showed

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
other two one of the things they showed

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.609 
other two one of the things they showed
me<00:01:08.400> was<00:01:08.520> object-oriented<00:01:09.240> programming<00:01:09.659> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
me was object-oriented programming it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.200 
me was object-oriented programming it
showed<00:01:10.890> me<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.610> didn't<00:01:11.909> even<00:01:12.000> see

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
showed me that but I didn't even see

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
showed me that but I didn't even see
that<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:13.530> other<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.830> they<00:01:13.920> showed<00:01:14.130> me<00:01:14.340> was

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that the other one they showed me was

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.249 
that the other one they showed me was
really<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.850> networked<00:01:15.390> computer<00:01:15.900> system<00:01:16.200> they

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
really a networked computer system they

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.990 
really a networked computer system they
had<00:01:16.350> over<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> hundred<00:01:16.619> Alto<00:01:17.280> computers<00:01:17.790> all

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
had over a hundred Alto computers all

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.170 
had over a hundred Alto computers all
networked<00:01:18.390> using<00:01:18.780> email<00:01:19.170> etc<00:01:20.130> etc<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.670> didn't

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
networked using email etc etc I didn't

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.100 
networked using email etc etc I didn't
even<00:01:21.299> see<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:22.220> was<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.460> blinded<00:01:24.090> by<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
even see that I was so blinded by the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.510 
even see that I was so blinded by the
first<00:01:25.380> thing<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:25.740> showed<00:01:25.950> me<00:01:26.130> which<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
first thing they showed me which was the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.999 
first thing they showed me which was the
graphical<00:01:26.909> user<00:01:27.000> interface<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.780> thought<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
graphical user interface I thought it

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.560 
graphical user interface I thought it
was<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> best<00:01:29.490> thing<00:01:29.729> I'd<00:01:29.909> ever<00:01:30.000> seen<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.540> my

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
was the best thing I'd ever seen in my

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.440 
was the best thing I'd ever seen in my
life<00:01:30.840> now<00:01:31.049> remember<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.250> was<00:01:32.460> very<00:01:32.670> flawed

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
life now remember it was very flawed

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.870 
life now remember it was very flawed
what<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.869> saw<00:01:34.140> was<00:01:34.409> incomplete<00:01:35.009> they'd<00:01:35.640> done<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
what we saw was incomplete they'd done a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.789 
what we saw was incomplete they'd done a
bunch<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.180> things<00:01:36.390> wrong<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.560> didn't<00:01:37.710> know

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
bunch of things wrong but we didn't know

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.230 
bunch of things wrong but we didn't know
that<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> time<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.490> still<00:01:38.790> though<00:01:39.060> they

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that at the time it's still though they

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.600 
that at the time it's still though they
had<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> germ<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.860> idea<00:01:41.159> was

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
had the germ of the of the idea was

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.370 
had the germ of the of the idea was
there<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.119> they<00:01:42.270> done<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> very<00:01:42.689> well<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
there and they done it very well and

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.130 
there and they done it very well and
within<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:47.189> know<00:01:47.340> 10<00:01:47.850> minutes<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.540> was

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
within you know 10 minutes it was

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.020 
within you know 10 minutes it was
obvious<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.770> me<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.430> computers<00:01:50.880> would

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
obvious to me that all computers would

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.429 
obvious to me that all computers would
work<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.600> basically<00:01:52.290> they<00:01:52.350> were

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
work like this basically they were

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.010 
work like this basically they were
copier<00:01:52.740> hands<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.280> had<00:01:53.399> no<00:01:53.549> clue<00:01:53.579> about<00:01:54.240> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
copier hands it just had no clue about a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.289 
copier hands it just had no clue about a
computer<00:01:55.860> what<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.159> could<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.180> they

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
computer what it could do and so they

not in the applications business it was

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.500 
not in the applications business it was

dominated by Lotus and Microsoft took a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.839 
dominated by Lotus and Microsoft took a
big<00:02:20.750> gamble<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.590> write<00:02:21.799> for<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.069> Mac<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.519> know

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
big gamble to write for the Mac you know

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.569 
big gamble to write for the Mac you know
I<00:02:22.879> brooded<00:02:23.480> for<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.689> few<00:02:23.840> months<00:02:24.049> but<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.859> was<00:02:25.099> it

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
I brooded for a few months but it was it

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.190 
I brooded for a few months but it was it
was<00:02:26.030> not<00:02:26.150> very<00:02:26.359> long<00:02:26.510> after<00:02:26.689> that<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:26.989> it

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
was not very long after that that it

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.800 
was not very long after that that it
really<00:02:27.500> occurred<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.129> me<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.459> if<00:02:29.060> we<00:02:29.329> didn't

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
really occurred to me that if we didn't

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.619 
really occurred to me that if we didn't
do<00:02:30.560> something<00:02:31.069> here<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.879> Apple<00:02:32.269> 2<00:02:32.450> was

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
do something here the Apple 2 was

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.679 
do something here the Apple 2 was
running<00:02:32.930> out<00:02:33.049> of<00:02:33.079> gas<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.819> we<00:02:34.819> needed<00:02:35.389> to<00:02:35.510> do

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
running out of gas and we needed to do

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.690 
running out of gas and we needed to do
something<00:02:36.079> with<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.319> technology<00:02:36.709> fast<00:02:37.310> or

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
something with this technology fast or

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.690 
something with this technology fast or
else<00:02:37.969> Apple<00:02:38.959> might<00:02:39.200> cease<00:02:39.799> to<00:02:40.040> exist<00:02:40.189> as<00:02:40.579> the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
else Apple might cease to exist as the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.899 
else Apple might cease to exist as the
company<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.299> was<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.819> formed<00:02:43.819> a

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
company that it was and so I formed a

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.300 
company that it was and so I formed a
small<00:02:44.060> team<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.689> do<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.930> Macintosh<00:02:45.439> and<00:02:45.709> you

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
small team to do the Macintosh and you

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.250 
small team to do the Macintosh and you
know<00:02:46.400> we<00:02:46.579> we<00:02:47.329> were<00:02:47.480> on<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.629> mission<00:02:47.720> from<00:02:48.200> God

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
know we we were on a mission from God

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.920 
know we we were on a mission from God
you<00:02:49.040> know<00:02:49.159> to<00:02:49.220> save<00:02:49.669> Apple<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.329> only<00:02:50.540> problem

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
you know to save Apple the only problem

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.539 
you know to save Apple the only problem
with<00:02:51.019> Microsoft<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.799> they<00:02:52.010> just<00:02:52.159> have<00:02:52.400> no

taste they have absolutely no taste and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.670 
taste they have absolutely no taste and
and<00:02:55.669> and<00:02:55.909> what<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.209> means<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.930> don't<00:02:57.560> mean

that in a small way I mean in the big
way<00:02:59.269> in<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.989> sense<00:03:00.349> that<00:03:05.409> they<00:03:07.299> they<00:03:08.299> don't

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510

way in the sense that they they don't
think<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:09.019> original<00:03:09.500> ideas<00:03:09.889> and<00:03:10.189> they<00:03:10.760> don't

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
think of original ideas and they don't

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.709

bring much culture into their product
and<00:03:14.719> you<00:03:15.409> say<00:03:15.560> well<00:03:15.709> why<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.069> that<00:03:16.159> important

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
and you say well why is that important

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.680 
and you say well why is that important
well<00:03:16.609> you<00:03:16.699> know<00:03:16.790> proportionally<00:03:17.419> spaced

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
well you know proportionally spaced

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.599 
well you know proportionally spaced
fonts<00:03:17.780> come<00:03:18.319> from<00:03:18.530> typesetting<00:03:19.430> and

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
fonts come from typesetting and

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.250 
fonts come from typesetting and
beautiful<00:03:20.030> books<00:03:20.329> that's<00:03:20.750> where<00:03:20.959> one<00:03:21.109> gets

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
beautiful books that's where one gets

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.469 
beautiful books that's where one gets
the<00:03:21.470> idea<00:03:21.799> if<00:03:22.099> it<00:03:22.699> weren't<00:03:22.849> for<00:03:22.909> the<00:03:23.060> Mac<00:03:23.269> they

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:23.479 
the idea if it weren't for the Mac they

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.289 
the idea if it weren't for the Mac they
would<00:03:23.629> never<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:24.049> that<00:03:24.199> in<00:03:24.319> their<00:03:24.440> products

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
would never have that in their products

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:33.069 
would never have that in their products
and<00:03:28.359> so<00:03:29.359> I<00:03:29.389> guess<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:30.639> am<00:03:31.639> saddened<00:03:32.329> not<00:03:32.900> by

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
and so I guess I am saddened not by

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.259 
and so I guess I am saddened not by
Microsoft<00:03:33.620> success<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.220> have<00:03:34.519> no<00:03:34.729> problem<00:03:35.150> with
