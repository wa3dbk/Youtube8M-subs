00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.030
 when we learned that aleksich could not 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.170
 visit with you 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.010
 that he's in Kiev this season then we 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.590
 I had to immediately find a replacement, we found 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.199
 using the raks of our sport great 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.820
 thank you for finding out how to replace us 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.630
 there was very little time to prepare a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.920
 Boria immediately suggested starting 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.960
 training we were not opposed and 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.210
 how prepared and act and Duma 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.510
 replacements in the team of course is always hard 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.710
 but I think we found a suitable 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.570
 replacement because he Igor same gene and 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.880
 has a pretty good mechanic to me 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.580
 it seems he can do well 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.680
 capable of this lana frantically that but 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.460
 let the soup world storm replacements it changed 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.350
 only 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.330
 the jar for everything else that we will 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.730
 play these lanes against yourself 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.060
 because for these three months we play 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.140
 together we have a lot of information 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.970
 the process guys at our team is green and 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.160
 we pass a lot of things in spam capital 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.080
 if they implement it all on off 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.680
 musical 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.680
 follow me 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.360
 I think to talk more if 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.510
 man knows what he needs for that 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.430
 to win then he will tell it all 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.800
 but since we have a replacement support for this 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.660
 first of all should have been explicit on 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.220
 play or mts energy that is besides you 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.530
 practice practice 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.900
 I played with him a lot of duty as I 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.410
 It seems to be a fundamental thing because 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.940
 that it helps not only to play but also 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.490
 establish communication with each other so that 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.670
 he and I find it easier to communicate with him I 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.040
 I think that really cutting replacement 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.140
 affect the teams strongly and need 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.790
 differently during the season in the process 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.040
 workouts just treat people 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.649
 realizing that the person you are playing with 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.180
 long 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.230
 often turns out to be better than someone more 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.670
 skill but it can be replaced in 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.670
 on the eve of the next tournament
