00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
effective ways to write faster is to use

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.849 
effective ways to write faster is to use
templates<00:00:21.480> for<00:00:21.660> your<00:00:21.810> most<00:00:22.170> common<00:00:22.529> types<00:00:22.710> of

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
templates for your most common types of

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.370 
templates for your most common types of
work<00:00:23.180> for<00:00:24.180> example<00:00:24.359> if<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.869> write<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.080> lot<00:00:25.260> of

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
work for example if you write a lot of

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.960 
work for example if you write a lot of
articles<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:26.010> designed<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.519> be<00:00:26.609> used<00:00:26.640> as

articles that are designed to be used as
web<00:00:27.150> content<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.019> create<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.289> number<00:00:28.590> of

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
web content you can create a number of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
templates that provide you with a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
templates that provide you with a
skeleton<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.750> an<00:00:30.840> article<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.320> get<00:00:31.439> started
