still included in this game but I'm also

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.910 
still included in this game but I'm also
kind<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.550> disappointed<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:58.050> Gotham<00:00:58.559> doesn't

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
kind of disappointed that Gotham doesn't

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.010 
kind of disappointed that Gotham doesn't
look<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.280> big<00:00:59.609> as<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.030> hoped<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.660> thought<00:01:00.870> it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
look as big as I hoped I thought it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.889 
look as big as I hoped I thought it
would<00:01:01.140> be<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> lot<00:01:01.770> bigger<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.670> lot<00:01:03.210> bigger<00:01:03.270> area

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
would be a lot bigger a lot bigger area

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.170 
would be a lot bigger a lot bigger area
to<00:01:04.140> travel<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.010> guess<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.400> okay<00:01:05.700> because

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
to travel but I guess it's okay because

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.880 
to travel but I guess it's okay because
I<00:01:06.540> mean<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.170> we're<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.740> be

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
I mean it's not like we're going to be

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.940 
I mean it's not like we're going to be
jumping<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.580> huge<00:01:08.960> skyscrapers<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.290> stuff

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
jumping up huge skyscrapers and stuff

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.260 
jumping up huge skyscrapers and stuff
like<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.790> probably<00:01:11.939> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> be

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
like that so it's probably going to be

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.780 
like that so it's probably going to be
you<00:01:12.570> know<00:01:12.689> large<00:01:13.200> skyscrapers<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.340> huge

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you know large skyscrapers but not huge

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.149 
you know large skyscrapers but not huge
like<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.780> backdrop<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.290> Arkham

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
like we see in the backdrop of Arkham

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.530 
like we see in the backdrop of Arkham
City<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.490> don't<00:01:17.700> think<00:01:17.909> we're<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.450> be

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
City I don't think we're going to be

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.240 
City I don't think we're going to be
able<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.869> travel<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.380> buildings<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:20.009> that

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
able to travel up buildings like that

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.960 
able to travel up buildings like that
but<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.479> also<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.460> one

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
but you can also see that we have a one

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.539 
but you can also see that we have a one
of<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.689> villains<00:01:25.080> confirmed<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.340> going

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
of the villains confirmed and it's going

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.179 
of the villains confirmed and it's going
to<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.880> black<00:01:27.299> mask<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.680> don't<00:01:28.979> know

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
to be black mask and if you don't know

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.210 
to be black mask and if you don't know
the<00:01:29.490> person<00:01:29.700> behind<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.540> mask<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:31.049> Roman<00:01:31.950> see

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the person behind the mask is Roman see

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.969 
the person behind the mask is Roman see
onus<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.939> think<00:01:33.270> that's<00:01:33.450> how<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.570> say<00:01:33.810> his<00:01:33.840> name

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
onus I think that's how you say his name

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.580 
onus I think that's how you say his name
but<00:01:34.979> Roman<00:01:35.430> see<00:01:35.670> onus<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.240> actually<00:01:37.140> killed<00:01:37.409> by

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
but Roman see onus is actually killed by

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.940 
but Roman see onus is actually killed by
Catwoman<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.930> that<00:01:39.930> could<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.229> some<00:01:40.619> sort<00:01:40.829> of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
Catwoman and that could be some sort of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.460 
Catwoman and that could be some sort of
a<00:01:41.040> spoiler<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.490> he<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.150> killed<00:01:42.570> by<00:01:43.140> Catwoman

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
so that could somewhat give us a hint

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.990 
so that could somewhat give us a hint
that<00:01:46.530> Catwoman<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.880> this

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
and that's actually somewhat of a side

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.749 
and that's actually somewhat of a side
mission<00:02:00.270> or<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.740> huge<00:02:01.740> mystery<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.610> get

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
fighting of course because Catwoman is a

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.380 
fighting of course because Catwoman is a
villain<00:02:34.410> technically<00:02:34.980> until<00:02:35.700> she<00:02:35.970> kind<00:02:36.270> of

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
villain technically until she kind of

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.720 
villain technically until she kind of
helps<00:02:36.810> Batman<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.650> know<00:02:38.010> certain<00:02:38.520> times

helps Batman and you know certain times

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.850 
helps Batman and you know certain times
but<00:02:39.090> technically<00:02:39.780> she's<00:02:40.080> still<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.410> villain

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
but technically she's still a villain

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.670 
but technically she's still a villain
and<00:02:41.100> her<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.240> Ivy<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.110> mean<00:02:43.440> they're<00:02:43.650> all

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
and her and Ivy I mean they're all

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.010 
and her and Ivy I mean they're all
they're<00:02:44.160> all<00:02:44.190> buds<00:02:44.610> well<00:02:45.510> actually<00:02:45.660> not

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
they're all buds well actually not

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.760 
they're all buds well actually not
really<00:02:46.080> but<00:02:46.500> yeah<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.940> could<00:02:48.210> confirm

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
really but yeah so that could confirm

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.080 
really but yeah so that could confirm
Catwoman<00:02:49.770> now<00:02:49.920> if<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.250> thought<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:50.760> was<00:02:51.030> a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
Catwoman now if you thought that was a

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.460 
Catwoman now if you thought that was a
spoiler<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.600> not<00:02:51.810> really<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.170> spoiler

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
spoiler it's not really a spoiler

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.560 
spoiler it's not really a spoiler
because<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.220> whole<00:02:53.370> death<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.820> black<00:02:54.000> mask<00:02:54.300> is

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
because the whole death of black mask is

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.600 
because the whole death of black mask is
actually<00:02:55.020> kind<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.470> side<00:02:55.710> mission<00:02:56.010> kind<00:02:56.430> of

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
actually kind of a side mission kind of

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.880 
actually kind of a side mission kind of
thing<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.630> there's<00:02:57.810> really<00:02:57.930> nothing<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.470> worry

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
thing so there's really nothing to worry

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.570 
thing so there's really nothing to worry
about<00:02:59.090> but<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.240> could<00:03:00.510> be<00:03:00.540> wrong<00:03:00.660> anyway<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.740> I

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
about but I could be wrong anyway and I

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.160 
about but I could be wrong anyway and I
actually<00:03:03.120> don't<00:03:03.510> think<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.900> would<00:03:04.020> be<00:03:04.140> that

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
actually don't think it would be that

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.320 
actually don't think it would be that
easy<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.890> Catwoman<00:03:05.460> would<00:03:05.820> be<00:03:05.970> killing

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
easy that Catwoman would be killing

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.090 
easy that Catwoman would be killing
black<00:03:06.480> mass<00:03:06.690> but<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:07.140> keep<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.800> on<00:03:07.980> your

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
black mass but just keep that on your

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.080 
black mass but just keep that on your
mind<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.520> thought<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.850> was<00:03:08.970> pretty

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
mind I thought that was pretty

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.710
