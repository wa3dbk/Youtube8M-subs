flour<00:01:15.840> mixture<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:17.270> this<00:01:18.270> becomes<00:01:18.659> your

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
flour mixture and this becomes your

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:30.859 
flour mixture and this becomes your
basic<00:01:19.470> pancake<00:01:20.009> recipe

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.840 

that's<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:31.619> pancake<00:01:32.009> batter<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that's your pancake batter this is the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.520 
that's your pancake batter this is the
kind<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.149> drop<00:01:33.390> consistency<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> need<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
kind of drop consistency you need to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.050 
kind of drop consistency you need to
achieve<00:01:35.270> in<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.360> pan<00:01:36.600> by<00:01:37.020> some<00:01:37.229> butter<00:01:37.850> now<00:01:38.850> I'm

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
achieve in a pan by some butter now I'm

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
achieve in a pan by some butter now I'm
going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.329> use<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.689> mold<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.799> get<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
going to use the mold so that I get a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.389 
going to use the mold so that I get a
perfect<00:01:41.670> round<00:01:41.850> shape<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.270> my<00:01:42.570> pancakes<00:01:43.399> but

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
perfect round shape to my pancakes but

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.340 
perfect round shape to my pancakes but
you<00:01:44.520> could<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.789> it<00:01:44.820> without<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:45.869> well<00:01:46.200> if

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
you could do it without it as well if

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.620 
you could do it without it as well if
you<00:01:46.470> don't<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.830> one<00:01:47.039> and<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.970> laddle<00:01:48.539> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you don't have one and just laddle a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.419 
you don't have one and just laddle a
spoonful<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.409> batter<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:52.560> wait<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.340> it

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
spoonful of the batter and wait for it

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.639 
spoonful of the batter and wait for it
to<00:01:53.549> cook<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.700> think<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.380> bottom<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
to cook so now I think the bottom of the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.919 
to cook so now I think the bottom of the
pancake<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.250> settled<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.659> I'm<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:00.899> to

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
pancake is settled so I'm going to

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.539 
pancake is settled so I'm going to
slowly<00:02:01.200> remove<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:03.080> now<00:02:04.080> as<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.319> can<00:02:04.470> see<00:02:04.649> it

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
slowly remove this now as you can see it

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.490 
slowly remove this now as you can see it
gives<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.880> nice<00:02:06.030> round<00:02:06.450> shape<00:02:06.569> to<00:02:06.959> the<00:02:07.049> pancake

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
gives a nice round shape to the pancake

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.289 
gives a nice round shape to the pancake
not<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> perfect<00:02:08.130> round<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:08.940> nevertheless

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
not the perfect round but nevertheless

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.270 
not the perfect round but nevertheless
and<00:02:09.810> we'll<00:02:09.989> cook<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.350> till<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> bottom<00:02:10.860> turns

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
and we'll cook it till the bottom turns

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.400 
and we'll cook it till the bottom turns
nice<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.120> brown<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.510> then<00:02:12.870> we'll<00:02:13.019> flip<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
nice and brown and then we'll flip the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.830 
nice and brown and then we'll flip the
pancake<00:02:13.769> over<00:02:14.010> now<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.239> great<00:02:15.540> process

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840

the chocolate chip pancake again very

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:11.820 
the chocolate chip pancake again very
simple<00:04:00.950> we<00:04:01.580> take<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.760> ladle<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.210> the<00:04:02.360> batter<00:04:10.750> and

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
simple we take a ladle of the batter and

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.690 
simple we take a ladle of the batter and
sprinkle<00:04:13.810> chocolate<00:04:14.810> chips<00:04:15.110> on<00:04:15.710> it<00:04:15.920> a<00:04:16.130> good

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
sprinkle chocolate chips on it a good

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.790 

so<00:04:24.150> these<00:04:24.300> chips<00:04:24.659> won't<00:04:24.960> melt<00:04:25.229> because<00:04:25.680> they

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
so these chips won't melt because they

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.469 
so these chips won't melt because they
are<00:04:25.889> big<00:04:26.099> stable<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:26.699> cook<00:04:26.879> stable<00:04:27.300> they'll

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
are big stable and cook stable they'll

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.510 
are big stable and cook stable they'll
stay<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.900> same<00:04:28.080> way<00:04:28.319> so<00:04:28.770> when<00:04:28.889> you<00:04:28.979> bite<00:04:29.220> into

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520
