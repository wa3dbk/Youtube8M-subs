00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.870
 what will it bring about today but let's go to 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.870
 to see 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.560
 I don't think he brought anything 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.060
 who knows what is special but try 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:35.550
 it also does not harm because the week 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.649
 last I could not for technical reasons 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.920
 between the video but I had already said that 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.600
 however to make a trip so 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.410
 Now let's see what brings door 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.640
 something interesting some weapon 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.320
 then in the end I think the weapons and money 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:58.440
 that those are so it's not who knows what 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:02.320
 invent something like the lanner falcon 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.450
 montecarlo who wanted it 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.380
 I think he dreams of it and sells it xor 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.780
 I hope he voted less than the summaries 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.420
 with the saints I buy twenty 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.420
 it is so much this wine of the coins now 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.170
 the coins are just a priest or something 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.090
 at the beginning it was a simple one 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:30.060
 difficult now is much simpler 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.570
 with two coins for the stuff and you did 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.020
 bullshit 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.780
 so in the sense that by now we are 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.320
 finished coins 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.320
 I ca n't run down 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.670
 away I drive by a strange one 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.520
 stop this thing they had made rounds 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.300
 here it is the road I believe more in 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.300
 terror of this 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:14.580
 a woman died interacting with these 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:20.910
 let us off we pass by machine 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:24.410
 dance then I have that you more 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.420
 quickly when myths aim the current 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.560
 when the fuck and translate what you 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.230
 move faster when I get it back 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.360
 his weapon when he reminds me he worked 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.830
 breaker roads in other words here would be made 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.480
 the other hunter because now this 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:50.520
 but stellar protocol but had the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.299
 boy is this now heaven or 3 in 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.750
 nothing i took the last time 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.280
 in fact when I was second video I got it 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.680
 the summaries did not bring how they exist 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.280
 what an fucking an exotic ingram there 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:14.459
 let's take line gragÃ  some 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:16.640
 helmet but let's see but here we are ball 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.640
 it goes 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.340
 indeed not for now the 21 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:35.390
 run run six girls but next 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.530
 the expansion there is a march 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.250
 mom my rediscovered thing hunt what 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:04:00.860
 I found it's an exotic mesh duck on 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:04:03.950
 32 19 goodbye and there is your helmet and not 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.400
 it would be bad if I didn't have another one 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:13.900
 these to the third man inside the 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:17.630
 here here is me this 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:23.390
 this valid potential this jesolo 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:25.610
 we upgrade for the other hunter 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:30.860
 as of this it moves more water beyond the 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:34.340
 pierre nothing but another in return 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.820
 just say field the light particles mi 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.820
 they are of no use 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.990
 so so now promised 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.340
 I'm here 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.830
 as the helmet said the exotic one 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.510
 that all eyes do not see how it is 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:08.360
 he calls, however, not only does ten not enter 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:11.690
 hoping he doesn't give me something about the dl 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:19.520
 ie the case of the show what 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:31.100
 must do for 3 2 1 woman called him 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:37.360
 I called him to the arachnid he put 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:39.560
 almost scene found though that does this 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.140
 of messina where on that energy when 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.610
 kills enemy with a grenade we had 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.070
 by an increase the zoom accuracy 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:50.030
 when this mombello is aimed at me 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.000
 enhanced because I like it and like it 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.010
 so mode boosts fuck off 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:02.180
 exotic sky fragment between the metal 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:07.760
 you and me okay on did not bring anything 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:11.480
 of detail in the end but brought 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.910
 unless the exotic deceptions that from the mi 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.970
 surprised two helmets footballer 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.580
 which in any case I did not have but it is not but 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.050
 The collection also because for the fifa 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.150
 example the tarsu with itself and 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.759
 which allows you to use radar 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.370
 even when I'm in pvp it's not bad 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:31.050
 in the crucible he makes his slut figure 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.080
 the other sincerely another helmet mi 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.150
 like it also strengthens because a helmet 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:42.060
 or new exotic that I sincerely would like 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:44.490
 even though I am loyal to the helmet of the 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.710
 however, third did not go 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:51.169
 very badly compared with the weapons of the 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:54.150
 shit though for the lucky part 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:56.659
 and see you cook sur next 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.659
