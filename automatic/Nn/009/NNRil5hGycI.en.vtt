don't<00:00:26.169> know<00:00:26.259> why<00:00:26.380> I<00:00:26.410> did<00:00:26.619> an<00:00:26.770> intro<00:00:27.039> that<00:00:27.220> weird

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
don't know why I did an intro that weird

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.029 
don't know why I did an intro that weird
that<00:00:27.610> was<00:00:28.230> uncomfortable<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.470> say<00:00:29.650> the<00:00:29.800> least

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
that was uncomfortable to say the least

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.439 
that was uncomfortable to say the least
so<00:00:30.130> anyways<00:00:30.579> we're<00:00:30.789> gonna<00:00:30.910> be<00:00:31.060> diving<00:00:31.210> into

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
so anyways we're gonna be diving into

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.689 
so anyways we're gonna be diving into
the<00:00:32.019> brand<00:00:32.379> new<00:00:32.500> map<00:00:32.680> and<00:00:32.710> what<00:00:33.070> works<00:00:33.309> with<00:00:33.519> it

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
the brand new map and what works with it

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.250 
the brand new map and what works with it
what<00:00:34.030> doesn't<00:00:34.269> work<00:00:34.449> with<00:00:34.660> it<00:00:34.750> and<00:00:34.900> whether<00:00:35.050> or

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
what doesn't work with it and whether or

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.259 
what doesn't work with it and whether or
not<00:00:35.350> it<00:00:35.559> is<00:00:35.680> worth<00:00:35.890> your<00:00:36.070> money<00:00:36.129> so<00:00:36.879> to<00:00:36.940> start

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
not it is worth your money so to start

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.780 
not it is worth your money so to start
off<00:00:37.360> this<00:00:37.420> brand<00:00:37.930> new<00:00:38.050> map<00:00:38.230> is<00:00:38.470> I<00:00:38.830> don't<00:00:39.670> know

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
off this brand new map is I don't know

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.090 
off this brand new map is I don't know
like<00:00:39.970> to<00:00:40.269> judge<00:00:40.600> it<00:00:40.780> on<00:00:40.930> size<00:00:41.290> because<00:00:41.829> it's<00:00:42.010> a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
like to judge it on size because it's a

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.460 
like to judge it on size because it's a
huge<00:00:42.579> map<00:00:42.940> but<00:00:43.360> it's<00:00:43.510> very<00:00:43.780> tight<00:00:44.170> so

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
huge map but it's very tight so

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.029 
huge map but it's very tight so
considerate<00:00:45.159> a<00:00:45.339> very<00:00:45.940> thin<00:00:46.449> but<00:00:47.110> large<00:00:47.559> map

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
considerate a very thin but large map

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.920 
considerate a very thin but large map
like<00:00:48.520> a<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.829> cake<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.910> a<00:00:51.969> bad<00:00:52.480> cake

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
like a like a cake like a bad cake

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.279 
like a like a cake like a bad cake
consider<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:53.949> like<00:00:54.100> a<00:00:54.129> bad<00:00:54.520> cake<00:00:55.079> because<00:00:56.079> this

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
consider it like a bad cake because this

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.170 
consider it like a bad cake because this
map<00:00:56.500> this<00:00:57.309> actually<00:00:57.609> it's<00:00:57.730> like<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.879> hotel

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
map this actually it's like a hotel

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.650 
map this actually it's like a hotel
under<00:00:58.750> water<00:00:59.199> and<00:01:00.070> in<00:01:00.519> this<00:01:00.699> underwater<00:01:01.180> area

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
under water and in this underwater area

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.540 
under water and in this underwater area
you<00:01:01.809> just<00:01:01.840> have<00:01:02.170> like<00:01:02.199> your<00:01:02.469> concierge<00:01:03.100> area

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
you just have like your concierge area

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.940 
you just have like your concierge area
your<00:01:03.820> Lobby<00:01:04.239> things<00:01:04.600> like<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:05.140> but<00:01:05.710> with

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
your Lobby things like that but with

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.620 
your Lobby things like that but with
zombies<00:01:06.640> coming<00:01:06.850> in<00:01:07.030> around<00:01:07.210> it<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:07.450> it's<00:01:07.600> a

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
zombies coming in around it so it's a

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.450 
zombies coming in around it so it's a
very<00:01:07.780> tight<00:01:08.050> area<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:09.039> there's<00:01:09.280> a<00:01:09.310> couple

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
very tight area and there's a couple

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.100 
very tight area and there's a couple
areas<00:01:09.700> like<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.090> spots<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.600> are<00:01:10.780> where<00:01:11.020> you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
areas like the spots that are where you

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.480 
areas like the spots that are where you
can<00:01:11.259> loop<00:01:11.440> and<00:01:11.619> make<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.890> lot<00:01:12.039> easier<00:01:12.070> but

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
can loop and make it a lot easier but

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.669 
can loop and make it a lot easier but
this<00:01:12.640> map<00:01:12.789> is<00:01:12.940> extremely<00:01:13.690> difficult<00:01:13.960> actually

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
this map is extremely difficult actually

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.850 
this map is extremely difficult actually
the<00:01:15.670> first<00:01:15.850> reason<00:01:16.330> being<00:01:16.360> that<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:17.020> gigantic

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
the first reason being that the gigantic

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.699 
the first reason being that the gigantic
boss<00:01:18.100> battles<00:01:18.550> with<00:01:18.700> us<00:01:18.850> take<00:01:19.270> way<00:01:20.200> too<00:01:20.530> long

00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:20.709 
boss battles with us take way too long

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:24.240 
boss battles with us take way too long
like<00:01:21.250> I'm<00:01:21.399> talking<00:01:21.610> like<00:01:21.880> they<00:01:22.030> take<00:01:23.250> stupid

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
like I'm talking like they take stupid

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.460 
like I'm talking like they take stupid
amounts<00:01:24.759> of<00:01:24.880> time<00:01:25.060> so<00:01:25.539> in<00:01:25.899> regards<00:01:26.289> to<00:01:26.380> that

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
amounts of time so in regards to that

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.650 
amounts of time so in regards to that
that's<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:27.009> very<00:01:27.220> big<00:01:27.490> negative<00:01:27.910> but<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.479> map

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
that's a very big negative but the map

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.749 
that's a very big negative but the map
is<00:01:28.840> pretty<00:01:29.080> fun<00:01:29.259> itself<00:01:29.619> I'd<00:01:30.369> say<00:01:30.610> that

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
is pretty fun itself I'd say that

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.010 
is pretty fun itself I'd say that
carrier<00:01:31.149> was<00:01:31.420> a<00:01:31.450> little<00:01:31.780> bit<00:01:31.899> better

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
carrier was a little bit better

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.589 
carrier was a little bit better
personally<00:01:32.679> and<00:01:33.459> then<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:33.789> would<00:01:33.970> say<00:01:34.239> that

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:34.599 
personally and then I would say that

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.359 
personally and then I would say that
before<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:35.080> I<00:01:35.259> actually<00:01:35.560> enjoyed<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.160> first

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
before that I actually enjoyed the first

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.880 
before that I actually enjoyed the first
EXO<00:01:36.819> zombies<00:01:36.849> map<00:01:37.360> ever<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:38.229> most<00:01:38.470> out<00:01:38.679> of<00:01:38.709> all

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
EXO zombies map ever the most out of all

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.580 
EXO zombies map ever the most out of all
of<00:01:38.950> these<00:01:39.220> but<00:01:40.209> I<00:01:40.300> would<00:01:40.420> say<00:01:40.539> this<00:01:40.690> one<00:01:40.869> it's

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
of these but I would say this one it's

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.229 
of these but I would say this one it's
pretty<00:01:42.009> decent<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.489> think<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.819> thing<00:01:43.000> is<00:01:43.030> that

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:43.239 
pretty decent I think the thing is that

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:44.070 
pretty decent I think the thing is that
they're<00:01:43.360> learning<00:01:43.599> from<00:01:43.780> their<00:01:44.050> mistakes

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
they're learning from their mistakes

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.260 
they're learning from their mistakes
overall<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.220> that<00:01:45.610> it's<00:01:45.789> kind<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.119> they're

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
overall and that it's kind of they're

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.290 
overall and that it's kind of they're
consistently<00:01:47.020> improving<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.970> map<00:01:49.149> was

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
consistently improving the map was

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.400 
consistently improving the map was
definitely<00:01:49.630> interesting<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.140> think<00:01:50.200> the

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
definitely interesting I think the

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.169 
definitely interesting I think the
storyline<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.099> it<00:01:51.250> kind<00:01:51.459> of<00:01:51.520> ended<00:01:51.729> slightly

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
storyline to it kind of ended slightly

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.850 
storyline to it kind of ended slightly
abruptly<00:01:52.599> I<00:01:52.840> think<00:01:53.319> they<00:01:53.410> could<00:01:53.530> have<00:01:53.560> fleshed

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
abruptly I think they could have fleshed

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.529 
abruptly I think they could have fleshed
it<00:01:54.009> out<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.220> little<00:01:54.429> bit<00:01:54.580> more<00:01:54.880> over<00:01:55.209> the<00:01:55.300> course

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
it out a little bit more over the course

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.479 
it out a little bit more over the course
of<00:01:55.780> an<00:01:55.989> entire<00:01:56.110> game<00:01:56.560> rather<00:01:56.920> than<00:01:57.130> having<00:01:57.310> a

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:57.489 
of an entire game rather than having a

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:59.339 
of an entire game rather than having a
contained<00:01:57.940> story<00:01:58.330> for<00:01:58.599> one<00:01:58.780> game<00:01:59.050> I<00:01:59.259> think

00:01:59.339 --> 00:01:59.349 
contained story for one game I think

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:00.150 
contained story for one game I think
that<00:01:59.470> would<00:01:59.619> have<00:01:59.679> been<00:01:59.739> a<00:01:59.860> little<00:02:00.069> more

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
that would have been a little more

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.820 
that would have been a little more
intriguing<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.840> overall<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.379> thought<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:02.709> was

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
intriguing but overall I thought it was

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.619 
intriguing but overall I thought it was
pretty<00:02:03.009> entertaining<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.849> think<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.179> guns<00:02:04.390> are

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:04.629 
pretty entertaining I think the guns are

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:05.850 
pretty entertaining I think the guns are
they<00:02:04.720> added<00:02:04.989> were<00:02:05.110> fantastic<00:02:05.739> the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
they added were fantastic the

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.359 
they added were fantastic the
blunderbuss

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
blunderbuss

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.520 
blunderbuss
and<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:07.119> new<00:02:07.360> Trident<00:02:07.690> are<00:02:07.959> a<00:02:07.989> lot<00:02:08.200> of<00:02:08.229> fun

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
and the new Trident are a lot of fun

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.380 
and the new Trident are a lot of fun
however<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:09.039> Trident<00:02:09.429> is<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.580> little<00:02:09.970> iffy<00:02:10.239> in

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
however the Trident is a little iffy in

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.119 
however the Trident is a little iffy in
terms<00:02:10.690> of<00:02:10.869> like<00:02:11.050> how<00:02:11.200> good<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:11.620> because

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
terms of like how good it is because

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.339 
terms of like how good it is because
even<00:02:12.940> if<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.150> shoot<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.569> at<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.720> zombie<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.230> will

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
even if you shoot it at a zombie it will

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.780 
even if you shoot it at a zombie it will
only<00:02:14.440> kill<00:02:14.770> one<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.010> them<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.250> it's<00:02:15.520> not<00:02:15.580> like

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
only kill one of them and it's not like

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.400 
only kill one of them and it's not like
that<00:02:15.849> it's<00:02:16.209> like<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.480> Wunderwaffe<00:02:16.930> etcetera

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
that it's like a Wunderwaffe etcetera

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.020 
that it's like a Wunderwaffe etcetera
i'll<00:02:17.890> where<00:02:18.099> can<00:02:18.280> knock<00:02:18.430> out<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.610> whole<00:02:18.849> group

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
i'll where can knock out a whole group

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.559 
i'll where can knock out a whole group
of<00:02:19.180> zombies<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.890> think<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.879> biggest<00:02:22.060> negatives

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
of zombies I think the biggest negatives

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.229 
of zombies I think the biggest negatives
to<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:22.780> map<00:02:22.989> would<00:02:23.140> be<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:24.040> fact<00:02:24.489> that<00:02:24.670> it

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
to this map would be the fact that it

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.899 
to this map would be the fact that it
takes<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.900> long<00:02:26.349> long<00:02:26.590> time<00:02:26.859> to<00:02:26.920> kind<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.489> set

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
takes a long long time to kind of set

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.339 
takes a long long time to kind of set
yourself<00:02:28.030> up<00:02:28.480> do<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.959> amount<00:02:29.170> of

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
yourself up do the amount of

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.470 
yourself up do the amount of
points<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:29.859> cost<00:02:30.129> of<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.909> map<00:02:31.090> open<00:02:31.359> up

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
points that cost of this map open up

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.170 
points that cost of this map open up
it's<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.930> very<00:02:32.230> extensive<00:02:32.499> map<00:02:32.859> to<00:02:33.040> open<00:02:33.069> up<00:02:33.370> and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
it's a very extensive map to open up and

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.129 
it's a very extensive map to open up and
then<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.420> fact<00:02:34.629> that<00:02:34.689> it's<00:02:34.900> actually

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
then the fact that it's actually

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.539 
then the fact that it's actually
difficult<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.650> get<00:02:35.829> said<00:02:36.040> points<00:02:36.340> because

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
difficult to get said points because

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.129 
difficult to get said points because
it's<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:36.849> tight<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.239> hard<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.659> kind<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.870> gain

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
it's so tight and hard to kind of gain

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.160 
it's so tight and hard to kind of gain
points<00:02:38.379> early<00:02:38.739> on<00:02:38.889> I<00:02:39.099> mean<00:02:39.719> other<00:02:40.719> than<00:02:41.049> that

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
points early on I mean other than that

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.110 
points early on I mean other than that
guys<00:02:41.499> it's<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.709> pretty<00:02:41.950> enjoyable<00:02:42.249> map<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.849> give

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
guys it's a pretty enjoyable map I give

guys it's a pretty enjoyable map I give
it<00:02:43.150> probably<00:02:43.749> a<00:02:43.780> seven<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.769> a<00:02:44.799> six<00:02:45.459> point<00:02:45.909> eight

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
it probably a seven to a six point eight

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.959 
it probably a seven to a six point eight
out<00:02:46.719> of<00:02:46.750> ten<00:02:47.139> I'd<00:02:47.349> say<00:02:47.560> not<00:02:48.129> that<00:02:48.400> great<00:02:48.639> not

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:48.969 
out of ten I'd say not that great not

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.550 
out of ten I'd say not that great not
that<00:02:49.000> bad<00:02:49.450> it's<00:02:49.689> kind<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.109> best<00:02:50.260> out<00:02:50.530> of

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
that bad it's kind of the best out of

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.319 
that bad it's kind of the best out of

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
but if you're not it's a map that you

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.909 
but if you're not it's a map that you
could<00:03:01.480> definitely<00:03:01.659> go<00:03:02.049> play<00:03:02.439> and<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.769> might

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
get some replayability out of it but
