you<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:54.090> top<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:56.390> can<00:01:57.390> tell

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
you on top so you can tell

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.569 
you on top so you can tell
but<00:01:59.840> this<00:01:59.960> one's<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.320> lot<00:02:00.679> shinier<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.310> grabs

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
but this one's a lot shinier it grabs

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.819 
but this one's a lot shinier it grabs
the<00:02:01.759> light<00:02:01.939> a<00:02:02.119> lot<00:02:02.329> more<00:02:02.600> than<00:02:03.140> this<00:02:03.289> one<00:02:03.560> um

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
the light a lot more than this one um

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.950 
the light a lot more than this one um
but<00:02:04.609> I<00:02:04.670> do<00:02:04.759> like<00:02:05.119> it<00:02:05.329> because<00:02:05.509> it's<00:02:05.780> not

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
but I do like it because it's not

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.499 
but I do like it because it's not
completely<00:02:06.439> flat<00:02:06.920> I've<00:02:07.429> seen<00:02:07.819> some<00:02:08.119> matte

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
completely flat I've seen some matte

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.380 
completely flat I've seen some matte
nail<00:02:08.720> polishes<00:02:09.319> that<00:02:09.679> kind<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.700> make<00:02:10.819> the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
nail polishes that kind of make the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.720 
nail polishes that kind of make the
polish<00:02:11.989> look<00:02:12.290> like<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.650> sharpie<00:02:13.250> like<00:02:13.459> if<00:02:13.580> you

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
polish look like a sharpie like if you

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.369 
polish look like a sharpie like if you
drew<00:02:13.940> sharpie<00:02:14.330> on<00:02:14.360> your<00:02:14.599> hand<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:14.989> then<00:02:15.110> are

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
drew sharpie on your hand and then are

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.830 
drew sharpie on your hand and then are
on<00:02:15.650> your<00:02:15.830> fingers<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:17.090> just<00:02:17.239> looks<00:02:17.480> flat

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
on your fingers and it just looks flat

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.690 
on your fingers and it just looks flat
and<00:02:18.080> there's<00:02:18.200> really<00:02:18.410> no<00:02:18.799> dimension<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.430> I

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
and there's really no dimension to it I

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.280 
and there's really no dimension to it I
don't<00:02:20.120> really<00:02:20.209> like<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.660> like<00:02:20.959> this

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
don't really like that I like this

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.830 
don't really like that I like this
because<00:02:21.530> it's<00:02:21.799> kind<00:02:22.069> of<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.400> like<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.299> satin

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
because it's kind of a like a satin

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.259 
because it's kind of a like a satin
almost<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.250> really<00:02:25.519> like<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.879> effect<00:02:26.150> that

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
almost so I really like the effect that

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.259 
almost so I really like the effect that
it<00:02:26.390> has<00:02:26.510> on<00:02:26.780> nail<00:02:27.319> polishes<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:28.010> did<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> few

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
it has on nail polishes I did a few

it has on nail polishes I did a few
swatches<00:02:29.930> of<00:02:29.959> some<00:02:30.349> different<00:02:30.739> finishes<00:02:31.610> of

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
swatches of some different finishes of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.470 
swatches of some different finishes of
nail<00:02:32.329> polishes<00:02:32.810> on<00:02:32.989> my<00:02:33.349> nail<00:02:33.980> bored<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.209> can

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
show you that so you can kind of get an

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.250 
show you that so you can kind of get an
idea<00:02:37.130> of<00:02:37.430> what<00:02:37.610> it's<00:02:37.730> going<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.910> look<00:02:37.970> like<00:02:38.260> so

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260

strawberry<00:02:52.459> fields<00:02:53.299> from<00:02:53.420> china<00:02:53.720> glaze<00:02:54.430> um<00:02:55.510> so

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
strawberry fields from china glaze um so

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.710 
strawberry fields from china glaze um so
that's<00:02:56.900> what<00:02:57.110> these<00:02:57.230> two<00:02:57.470> art<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:58.190> that's

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
that's what these two art so that's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.449 
that's what these two art so that's
strawberry<00:02:59.720> fields<00:03:00.200> with<00:03:00.650> just<00:03:01.099> by<00:03:01.190> itself

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
strawberry fields with just by itself

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.319 
strawberry fields with just by itself
and<00:03:01.790> then<00:03:02.360> with<00:03:02.629> the<00:03:02.900> matte<00:03:03.560> topcoat<00:03:04.329> this

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
and then with the matte topcoat this

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.039 
and then with the matte topcoat this
color<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:06.019> I<00:03:06.859> think<00:03:07.220> this<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:07.880> Charlie's<00:03:08.630> yeah

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
color is I think this is Charlie's yeah

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.059 
color is I think this is Charlie's yeah
this<00:03:09.230> is<00:03:09.440> OMG<00:03:11.019> so<00:03:12.019> you<00:03:12.109> can<00:03:12.380> definitely<00:03:12.590> see

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
this is OMG so you can definitely see

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.979 
this is OMG so you can definitely see
the<00:03:13.100> holographic<00:03:13.670> part<00:03:14.090> in<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.389> side<00:03:14.599> that<00:03:14.840> is

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
the holographic part in the side that is

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.780 
the holographic part in the side that is
just<00:03:15.410> by<00:03:15.530> itself<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:16.069> then<00:03:16.430> that's<00:03:16.579> what<00:03:16.700> it

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
just by itself and then that's what it

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.940 
just by itself and then that's what it
looks<00:03:16.940> like<00:03:17.060> with<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.389> top<00:03:17.599> coat<00:03:17.840> on<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:17.989> so<00:03:18.829> it

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
looks like with the top coat on it so it

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.360 
looks like with the top coat on it so it
definitely<00:03:19.099> takes<00:03:19.430> away<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:19.959> holographic

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
definitely takes away that holographic

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.629 
definitely takes away that holographic
um<00:03:22.370> effect<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:24.049> makes<00:03:24.319> it<00:03:24.470> flat<00:03:24.889> but<00:03:25.519> it's

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
um effect and it makes it flat but it's

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.759 
um effect and it makes it flat but it's
kind<00:03:25.819> of<00:03:25.849> cool<00:03:26.030> with<00:03:26.239> like<00:03:26.470> aluminum<00:03:27.470> foil

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
kind of cool with like aluminum foil

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.300 
kind of cool with like aluminum foil
this<00:03:28.669> one<00:03:28.880> is<00:03:29.030> passion<00:03:29.599> from<00:03:29.840> china<00:03:30.079> glaze<00:03:30.310> so
