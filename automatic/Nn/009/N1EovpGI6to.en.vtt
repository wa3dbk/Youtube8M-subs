00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.489
 Hello 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:10.869
 This time 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.309
 About how to write a station 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.740
 Especially I would like to talk about data 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.830
 The two companies first wrote a laugh between when they were smelled 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.349
 You are not sorry 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.039
 In the case of the English transparent watercolor is the end of the air and crows bright theory 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:28.949
 Because there is not 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.900
 I think it can be done by firing 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.540
 It is said that there is a dark image 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.980
 Yes before taking off the moon and getting out before there is no diamond 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.120
 I will come 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.190
 Because 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.240
 Let's talk first if we first leave the cherry blossoms 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.170
 On the house calendar 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.480
 Write freely 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.930
 Gap 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.950
 Jewish 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.570
 When you see three machines 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.940
 I think it would be nice if we could proceed with the idea 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.940
 Then I want to do it right away 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.730
 ja first of water 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.710
 I will temporarily infiltrate 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.220
 I think 150,000 shares and 105 from the next month 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.410
 Such Japan 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.580
 There is no need to do it regularly and carefully 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.110
 Because it is heavy 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.970
 Roughly 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.970
 And all at once 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.520
 I want to go on the assumption that light is coming from the left 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.520
 I think so, so the taste will be a bit darker 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.150
 The end is here 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.770
 Because it leads to mistakes gradually 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.410
 It may be said that it is a manganese advertisement, but it is cheap around 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.849
 I have also made a machine 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.020
 This kind of pitfall is also important 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.740
 Sky Hall Toyota Sukumo-shi 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.940
 If you overdo it, you will get stuck and die for a while 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.339
 I do not mind 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.989
 Sky Hall is that 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.989
 I think it feels like wearing 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.119
 In fifth place 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:36.599
 Indeed before 4 o'clock 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.599
 It is spreading with the stage later 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.139
 Now I'm going to riverbank 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.529
 Choose mostly dry 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:47.330
 This time there is 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
 I would like to see a movie with Miki 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.109
 Speaking of wearing two instruments and singing immediately brown 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.739
 I think there are many strong people with insights, but they are all brown 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.009
 I think it is not necessary to be different 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.859
 I think but 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.359
 Brown 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.249
 It does not have to be main 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:08.639
 4 contents 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.799
 Run away 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.799
 I think it would be nice if Ueda would do it 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.409
 Seen from such a gap 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.459
 It's something in the air 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.459
 Feel free to listen to each month 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.359
 To rice 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.019
 I will say this time 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.289
 Though it was good 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:41.169
 Yeah 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.419
 It is called foreign intelligence receiving attack, but with this 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.619
 Smile again this time 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:50.619
 It will be effective if I give it back 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.979
 After bacon again 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.979
 I think I can say google where it is needed 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.209
 There were other schools like this 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.209
 It may be written that there is a part, but a little 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.680
 I will put the milk 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.189
 Is it like this 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:02.180
 What did you think 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.180
 It is like cherry blossoms to Hatoyama 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:08.610
 Ikedani supports 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.639
 When writing things 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.319
 That there is nothing to think that the movie will be seen at all 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.219
 Will be 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:17.599
 If you do so, you will feel lost. 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.929
 In front of the place that can not be seen in the garden by watching 

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:23.930
 Because there will be leaves and flowers 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.810
 I think it would be nice if you try that way 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.999
 I used it a while ago 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:33.539
 Though old 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:34.569
 Like this 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:35.979
 That's how it works 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.589
 You can get this- 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:39.460
 88 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.819
 To put in treatment 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.050
 Though it is a thing 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.300
 There is also a battle that is very convenient and can only be done with this brush 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:49.879
 It may be good to try 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:50.449
 see you
