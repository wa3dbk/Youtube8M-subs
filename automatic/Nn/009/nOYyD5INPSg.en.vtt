00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
bottles I'm used to the the Nathan

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.520 
bottles I'm used to the the Nathan
handhelds<00:04:03.420> these<00:04:03.900> are<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.019> little<00:04:04.110> difference

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
handhelds these are a little difference

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.120 
handhelds these are a little difference
got<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.739> weird<00:04:04.890> nipple<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:06.769> goes<00:04:07.769> in<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.100> out

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
got a weird nipple that goes in and out

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.300 
got a weird nipple that goes in and out
there<00:04:09.090> was<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.239> little<00:04:09.420> bit<00:04:09.570> of<00:04:09.690> freezing<00:04:09.870> up

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
there was a little bit of freezing up

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.890 
there was a little bit of freezing up
last<00:04:11.310> summer<00:04:11.430> rain<00:04:11.700> was<00:04:11.850> 17<00:04:12.209> degrees<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:12.690> there

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
last summer rain was 17 degrees so there

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.810 
last summer rain was 17 degrees so there
it<00:04:13.500> wasn't<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.829> big<00:04:14.010> deal<00:04:14.160> so<00:04:14.489> I<00:04:14.519> think<00:04:14.610> that

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
it wasn't a big deal so I think that

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.280 
it wasn't a big deal so I think that
this<00:04:14.910> actually<00:04:15.269> might<00:04:15.450> hold<00:04:15.750> up<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:16.019> little<00:04:16.200> bit

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
this actually might hold up a little bit

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.599 
this actually might hold up a little bit
better<00:04:16.440> than<00:04:16.650> some<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:16.979> Nathan<00:04:17.310> ones<00:04:17.459> with

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
better than some of the Nathan ones with

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.830 
better than some of the Nathan ones with
the<00:04:17.729> hard<00:04:18.419> nipple<00:04:19.380> anyway<00:04:20.160> this<00:04:20.790> one<00:04:21.060> is<00:04:21.299> real

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
the hard nipple anyway this one is real

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.080 
the hard nipple anyway this one is real
flexible<00:04:22.289> goes<00:04:22.919> in<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.190> out<00:04:23.250> will<00:04:23.789> finger

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
flexible goes in and out will finger

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.400 
flexible goes in and out will finger
