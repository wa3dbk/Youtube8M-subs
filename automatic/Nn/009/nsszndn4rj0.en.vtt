weigh this on the scale before I mounted
it<00:00:44.540> up<00:00:44.980> they<00:00:45.980> show<00:00:46.219> that<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.670> ten<00:00:47.030> speed<00:00:47.270> model

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
it up they show that the ten speed model

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.590 
it up they show that the ten speed model
in<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:50.170> long<00:00:51.170> cage<00:00:51.559> is<00:00:51.829> 239<00:00:52.640> grams<00:00:52.940> which<00:00:53.420> that

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
in the long cage is 239 grams which that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.209 
in the long cage is 239 grams which that
should<00:00:53.840> be<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.110> heaviest<00:00:54.440> of<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.800> series

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
should be the heaviest of the series

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.860 
should be the heaviest of the series
because<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.579> long<00:00:55.790> cages<00:00:56.210> are<00:00:56.390> generally<00:00:56.840> a

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
because the long cages are generally a

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.220 
because the long cages are generally a
few<00:00:57.140> grams<00:00:57.379> heavier<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.489> this<00:00:58.700> is<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:59.030> at<00:00:59.780> worst

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
few grams heavier so this is it at worst

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.100 
few grams heavier so this is it at worst
a<00:01:00.469> 239<00:01:01.160> gram<00:01:01.370> derailleur<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.030> lower<00:01:02.930> than

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
a 239 gram derailleur and lower than

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.229 
a 239 gram derailleur and lower than
that<00:01:03.230> for<00:01:03.289> this<00:01:03.590> I<00:01:03.860> have<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:04.610> medium<00:01:05.000> cage

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
that for this I have the medium cage

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.180 
that for this I have the medium cage
here<00:01:05.539> so<00:01:05.750> it<00:01:05.810> should<00:01:05.960> be<00:01:05.990> about<00:01:06.200> 230<00:01:06.890> grams

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
here so it should be about 230 grams

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.430 
here so it should be about 230 grams
because<00:01:08.119> generally<00:01:08.600> that<00:01:08.690> long<00:01:08.930> cage<00:01:09.200> adds

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
because generally that long cage adds

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.150 
because generally that long cage adds
about<00:01:09.619> 5<00:01:10.369> to<00:01:10.580> 10<00:01:10.759> grams<00:01:11.229> but<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.590> construction

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
about 5 to 10 grams but the construction

about 5 to 10 grams but the construction
of<00:01:13.280> this<00:01:13.459> derailleur<00:01:13.970> features<00:01:14.780> again<00:01:15.770> a

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.470 
of the part so I actually paid about 42
for<00:02:17.689> this<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.349> it<00:02:19.069> is<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.489> retail<00:02:20.030> sick

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
for this but it is a retail sick

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.649 
for this but it is a retail sick
see<00:02:20.599> five<00:02:20.810> dollars<00:02:21.879> and<00:02:22.879> I<00:02:23.030> have<00:02:23.390> gotten

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
see five dollars and I have gotten

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.600 
see five dollars and I have gotten
absolutely<00:02:23.959> great<00:02:24.560> performance<00:02:25.069> out<00:02:25.159> of<00:02:25.280> this

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
absolutely great performance out of this

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.390 
absolutely great performance out of this
I<00:02:25.659> think<00:02:26.659> the<00:02:26.780> x7<00:02:27.290> has<00:02:27.440> now<00:02:27.590> really<00:02:27.950> closed<00:02:28.220> the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
I think the x7 has now really closed the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.270 
I think the x7 has now really closed the
gap<00:02:28.610> on<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.940> X<00:02:29.090> 9<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.569> X<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:29.900> this<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.709> overall

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
gap on the X 9 and X so this is overall

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.940 
gap on the X 9 and X so this is overall
my<00:02:31.610> favorite<00:02:32.120> series<00:02:32.569> of<00:02:32.750> dérailleur<00:02:33.260> it

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
those Rams triggers are a bit more

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.030 
those Rams triggers are a bit more
ergonomic<00:02:50.989> than<00:02:51.110> Shimano's<00:02:51.590> because<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:51.890> can
