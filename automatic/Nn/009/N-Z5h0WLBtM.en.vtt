00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:02.710 
all right so here's the start of my mark

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.630 
all right so here's the start of my mark
42<00:00:03.070> for<00:00:03.460> Marion<00:00:03.850> 3<00:00:04.710> what<00:00:05.710> I've<00:00:05.860> done<00:00:06.130> is<00:00:06.490> I've

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:06.640 
42 for Marion 3 what I've done is I've

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.029 
42 for Marion 3 what I've done is I've
just<00:00:06.790> basically<00:00:07.210> taking<00:00:07.600> a<00:00:07.810> mark<00:00:08.259> 7<00:00:08.650> face

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:09.039 
just basically taking a mark 7 face

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.739 
just basically taking a mark 7 face
plate<00:00:09.370> and<00:00:09.580> it<00:00:10.269> made<00:00:10.450> some<00:00:10.599> modifications

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:10.749 
plate and it made some modifications

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.529 
plate and it made some modifications
that<00:00:11.230> cut<00:00:11.349> some<00:00:11.499> detail<00:00:12.070> lines<00:00:12.280> into<00:00:12.549> it<00:00:12.639> those

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:13.539 
that cut some detail lines into it those

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.449 
that cut some detail lines into it those
probably<00:00:13.959> won't<00:00:14.110> be<00:00:14.230> deep<00:00:14.409> final<00:00:15.159> because<00:00:15.280> I

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
probably won't be deep final because I

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.900 
probably won't be deep final because I
need<00:00:16.119> to<00:00:16.209> kind<00:00:16.390> of<00:00:16.449> figure<00:00:16.630> out<00:00:17.310> exactly<00:00:18.310> where

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
need to kind of figure out exactly where

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.050 
need to kind of figure out exactly where
the<00:00:19.240> lines<00:00:19.420> are<00:00:19.690> and<00:00:20.230> what<00:00:20.410> not<00:00:20.560> so<00:00:21.060> anyways

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
the lines are and what not so anyways

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.910 
the lines are and what not so anyways
what<00:00:22.810> I'm<00:00:22.930> gonna<00:00:23.080> be<00:00:23.200> working<00:00:23.350> on<00:00:23.590> today<00:00:23.710> is

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
what I'm gonna be working on today is

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.100 
what I'm gonna be working on today is
actually<00:00:24.100> the<00:00:24.310> ears<00:00:24.550> that's<00:00:25.360> yours<00:00:25.780> the<00:00:25.930> face

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
actually the ears that's yours the face

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.300 
actually the ears that's yours the face
plate<00:00:26.380> and<00:00:26.590> what<00:00:26.800> I've<00:00:26.920> done<00:00:27.040> is<00:00:27.100> I've

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
plate and what I've done is I've

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.160 
plate and what I've done is I've
actually<00:00:27.400> cut<00:00:27.790> the<00:00:28.420> section<00:00:28.780> out<00:00:28.900> where<00:00:29.080> the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
actually cut the section out where the

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.260 
actually cut the section out where the
vent<00:00:29.350> goes<00:00:29.530> in<00:00:29.770> the<00:00:29.860> ears<00:00:30.039> and<00:00:30.820> then<00:00:31.000> I've<00:00:31.090> cut

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
vent goes in the ears and then I've cut

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.510 
vent goes in the ears and then I've cut
a<00:00:31.300> relief<00:00:31.600> line<00:00:31.840> down<00:00:32.050> at<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.230> bottom<00:00:32.410> now<00:00:33.190> in

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
a relief line down at the bottom now in

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.370 
a relief line down at the bottom now in
order<00:00:33.670> to<00:00:33.790> keep<00:00:33.910> these<00:00:34.150> down<00:00:34.420> basically<00:00:35.260> what

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
order to keep these down basically what

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.870 
order to keep these down basically what
I've<00:00:35.440> done<00:00:35.530> is<00:00:35.650> just<00:00:35.680> taking<00:00:36.070> simple<00:00:36.610> evie<00:00:36.850> a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
I've done is just taking simple evie a

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.780 
I've done is just taking simple evie a
foam<00:00:37.230> cut<00:00:38.230> it<00:00:38.320> in<00:00:38.410> half<00:00:38.650> into<00:00:38.980> 2<00:00:39.160> strips<00:00:39.489> and

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
foam cut it in half into 2 strips and

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.120 
foam cut it in half into 2 strips and
I'm<00:00:40.720> just<00:00:40.840> gonna<00:00:40.930> basically<00:00:41.140> slide<00:00:41.739> this<00:00:41.920> in

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
I'm just gonna basically slide this in

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.790 
I'm just gonna basically slide this in
the<00:00:42.190> back<00:00:42.370> here<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:43.000> make<00:00:43.720> sure<00:00:43.780> this<00:00:44.230> stays<00:00:44.290> in

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
the back here to make sure this stays in

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.569 
the back here to make sure this stays in
where<00:00:45.040> it<00:00:45.130> should<00:00:45.310> be<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.660> then<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.590> will<00:00:48.430> be

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
where it should be and then I will be

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.380 
where it should be and then I will be
taping<00:00:49.060> this<00:00:49.180> off<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:51.820> then

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
taping this off here and then

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.500 
taping this off here and then
fiberglassing<00:00:53.230> it<00:00:53.470> from<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.710> backside<00:00:53.890> so

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
fiberglassing it from the backside so

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.729 
fiberglassing it from the backside so
basically<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.540> table<00:00:55.750> actus<00:00:56.200> barrier<00:00:56.590> between

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
basically a table actus barrier between

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.040 
basically a table actus barrier between
the<00:00:57.040> front<00:00:57.280> of<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.399> base<00:00:57.579> plate<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.840> already

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
the front of the base plate that already

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.600 
the front of the base plate that already
has<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.290> lines<00:00:59.469> and<00:00:59.649> details<00:00:59.980> that<00:01:00.160> I<00:01:00.219> want<00:01:00.460> I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
has the lines and details that I want I

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.940 
has the lines and details that I want I
don't<00:01:00.640> want<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:01.030> fiberglass<00:01:01.360> going<00:01:01.750> over<00:01:02.110> and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
don't want the fiberglass going over and

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.950 
don't want the fiberglass going over and
then<00:01:03.100> basically<00:01:03.489> destroying<00:01:04.390> those<00:01:04.540> details

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
then basically destroying those details

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.960 
then basically destroying those details
so<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:06.010> then<00:01:06.130> I<00:01:06.159> have<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.370> go<00:01:06.460> back<00:01:06.610> in<00:01:06.790> with<00:01:06.820> a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
so and then I have to go back in with a

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.490 
so and then I have to go back in with a
needle<00:01:07.150> file<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.600> clean<00:01:07.810> those<00:01:07.900> out<00:01:08.140> so

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
needle file and clean those out so

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.469 
needle file and clean those out so
basically<00:01:09.400> for<00:01:09.790> today<00:01:10.000> we're<00:01:10.180> just<00:01:10.210> going<00:01:10.420> to

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
basically for today we're just going to

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.789 
basically for today we're just going to
be<00:01:10.600> doing<00:01:12.450> some<00:01:13.450> detail<00:01:13.840> lines<00:01:14.110> figure<00:01:14.620> out

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
be doing some detail lines figure out

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.910 
be doing some detail lines figure out
where<00:01:15.040> things<00:01:15.460> need<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.790> go<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.770> whatnot<00:01:17.770> and

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
where things need to go and whatnot and

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.609 
where things need to go and whatnot and
just<00:01:18.610> doing<00:01:19.030> little<00:01:19.150> things<00:01:19.299> like<00:01:19.570> this<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.500> as

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
just doing little things like this so as

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.039 
just doing little things like this so as
you<00:01:20.710> can<00:01:20.770> see<00:01:21.180> since<00:01:22.180> it's<00:01:22.390> foam<00:01:22.659> when<00:01:22.930> I<00:01:22.960> do

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
you can see since it's foam when I do

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.570 
you can see since it's foam when I do
fiberglass<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:23.770> I<00:01:23.830> can<00:01:23.950> just<00:01:24.100> carve<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.490> out

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
fiberglass and I can just carve it out

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.899 
fiberglass and I can just carve it out
with<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:24.990> dremel<00:01:25.990> or<00:01:29.310> soldering<00:01:30.310> iron<00:01:30.580> whatever

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
with a dremel or soldering iron whatever

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.359 
with a dremel or soldering iron whatever
you<00:01:31.000> want<00:01:31.150> to<00:01:31.210> do<00:01:31.360> to<00:01:32.320> get<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.770> foam<00:01:32.950> out<00:01:33.130> so

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
you want to do to get the foam out so

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.890 
you want to do to get the foam out so
you<00:01:33.490> actually<00:01:33.610> have<00:01:33.850> it<00:01:33.970> recession<00:01:34.540> back<00:01:34.689> in

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
you actually have it recession back in

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.870 
you actually have it recession back in
there<00:01:35.049> so<00:01:35.229> it<00:01:35.290> looks<00:01:35.470> like<00:01:35.590> it's<00:01:35.740> actually

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
there so it looks like it's actually

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.190 
there so it looks like it's actually
something<00:01:36.880> real<00:01:37.119> instead<00:01:37.689> of<00:01:37.780> just<00:01:37.930> something

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
something real instead of just something

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.370 
something real instead of just something
blocked<00:01:38.409> off<00:01:38.650> so<00:01:39.840> some<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:40.990> lines<00:01:41.140> here

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
blocked off so some of the lines here

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.750 
blocked off so some of the lines here
I'll<00:01:41.500> be<00:01:41.590> doing<00:01:41.830> I<00:01:41.950> needed<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.369> think<00:01:42.610> there's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
I'll be doing I needed I think there's

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.300 
I'll be doing I needed I think there's
some<00:01:42.880> lines<00:01:43.090> here<00:01:43.240> as<00:01:43.509> well<00:01:43.720> I<00:01:43.750> need<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.110> add

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
some lines here as well I need to add

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.370
