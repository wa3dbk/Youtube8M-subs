00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.510 
administrators or users I think it'd
probably<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> same<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.500> yours<00:01:40.799> but

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
probably be the same like yours but

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.310 
probably be the same like yours but
anyway<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.450> basically<00:01:42.780> do<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.079> go

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
anyway and all you basically do you go

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.200 
anyway and all you basically do you go
from<00:01:43.619> all<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.549> then<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.060> think

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
from all like that and then you think

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
from all like that and then you think
okay<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.750> what<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.079> do<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:46.470> basically<00:01:47.130> you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
okay so what they do now basically you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.490 
okay so what they do now basically you
on<00:01:47.399> edit<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.149> might<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.570> prompt<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.259> I

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
on edit here you might be prompt but I

permissions in the that actual

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.880 
permissions in the that actual
folder<00:01:56.790> now<00:01:57.509> basically<00:01:58.079> these<00:01:58.259> free<00:01:58.590> tabs

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
folder now basically these free tabs

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.840 
folder now basically these free tabs
here<00:01:59.100> what<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.540> make<00:02:00.689> sure<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:01.259> that

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
here what you have to make sure is that

allow this allow appears all ticked and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.300 
allow this allow appears all ticked and
the<00:02:05.640> now<00:02:06.090> no<00:02:06.540> ticks<00:02:06.930> are<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> denying<00:02:07.979> tab

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the now no ticks are in the denying tab

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.919 
the now no ticks are in the denying tab
because<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.360> where<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.660> actually

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
because this is where you actually

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.900 
because this is where you actually
having<00:02:10.140> your<00:02:10.259> problem<00:02:10.590> now<00:02:11.039> my<00:02:11.280> system<00:02:11.700> as

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
having your problem now my system as
