more milk on I generally like to have a
lot<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:05.980> I'll<00:04:06.130> probably<00:04:06.340> pour<00:04:06.850> a<00:04:06.880> little<00:04:07.030> bit

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
lot so I'll probably pour a little bit

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.810 
lot so I'll probably pour a little bit
more<00:04:07.420> on<00:04:07.540> but<00:04:08.140> here<00:04:08.320> you<00:04:08.440> go<00:04:08.620> you<00:04:09.160> have<00:04:09.280> a<00:04:09.340> fruit

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820
