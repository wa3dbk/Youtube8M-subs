kind of little staggered and have one
come<00:02:25.290> up<00:02:25.850> but<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.970> know<00:02:27.090> these<00:02:27.210> look<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> lot

Kenai<00:02:38.850> was<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.170> had<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> lack<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.620> room<00:02:40.890> and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
Kenai was a had a lack of room and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.070 
Kenai was a had a lack of room and
wasn't<00:02:43.230> really<00:02:43.590> able<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:43.860> put<00:02:44.130> them<00:02:44.810> too<00:02:45.810> far

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
wasn't really able to put them too far

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.100 
wasn't really able to put them too far
apart<00:02:46.230> right<00:02:46.680> here<00:02:47.300> but<00:02:48.300> uh<00:02:48.330> they're<00:02:48.960> really

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
apart right here but uh they're really

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.540 
apart right here but uh they're really
grown<00:02:49.680> pretty<00:02:49.830> well<00:02:50.070> these<00:02:50.250> will<00:02:50.400> be

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
grown pretty well these will be

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.230 
grown pretty well these will be
established<00:02:51.060> next<00:02:51.390> year<00:02:51.660> probably<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:53.070> uh

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
established next year probably but uh

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.130 
established next year probably but uh
these<00:02:54.240> are<00:02:54.480> really<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:54.870> huge<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:57.080> now<00:02:58.080> I'm

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
these are really just huge so now I'm

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.780

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
going to show you my other side that I

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.380 
going to show you my other side that I
have<00:03:01.250> now<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.520> side<00:03:02.760> right<00:03:02.940> here<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.210> don't

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
have now this side right here I don't

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.170 
have now this side right here I don't
even<00:03:03.450> know<00:03:03.630> if<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:03.870> see<00:03:04.170> him<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:04.530> uh

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
even know if you can see him but uh

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.210 
even know if you can see him but uh
there's<00:03:06.180> one<00:03:06.300> right<00:03:07.200> there

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
there's one right there

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.090 
there's one right there
it's<00:03:08.880> not<00:03:09.090> doing<00:03:09.420> too<00:03:09.660> well<00:03:09.690> that's<00:03:10.290> got<00:03:10.770> brown

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
it's not doing too well that's got brown

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.040 
it's not doing too well that's got brown
on<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.460> bottom<00:03:11.910> now<00:03:12.540> these<00:03:12.690> are<00:03:12.840> Murray

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
on the bottom now these are Murray

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.900 
on the bottom now these are Murray
Cypress<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.830> same<00:03:14.040> as<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.430> other<00:03:14.520> side

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
Cypress is the same as on the other side

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.660 
Cypress is the same as on the other side
but<00:03:15.780> uh<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.200> call<00:03:16.710> this<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:16.920> shady<00:03:17.370> side

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
but uh I call this the shady side

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.910 
but uh I call this the shady side
because<00:03:18.170> this<00:03:19.170> side<00:03:19.350> doesn't<00:03:19.560> get<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:19.830> whole

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
because this side doesn't get a whole

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.040 
because this side doesn't get a whole
lot<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.400> Sun<00:03:21.350> but<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.470> can<00:03:22.620> see<00:03:22.860> they're<00:03:23.070> about

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
lot of Sun but you can see they're about

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.300 
lot of Sun but you can see they're about
about<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.080> foot<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.590> half<00:03:25.800> maybe<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:28.310> this

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
about a foot and a half maybe and this

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.790 
about a foot and a half maybe and this
if<00:03:29.460> I<00:03:29.580> can<00:03:29.700> get<00:03:29.820> down<00:03:29.850> here<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.270> little<00:03:30.360> bit<00:03:30.540> more

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
if I can get down here a little bit more

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.220 
if I can get down here a little bit more
as<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:31.950> can<00:03:32.100> see<00:03:32.340> I'll<00:03:32.460> show<00:03:32.490> you<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.850> row

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
as you can see I'll show you the row

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.370 
as you can see I'll show you the row
we've<00:03:34.230> got<00:03:34.440> any<00:03:34.560> getting<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.830> shade<00:03:35.130> kind<00:03:35.430> of

and you can see this one very small I've
got<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.140> little<00:03:40.260> bit<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:41.720> they<00:03:42.720> call<00:03:42.990> it

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
got a little bit of that they call it

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:51.199 
got a little bit of that they call it
brownness<00:03:44.390> on<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:46.280> bottom<00:03:47.280> there<00:03:47.459> but<00:03:48.209> um<00:03:50.209> I'm

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
brownness on the bottom there but um I'm

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.560 
brownness on the bottom there but um I'm
kind<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.480> down<00:03:51.720> here<00:03:51.959> now<00:03:52.170> but<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.830> can<00:03:52.950> see

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
kind of down here now but you can see

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.230 
kind of down here now but you can see
this<00:03:54.570> one's<00:03:54.840> got<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.140> brown<00:03:55.440> right<00:03:55.740> there<00:03:56.240> not

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
this one's got the brown right there not

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.860 
this one's got the brown right there not
too<00:03:57.660> happy<00:03:58.170> with<00:03:58.380> that<00:03:59.540> I'm<00:04:00.540> not<00:04:00.660> real<00:04:00.840> sure

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
too happy with that I'm not real sure

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.240 
too happy with that I'm not real sure
what's<00:04:01.200> causing<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.620> maybe<00:04:01.920> just<00:04:02.160> not

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
what's causing that maybe just not

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.430 
what's causing that maybe just not
enough<00:04:02.490> Sun<00:04:02.730> but<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.420> lot<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.810> these<00:04:03.990> kind<00:04:04.320> of

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
enough Sun but a lot of these kind of

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.720 
enough Sun but a lot of these kind of
this<00:04:05.010> one<00:04:05.190> looks<00:04:05.400> pretty<00:04:05.610> decent<00:04:07.070> but<00:04:08.070> there's

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
this one looks pretty decent but there's

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.870 
this one looks pretty decent but there's
no<00:04:08.880> roundness<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:10.170> much<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:10.800> these<00:04:11.040> on<00:04:11.580> that

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
no roundness to much on these on that

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.220 
no roundness to much on these on that
one<00:04:12.030> right<00:04:12.180> there<00:04:12.360> but<00:04:12.540> there<00:04:12.870> is<00:04:12.990> someone

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
one right there but there is someone

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.680 
one right there but there is someone
there<00:04:13.590> now<00:04:14.580> these<00:04:14.730> were<00:04:14.940> planted<00:04:15.120> at<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.480> same

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
there now these were planted at the same

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.360 
there now these were planted at the same
time<00:04:15.959> as<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.260> other<00:04:16.410> side<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:16.980> as<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:17.160> can

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
time as the other side and as you can

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.900 
time as the other side and as you can
see<00:04:18.109> without<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.410> Sun<00:04:19.680> really<00:04:20.340> coming<00:04:20.729> down

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
see without the Sun really coming down

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.420 
see without the Sun really coming down
on<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.270> it's<00:04:21.540> really<00:04:22.530> slow

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
on it it's really slow

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.700 
on it it's really slow
I<00:04:23.810> don't<00:04:24.810> know<00:04:24.900> if<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.050> can<00:04:25.169> see<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.440> others

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
I don't know if you can see the others

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.610 
I don't know if you can see the others
but<00:04:26.540> you're<00:04:27.540> right<00:04:27.660> here<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.050> can't<00:04:28.259> you<00:04:28.530> know

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
but you're right here you can't you know

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.510 
but you're right here you can't you know
there's<00:04:28.800> not<00:04:28.949> a<00:04:28.979> whole<00:04:29.190> lot<00:04:29.220> on<00:04:29.639> these<00:04:29.810> but

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
there's not a whole lot on these but

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.770 
there's not a whole lot on these but
some<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.639> them<00:04:32.729> look<00:04:32.880> pretty<00:04:33.030> good<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:33.600> ones

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
some of them look pretty good the ones

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.800 
some of them look pretty good the ones
down<00:04:33.990> here<00:04:34.350> get<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.710> little<00:04:34.949> bit<00:04:35.039> more<00:04:35.220> Sun<00:04:35.810> so

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
down here get a little bit more Sun so

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.610 
down here get a little bit more Sun so
they'll<00:04:37.050> probably<00:04:37.320> be<00:04:37.770> growing<00:04:39.289> quite<00:04:40.289> a<00:04:40.380> bit

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
they'll probably be growing quite a bit

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.120 
they'll probably be growing quite a bit
faster<00:04:41.490> than<00:04:41.669> the<00:04:41.729> other<00:04:42.440> other<00:04:43.440> end<00:04:43.800> over

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
faster than the other other end over

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.719 
faster than the other other end over
here<00:04:45.919> some<00:04:46.919> of<00:04:46.949> these<00:04:47.070> look<00:04:47.250> really<00:04:47.430> good<00:04:47.580> this

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
here some of these look really good this
