00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.210 
versus this was the only black on here
was<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.360> swoosh<00:02:31.720> symbol<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.410> then<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:33.010> rest

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
was the swoosh symbol and then the rest

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.960 
was the swoosh symbol and then the rest
of<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.460> was<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.730> dark<00:02:34.300> gray<00:02:35.790> they<00:02:36.790> went

of this was that dark gray they went

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.900 
of this was that dark gray they went

licensor gold on these other than that
it<00:02:48.460> looks<00:02:48.760> like<00:02:49.120> it's<00:02:49.240> just<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.600> little<00:02:50.530> bit

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
it looks like it's just a little bit

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.950 
it looks like it's just a little bit
difference<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.220> aesthetics<00:02:51.700> they<00:02:52.360> did<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.570> sort

difference in aesthetics they did a sort

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.710 
difference in aesthetics they did a sort
of<00:02:52.990> a<00:02:53.080> webbing<00:02:53.410> here<00:02:53.590> which<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.830> kind<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.370> dig<00:02:54.720> on

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
of a webbing here which I kind of dig on

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.330 
of a webbing here which I kind of dig on
the<00:02:55.930> new<00:02:56.080> model<00:02:56.260> they<00:02:56.710> move<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.070> swoosh

the new model they move the swoosh

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.050

they're<00:03:06.790> fairly<00:03:07.120> similar<00:03:07.660> it's<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.020> same<00:03:08.290> one

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
they're fairly similar it's the same one

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.000 
they're fairly similar it's the same one
piece<00:03:09.700> construction<00:03:10.090> design<00:03:10.600> so<00:03:11.500> its<00:03:11.680> tongue

piece construction design so its tongue

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.470

less the same off-centered lace system
which<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:17.200> know<00:03:17.560> they<00:03:17.770> designed<00:03:18.130> specifically

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
which I know they designed specifically

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.180 
which I know they designed specifically
to<00:03:18.880> avoid<00:03:19.209> having<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.810> laces<00:03:20.590> go<00:03:20.709> across<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
to avoid having the laces go across the

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.440 
to avoid having the laces go across the
top<00:03:21.370> of<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.610> foot<00:03:21.790> which<00:03:22.000> can<00:03:22.180> be<00:03:22.270> very

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
top of the foot which can be very

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.520 
top of the foot which can be very
uncomfortable<00:03:22.870> for<00:03:23.320> runners<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:25.050> as<00:03:26.050> far<00:03:26.380> as

uncomfortable for runners and as far as

uncomfortable for runners and as far as
feel<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.459> it<00:03:28.270> feels<00:03:28.420> like<00:03:28.630> they<00:03:28.720> open<00:03:29.020> up<00:03:29.110> the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
feel I it feels like they open up the

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.220 
feel I it feels like they open up the
toe<00:03:29.470> box<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.920> little<00:03:29.950> bit<00:03:30.220> on<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.820> new<00:03:30.970> model

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
toe box a little bit on the new model

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.300

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
bit more room to spread out as they hit

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.100 
bit more room to spread out as they hit
the<00:03:35.440> pavement<00:03:36.150> versus<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.360> old<00:03:37.540> model<00:03:37.930> which

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
the pavement versus the old model which

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.130 
the pavement versus the old model which
on<00:03:38.700> me<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:39.940> felt<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.300> little<00:03:40.450> bit<00:03:40.660> cramped<00:03:41.080> I

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
on me it felt a little bit cramped I

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
on me it felt a little bit cramped I
know<00:03:41.260> some<00:03:41.440> people<00:03:41.470> didn't<00:03:41.920> have<00:03:41.980> that

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
know some people didn't have that

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.699 
know some people didn't have that
problem<00:03:42.190> my<00:03:42.940> second<00:03:43.390> toe<00:03:43.600> is<00:03:43.840> longer<00:03:43.959> than<00:03:44.560> my

first toe which a lot of people have and

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.460 
first toe which a lot of people have and
the<00:03:48.910> old<00:03:49.060> model<00:03:49.420> didn't<00:03:49.900> really<00:03:50.200> give<00:03:50.320> me

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
the old model didn't really give me

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.990 
the old model didn't really give me
enough<00:03:50.620> room<00:03:50.920> in<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.980> accommodate<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:54.790> I

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
enough room in to accommodate that I

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.480 
enough room in to accommodate that I
know<00:03:55.060> it's<00:03:55.270> kind<00:03:55.420> of<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.600> I'm<00:03:56.500> in<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.340> minority

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
know it's kind of a I'm in the minority

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.380 
know it's kind of a I'm in the minority
here<00:03:57.940> with<00:03:58.240> that<00:03:58.360> kind<00:03:58.600> of<00:03:58.660> foot<00:03:58.900> shape<00:03:59.140> but

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
here with that kind of foot shape but

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.760 
here with that kind of foot shape but
with<00:04:01.390> a<00:04:01.420> new<00:04:01.630> model<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:01.959> feel<00:04:02.110> like<00:04:02.230> it's<00:04:02.440> they

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
with a new model I feel like it's they

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.260 
with a new model I feel like it's they
open<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.130> up<00:04:03.220> just<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.520> little<00:04:03.730> bit<00:04:03.820> more<00:04:04.060> so

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
open it up just a little bit more so

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.340 
open it up just a little bit more so
there's<00:04:04.450> there's<00:04:04.750> enough<00:04:05.020> room<00:04:05.140> to

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
there's there's enough room to

there's there's enough room to
accommodate<00:04:05.380> my<00:04:06.040> foot<00:04:06.340> in<00:04:06.430> there<00:04:06.580> so<00:04:06.880> I<00:04:07.090> do

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
accommodate my foot in there so I do

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.460 
accommodate my foot in there so I do
like<00:04:07.750> that<00:04:07.959> other<00:04:08.200> than<00:04:08.320> that's<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.739> same<00:04:09.040> as

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.510 
does heart rate I think you can get a
separate<00:05:40.150> heart<00:05:40.389> rate<00:05:40.599> band<00:05:41.560> to<00:05:42.009> wear<00:05:42.219> on<00:05:42.400> your
