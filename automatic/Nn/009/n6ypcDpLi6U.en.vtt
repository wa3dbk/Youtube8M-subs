00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.649
 In 2003 , millions of 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.020
 cases of gastrointestinal diseases 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:32.930
 as yapias and amoebiasis and salmonellosis 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.140
 largely associated with the consumption of 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.450
 Water why not take the year but not 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.790
 you get scared so you can understand me better 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.250
 start explaining something to you all 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.379
 we must know the water is one of the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.109
 most valuable natural resources of the 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.149
 planet and the lakes lakes dams and 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.820
 lagoons are some of our 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.409
 suppliers and occupies almost three quarters 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.159
 parts of the earth's surface 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:01.010
 although less than 3% is water for consumption 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.589
 human since a few decades ago 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.990
 State and municipal federal governments 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.720
 are doing the most treatment 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.020
 common to be drinking the water 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.630
 the disinfection of water to eliminate and 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.420
 germs when the water comes from 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.360
 Surface sources such as lakes rivers 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.060
 lagoons and dams a process is required 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.940
 of purification for the elimination of 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.670
 the dissolved and suspended particles and 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.250
 then the deposits are disinfected 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.470
 adding chlorine mainly for 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.840
 that the water reaches your home clean and 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.210
 with good quality for this the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.250
 secretary of health in conjunction with the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.890
 health authorities of governments 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.080
 States carry out the surveillance of the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.510
 water quality this is done with 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.970
 trained personnel and special equipment 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.280
 to detect that the chlorine level is 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.860
 according to the quality that you are referring to and 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.050
 so watch that the water is suitable for 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.110
 human consumption to be free of 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.290
 bacteria that can affect your health 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.080

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.840
 six million samplings throughout the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.290
 country then the water reaching monaco 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.510
 it's clean yes but it's no use if your 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.970
 cistern tanks by tanks of 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.410
 storage 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.240
 it means that the only thing I have to 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.160

 you have to disinfect the every six 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.320
 months 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.970
 would you like to know how the

 as a damp cloth to cover the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.490
 airways of washed chlorine 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.580

 disinfection 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.150
 empty three layers of chlorine in a bucket 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.460
 full of water there the floor walls and
