00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
nothing is huge it is morbidly massive

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.309 
nothing is huge it is morbidly massive
but<00:03:22.599> I<00:03:22.629> think<00:03:22.870> we've<00:03:23.019> already<00:03:23.169> established

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
but I think we've already established

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.550 
but I think we've already established
that<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.910> can't<00:03:25.419> hit<00:03:25.720> pretty<00:03:26.049> darn<00:03:26.290> hard

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
that it can't hit pretty darn hard

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.559 
that it can't hit pretty darn hard
though<00:03:26.859> now<00:03:27.040> intimidate<00:03:27.639> it<00:03:27.849> lowered<00:03:28.299> my

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
though now intimidate it lowered my

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.240 
though now intimidate it lowered my
attacks<00:03:29.049> so<00:03:29.349> that's<00:03:29.530> why<00:03:29.650> I'm<00:03:29.769> trying<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.099> use

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
attacks so that's why I'm trying to use

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.159 
attacks so that's why I'm trying to use
air<00:03:30.549> cutter<00:03:30.819> and<00:03:31.449> hoping<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.780> get<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.959> critical

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
air cutter and hoping to get a critical

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.020 
air cutter and hoping to get a critical
hit<00:03:32.530> because<00:03:32.769> it's<00:03:32.919> special<00:03:33.400> base<00:03:33.609> and<00:03:33.909> it's

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
hit because it's special base and it's

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.330 
hit because it's special base and it's
not<00:03:34.209> going<00:03:34.449> to<00:03:34.510> be<00:03:34.629> affected<00:03:35.079> by<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.440> we<00:03:36.190> did
