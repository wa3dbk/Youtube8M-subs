I've returned back to the nest and I
found<00:00:36.630> an<00:00:36.840> app<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.410> really<00:00:37.710> does<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> nice<00:00:38.160> job

here's<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.610> demonstration<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> Skylark

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
here's a demonstration of the Skylark

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.790 
here's a demonstration of the Skylark
app<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.920> an<00:00:56.160> iPhone<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.600> sure<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.320> this

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
app on an iPhone I'm not sure if this

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740 
app on an iPhone I'm not sure if this
application<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.579> available<00:00:59.699> for<00:01:00.270> Droid<00:01:00.539> or

application is available for Droid or

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.139 
application is available for Droid or
not<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.340> there's<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.430> good<00:01:02.640> likelihood<00:01:02.820> that

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
not but there's a good likelihood that

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.060 
not but there's a good likelihood that
it<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.539> here<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.530> see<00:01:04.949> it's

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it is here it is you can see it's

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.560 
it is here it is you can see it's
installed<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> bottom<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.210> down<00:01:06.240> here

I'm<00:01:08.159> gonna<00:01:08.760> trial<00:01:09.150> right<00:01:09.360> now<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.930> you're

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
I'm gonna trial right now so if you're

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.230 
I'm gonna trial right now so if you're
unsure<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.530> think<00:01:10.860> they<00:01:10.950> offer<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.280> 14-day<00:01:11.909> trial

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
unsure I think they offer a 14-day trial

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.980 
unsure I think they offer a 14-day trial
for<00:01:12.479> free<00:01:13.159> my<00:01:14.159> understanding<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.850> $4.99<00:01:15.240> for

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
for free my understanding it's $4.99 for

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.950 
for free my understanding it's $4.99 for
as<00:01:16.229> many<00:01:16.790> smartphones<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.330> control<00:01:18.720> one

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
as many smartphones to control one

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.929 
as many smartphones to control one
single<00:01:19.350> nest<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.610> two<00:01:20.790> or<00:01:20.909> three

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
single nest so if you have two or three

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.719 
single nest so if you have two or three
smartphones<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.750> home<00:01:22.009> you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.040> tie<00:01:23.490> them

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
smartphones in a home you can tie them

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.969 
smartphones in a home you can tie them
all<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.330> nest<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.930> $4.99<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.619> believe

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
all to that nest for $4.99 I believe

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.810 
all to that nest for $4.99 I believe
very<00:01:26.700> simple<00:01:27.060> application<00:01:27.240> hit<00:01:28.170> setting<00:01:28.820> you

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
very simple application hit setting you

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.330 
very simple application hit setting you
have<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.420> put<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.750> your<00:01:30.900> nest<00:01:31.259> account<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.189> can

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
have to put in your nest account you can

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.609 
have to put in your nest account you can
see<00:01:32.520> that's<00:01:33.360> right<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.140> then<00:01:34.470> your

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
see that's right up here and then your

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.700 
see that's right up here and then your
password<00:01:34.860> you'll<00:01:35.820> see<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.630> devices<00:01:37.020> it'll

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
password you'll see the devices it'll

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.880 
password you'll see the devices it'll
show<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.189> phones<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.729> connected<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.270> it

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
show you what phones are connected to it

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.770 
show you what phones are connected to it
there<00:01:40.890> right<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.460> here's<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.420> mean

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
there right there and here's I mean

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.999 
there right there and here's I mean
that's<00:01:42.960> pretty<00:01:43.110> straightforward<00:01:43.439> so

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
that's pretty straightforward so

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.770 
that's pretty straightforward so
basically<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.640> way<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.850> application<00:01:45.479> works

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
basically the way this application works

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.740 
basically the way this application works
is<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:47.220> connects<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.790> nest<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.270> tell<00:01:48.479> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
is it just connects to nest to tell it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.450 
is it just connects to nest to tell it
whether<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.229> home<00:01:49.409> or<00:01:49.619> way<00:01:49.770> all<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
whether it's home or way all the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.389 
whether it's home or way all the
geofencing<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> geolocation<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.649> done<00:01:53.280> in

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
geofencing the geolocation is done in

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.859 
geofencing the geolocation is done in
the<00:01:53.490> application<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.240> there's<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.659> map

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the application so there's a little map

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.319 
the application so there's a little map
down<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.219> set<00:01:56.490> your<00:01:56.700> home<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
down here you can set your home with the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.380 
down here you can set your home with the
pin<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.810> set<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> radius<00:01:58.950> around<00:01:59.670> that<00:02:00.030> pin

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
pin and set the radius around that pin

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.170 
pin and set the radius around that pin
of<00:02:00.600> how<00:02:00.750> far<00:02:01.079> you'd<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.640> travel

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
of how far you'd like to have to travel

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.209 
of how far you'd like to have to travel
before<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.719> activates<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.439> home<00:02:04.740> or<00:02:04.979> away

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
before it activates the home or away

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.100 
before it activates the home or away
feature<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.509> simple

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
feature it's that simple

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.490 
feature it's that simple
