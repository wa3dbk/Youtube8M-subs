what type of gun Sniper Wolf uses uses a
psg-1<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:26.040> when<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.070> pulled<00:02:27.400> up<00:02:27.490> images<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.030> a

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
psg-1 and when I pulled up images of a

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.050 
psg-1 and when I pulled up images of a
PSU<00:02:28.390> want<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.960> looks<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.410> lot<00:02:29.740> like<00:02:30.070> Wyatt's<00:02:30.790> gun

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
PSU want it looks a lot like Wyatt's gun

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.210 
PSU want it looks a lot like Wyatt's gun
they<00:02:31.480> look<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.930> lot<00:02:32.200> similar<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.950> don't<00:02:33.100> really

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
they look a lot similar you don't really

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.670 
they look a lot similar you don't really
get<00:02:33.460> too<00:02:34.060> clear<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.570> view<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.050> gun<00:02:35.260> but

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
get too clear of a view of the gun but

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.590 
get too clear of a view of the gun but
when<00:02:35.860> she's<00:02:36.070> holding<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:36.580> up<00:02:36.760> like<00:02:37.060> the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
when she's holding it up like the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.510 
when she's holding it up like the
magazine<00:02:38.110> writing<00:02:38.410> from<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.680> trigger<00:02:39.160> stuff

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
magazine writing from the trigger stuff

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.760 
magazine writing from the trigger stuff
like<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.820> like<00:02:40.330> little<00:02:40.990> things<00:02:41.230> about<00:02:41.530> it

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
like that like little things about it

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.460 
like that like little things about it
match<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.580> psg1<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.540> think<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:44.050> they<00:02:44.170> used

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
match the psg1 so I think that they used

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.580 
match the psg1 so I think that they used
the<00:02:44.680> same<00:02:44.920> type<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.310> gun<00:02:45.700> which<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.690> gonna<00:02:47.140> come

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
the same type of gun which is gonna come

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.800 
the same type of gun which is gonna come
into<00:02:47.740> play<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:48.070> little<00:02:48.370> bit<00:02:48.520> later<00:02:48.790> on<00:02:48.880> but<00:02:49.270> just

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
into play a little bit later on but just

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.120 
into play a little bit later on but just
keep<00:02:49.960> that<00:02:49.990> in<00:02:50.200> mind<00:02:50.320> they<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.920> same

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
keep that in mind they have the same

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.760 
keep that in mind they have the same
type<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.400> gun<00:02:51.640> that's<00:02:51.970> that's<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.990> connection

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
type of gun that's that's a connection

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.070 
type of gun that's that's a connection
but<00:02:53.980> it's<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.430> mean<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.510> can't<00:02:55.720> really<00:02:55.840> do

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
but it's I mean you can't really do

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.310 
but it's I mean you can't really do
anything<00:02:56.290> with<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.680> right<00:02:56.980> now<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.840> I<00:02:58.870> kept

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
anything with it right now so I kept

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.170 
anything with it right now so I kept
looking<00:02:59.830> I<00:03:00.160> kept<00:03:00.370> trying<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.640> figure<00:03:00.880> things

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
looking I kept trying to figure things

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.300 
looking I kept trying to figure things
out<00:03:01.450> trying<00:03:01.960> to<00:03:01.990> understand<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.800> was<00:03:03.130> learning

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
out trying to understand I was learning

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.700 
out trying to understand I was learning
more<00:03:03.580> about<00:03:03.700> sniper<00:03:04.120> wolf<00:03:04.420> now<00:03:04.660> sniper<00:03:05.260> wolf

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
more about sniper wolf now sniper wolf

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.770 
more about sniper wolf now sniper wolf
we<00:03:06.100> don't<00:03:06.250> really<00:03:06.430> know<00:03:06.670> when<00:03:07.090> she<00:03:07.390> was<00:03:07.570> born

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
we don't really know when she was born

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.050 
we don't really know when she was born
exactly<00:03:08.440> we<00:03:08.830> know<00:03:08.950> she<00:03:09.010> died<00:03:09.280> in<00:03:09.460> her<00:03:09.490> 20s

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
exactly we know she died in her 20s

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.210 
exactly we know she died in her 20s
so<00:03:10.330> that<00:03:10.480> leaves<00:03:10.660> just<00:03:10.840> like<00:03:10.990> a<00:03:11.020> nine-year<00:03:11.620> gap

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
so that leaves just like a nine-year gap

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.620 
so that leaves just like a nine-year gap
of<00:03:12.490> when<00:03:12.640> she<00:03:12.790> could<00:03:12.970> have<00:03:13.060> been<00:03:13.210> born

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
of when she could have been born

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.630 
of when she could have been born
possibly<00:03:14.470> she<00:03:14.890> could<00:03:15.040> have<00:03:15.130> been<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.250> kid<00:03:15.490> at

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
possibly she could have been a kid at

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.850 
possibly she could have been a kid at
the<00:03:15.670> time<00:03:15.940> during<00:03:16.300> Metal<00:03:16.930> Gear<00:03:16.990> Solid<00:03:17.380> 5<00:03:17.560> or

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
the time during Metal Gear Solid 5 or

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.620 
the time during Metal Gear Solid 5 or
she<00:03:18.100> could<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.310> not<00:03:18.490> yet<00:03:18.910> been<00:03:19.060> born<00:03:19.390> at<00:03:19.510> all

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
she could have not yet been born at all

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.160 
she could have not yet been born at all
so<00:03:20.910> will<00:03:21.910> she<00:03:21.940> come<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.330> play<00:03:22.510> in<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.750> game<00:03:22.780> I

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
so will she come to play in the game I

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.190 
so will she come to play in the game I
don't<00:03:23.320> know<00:03:23.620> but<00:03:24.610> there<00:03:25.570> is<00:03:25.690> another<00:03:25.930> thing

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
don't know but there is another thing

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.900 
don't know but there is another thing
I've<00:03:26.320> noticed<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.890> this<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.340> going<00:03:27.490> to<00:03:27.610> this

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
I've noticed and this is going to this

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.470 
I've noticed and this is going to this
is<00:03:28.060> gonna<00:03:28.180> be<00:03:28.330> a<00:03:28.360> stretch<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.760> is<00:03:30.940> this<00:03:31.360> is

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
a smooth curve or anything it has this

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.310 
a smooth curve or anything it has this
weird<00:04:05.260> bend<00:04:05.620> in<00:04:05.800> it<00:04:05.890> so<00:04:06.610> in<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:07.810> scene<00:04:08.110> where

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
weird bend in it so in that scene where

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.229 
weird bend in it so in that scene where
you<00:04:08.410> see<00:04:08.440> quiet<00:04:09.010> standing<00:04:09.640> on<00:04:09.760> top<00:04:09.970> of<00:04:10.150> that

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
you see quiet standing on top of that

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.620 
you see quiet standing on top of that
roof<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:11.050> kind<00:04:11.709> of<00:04:11.739> like<00:04:11.920> zooms<00:04:12.280> up<00:04:12.670> her<00:04:13.330> body

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
roof it kind of like zooms up her body

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.479 
roof it kind of like zooms up her body
or<00:04:13.870> whatever<00:04:14.020> you<00:04:14.560> see<00:04:14.739> that<00:04:14.920> she<00:04:15.040> has<00:04:15.160> a<00:04:15.190> knife

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
or whatever you see that she has a knife

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.780 
or whatever you see that she has a knife
holster<00:04:15.910> now<00:04:16.560> picking<00:04:17.560> out<00:04:17.770> a<00:04:17.799> curry<00:04:18.250> knife<00:04:18.520> in

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
holster now picking out a curry knife in

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.699 
holster now picking out a curry knife in
a<00:04:18.940> holster<00:04:19.299> is<00:04:19.419> really<00:04:19.630> hard<00:04:19.840> to<00:04:19.900> it's<00:04:20.470> really

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
a holster is really hard to it's really

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.590 
a holster is really hard to it's really
hard<00:04:20.830> to<00:04:20.919> tell<00:04:21.160> basically<00:04:21.789> because<00:04:22.090> the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
hard to tell basically because the

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.320 
hard to tell basically because the
holster<00:04:23.080> will<00:04:23.560> hide<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.100> bend<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:24.520> won't<00:04:24.700> like

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
holster will hide the bend it won't like

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.550 
holster will hide the bend it won't like
it<00:04:25.780> won't<00:04:25.930> look

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
it won't look

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.440 
it won't look
it<00:04:26.830> has<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.100> bend<00:04:27.430> in<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.730> when<00:04:28.030> it's<00:04:28.150> in<00:04:28.330> the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
it has a bend in it when it's in the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.290 
it has a bend in it when it's in the
holster<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:30.400> kind<00:04:30.639> of<00:04:30.669> have<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:30.910> look<00:04:31.090> for

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
holster so you kind of have to look for

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.720 
holster so you kind of have to look for
a<00:04:31.330> light<00:04:31.720> bend<00:04:32.139> in<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.770> holster<00:04:33.070> itself<00:04:33.520> and

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
a light bend in the holster itself and

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.250 
a light bend in the holster itself and
you<00:04:34.210> can<00:04:34.389> kind<00:04:34.690> of<00:04:34.810> see<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.139> but<00:04:35.470> it's<00:04:35.760> weird

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
you can kind of see it but it's weird

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.070 
you can kind of see it but it's weird
it's<00:04:38.260> it's<00:04:38.740> uncertain<00:04:39.340> if<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:40.330> is<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:40.600> Currie

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
it's it's uncertain if it is a Currie

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.800 
it's it's uncertain if it is a Currie
not<00:04:41.350> but<00:04:42.070> if<00:04:42.280> it<00:04:42.400> is<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.610> cookery<00:04:43.060> knife<00:04:43.360> then

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
not but if it is a cookery knife then

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.230 
not but if it is a cookery knife then
she<00:04:44.200> could<00:04:44.500> be<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.650> Gurkha<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.490> if<00:04:46.030> she's<00:04:46.210> a

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
she could be a Gurkha and if she's a

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.629 
she could be a Gurkha and if she's a
guru<00:04:46.450> cos<00:04:46.810> she<00:04:46.990> could<00:04:47.230> be<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.710> future<00:04:48.010> trainer

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
guru cos she could be the future trainer

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.620 
guru cos she could be the future trainer
of<00:04:49.000> Sniper<00:04:49.570> Wolf<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:51.210> that<00:04:52.210> would<00:04:52.389> be<00:04:52.510> really

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
of Sniper Wolf and that would be really

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.170 
of Sniper Wolf and that would be really
cool<00:04:52.990> like<00:04:53.770> that<00:04:54.100> would<00:04:54.760> definitely

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
cool like that would definitely

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.629 
cool like that would definitely
establish<00:04:55.870> a<00:04:55.900> link<00:04:56.169> between<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.710> two<00:04:56.740> but

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
establish a link between the two but

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.960 
establish a link between the two but
like<00:04:57.820> I<00:04:57.940> said<00:04:58.000> this<00:04:58.660> is<00:04:58.840> like<00:04:59.550> this<00:05:00.550> is<00:05:00.700> kind<00:05:00.940> of

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
like I said this is like this is kind of

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.580 
like I said this is like this is kind of
a<00:05:01.090> stretched<00:05:01.540> theory<00:05:01.840> because<00:05:02.169> we<00:05:02.320> don't<00:05:02.500> know

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
a stretched theory because we don't know

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.409 
a stretched theory because we don't know
enough<00:05:02.830> about<00:05:02.919> quiet<00:05:03.400> we<00:05:03.910> don't<00:05:04.060> even<00:05:04.210> really

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
enough about quiet we don't even really

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.450 
enough about quiet we don't even really
know<00:05:04.630> that<00:05:04.810> much<00:05:04.960> about<00:05:04.990> Sniper<00:05:05.470> Wolf<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:06.310> all

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
know that much about Sniper Wolf and all

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.140 
know that much about Sniper Wolf and all
her<00:05:06.700> things<00:05:07.570> so<00:05:07.930> but<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:09.520> see<00:05:09.729> that<00:05:09.910> kind<00:05:10.060> of

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
her things so but to see that kind of

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.940 
her things so but to see that kind of
connection<00:05:10.540> I<00:05:10.990> could<00:05:11.380> definitely<00:05:11.560> see<00:05:11.919> that

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
connection I could definitely see that

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.100 
connection I could definitely see that
happening<00:05:12.610> because<00:05:13.210> it<00:05:13.419> would<00:05:13.540> make<00:05:13.690> sense<00:05:13.900> in

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
happening because it would make sense in

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.770 
happening because it would make sense in
it<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:14.770> makes<00:05:15.010> story<00:05:15.400> sense<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:16.090> story<00:05:16.450> sense

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
it it makes story sense and story sense

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.600 
it it makes story sense and story sense
is<00:05:17.020> always<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:17.470> best<00:05:17.710> thing<00:05:17.830> because<00:05:18.460> it

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
is always the best thing because it

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.460 
is always the best thing because it
sounds<00:05:18.970> cool<00:05:19.030> and<00:05:19.240> because<00:05:19.750> it<00:05:19.870> would<00:05:19.990> be<00:05:20.169> cool

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
sounds cool and because it would be cool

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.040 
sounds cool and because it would be cool
and<00:05:20.770> that's<00:05:21.760> really<00:05:22.030> what<00:05:22.360> made<00:05:22.570> me<00:05:22.720> think

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
and that's really what made me think

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.110 
and that's really what made me think
that<00:05:23.260> it<00:05:23.530> is<00:05:23.680> a<00:05:23.710> possibility<00:05:24.310> now<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.700> entire

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
that it is a possibility now the entire

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.090 
that it is a possibility now the entire
theory<00:05:25.600> kind<00:05:25.870> of<00:05:25.990> hinges<00:05:26.320> on<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:26.590> fact<00:05:26.860> that

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
theory kind of hinges on the fact that

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.450 
theory kind of hinges on the fact that
quiet<00:05:27.639> could<00:05:28.240> be<00:05:28.419> a<00:05:28.450> guru<00:05:28.720> kheh<00:05:29.080> but<00:05:29.560> it's<00:05:30.160> kind

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
quiet could be a guru kheh but it's kind

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.000 
quiet could be a guru kheh but it's kind
of<00:05:30.550> a<00:05:30.930> long-winded<00:05:31.930> theory<00:05:32.350> like<00:05:32.590> it's<00:05:32.770> kind

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
of a long-winded theory like it's kind

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.240 
of a long-winded theory like it's kind
of<00:05:33.039> hard<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:33.789> really<00:05:34.660> know<00:05:34.930> because<00:05:35.200> the<00:05:36.070> Guru

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
of hard to really know because the Guru

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.750 
of hard to really know because the Guru
cos<00:05:36.550> are<00:05:36.700> based<00:05:36.880> in<00:05:37.120> like<00:05:37.330> Nepal<00:05:37.960> which<00:05:38.770> is<00:05:39.010> in

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
cos are based in like Nepal which is in

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.360 
cos are based in like Nepal which is in
that<00:05:40.600> kind<00:05:40.960> of<00:05:41.020> like<00:05:41.169> Middle<00:05:41.620> Eastern<00:05:42.010> region

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
that kind of like Middle Eastern region

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.719 
that kind of like Middle Eastern region
but<00:05:42.580> it<00:05:42.700> isn't<00:05:43.120> where<00:05:43.990> we<00:05:44.710> know<00:05:44.890> that<00:05:45.160> this

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
but it isn't where we know that this

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.730 
but it isn't where we know that this
game<00:05:45.970> takes<00:05:46.240> place<00:05:46.330> because<00:05:46.690> we<00:05:46.810> know<00:05:46.960> that<00:05:46.990> in

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
game takes place because we know that in

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.070 
game takes place because we know that in
that<00:05:48.460> scene<00:05:48.760> where<00:05:49.000> you<00:05:49.120> see<00:05:49.150> quiet<00:05:49.630> she's<00:05:49.930> in

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
that scene where you see quiet she's in

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.150 
that scene where you see quiet she's in
Afghanistan<00:05:50.860> so<00:05:51.850> why<00:05:52.810> is<00:05:52.870> she<00:05:53.289> in<00:05:53.410> Afghanistan

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
Afghanistan so why is she in Afghanistan

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.370 
Afghanistan so why is she in Afghanistan
like<00:05:54.400> what's<00:05:54.760> going<00:05:55.120> on<00:05:55.270> like<00:05:55.510> why<00:05:56.110> is<00:05:56.169> she

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
like what's going on like why is she

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.779 
like what's going on like why is she
there<00:05:56.590> maybe<00:05:57.039> she's<00:05:57.280> hunting<00:05:57.550> down<00:05:57.669> the

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
there maybe she's hunting down the

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.010 
there maybe she's hunting down the
people<00:05:58.060> to<00:05:58.150> cut<00:05:58.330> out<00:05:58.450> her<00:05:58.570> tongue<00:05:58.600> I<00:05:58.990> don't

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
people to cut out her tongue I don't

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.860 
people to cut out her tongue I don't
know<00:05:59.320> but<00:05:59.830> it's<00:06:00.160> like<00:06:00.280> also<00:06:00.880> she<00:06:01.450> doesn't<00:06:01.750> look

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
know but it's like also she doesn't look

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.730 
know but it's like also she doesn't look
like<00:06:01.930> she's<00:06:02.320> from<00:06:02.590> Nepal<00:06:03.550> so<00:06:04.560> because<00:06:05.560> she's

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
like she's from Nepal so because she's

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.370 
like she's from Nepal so because she's
white<00:06:06.160> and<00:06:06.220> they're<00:06:06.669> more<00:06:07.600> of<00:06:07.630> a<00:06:07.780> like<00:06:07.990> kind<00:06:08.229> of

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
white and they're more of a like kind of

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.610 
white and they're more of a like kind of
like<00:06:08.500> Asian<00:06:09.310> type<00:06:10.150> skin<00:06:10.660> tone<00:06:10.900> I<00:06:11.139> don't<00:06:11.500> know

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
like Asian type skin tone I don't know

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.990 
like Asian type skin tone I don't know
but<00:06:13.979> like<00:06:14.979> I<00:06:15.130> said<00:06:15.190> there's<00:06:15.490> just<00:06:15.550> too<00:06:15.850> many

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
but like I said there's just too many

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.940 
but like I said there's just too many
like<00:06:16.389> questions<00:06:16.960> and<00:06:17.169> unknowns<00:06:17.530> at<00:06:17.800> this

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
like questions and unknowns at this

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.140 
like questions and unknowns at this
point<00:06:18.310> to<00:06:18.940> really<00:06:19.270> make<00:06:20.370> like<00:06:21.370> more<00:06:21.970> of<00:06:22.090> a

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
point to really make like more of a

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.000 
point to really make like more of a
solid<00:06:22.630> theory<00:06:23.020> so<00:06:23.229> I'm<00:06:23.380> just<00:06:23.530> kind<00:06:23.800> of<00:06:23.860> like

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
solid theory so I'm just kind of like

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.180 
solid theory so I'm just kind of like
it's<00:06:24.850> kind<00:06:25.090> of<00:06:25.150> very<00:06:25.450> loose<00:06:25.930> theory<00:06:26.410> I<00:06:26.590> just

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
it's kind of very loose theory I just

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.590 
it's kind of very loose theory I just
thought<00:06:27.310> it<00:06:27.430> would<00:06:27.550> be<00:06:27.669> fun<00:06:27.940> to<00:06:28.060> talk<00:06:28.270> about<00:06:28.450> I

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
thought it would be fun to talk about I

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.360 
thought it would be fun to talk about I
thought<00:06:28.900> it<00:06:28.990> would<00:06:29.110> be<00:06:29.260> like<00:06:29.470> interesting<00:06:30.130> and

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
thought it would be like interesting and

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.340 
thought it would be like interesting and
I<00:06:30.430> let<00:06:30.850> you<00:06:30.880> guys<00:06:31.150> know<00:06:31.450> and<00:06:31.690> see<00:06:31.870> what<00:06:32.020> you<00:06:32.169> can

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
I let you guys know and see what you can

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.060 
I let you guys know and see what you can
do<00:06:32.500> with<00:06:32.710> it

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
do with it

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.980 
do with it
maybe<00:06:33.490> you<00:06:33.669> know<00:06:33.820> more<00:06:34.030> than<00:06:34.180> I<00:06:34.240> do<00:06:34.389> I<00:06:34.840> don't

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
maybe you know more than I do I don't

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.250 
maybe you know more than I do I don't
know<00:06:35.400> but<00:06:36.400> yeah<00:06:37.360> I<00:06:37.390> figured<00:06:37.780> I'd<00:06:37.840> let<00:06:37.870> you<00:06:38.020> guys

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
know but yeah I figured I'd let you guys

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.900 
know but yeah I figured I'd let you guys
know

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
know

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.590 
know
and<00:06:40.000> until<00:06:40.690> next<00:06:40.810> time<00:06:40.990> see<00:06:41.440> you<00:06:41.530> later
