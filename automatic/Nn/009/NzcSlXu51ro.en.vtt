 He said yes, I would not have married her 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.639
 but I already had other couples and I did not 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.040
 result from different verbal tastes 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.950
 it's just that I have to tell you that 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.630
 is musical part not understood not 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.160

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.790
 this song costs him so much 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.980
 the likes live and his voice has gone 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.979

 second stage 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.860
 yes yes this process was that it was 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:12.889
 who was and will stay in what is 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.169
 attitude that presentation I would say yes 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:19.160
 but it's more than attitude and presentation 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:21.530
 it is also the translation of what you do 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.740
 as a singer and in that translation you 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.040

 past 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.880
 more material to investigate the 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.280
 reception of the public I imagined 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.820
 that was going to be like that or we're lying 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.730
 another type of music and singers
