00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
better but it's about on par with the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.990 
better but it's about on par with the
iPad<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.720> one<00:03:23.620> thing<00:03:23.769> I<00:03:23.830> do<00:03:23.890> like<00:03:24.220> is<00:03:24.459> how<00:03:24.940> the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
iPad and one thing I do like is how the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.680

Motorola<00:03:25.450> Xoom<00:03:25.920> has<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:26.950> 16<00:03:27.670> by<00:03:27.910> 10<00:03:28.239> aspect

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
Motorola Xoom has a 16 by 10 aspect

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.860 
Motorola Xoom has a 16 by 10 aspect
