00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010

going<00:00:50.489> around<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:50.910> field<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.329> how<00:00:51.420> long<00:00:51.570> it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
going around this field and how long it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.959 
going around this field and how long it
took<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.649> we've<00:00:52.770> got<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.129> completely<00:00:53.670> done

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
took but we've got that completely done

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.290 
took but we've got that completely done
now<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:55.070> started<00:00:56.070> building<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.489> sky<00:00:56.760> boxes

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
now and started building the sky boxes

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.740 
now and started building the sky boxes
we've<00:00:58.020> got<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:59.030> basically<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> front<00:01:00.449> frame

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
we've got the basically the front frame

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.660 
we've got the basically the front frame
of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> skyboxes<00:01:01.739> complete<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.489> way

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
of the skyboxes complete all the way

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.509 
of the skyboxes complete all the way
around<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.329> field<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.589> then<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.129> end<00:01:05.400> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
around the field and then this end of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.609 
around the field and then this end of
the<00:01:05.610> field<00:01:05.820> will<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.090> open<00:01:06.479> here<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:07.470> like

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the field will be open here just like

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.920 
the field will be open here just like
the<00:01:08.430> typical<00:01:08.610> Lambeau<00:01:09.119> Field<00:01:09.390> picture<00:01:09.780> would

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the typical Lambeau Field picture would

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.380 
the typical Lambeau Field picture would
be<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.610> then<00:01:11.610> we've<00:01:11.729> built<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.180> stadium

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
be and then we've built the stadium

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.750 
be and then we've built the stadium
lighting<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.590> way<00:01:13.650> around<00:01:13.770> which<00:01:14.490> looks

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
lighting all the way around which looks

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760 
lighting all the way around which looks
pretty<00:01:14.820> cool<00:01:15.090> at<00:01:15.270> night<00:01:15.299> actually<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.409> doesn't

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
pretty cool at night actually it doesn't

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.590 
pretty cool at night actually it doesn't
light<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.159> much<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.580> would<00:01:17.640> hope<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.360> it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
light up as much as I would hope but it

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.719 
light up as much as I would hope but it
definitely<00:01:19.200> gives<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.740> little<00:01:19.890> bit<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
definitely gives it a little bit of the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.590 
definitely gives it a little bit of the
lighting<00:01:21.110> factor<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.650> would<00:01:22.770> expect

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
lighting factor that you would expect

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.620 
lighting factor that you would expect
and<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> yellow<00:01:26.090> lines<00:01:27.090> coming<00:01:27.420> down

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
and so with the yellow lines coming down

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.030 
and so with the yellow lines coming down
here<00:01:27.840> i<00:01:27.900> think<00:01:28.049> i'm<00:01:28.259> going<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> wait<00:01:28.650> until<00:01:28.860> i

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
here i think i'm going to wait until i

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.219 
here i think i'm going to wait until i
get<00:01:29.520> done<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.000> i'm<00:01:30.540> probably<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:31.140> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
get done with this i'm probably going to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.960 
get done with this i'm probably going to
have<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> few<00:01:31.710> coming<00:01:32.040> down<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> sides<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.820> as

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
have a few coming down the sides here as

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.880 
have a few coming down the sides here as
well<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:34.140> i'm<00:01:34.259> going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> end<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.619> knocking

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
well but i'm going to end up knocking

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.640 
well but i'm going to end up knocking
part<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.930> corners<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.470> build

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
part of this out in the corners to build

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.350 
part of this out in the corners to build
the<00:01:37.770> tunnel<00:01:38.100> system<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.700> go<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.119> locker

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the tunnel system to go to the locker

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.300 
the tunnel system to go to the locker
rooms<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.740> i'm<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.130> wait

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
rooms and so i'm just going to wait

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.520 
rooms and so i'm just going to wait
until<00:01:41.460> i<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.030> point<00:01:42.360> before<00:01:43.320> i

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
until i get to that point before i

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.190 
until i get to that point before i
continue<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.759> i<00:01:45.689> think<00:01:45.960> i<00:01:46.020> showed

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
continue on here and i think i showed

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.319 
continue on here and i think i showed
you<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.590> last<00:01:46.829> video<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:47.759> how<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
you on that last video here how the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.880 
you on that last video here how the
seating<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> look<00:01:49.380> there's<00:01:49.740> going

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
seating is going to look there's going

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.340 
seating is going to look there's going
to<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:49.979> stairs<00:01:50.399> coming<00:01:50.790> down<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.630> haven't

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
to be stairs coming down here I haven't

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.310 
to be stairs coming down here I haven't
done<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.740> any<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.250> other<00:01:54.320> sections

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
done that for any of the other sections

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.929 
done that for any of the other sections
just<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.860> was<00:01:55.890> again<00:01:56.159> time<00:01:56.399> consuming

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
just because it was again time consuming

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.149 
just because it was again time consuming
and<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.689> wait<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.110> do<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.259> until<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.829> have

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
and I think wait to do that until I have

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.190 
and I think wait to do that until I have
the<00:01:59.670> floors<00:01:59.969> roughed<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> inside<00:02:01.170> of

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the floors roughed in on the inside of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.740 
the floors roughed in on the inside of
the<00:02:01.439> interior<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> stadium<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.540> what

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the interior of the stadium and so what

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.840 
the interior of the stadium and so what
I'm<00:02:03.840> working<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.320> next<00:02:04.649> here<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.250> actually

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
I'm working on next here is actually

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.020 
I'm working on next here is actually
building<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> skybox<00:02:06.689> area<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.759> that<00:02:08.759> is

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
building in the skybox area and that is

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.490 
building in the skybox area and that is
actually<00:02:09.239> going<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.599> be<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> lot<00:02:10.110> more<00:02:10.140> work

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
actually going to be a lot more work

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.340 
actually going to be a lot more work
than<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.860> had<00:02:11.220> originally<00:02:11.340> thought<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:12.239> well

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
than I had originally thought as well

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.130 
than I had originally thought as well
see<00:02:13.500> here's<00:02:13.740> my<00:02:13.800> house<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.840> it's<00:02:15.840> actually

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
see here's my house and it's actually

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.650 
see here's my house and it's actually
pretty<00:02:16.290> close<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.860> stadium<00:02:17.070> build<00:02:17.660> right

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
pretty close to the stadium build right

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.700 
pretty close to the stadium build right
over<00:02:18.900> here<00:02:19.250> but<00:02:20.250> what<00:02:20.610> I've<00:02:20.700> done<00:02:20.910> today<00:02:21.120> is

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
over here but what I've done today is

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.890 
over here but what I've done today is
worked<00:02:22.710> on<00:02:22.890> putting<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.700> skybox<00:02:24.390> area

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
worked on putting the skybox area

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.350 
worked on putting the skybox area
together<00:02:25.140> I'm<00:02:25.680> going<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.580> have<00:02:26.730> stairways

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
together I'm going to have stairways

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.830 
together I'm going to have stairways
going<00:02:27.810> up<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.470> down<00:02:29.030> probably<00:02:30.030> three<00:02:30.570> blocks

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
going up and down probably three blocks

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.020 
going up and down probably three blocks
across<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.830> these<00:02:31.980> three<00:02:32.250> will<00:02:32.490> be<00:02:32.610> probably

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
across so these three will be probably

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.360 
across so these three will be probably
going<00:02:33.450> up<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.900> these<00:02:34.500> three<00:02:34.830> will<00:02:35.010> be<00:02:35.100> going

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
going up and these three will be going

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.090 
going up and these three will be going
down<00:02:35.990> I'm<00:02:36.990> be<00:02:37.290> building<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.800> different

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
down I'm be building in different

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.850 
down I'm be building in different
staircases<00:02:38.340> all<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.000> way<00:02:39.090> along<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.740> get

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
staircases all the way along this to get

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.620 
staircases all the way along this to get
to<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.070> upper<00:02:41.490> levels<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.000> lower<00:02:42.210> levels

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
to the upper levels and the lower levels

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.950 
to the upper levels and the lower levels
eventually<00:02:43.620> here<00:02:43.830> but<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.750> going<00:02:45.870> to

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
eventually here but so this is going to

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.180 
eventually here but so this is going to
be<00:02:46.020> kind<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.320> main<00:02:46.470> walkway<00:02:46.740> you'll

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
be kind of the main walkway you'll

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.610 
be kind of the main walkway you'll
probably<00:02:47.340> one<00:02:47.670> length<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.690> blocks<00:02:48.960> beyond

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
probably one length of blocks beyond

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.230 
probably one length of blocks beyond
that<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.100> then<00:02:50.250> you'll<00:02:50.460> see<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.700> staircase

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
that and then you'll see the staircase

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.140 
that and then you'll see the staircase
is<00:02:51.480> starting<00:02:51.870> on<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.470> section<00:02:52.860> here<00:02:53.150> but

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
is starting on this section here but

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.560 
is starting on this section here but
build<00:02:54.930> my<00:02:55.050> employee<00:02:55.440> only<00:02:55.910> little<00:02:56.910> area<00:02:57.360> where

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
build my employee only little area where

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.880 
build my employee only little area where
I<00:02:57.600> just<00:02:57.930> sleep<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.230> get<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.530> night<00:02:58.710> and

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
I just sleep to get to the night and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.340 
I just sleep to get to the night and
store<00:02:59.130> some<00:02:59.310> stuff<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.820> then<00:03:00.600> we've<00:03:01.320> got

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
store some stuff and then we've got

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.950 
store some stuff and then we've got
these<00:03:01.680> skyboxes<00:03:02.400> going<00:03:02.760> down<00:03:02.940> along<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.750> side

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
these skyboxes going down along the side

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.790 
these skyboxes going down along the side
here<00:03:04.130> using<00:03:05.130> iron<00:03:05.370> doors<00:03:05.580> for<00:03:05.820> each<00:03:05.940> one<00:03:06.240> you

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
here using iron doors for each one you

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.580 
here using iron doors for each one you
can<00:03:07.800> see<00:03:07.950> our<00:03:07.980> view<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.820> stadium<00:03:09.210> here

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
can see our view of the stadium here

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.930 
can see our view of the stadium here
eventually<00:03:10.590> I'll<00:03:10.920> come<00:03:11.130> back<00:03:11.310> when<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:11.760> gets

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
eventually I'll come back when this gets

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.910 
eventually I'll come back when this gets
closer<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.390> completion<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.110> add<00:03:13.320> some<00:03:13.500> detail

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
closer to completion and add some detail

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.980 
closer to completion and add some detail
put<00:03:14.640> in<00:03:14.790> some<00:03:14.970> seating<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.600> probably<00:03:15.840> some

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
type of thing some end tables but for

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.640 
type of thing some end tables but for
right<00:03:21.720> now<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:21.930> trying<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.350> get<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.560> all

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
right now just trying to get it all

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.010 
right now just trying to get it all
roughed<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.880> can<00:03:24.000> see<00:03:24.180> these<00:03:24.360> are<00:03:24.420> all

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
roughed in and you can see these are all

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.650 
roughed in and you can see these are all
the<00:03:25.230> same<00:03:25.440> all<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.800> way<00:03:25.830> down<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:27.510> can

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
the same all the way down and you can

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.360 
the same all the way down and you can
just<00:03:27.810> see<00:03:27.990> how<00:03:28.170> much<00:03:28.350> work<00:03:28.590> this<00:03:28.800> is<00:03:29.010> just<00:03:29.250> to

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
just see how much work this is just to

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.490 
just see how much work this is just to
lay<00:03:29.520> all<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.030> ceiling<00:03:30.420> blocks<00:03:30.630> all<00:03:30.960> the<00:03:30.990> floor

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
lay all the ceiling blocks all the floor

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.710 
lay all the ceiling blocks all the floor
and<00:03:31.740> then<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.430> build<00:03:32.640> all<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.880> walls<00:03:33.120> in<00:03:33.390> it's

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
and then to build all the walls in it's

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.900 
and then to build all the walls in it's
just<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.380> ton<00:03:34.740> of<00:03:34.770> blocks<00:03:35.070> ton<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.460> work<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.610> do

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
just a ton of blocks ton of work to do

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.480 
just a ton of blocks ton of work to do
and<00:03:36.380> you<00:03:37.380> know<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:37.680> tell<00:03:37.980> I'm<00:03:38.280> nowhere

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
and you know you can tell I'm nowhere

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.980 
and you know you can tell I'm nowhere
near<00:03:38.640> done<00:03:39.060> because<00:03:39.390> we're<00:03:39.540> going<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.720> go<00:03:39.810> all

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
near done because we're going to go all

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.350 
near done because we're going to go all
the<00:03:40.110> way<00:03:40.140> down<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.710> around<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:42.090> entire

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
the way down and around the entire

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.210 
the way down and around the entire
stadium<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.380> it's<00:03:43.500> going<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.680> take<00:03:43.800> a<00:03:43.830> lot<00:03:44.160> of

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
stadium so it's going to take a lot of

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.580 
stadium so it's going to take a lot of
work<00:03:44.460> but<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.300> can<00:03:45.330> see<00:03:45.600> just<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:46.110> kind<00:03:46.500> of

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
work but you can see just the kind of

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.370 
work but you can see just the kind of
roughed<00:03:46.800> in<00:03:46.950> project<00:03:47.460> how<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.970> goes<00:03:48.180> we've<00:03:49.170> got

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
roughed in project how it goes we've got

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.460 
roughed in project how it goes we've got
the<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.830> four<00:03:50.100> floors<00:03:50.490> of<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.840> stadium<00:03:52.080> and

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
the the four floors of the stadium and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.630 
the the four floors of the stadium and
then<00:03:52.590> we're<00:03:52.710> going<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:52.860> have<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.400> green

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
then we're going to have the the green

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.400 
then we're going to have the the green
roof<00:03:53.910> top<00:03:54.530> on<00:03:55.530> top<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.190> stadium<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:57.410> right

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
roof top on top of the stadium and right

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.200 
roof top on top of the stadium and right
now<00:03:58.560> again<00:03:59.070> just<00:03:59.340> going<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.670> be<00:03:59.760> kind<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.150> the

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
now again just going to be kind of the

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.940 
now again just going to be kind of the
same<00:04:00.420> thing<00:04:00.480> on<00:04:00.780> all<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.020> levels<00:04:01.260> we<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:01.830> got

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
same thing on all the levels we just got

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.240 
same thing on all the levels we just got
the<00:04:02.070> different<00:04:02.370> stadium<00:04:02.790> sky<00:04:03.690> boxes<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:05.100> so

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
the different stadium sky boxes and so

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.530 
the different stadium sky boxes and so
you<00:04:05.310> can<00:04:05.430> get<00:04:05.520> a<00:04:05.580> nice<00:04:05.760> view<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.210> stadium

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
you can get a nice view of the stadium

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.280 
you can get a nice view of the stadium
here<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:08.690> then<00:04:09.690> we'll<00:04:09.780> have<00:04:09.930> some<00:04:10.080> seating

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
here and then we'll have some seating

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.040 
here and then we'll have some seating
and<00:04:10.440> then<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.620> think<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.850> main<00:04:12.180> level<00:04:12.480> or<00:04:12.990> i

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
and then I think the main level or i

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.590 
and then I think the main level or i
guess<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.740> end<00:04:13.920> zone<00:04:14.160> level<00:04:14.550> isn't<00:04:15.120> really<00:04:15.570> a

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
guess the end zone level isn't really a

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.450 
guess the end zone level isn't really a
luxury<00:04:16.080> box<00:04:16.410> it's<00:04:16.680> going<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.859> be<00:04:16.950> more<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.280> just

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.460 
luxury box it's going to be more of just

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.570 
luxury box it's going to be more of just
an<00:04:17.640> interior<00:04:18.270> club<00:04:19.200> seating<00:04:19.500> level<00:04:19.890> and<00:04:20.100> so

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
an interior club seating level and so

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.760 
an interior club seating level and so
there<00:04:21.450> it's<00:04:21.600> not<00:04:21.780> going<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.020> be<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.500> know<00:04:22.590> as

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
there it's not going to be you know as

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.320 
there it's not going to be you know as
personal<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.640> room<00:04:23.820> it's<00:04:24.000> just<00:04:24.120> going<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.270> be

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
personal of a room it's just going to be

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.420 
personal of a room it's just going to be
more<00:04:24.780> stadium<00:04:25.290> seating

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
more stadium seating

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.159 
more stadium seating
but<00:04:26.580> just<00:04:26.759> kind<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.060> in<00:04:27.240> doors<00:04:27.509> behind<00:04:27.870> this

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
but just kind of in doors behind this

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.810 
but just kind of in doors behind this
wall<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:28.830> actually<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.370> think<00:04:29.430> we'll<00:04:29.699> go<00:04:29.789> a

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
wall so that actually I think we'll go a

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.700 
wall so that actually I think we'll go a
little<00:04:30.000> bit<00:04:30.210> quicker<00:04:30.389> than<00:04:31.259> some<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.650> these

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
little bit quicker than some of these

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.520 
little bit quicker than some of these
other<00:04:31.770> luxury<00:04:32.340> boxes<00:04:32.729> but<00:04:33.000> no<00:04:33.539> doubt<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.990> pretty

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
other luxury boxes but no doubt a pretty

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.580 
other luxury boxes but no doubt a pretty
big<00:04:34.800> task<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:36.270> complete<00:04:36.300> just<00:04:37.080> because<00:04:37.380> it's

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
big task to complete just because it's

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.740 
big task to complete just because it's
so<00:04:37.919> much<00:04:38.100> work<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.610> then<00:04:39.180> I<00:04:39.210> can<00:04:39.479> only<00:04:39.600> imagine

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
so much work and then I can only imagine

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.950 
so much work and then I can only imagine
how<00:04:40.289> much<00:04:40.500> work<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:41.009> exterior<00:04:41.580> wall<00:04:42.030> going

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
how much work the exterior wall going

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.659 
how much work the exterior wall going
all<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.320> way<00:04:43.410> down<00:04:43.620> to<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.830> ground<00:04:44.100> level<00:04:44.370> is

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
all the way down to the ground level is

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:45.920 
all the way down to the ground level is
going<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:44.910> be<00:04:45.060> especially<00:04:45.330> since<00:04:45.690> there's<00:04:45.870> so

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
going to be especially since there's so

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.499 
going to be especially since there's so
much<00:04:46.110> earth<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:46.560> needs<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.860> be<00:04:46.949> cleared<00:04:47.220> to

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
much earth that needs to be cleared to

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.730 
much earth that needs to be cleared to
that's<00:04:48.509> just<00:04:48.750> really<00:04:48.900> time<00:04:49.139> consuming<00:04:49.169> but

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
that's just really time consuming but

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.499 
that's just really time consuming but
you<00:04:50.250> can<00:04:50.400> see<00:04:50.550> we've<00:04:50.699> made<00:04:50.880> quite<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.210> bit<00:04:51.419> of

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
you can see we've made quite a bit of

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.570 
you can see we've made quite a bit of
progress<00:04:51.949> definitely<00:04:52.949> let<00:04:53.039> me<00:04:53.070> know<00:04:53.160> guys

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
progress definitely let me know guys

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.219 
progress definitely let me know guys
what<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:53.970> think<00:04:54.150> about<00:04:54.240> this<00:04:54.539> project<00:04:55.050> in<00:04:55.139> the

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
what you think about this project in the

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.290 
what you think about this project in the
comments<00:04:55.620> below<00:04:55.740> if<00:04:56.130> you<00:04:56.550> have<00:04:56.580> any<00:04:56.669> ideas<00:04:57.180> or

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
comments below if you have any ideas or

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.920 
comments below if you have any ideas or
suggestions<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:58.550> on<00:04:59.550> that<00:05:00.240> I<00:05:00.300> guess<00:05:00.509> that's

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
suggestions and on that I guess that's

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.560 
suggestions and on that I guess that's
it<00:05:01.139> for<00:05:01.380> this<00:05:01.470> update<00:05:01.880> I'll<00:05:02.880> bring<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.300> more

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
it for this update I'll bring you more

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.960 
it for this update I'll bring you more
as<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:04.440> progress<00:05:04.800> is<00:05:04.979> made<00:05:05.190> but<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.699> think<00:05:05.880> it

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
as the progress is made but I think it

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.240 
as the progress is made but I think it
will<00:05:06.060> probably<00:05:06.300> be<00:05:06.449> a<00:05:06.539> little<00:05:06.690> while<00:05:06.960> now

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
will probably be a little while now

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.379 
will probably be a little while now
since<00:05:08.250> it's<00:05:08.460> just<00:05:08.610> going<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.030> be<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.150> lot<00:05:09.330> of

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
since it's just going to be a lot of

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.870 
since it's just going to be a lot of
kind<00:05:09.780> of<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:09.960> same<00:05:10.229> repetitive<00:05:10.789> building<00:05:11.789> in

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
kind of the same repetitive building in

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.719 
kind of the same repetitive building in
the<00:05:11.970> sky<00:05:12.180> boxes<00:05:12.660> all<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.930> way<00:05:13.020> along<00:05:13.729> which

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
the sky boxes all the way along which

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.129 
the sky boxes all the way along which
will<00:05:14.880> take<00:05:15.000> me<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.240> long<00:05:15.509> time<00:05:15.690> so<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.990> next

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
will take me a long time so the next

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.779 
will take me a long time so the next
update<00:05:16.410> will<00:05:16.590> be<00:05:16.770> when<00:05:17.039> I<00:05:17.070> probably<00:05:17.340> get<00:05:17.580> that

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
update will be when I probably get that

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.540 
update will be when I probably get that
pretty<00:05:18.120> close<00:05:18.389> to<00:05:18.539> completion<00:05:18.900> and<00:05:19.550> other

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
pretty close to completion and other

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.499 
pretty close to completion and other
than<00:05:20.639> that<00:05:20.759> I<00:05:20.910> appreciate<00:05:21.120> you<00:05:21.360> guys<00:05:21.449> watching

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
than that I appreciate you guys watching

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:32.119 
than that I appreciate you guys watching
and<00:05:22.229> I<00:05:22.380> will<00:05:22.410> see<00:05:22.680> you<00:05:22.949> in<00:05:23.099> the<00:05:23.340> next<00:05:23.550> video
