I<00:00:02.540> think<00:00:03.540> our<00:00:03.659> culture<00:00:03.929> has<00:00:04.319> always<00:00:04.560> embraced

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
I think our culture has always embraced

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.140 
I think our culture has always embraced
robots<00:00:05.940> through<00:00:07.160> entertainment<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.790> movies

robots through entertainment the movies

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.790 
robots through entertainment the movies
everything<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.780> you've<00:00:09.870> seen<00:00:10.110> robots<00:00:10.530> in

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
everything that you've seen robots in

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.740 
everything that you've seen robots in
and<00:00:11.309> it's<00:00:11.639> it's<00:00:12.030> like<00:00:12.090> an<00:00:12.269> unfulfilled

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
and it's it's like an unfulfilled

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:22.269 
and it's it's like an unfulfilled
promise<00:00:13.530> that's<00:00:13.769> always<00:00:13.980> been<00:00:14.340> out<00:00:14.490> there

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.000 

besides<00:00:23.279> being<00:00:23.730> incredibly<00:00:24.630> fun<00:00:24.930> there's<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
besides being incredibly fun there's a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.009 
besides being incredibly fun there's a
lot<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.519> practical<00:00:26.699> uses<00:00:27.269> for<00:00:27.300> robots<00:00:27.779> that

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
lot of practical uses for robots that

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.390 
lot of practical uses for robots that
are<00:00:28.080> gonna<00:00:28.260> allow<00:00:28.439> us<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.590> do<00:00:28.830> some<00:00:29.099> things

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
are gonna allow us to do some things

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.580 
are gonna allow us to do some things
that<00:00:29.699> we've<00:00:29.849> never<00:00:30.060> done<00:00:30.269> before<00:00:30.449> as<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.349> start

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that we've never done before as we start

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590 
that we've never done before as we start
to<00:00:31.710> increase<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.070> technology<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.090> windows

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
to increase the technology the windows

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.270 
to increase the technology the windows
just<00:00:33.809> start<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> open<00:00:34.260> exponentially<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.100> what

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
just start to open exponentially of what

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.549 
just start to open exponentially of what
we<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.850> them<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.410> can

with robots built things my job and my

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.710 
with robots built things my job and my
day<00:01:35.890> job<00:01:36.160> is<00:01:36.399> working<00:01:36.789> on<00:01:36.910> commercial<00:01:37.600> and

day job is working on commercial and
industrial<00:01:37.920> robotics<00:01:38.920> actually<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:40.119> this

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
industrial robotics actually and this

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.420 
industrial robotics actually and this
was<00:01:40.750> just<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:40.990> hobby<00:01:41.170> that<00:01:41.440> I<00:01:41.500> had<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:41.979> decided

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
was just a hobby that I had and decided

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.999 
was just a hobby that I had and decided
to<00:01:42.490> expand<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.119> outside<00:01:43.570> of<00:01:43.630> my<00:01:44.259> apartment<00:01:44.530> and

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
to expand it outside of my apartment and

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.279 
to expand it outside of my apartment and
you<00:01:45.520> know<00:01:45.700> share<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.119> with<00:01:46.240> everybody<00:01:46.630> else<00:01:46.840> a

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
you know share it with everybody else a

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.690 
you know share it with everybody else a
really<00:01:47.710> important<00:01:48.070> part<00:01:48.160> of<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.369> store<00:01:48.580> is

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
really important part of the store is

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.639 
really important part of the store is
just<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.970> entire<00:01:49.179> idea<00:01:49.420> of<00:01:49.690> technology<00:01:50.440> and

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
just the entire idea of technology and

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.950 
just the entire idea of technology and
kind<00:01:51.490> of<00:01:51.580> what<00:01:51.729> it<00:01:51.820> can<00:01:51.940> do<00:01:52.119> for<00:01:52.149> us<00:01:52.479> we

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
kind of what it can do for us we

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.050 
kind of what it can do for us we
specialized<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:53.560> educational<00:01:54.460> kits<00:01:54.759> we<00:01:54.970> have

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
specialized in educational kits we have

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.210 
specialized in educational kits we have
a<00:01:55.090> lot<00:01:55.300> of<00:01:55.420> robots<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.110> build<00:01:56.440> from<00:01:57.069> a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
a lot of robots that you build from a

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.219 
a lot of robots that you build from a
kit<00:01:57.459> form<00:01:57.789> it's<00:01:58.000> similar<00:01:58.240> to<00:01:58.569> a<00:01:58.599> model<00:01:59.050> where

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
kit form it's similar to a model where

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.859 
kit form it's similar to a model where
you're<00:01:59.429> separating<00:02:00.429> plastic<00:02:01.240> pieces<00:02:01.630> from

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
you're separating plastic pieces from

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.830 
you're separating plastic pieces from
the<00:02:02.020> runners<00:02:02.550> you<00:02:03.550> assemble<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.090> using<00:02:04.450> nuts

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
the runners you assemble it using nuts

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.630 
the runners you assemble it using nuts
bolts<00:02:05.170> but<00:02:05.470> then<00:02:05.649> there's<00:02:05.830> some<00:02:06.009> electronic

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
bolts but then there's some electronic

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.290 
bolts but then there's some electronic
elements<00:02:07.300> to<00:02:07.479> it<00:02:07.599> with<00:02:07.810> sensors<00:02:08.530> motors

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
elements to it with sensors motors

there's<00:03:04.849> a<00:03:05.269> couple<00:03:05.840> different<00:03:06.010> scenarios

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
there's a couple different scenarios

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.280 
there's a couple different scenarios
that<00:03:07.040> have<00:03:07.370> been<00:03:07.489> put<00:03:07.670> forth<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:08.180> why<00:03:08.810> robots

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
that have been put forth of why robots

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.140 
that have been put forth of why robots
would<00:03:09.470> actually<00:03:09.950> rise<00:03:10.250> up<00:03:10.489> basically<00:03:11.030> the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
would actually rise up basically the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.640 
would actually rise up basically the
robots<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:11.540> we<00:03:11.660> has<00:03:11.810> today<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.410> we're<00:03:12.530> gonna

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
robots that we has today and we're gonna

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.800 
robots that we has today and we're gonna
have<00:03:12.890> for<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.190> couple<00:03:13.489> hundred<00:03:13.730> years<00:03:13.880> I'm<00:03:14.599> not

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
have for a couple hundred years I'm not

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.550 
have for a couple hundred years I'm not
going<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:14.989> be<00:03:15.110> nearly<00:03:15.950> as<00:03:16.840> intelligent<00:03:17.840> as<00:03:18.500> a

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
going to be nearly as intelligent as a

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.949 
going to be nearly as intelligent as a
robot<00:03:18.950> needs<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.370> be<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.730> want<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.360> do<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.690> to

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
robot needs to be to want to do that to

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.589 
robot needs to be to want to do that to
have<00:03:21.080> those<00:03:21.349> survival<00:03:22.220> impulses<00:03:22.730> well<00:03:23.420> we'll

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
have those survival impulses well we'll

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.720 
have those survival impulses well we'll
always<00:03:24.019> be<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.470> ones<00:03:24.650> making<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.160> batteries

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
always be the ones making the batteries

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.759 
always be the ones making the batteries
and<00:03:25.910> everything<00:03:26.360> so<00:03:26.690> I'll<00:03:27.260> have<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.560> see<00:03:27.739> what

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
and everything so I'll have to see what

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.860 
and everything so I'll have to see what
happens<00:03:28.280> everybody<00:03:28.880> else<00:03:29.209> will<00:03:29.450> be<00:03:29.480> working

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
happens everybody else will be working

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.420 
happens everybody else will be working
in<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.049> salt<00:03:30.260> mines<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.890> I'm<00:03:30.950> gonna<00:03:31.040> be<00:03:31.220> doing

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
in the salt mines and I'm gonna be doing

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:39.970 
in the salt mines and I'm gonna be doing
basic<00:03:31.880> maintenance<00:03:38.290> we're<00:03:39.290> gonna<00:03:39.410> continue

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
kind of consolidate them to just based

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.860 
kind of consolidate them to just based
