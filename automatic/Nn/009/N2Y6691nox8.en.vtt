00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400 

I<00:00:00.060> wonder<00:00:00.390> if<00:00:00.510> you<00:00:00.599> would<00:00:00.780> have<00:00:00.870> done<00:00:00.989> a<00:00:01.050> little

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
I wonder if you would have done a little

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.290 
I wonder if you would have done a little
bit<00:00:01.560> better<00:00:01.709> with<00:00:02.340> hydraulics<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.060> think

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
bit better with hydraulics I think

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.180 
bit better with hydraulics I think
actually<00:00:03.449> hydralisk<00:00:04.020> honestly<00:00:04.589> would<00:00:05.100> have

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
actually hydralisk honestly would have

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.829 
actually hydralisk honestly would have
been<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> better<00:00:05.460> thing<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.120> do<00:00:06.299> had<00:00:06.569> he<00:00:06.660> known

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
been a better thing to do had he known

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.530 
been a better thing to do had he known
that<00:00:07.080> rates<00:00:07.919> were<00:00:08.069> coming<00:00:08.370> because<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.360> rates

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
that rates were coming because the rates

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.970 
that rates were coming because the rates
would<00:00:09.719> have<00:00:09.840> picked<00:00:10.019> off<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.410> well<00:00:10.769> they

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
would have picked off the well they

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.190 
would have picked off the well they
picked<00:00:11.400> off<00:00:11.519> Oh<00:00:11.700> Lord<00:00:11.940> before<00:00:12.090> any<00:00:12.540> anti<00:00:12.929> could

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
picked off Oh Lord before any anti could

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.870 
picked off Oh Lord before any anti could
go<00:00:13.320> up<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.830> wouldn't<00:00:14.070> have<00:00:14.190> been<00:00:14.219> true<00:00:14.549> with

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
go up that wouldn't have been true with

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.640 
go up that wouldn't have been true with
hydraulics<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.599> also<00:00:15.809> hide<00:00:15.960> risks<00:00:16.260> would

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
hydraulics and also hide risks would

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.810 
hydraulics and also hide risks would
have<00:00:16.770> been<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.949> will<00:00:17.039> pick<00:00:17.220> out<00:00:17.369> against<00:00:17.640> that

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
have been it will pick out against that

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.060 
have been it will pick out against that
mini<00:00:18.000> contain<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.720> vultures<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.230> Marines<00:00:19.529> way

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
mini contain of vultures and Marines way

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.920 
mini contain of vultures and Marines way
before<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> first<00:00:20.699> tank<00:00:20.939> got<00:00:21.180> there<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:21.840> by

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
before the first tank got there but by

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.210 
before the first tank got there but by
going<00:00:22.080> from<00:00:22.320> euless<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.740> think<00:00:22.920> he's<00:00:23.039> pretty

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
going from euless I think he's pretty

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.939 
going from euless I think he's pretty
much<00:00:23.400> condemned<00:00:23.820> himself<00:00:24.019> to<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> loss<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.590> so

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
much condemned himself to a loss here so

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.580 
much condemned himself to a loss here so
now<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.900> rates<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:28.050> getting<00:00:28.289> picked<00:00:28.470> off

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
now the rates are getting picked off

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.349 
now the rates are getting picked off
actually<00:00:28.890> but<00:00:29.220> importantly<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.060> sunken

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
actually but importantly the sunken

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.150 
actually but importantly the sunken
colonies<00:00:30.720> are<00:00:30.869> down<00:00:31.140> now<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.740> vulture<00:00:32.099> is

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
colonies are down now the vulture is

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.100 
colonies are down now the vulture is
going<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.730> think<00:00:33.120> their<00:00:33.420> speed<00:00:33.630> upgraded

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
going in I think their speed upgraded

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.180 
going in I think their speed upgraded
actually<00:00:34.440> yeah<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> speed<00:00:34.860> upgraded

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
actually yeah the speed upgraded

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.740 
actually yeah the speed upgraded
vultures<00:00:35.520> Mila<00:00:35.850> start<00:00:36.120> chasing<00:00:36.300> them<00:00:36.630> around

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
vultures Mila start chasing them around

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.680 
vultures Mila start chasing them around
though<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:38.190> might<00:00:38.700> haven't<00:00:39.059> no<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> still

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
though so you might haven't no I still

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.030 
though so you might haven't no I still
don't<00:00:39.809> think<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.140> still<00:00:40.379> think<00:00:40.559> he's<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:40.980> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
don't think I still think he's going to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.670 
don't think I still think he's going to
hooked<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.610> game<00:00:41.840> really<00:00:42.840> he<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.230> think

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
hooked in this game really he is I think

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.560 
hooked in this game really he is I think
no<00:00:43.920> drones<00:00:44.219> mining<00:00:44.550> at<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.700> natural<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
no drones mining at the natural and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.690 
no drones mining at the natural and
really<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> couple<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.890> mule<00:00:47.039> escs<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.460> and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
really just a couple of mule escs up and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.819 
really just a couple of mule escs up and
cloak<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.149> almost<00:00:48.450> done<00:00:48.750> dual<00:00:49.170> start<00:00:49.530> ports

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.850 
cloak is almost done dual start ports

cloak rates come out I don't think

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.219 
cloak rates come out I don't think
there's<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.970> anything<00:01:09.270> he'll<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.080> do

there's going to anything he'll can do
at<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.500> point<00:01:10.590> he's<00:01:11.310> actually<00:01:11.610> focusing

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
at this point he's actually focusing

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.850 
at this point he's actually focusing
down<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:13.020> missile<00:01:13.380> charter<00:01:13.590> trying<00:01:13.799> to

be<00:03:01.470> able<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.709> just<00:03:01.950> hang<00:03:02.280> around<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.850> finish

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
be able to just hang around and finish

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.120 
be able to just hang around and finish
off<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.569> SUV's<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.170> really<00:03:04.769> it's<00:03:04.920> not<00:03:05.040> going

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
off the SUV's so really it's not going

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.600 
off the SUV's so really it's not going
to<00:03:05.220> work<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.580> Wow<00:03:06.150> no<00:03:06.630> medics<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.230> up<00:03:07.470> for<00:03:07.769> up

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
to work and Wow no medics so up for up

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.270 
to work and Wow no medics so up for up
for<00:03:09.180> up<00:03:09.510> magic<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.290> think<00:03:10.470> if<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.739> had<00:03:10.830> gone<00:03:11.069> for

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
for up magic I think if you had gone for

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.289 
for up magic I think if you had gone for
medical<00:03:11.549> Marines<00:03:11.730> he<00:03:11.880> actually<00:03:12.030> could<00:03:12.269> have

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
medical Marines he actually could have

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.699 
medical Marines he actually could have
sealed<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.750> game<00:03:12.959> off<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.170> little<00:03:13.440> bit<00:03:13.560> more

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
sealed this game off a little bit more

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.650 
sealed this game off a little bit more
safely<00:03:14.069> because<00:03:14.970> he's<00:03:15.090> gone<00:03:15.239> for<00:03:15.420> several

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660

the one tank still wandering around and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.009 
the one tank still wandering around and
really<00:03:29.579> exciting<00:03:30.000> close<00:03:30.239> here<00:03:30.510> but<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.750> think

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
really exciting close here but I think

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.690 
really exciting close here but I think
I'm<00:03:31.200> but<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.680> conclusion<00:03:32.160> was<00:03:32.190> for<00:03:32.489> gone

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
I'm but the conclusion was for gone

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.610 
I'm but the conclusion was for gone
despite<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.480> nice<00:03:33.660> micro<00:03:34.049> that<00:03:34.230> boats<00:03:34.410> are

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
despite the nice micro that boats are

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.620 
despite the nice micro that boats are
showing<00:03:34.980> right<00:03:35.130> now<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.280> think<00:03:35.430> I'm<00:03:35.760> two<00:03:36.329> drones

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630

showing right now I think I'm two drones
yeah<00:03:37.079> honestly<00:03:37.350> once<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.950> last<00:03:38.100> drones<00:03:38.400> died

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
from the vultures I think the game was

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.340 
from the vultures I think the game was
over<00:03:40.680> so<00:03:41.549> at<00:03:42.540> this<00:03:42.600> point<00:03:42.810> I'm<00:03:42.959> just<00:03:43.140> waiting

over so at this point I'm just waiting
for<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.620> inevitable<00:03:43.980> conclusion<00:03:44.430> here<00:03:44.970> with

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
for the inevitable conclusion here with

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.479 
for the inevitable conclusion here with
just<00:03:45.329> three<00:03:45.510> meals<00:03:45.660> left<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.380> two<00:03:46.890> drones<00:03:47.160> um

chance of him losing I think he could

I think them if if all magic had
planting<00:05:28.060> down<00:05:28.360> a<00:05:28.750> a<00:05:30.270> economy<00:05:31.270> I<00:05:31.300> think<00:05:31.390> you

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
planting down a a economy I think you

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
like medic marine but uh I guess he's

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.620 
like medic marine but uh I guess he's
going<00:05:35.229> to<00:05:35.290> just<00:05:35.530> stay<00:05:35.800> with<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.630> rates

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630
