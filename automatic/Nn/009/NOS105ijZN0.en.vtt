00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.490 
lot of wheel ruts and as you guys can
see<00:00:26.730> Cobras<00:00:27.330> are<00:00:27.480> gonna<00:00:27.599> be<00:00:27.779> really<00:00:27.960> affected

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
see Cobras are gonna be really affected

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.720 
see Cobras are gonna be really affected
because<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.859> could<00:00:29.039> throw<00:00:29.189> them<00:00:29.369> past

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
because you could throw them past

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.939 
because you could throw them past
position<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> inside<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> get<00:00:31.590> them<00:00:31.679> wide

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
position to the inside and get them wide

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.010 
position to the inside and get them wide
open<00:00:31.980> there<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> nice<00:00:32.969> catch<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.600> think

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
open there for a nice catch so I think

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.930 
open there for a nice catch so I think
this<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.680> what<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> game<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.370> gonna<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.579> all

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
this is what the game is gonna be all

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.420 
this is what the game is gonna be all
about<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.600> year<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.350> lot<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.829> option<00:00:38.190> play

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
about this year a lot of option play

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.950 
about this year a lot of option play
especially<00:00:38.640> because<00:00:39.210> last<00:00:39.420> year

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
especially because last year

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.950 
especially because last year
rg3<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.790> course<00:00:42.090> colin<00:00:42.450> kaepernick

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
rg3 and of course colin kaepernick

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.190 
rg3 and of course colin kaepernick
exposed<00:00:43.739> them<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> NFL<00:00:45.300> really<00:00:45.719> well<00:00:45.930> last

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
exposed them to the NFL really well last

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.470 
exposed them to the NFL really well last
year<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.710> definitely<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.820> year<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> year

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
year so definitely this year is the year

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.020 
year so definitely this year is the year
the<00:00:48.750> option<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.070> remember<00:00:50.460> last<00:00:50.760> year

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the option so I remember last year

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.310 
the option so I remember last year
didn't<00:00:51.180> see<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> way<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.809> option<00:00:52.140> wasn't

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
didn't see the way the option wasn't

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.020 
didn't see the way the option wasn't
really<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.770> effective<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.730> year<00:00:54.000> I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
really that effective but this year I

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.029 
really that effective but this year I

make your reads correctly you could keep

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.389 
make your reads correctly you could keep

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
to the outside right here so there's two

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.780 
to the outside right here so there's two
things<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.680> gotta<00:01:10.860> read<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> defensive<00:01:11.670> end

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
things I gotta read the defensive end

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.340 
things I gotta read the defensive end
and<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> safety<00:01:12.360> safety<00:01:12.630> comes<00:01:12.960> down<00:01:13.170> I'm

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
and the safety safety comes down I'm

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.510 
and the safety safety comes down I'm
gonna<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.530> ahead<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.830> pitch<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.159> out

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
gonna go ahead and pitch it out

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.820 
gonna go ahead and pitch it out
safety<00:01:14.909> stays<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> pitchman<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.320> keep<00:01:16.590> it

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
safety stays with a pitchman you keep it

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.469 
safety stays with a pitchman you keep it

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
and then definitely definitely the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.969 
and then definitely definitely the
defensive<00:01:19.020> end<00:01:19.170> goes<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> running<00:01:19.950> back

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
defensive end goes to the running back

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.249 
defensive end goes to the running back
then<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.670> keep<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.119> or<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.390> stay<00:01:21.630> standing<00:01:21.900> up

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
