better<00:05:37.650> I<00:05:37.949> consider<00:05:38.639> when<00:05:38.819> we<00:05:38.940> played<00:05:39.210> them<00:05:39.419> a

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
better I consider when we played them a

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.749 
better I consider when we played them a
few<00:05:39.960> weeks<00:05:39.990> ago<00:05:40.259> and<00:05:40.560> we<00:05:41.009> came<00:05:41.220> in<00:05:41.370> second<00:05:41.669> half

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
one but uh yeah we we did well could

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.330

scored<00:05:50.669> a<00:05:50.819> couple<00:05:51.210> of<00:05:52.139> that<00:05:52.379> type<00:05:52.590> before<00:05:53.159> and

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
scored a couple of that type before and

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.610 
scored a couple of that type before and
once<00:05:54.240> I<00:05:54.360> take<00:05:54.509> Itachi's<00:05:54.990> moving<00:05:55.349> to<00:05:55.440> the<00:05:55.560> left

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
once I take Itachi's moving to the left

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.040 
once I take Itachi's moving to the left
so<00:05:56.490> all<00:05:56.669> his<00:05:56.789> weight<00:05:56.940> on<00:05:56.969> that<00:05:57.150> on<00:05:57.630> that<00:05:57.690> side

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
so all his weight on that on that side

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.950 
so all his weight on that on that side
and<00:05:58.080> I'm<00:05:58.289> think<00:05:59.099> took<00:05:59.219> the<00:05:59.310> other<00:05:59.370> way<00:05:59.550> and

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
and I'm think took the other way and

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.110 
and I'm think took the other way and
yeah<00:06:00.960> so<00:06:01.169> nice<00:06:01.530> top<00:06:01.830> corner<00:06:02.130> so<00:06:02.340> I'll<00:06:02.969> take

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120
