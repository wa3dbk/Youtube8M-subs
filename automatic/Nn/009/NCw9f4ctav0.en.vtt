I tell me you're not moving it or not

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.970 
I tell me you're not moving it or not
because<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.200> gotta<00:02:34.350> move<00:02:34.470> at<00:02:34.620> least<00:02:34.650> three

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
because you gotta move at least three

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.580 
because you gotta move at least three
times<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:36.330> importantly<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.050> all<00:02:37.140> shape<00:02:37.380> once

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
times so importantly it's all shape once

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.590 
times so importantly it's all shape once
you<00:02:37.680> move<00:02:37.830> three<00:02:38.010> time<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.310> go<00:02:38.490> hook<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:39.360> move

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
you move three time you go hook you move

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.810 
you move three time you go hook you move
twice<00:02:39.870> most<00:02:40.530> impressive<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> power<00:02:41.580> and

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820
