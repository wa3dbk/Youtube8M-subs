00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.140
 To all of you who are shaking their heads 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.700
 reaches up, up, up, up 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.200
 You are browsing your book 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.560
 and get a little sad about every single page 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.060
 for you have to get into a subject 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.100
 Who never really told you a shit 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.420
 When the curriculum and reading holiday 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.520
 is like a swamp you sink in 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.560
 And the Skip Netflix series 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.260
 Replaced by crying and whining 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.240
 Tell the teachers! 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.900
 Oh. To the teachers 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.980
 and give it all 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.860
 Now, up, up, up, up 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.060
 And tell the teachers 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.360
 and censor! Be on your toes! 

00:01:21.496 --> 00:01:23.496
 When you just open up 

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:27.816
 and get it in your brain out of your mouth 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.660
 Remember and gather your thoughts 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.760
 And will you be asked; Think at least one second 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.360
 If you punch yourself 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.840
 and read and ask until you understand 

00:01:46.608 --> 00:01:49.048
 You'd like to feel 

00:01:49.048 --> 00:01:54.500
 How it is to know something about something. 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 And tell the teachers! 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.940
 If you roam around your stuff and get a little sad about the terpery 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 Oh. To the teachers 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.740
 Don't beat yourself when there is something difficult to understand 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.540
 And give it all! 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.560
 When you are going up, up, up 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.600
 And show it to the teachers, though! 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.320
 And censor! Be on your toes! 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.540
 Listen to this song that goes out 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.880
 up, up, up, up 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.280
 To all of you who beat you upside down 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.060
 Don't give up, up, up, up! 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.820
 So come on! After all, we look in the passed 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.080
 When up, up, up, up 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.500
 For the exam. It could be understood. 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.900
 Inside the shell up! 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.560
 And tell the teachers 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.980
 If you roam around your stuff and get a little sad about the terpery 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.540
 And over the teachers 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.760
 Let go and beat yourself if there is something difficult to understand. 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.240
 Listen up! For this song it goes out 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.380
 Oh. From the teachers 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.600
 If you meet prepared and talk quietly then you control the show. 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.640
 And we are impressed 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.600
 Do you run the show? 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.560
 Do you control the show. 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.140
 Do you control the show! 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.980
 And we are impressed!
