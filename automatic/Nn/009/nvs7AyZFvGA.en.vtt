00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.049 
week as a supplement to the running game
because<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.470> charges<00:00:46.830> quite<00:00:47.040> honestly<00:00:47.400> can't

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
because the charges quite honestly can't

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.149 
because the charges quite honestly can't
do<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.269> great<00:00:48.600> job<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:49.110> stopping<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:49.860> run<00:00:49.979> so

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
do a great job of stopping the run so

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:52.189 
do a great job of stopping the run so
rewrites<00:00:50.549> may<00:00:50.790> not<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.390> effective<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.110> you

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
rewrites may not be as effective so you

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.289 
rewrites may not be as effective so you
gotta<00:00:52.379> go<00:00:52.500> your<00:00:52.860> next<00:00:53.129> best<00:00:53.489> opportunity<00:00:54.269> to

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
move the football in short increments

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.710 
move the football in short increments
would<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.430> Anquan<00:00:56.879> Boldin<00:00:56.909> and<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.510> short

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
would be Anquan Boldin and that short

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.259 
would be Anquan Boldin and that short
passing<00:00:58.080> attack<00:00:58.699> defensively<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> Ravens

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.579 
passing attack defensively the Ravens
will<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.659> to<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> better<00:01:01.229> job<00:01:01.350> of

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
will have to do a better job of

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.740 
will have to do a better job of
communicating<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.820> secondary<00:01:03.479> when

communicating in the secondary when

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.359 
communicating in the secondary when
you're<00:01:03.869> passing<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:04.440> receivers<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> next

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
you're passing off receivers to the next

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.430 
you're passing off receivers to the next
guy<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:06.030> got<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.450> understand<00:01:06.990> your

guy you got to understand your

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.080 
guy you got to understand your
assignments<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.159> that's<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.490> got<00:01:08.700> them<00:01:08.909> in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
assignments and that's what got them in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.310 
assignments and that's what got them in
trouble<00:01:09.119> last<00:01:09.630> week<00:01:09.750> versus<00:01:10.140> Pittsburgh

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
can't have that this week versus the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.800 
can't have that this week versus the
charges<00:01:14.550> because<00:01:14.820> Philip<00:01:15.120> Rivers<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.630> be

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
charges because Philip Rivers will be

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.210 
charges because Philip Rivers will be
able<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:16.290> take<00:01:16.440> advantage<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.010> so<00:01:17.160> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
able to take advantage of that so you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.950 
able to take advantage of that so you
got<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.430> communicate<00:01:17.580> better<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:18.630> second

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
got to communicate better in the second

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.310 
got to communicate better in the second
area<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.230> order<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.620> a<00:01:19.680> chance<00:01:21.080> now<00:01:22.080> let's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
area in order to have a chance now let's

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.600 
area in order to have a chance now let's
move<00:01:22.470> over<00:01:22.620> to<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> charges<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.490> this

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
move over to the charges in this

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.520 
move over to the charges in this
ballgame<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.210> offensively<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.900> think<00:01:25.260> this<00:01:25.470> is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
ballgame in offensively I think this is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.650 
ballgame in offensively I think this is
a<00:01:25.680> good<00:01:25.920> matchup<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.430> San<00:01:26.910> Diego<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.390> want

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
a good matchup for San Diego they want

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.000 
a good matchup for San Diego they want
to<00:01:27.750> throw<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:27.990> football<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.620> those<00:01:28.800> three

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
to throw the football out of those three

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.160 
to throw the football out of those three
and<00:01:29.280> four<00:01:29.460> wide<00:01:29.670> receiver<00:01:30.030> sets<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.540> wouldn't

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and four wide receiver sets I wouldn't

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.540 
and four wide receiver sets I wouldn't
just<00:01:31.410> forget<00:01:31.800> about<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.190> running<00:01:32.340> game<00:01:32.460> that

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
just forget about the running game that

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.430 
just forget about the running game that
I<00:01:32.730> think<00:01:32.970> their<00:01:33.090> drawers<00:01:33.510> there<00:01:33.870> quick<00:01:34.110> traps

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
I think their drawers there quick traps

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.620 
I think their drawers there quick traps
those<00:01:35.010> type<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.370> plays<00:01:35.760> can<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.390> success

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
those type of plays can have success

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.960 
those type of plays can have success
versus<00:01:37.260> this<00:01:37.440> Ravens<00:01:37.830> defense<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.700> when<00:01:38.850> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
versus this Ravens defense but when you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.180 
versus this Ravens defense but when you
look<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.390> outside<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:40.170> receiver<00:01:40.590> Malcolm

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
look on the outside at receiver Malcolm

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.430 
look on the outside at receiver Malcolm
Floyd<00:01:41.340> having<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> ability<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.810> highpoint<00:01:43.290> of

personnel breakdown in this ballgame and

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.929 
personnel breakdown in this ballgame and
you<00:03:08.379> see<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.709> charges<00:03:09.129> do<00:03:09.340> have<00:03:09.549> weapons

you see the charges do have weapons

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.399 
you see the charges do have weapons
offensively<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.689> problem<00:03:11.079> is<00:03:11.200> they're

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
offensively the problem is they're

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.949 
offensively the problem is they're
inconsistent<00:03:12.069> from<00:03:12.459> drive<00:03:12.849> to<00:03:13.090> drive<00:03:13.389> and<00:03:13.689> you

inconsistent from drive to drive and you

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.539 
inconsistent from drive to drive and you
can't<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:14.439> that<00:03:14.680> versus<00:03:15.069> a<00:03:15.129> team<00:03:15.310> like<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549
