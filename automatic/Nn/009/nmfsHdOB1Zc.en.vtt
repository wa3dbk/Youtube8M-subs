00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
in heaven part is it because they're

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.869 
in heaven part is it because they're
both<00:00:36.239> two<00:00:36.829> beautiful<00:00:37.829> women<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.700> like

being<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.870> heaven<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.649> guess<00:00:41.629> me<00:00:42.629> maybe<00:00:43.140> it's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
being in heaven I guess me maybe it's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.340 
being in heaven I guess me maybe it's
like<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.770> reference<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.850> pack<00:00:45.120> land<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.870> mean<00:00:46.320> I

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
like a reference to pack land I mean I

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.310 
like a reference to pack land I mean I
think<00:00:46.680> that's<00:00:46.890> where<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> fairies<00:00:48.390> from<00:00:48.660> uh

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
think that's where the fairies from uh

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.670 
think that's where the fairies from uh
we<00:00:49.770> even<00:00:50.489> saw<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> second<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.680> pac-man's

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680
