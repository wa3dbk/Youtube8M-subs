00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
there is some creativity to the

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
as it can get it never gets to a point

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.890 
as it can get it never gets to a point
where<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.040> says<00:03:51.250> anything<00:03:51.610> bad<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.540> mean<00:03:52.750> by

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
where it says anything bad I mean by

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.290 
where it says anything bad I mean by
giving<00:03:53.260> me<00:03:53.380> bad<00:03:53.680> messages<00:03:54.400> or<00:03:54.580> morals<00:03:55.090> or

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
giving me bad messages or morals or

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.150 
giving me bad messages or morals or
anything<00:03:55.540> it's<00:03:56.170> just<00:03:56.410> our<00:03:56.530> bland<00:03:56.890> and

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
anything it's just our bland and

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.920 
anything it's just our bland and
forgettable<00:03:57.640> like<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:57.970> lot<00:03:58.239> of<00:03:58.300> Disney<00:03:58.660> films

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
forgettable like a lot of Disney films

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.600 
forgettable like a lot of Disney films
that<00:03:59.050> were<00:03:59.140> coming<00:03:59.319> out<00:03:59.530> at<00:03:59.650> that<00:03:59.769> time<00:04:00.010> it's

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
that were coming out at that time it's

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.130 
that were coming out at that time it's
not<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.970> worst<00:04:01.180> but<00:04:01.510> it's<00:04:01.630> definitely<00:04:01.989> one<00:04:02.110> of

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
not the worst but it's definitely one of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.110 
not the worst but it's definitely one of
the<00:04:02.260> lower<00:04:02.440> ones<00:04:02.769> but<00:04:03.130> like<00:04:03.280> I<00:04:03.370> said<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.790> films

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
the lower ones but like I said the films

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.940 
the lower ones but like I said the films
really<00:04:04.390> starting<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.840> grow<00:04:05.110> in<00:04:05.140> fans<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:05.890> I

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
really starting to grow in fans and I

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.500 
really starting to grow in fans and I
find<00:04:06.160> more<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.489> more<00:04:06.519> people<00:04:06.819> actually<00:04:07.120> sort

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
find more and more people actually sort

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.780 
find more and more people actually sort
of<00:04:07.569> have<00:04:07.720> this<00:04:07.870> secret<00:04:08.200> life<00:04:08.500> for<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:08.920> so<00:04:09.340> maybe

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
of have this secret life for it so maybe

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.009 
of have this secret life for it so maybe
there<00:04:09.970> was<00:04:10.120> something<00:04:10.450> there<00:04:10.569> they<00:04:10.720> can<00:04:10.840> grab

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
there was something there they can grab

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.870 
there was something there they can grab
a<00:04:11.049> certain<00:04:11.410> group<00:04:11.560> of<00:04:11.709> people<00:04:11.769> but<00:04:12.580> it

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
a certain group of people but it

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.190 
a certain group of people but it
certainly<00:04:13.180> didn't<00:04:13.510> grab<00:04:13.690> me<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.110> it

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
certainly didn't grab me and it

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.720 
certainly didn't grab me and it
certainly<00:04:14.380> didn't<00:04:14.739> grab<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:14.920> lot<00:04:15.160> of<00:04:15.250> audiences

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
certainly didn't grab a lot of audiences

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.670 
certainly didn't grab a lot of audiences
at<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.000> time<00:04:16.209> Black<00:04:16.780> Cauldron<00:04:17.019> is<00:04:17.320> often

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
at the time Black Cauldron is often

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.409 
at the time Black Cauldron is often
called<00:04:17.889> one<00:04:18.040> of<00:04:18.160> Disney's<00:04:18.310> biggest<00:04:18.970> failures

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
called one of Disney's biggest failures

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.320 
called one of Disney's biggest failures
I<00:04:19.660> think<00:04:20.200> it's<00:04:20.350> just<00:04:20.530> kind<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:20.829> a<00:04:20.919> bad<00:04:21.180> not<00:04:22.180> the

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
I think it's just kind of a bad not the

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.740 
I think it's just kind of a bad not the
worst<00:04:22.540> but<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:22.990> probably<00:04:23.229> skip
