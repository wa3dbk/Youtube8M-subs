accidentally<00:03:34.520> went<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.150> root<00:03:35.360> it<00:03:36.110> was

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
accidentally went to the root it was

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.200 
accidentally went to the root it was
getting<00:03:36.590> way<00:03:36.770> too<00:03:36.830> light<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:37.670> I<00:03:37.820> didn't<00:03:38.060> want

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
to take it up any lighter I put a

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.170 
to take it up any lighter I put a
plastic<00:03:42.860> cap<00:03:43.220> on<00:03:43.370> with<00:03:43.520> this<00:03:43.640> I<00:03:43.850> don't<00:03:43.970> know<00:03:44.090> if

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
plastic cap on with this I don't know if

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.160 
plastic cap on with this I don't know if
I<00:03:44.270> was<00:03:44.390> supposed<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.810> or<00:03:45.020> not<00:03:45.170> but<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:47.140> had<00:03:48.140> just

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
won't for like 15 minutes and this is

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.930 
won't for like 15 minutes and this is
how<00:03:49.820> much<00:03:49.940> it<00:03:50.120> lightened<00:03:50.420> my<00:03:50.480> hair<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.940> just

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
how much it lightened my hair so just

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.550

you know at your own discretion just
keep<00:03:54.680> an<00:03:54.800> eye<00:03:54.920> on<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.459> you<00:03:56.209> know<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.390> like<00:03:56.990> I<00:03:57.110> said

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170

I<00:03:57.380> didn't<00:03:57.830> want<00:03:57.980> to<00:03:58.070> go<00:03:58.160> up<00:03:58.190> any<00:03:58.430> lighter

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
I didn't want to go up any lighter

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.880 
I didn't want to go up any lighter
because<00:03:59.450> like<00:03:59.630> in<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.870> roots<00:04:00.110> you<00:04:00.320> can<00:04:00.590> see

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
because like in the roots you can see

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.760 
because like in the roots you can see
it's<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.459> platinum<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.209> then<00:04:02.780> like<00:04:03.020> as<00:04:03.290> you<00:04:03.620> get

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
it's a platinum and then like as you get

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.960 
it's a platinum and then like as you get
lower<00:04:04.010> it<00:04:04.160> gets<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.459> little<00:04:04.610> darker<00:04:05.180> but

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
lower it gets a little darker but

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.340 
lower it gets a little darker but
hopefully<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.090> still<00:04:08.300> comes<00:04:08.510> out<00:04:08.690> okay<00:04:09.050> I'm

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
hopefully it still comes out okay I'm

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.010 
hopefully it still comes out okay I'm
just<00:04:09.910> you<00:04:10.910> know<00:04:10.940> hopefully<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:11.690> can<00:04:11.780> get<00:04:11.900> the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
just you know hopefully I can get the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.780 
just you know hopefully I can get the
blue<00:04:12.200> where<00:04:12.380> I<00:04:12.410> can<00:04:12.650> get<00:04:12.800> it<00:04:12.980> but<00:04:13.160> other<00:04:13.550> than

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
blue where I can get it but other than

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.280 
blue where I can get it but other than
that<00:04:13.850> I<00:04:14.000> was<00:04:14.209> afraid<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.660> take<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.870> up<00:04:15.050> any

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.580 
that I was afraid to take it up any
lighter

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
so I've rinsed it i shampooed it in this

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.830 
so I've rinsed it i shampooed it in this
area<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.250> I'm<00:04:19.430> getting<00:04:19.669> ready<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:20.090> apply<00:04:20.540> the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840
