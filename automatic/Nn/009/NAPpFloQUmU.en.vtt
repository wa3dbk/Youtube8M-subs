actually<00:02:44.620> getting<00:02:44.890> your<00:02:45.010> hands<00:02:45.280> dirty<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.850> in

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
actually getting your hands dirty and in

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
moving rocks around transplanting

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.949 
moving rocks around transplanting
vegetation<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.860> think<00:02:51.100> all<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.340> our

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
vegetation and I think all of our

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.600 
vegetation and I think all of our
volunteers<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.140> participants<00:02:53.800> in<00:02:54.459> our

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
volunteers and participants in our

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.180 
volunteers and participants in our
programs<00:02:55.120> particularly<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.739> earth<00:02:56.890> Corps

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
programs particularly the earth Corps

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.610 
programs particularly the earth Corps
program<00:02:57.640> they<00:02:58.300> come<00:02:58.540> away<00:02:58.660> with<00:02:58.989> them<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.470> think

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
program they come away with them I think

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.650 
program they come away with them I think
a<00:02:59.860> greater<00:03:00.100> understanding<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:01.000> appreciation

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
a greater understanding and appreciation

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.449 
a greater understanding and appreciation
of<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.890> these<00:03:03.160> environments<00:03:04.830> our<00:03:05.830> goal<00:03:06.100> in<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
of of these environments our goal in the

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.570 
of of these environments our goal in the
