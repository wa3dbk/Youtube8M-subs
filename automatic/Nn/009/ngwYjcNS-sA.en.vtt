00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
there's no tires on it for a reason

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.430 
there's no tires on it for a reason
there's<00:00:08.849> there<00:00:09.719> was<00:00:09.870> enough<00:00:10.080> clearance

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
there's there was enough clearance

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.120 
there's there was enough clearance
between<00:00:10.590> this<00:00:10.889> front<00:00:11.160> tire<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.389> motor

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
between this front tire and the motor

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.410 
between this front tire and the motor
like<00:00:14.130> you'd<00:00:14.429> turn<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.780> just<00:00:16.109> would<00:00:16.680> you

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
like you'd turn it and it just would you

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.320 
like you'd turn it and it just would you
know<00:00:18.420> catch<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.670> the<00:00:20.670> tire<00:00:20.910> was<00:00:21.119> about

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
know catch on that the tire was about

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.109 
know catch on that the tire was about
that<00:00:21.480> tall<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.289> oh<00:00:22.529> well<00:00:23.100> that's<00:00:23.880> what<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> had

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
that tall so oh well that's what I had

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.609 
that tall so oh well that's what I had
to<00:00:24.210> get<00:00:24.330> done<00:00:24.510> there's<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.050> tires<00:00:25.289> were<00:00:25.470> both

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
to get done there's the tires were both

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.980 
to get done there's the tires were both
flat<00:00:25.980> as<00:00:26.220> well<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.730> back<00:00:26.880> tire<00:00:27.119> was<00:00:27.330> flat<00:00:27.359> no

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
flat as well the back tire was flat no

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.990 
flat as well the back tire was flat no
tube<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.590> because<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.580> found<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.880> bicycle

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
tube in it because we found the bicycle

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.790 
tube in it because we found the bicycle
at<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> dump<00:00:30.660> right<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> whole<00:00:31.590> reason

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
at the dump right but the whole reason

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.650 
at the dump right but the whole reason
like<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.579> could<00:00:32.759> avoid<00:00:32.850> using<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.360> bicycle

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
like if I could avoid using this bicycle

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.530 
like if I could avoid using this bicycle
I<00:00:33.899> would<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.219> had<00:00:35.460> oversized<00:00:36.030> tubing

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
I would have but it had oversized tubing

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.330 
I would have but it had oversized tubing
right<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.050> was<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.410> perfect<00:00:37.770> bicycle

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
right so it was the perfect bicycle

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.799 
right so it was the perfect bicycle
because<00:00:39.090> he<00:00:39.360> was<00:00:39.480> built<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.989> tanky<00:00:40.399> that<00:00:41.399> I

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
because he was built so tanky that I

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.840 
because he was built so tanky that I
could<00:00:42.809> get<00:00:42.960> away<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.860> know<00:00:43.950> absolute

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
could get away with you know absolute

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.959 
could get away with you know absolute
 welds<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.969> that

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
 welds like this like that

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.760 
 welds like this like that
that's<00:00:48.149> that's<00:00:48.510> absolutely<00:00:49.050> disgusting<00:00:49.230> but

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
that's that's absolutely disgusting but

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.490 
that's that's absolutely disgusting but
it<00:00:50.100> holds<00:00:50.399> because<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.420> bicycle<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it holds because the bicycle was you

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.850 
it holds because the bicycle was you
know<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.829> thick<00:00:54.260> next<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.320> got<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.559> find<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
know so thick next you got to find a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.459 
know so thick next you got to find a
motor<00:00:56.039> somewhere<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:57.930> found

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
motor somewhere I just you know found

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.439 
motor somewhere I just you know found
one<00:00:58.710> off<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> roto<00:00:59.250> tiller<00:00:59.460> that<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
one off a roto tiller that was in the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.830 
one off a roto tiller that was in the
dump<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.910> it<00:01:02.910> was<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> pee<00:01:03.210> scrap<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.570> was<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
dump it it was a pee scrap it was in the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200 
dump it it was a pee scrap it was in the
dump<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> reason<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.890> didn't<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.970> like

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
dump for a reason it didn't really like

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.750 
dump for a reason it didn't really like
to<00:01:06.390> start<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.170> doesn't<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.100> run<00:01:08.340> when<00:01:08.670> you

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
to start it doesn't like to run when you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.840 
to start it doesn't like to run when you
give<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.000> gas<00:01:09.350> it<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.280> chokes<00:01:11.700> out

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
give it gas it just you know chokes out

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330 
give it gas it just you know chokes out
and<00:01:12.060> dies<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.380> course<00:01:13.560> at<00:01:13.770> random<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
and dies just of course at random I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.310 
and dies just of course at random I
can't<00:01:14.580> tune<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.000> because<00:01:15.390> most<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> time

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
can't tune it because most of the time

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.060 
can't tune it because most of the time
it<00:01:16.530> works<00:01:16.729> but<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:19.470> next<00:01:19.710> step<00:01:19.860> would

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
it works but the next step would

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.030 
it works but the next step would
probably<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.700> too<00:01:21.350> stupid<00:01:22.350> shadows<00:01:22.799> getting

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
probably be too stupid shadows getting

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.890 
probably be too stupid shadows getting
in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.189> way<00:01:23.280> I'm<00:01:23.400> sorry<00:01:23.549> about<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.790> guys<00:01:24.090> is

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
to take off the pedals now go from this

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.310 
to take off the pedals now go from this
side<00:01:26.759> because<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.390> side<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.869> didn't<00:01:28.170> actually

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
side because this side I didn't actually

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.080 
side because this side I didn't actually
take<00:01:28.560> off<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.710> pedal<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.520> grinded

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.700 
take off the pedal I just I just grinded
it<00:01:30.180> because<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.659> much<00:01:30.780> easier<00:01:31.110> what

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it because it was that much easier what

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.020 
it because it was that much easier what
you<00:01:31.799> got<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.220> there's<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.579> little<00:01:32.759> cap

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you got to do is there's this little cap

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.600 
you got to do is there's this little cap
there<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.890> know<00:01:34.979> take<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> little<00:01:35.460> tool

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
there the you know take a little tool

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.880 
there the you know take a little tool
and<00:01:35.700> pop<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:35.939> off<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:37.439> once<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.740> get

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
and pop that off and then once you get

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.609 
and pop that off and then once you get
under<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.110> try<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.320> doing<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
under there you can try and doing the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.620 
under there you can try and doing the
bolt<00:01:40.829> whatever<00:01:41.189> else<00:01:41.400> even<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.360> take<00:01:42.509> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
bolt whatever else even if you take that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.480 
bolt whatever else even if you take that
bolt<00:01:42.869> off<00:01:43.020> nothing<00:01:43.439> nothing<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.189> helps

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
bolt off nothing nothing really helps

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.649 
bolt off nothing nothing really helps
what<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.640> got<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> do<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.090> got<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.240> take<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
what you got to do is you got to take a

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.710 
what you got to do is you got to take a
grinder<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.259> grind<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.939> that<00:01:47.939> until<00:01:48.600> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
grinder and grind like that until you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
grinder and grind like that until you
reach<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.140> bolt<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.670> then<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:51.380> take<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.439> pry

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
reach the bolt and then like take a pry

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.039 
reach the bolt and then like take a pry
bar<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:53.009> some<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.520> pry<00:01:53.909> up<00:01:54.210> against<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.840> and

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
bar or some and pry up against that and

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.190 
bar or some and pry up against that and
the<00:01:55.500> pedal<00:01:55.770> will<00:01:55.950> eventually<00:01:56.310> come<00:01:56.490> off<00:01:56.520> that

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
the pedal will eventually come off that

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.780 
the pedal will eventually come off that
was<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> pain<00:01:58.439> man<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.070> grind<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> off

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
was a pain man so so I just grind it off

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.499 
was a pain man so so I just grind it off
on<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.090> side<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:01.969> once<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.360> this

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
on that side and once you can get this

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.560 
on that side and once you can get this
pulley<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.110> side<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:05.119> works<00:02:06.119> perfectly

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
pulley on this side it works perfectly

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.589 
pulley on this side it works perfectly
like<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.140> lock<00:02:07.439> bolt<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.149> locks

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
like the lock bolt on there just locks

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.940 
like the lock bolt on there just locks
right<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> three<00:02:10.530> quarter<00:02:10.920> inch

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
right on this is a three quarter inch

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.650 
right on this is a three quarter inch
shaft<00:02:11.690> everything<00:02:12.690> seems<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.989> work

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
shaft everything seems to work

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.710 
shaft everything seems to work
I I<00:02:14.050> couldn't<00:02:14.410> be<00:02:14.470> happier<00:02:14.800> with<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:14.920> but<00:02:15.790> if

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
I I couldn't be happier with that but if

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.780 
I I couldn't be happier with that but if
you<00:02:16.900> can<00:02:17.050> find<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.380> bigger<00:02:17.590> pulley<00:02:17.890> did<00:02:18.460> you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
you can find a bigger pulley did you

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.270 
you can find a bigger pulley did you
know<00:02:18.880> definitely<00:02:19.150> do<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.320> about<00:02:20.500> what

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
know definitely do so this is about what

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.580 
know definitely do so this is about what
ish<00:02:21.550> across<00:02:22.000> if<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.990> could<00:02:23.140> get<00:02:23.230> away<00:02:23.320> with<00:02:23.500> it

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
ish across if you could get away with it

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.750 
ish across if you could get away with it
maybe<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:23.830> have<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.010> taller<00:02:24.250> bicycle<00:02:24.700> or

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
maybe you have a taller bicycle or

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.970 
maybe you have a taller bicycle or
something<00:02:24.870> does<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.020> almost<00:02:26.530> touches<00:02:26.920> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
something does this almost touches the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.250 
something does this almost touches the
ground<00:02:27.160> right<00:02:27.430> now<00:02:27.630> but<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.750> can't<00:02:28.900> even<00:02:29.080> use

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
ground right now but you can't even use

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.990 
ground right now but you can't even use
like<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.410> bicycle<00:02:29.950> tire<00:02:30.100> as<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> pulley<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.820> never

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
like a bicycle tire as a pulley I never

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.160 
like a bicycle tire as a pulley I never
even<00:02:31.120> thought<00:02:31.300> about<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.660> but<00:02:31.810> yeah<00:02:31.960> that's

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
even thought about that but yeah that's

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.290 
even thought about that but yeah that's
a<00:02:32.230> great<00:02:32.320> idea<00:02:32.410> if<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.490> can<00:02:33.610> find<00:02:33.790> some<00:02:34.120> way<00:02:34.270> to

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
a great idea if you can find some way to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.080 
a great idea if you can find some way to
mount<00:02:34.660> that<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:36.220> would<00:02:36.340> work<00:02:36.490> really<00:02:36.700> slick

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
mount that that would work really slick

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.510 
mount that that would work really slick
and<00:02:37.510> then<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.530> got<00:02:38.710> to<00:02:38.800> find<00:02:38.950> something<00:02:39.250> just

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
and then you got to find something just

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.760 
and then you got to find something just
you<00:02:39.850> know<00:02:39.970> whatever<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.660> got<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.050> absolute

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
you know whatever you got this absolute

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.170 
you know whatever you got this absolute
smallest<00:02:42.010> thing<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.400> have<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.820> is<00:02:43.000> about

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
smallest thing you have this is about

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.430 
smallest thing you have this is about
two<00:02:43.600> ish<00:02:44.290> inches<00:02:44.890> across<00:02:45.300> typical<00:02:46.300> 5/8<00:02:46.720> big

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
two ish inches across typical 5/8 big

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.980 
two ish inches across typical 5/8 big
shaft<00:02:47.710> it's<00:02:48.160> got<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.490> key<00:02:48.820> on<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.240> you<00:02:49.870> know

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
shaft it's got the key on it you know

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.890 
shaft it's got the key on it you know
typical<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:53.380> make<00:02:53.530> this<00:02:53.710> motor<00:02:53.980> mount

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
typical and to make this motor mount

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.750 
typical and to make this motor mount
what<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:55.930> did<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.830> know<00:02:56.950> for<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.250> motor<00:02:57.430> this

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
what I did you know for the motor this

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.020 
what I did you know for the motor this
took<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:01.650> piece<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.680> metal<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.280> just<00:03:03.550> bend<00:03:03.910> it

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
took a piece of metal and just bend it

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.970 
took a piece of metal and just bend it
around<00:03:04.390> there<00:03:04.870> like<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.350> then<00:03:05.680> took<00:03:05.860> a

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
around there like that and then took a

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.810 
around there like that and then took a
plate<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:07.500> welded<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.590> onto<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.950> bicycle<00:03:09.070> now

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
plate and welded it onto the bicycle now

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.460 
plate and welded it onto the bicycle now
the<00:03:10.120> reason<00:03:10.390> why<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.510> can<00:03:10.840> get<00:03:10.960> away<00:03:11.080> with<00:03:11.350> those

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
the reason why I can get away with those

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.940 
the reason why I can get away with those
crappy<00:03:11.740> welds<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.460> cuz<00:03:13.110> it's<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.320> thick<00:03:14.770> ass

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
crappy welds is cuz it's a thick ass

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.610 
crappy welds is cuz it's a thick ass
bicycle<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:16.000> then<00:03:16.930> what<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.170> did<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.380> I<00:03:17.590> just

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
bicycle and then what I did is I just

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.010 
bicycle and then what I did is I just
you<00:03:18.610> know<00:03:18.640> welded<00:03:19.240> on<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:19.630> course<00:03:19.690> you'll<00:03:19.990> be

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
you know welded on of course you'll be

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.660 
you know welded on of course you'll be
grinding<00:03:20.590> down<00:03:20.740> on<00:03:20.860> this<00:03:20.980> bicycle<00:03:21.220> this<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.490> a

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
grinding down on this bicycle this is a

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.780 
grinding down on this bicycle this is a
tip<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:22.300> I<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:22.959> know<00:03:23.080> seem<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.740> notice<00:03:23.890> that

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
tip that I you know seem to notice that

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.330 
tip that I you know seem to notice that
I<00:03:24.820> should<00:03:25.180> give<00:03:25.330> you<00:03:25.360> guys<00:03:26.100> when<00:03:27.100> you're

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
I should give you guys when you're

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.470 
I should give you guys when you're
grinding<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.820> down<00:03:27.850> you're<00:03:28.150> never<00:03:28.209> going<00:03:28.450> to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
grinding it down you're never going to

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.850 
grinding it down you're never going to
get<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:28.630> flat<00:03:28.840> G<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.320> have<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.560> go<00:03:29.650> through<00:03:29.800> a

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
get a flat G to have to go through a

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.320 
get a flat G to have to go through a
whole<00:03:30.070> grinding<00:03:30.550> desk<00:03:30.730> before<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.030> do<00:03:31.150> that

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
whole grinding desk before you do that

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.360 
whole grinding desk before you do that
so<00:03:31.570> what<00:03:32.110> I<00:03:32.140> did<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.410> just<00:03:32.440> took<00:03:32.620> an<00:03:32.770> old<00:03:32.860> farmers

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
so what I did I just took an old farmers

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.820 
so what I did I just took an old farmers
trick<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:34.200> stacked<00:03:35.200> up<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.440> whole<00:03:35.560> bunch<00:03:35.680> of

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
trick and I stacked up a whole bunch of

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.980 
trick and I stacked up a whole bunch of
washers<00:03:36.370> in<00:03:36.550> one<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:36.910> spaces<00:03:37.240> and<00:03:37.630> just

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
washers in one of the spaces and just

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.020 
washers in one of the spaces and just
you<00:03:38.170> know<00:03:38.200> welded<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.770> there<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.070> was<00:03:39.190> fine<00:03:39.459> it

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
you know welded it there it was fine it

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.100 
you know welded it there it was fine it
seems<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.720> hold<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.680> I'm<00:03:41.920> not<00:03:42.130> complaining<00:03:43.110> and

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
seems to hold so I'm not complaining and

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.540 
seems to hold so I'm not complaining and
then<00:03:44.230> once<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.470> got<00:03:44.590> all<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.830> together<00:03:45.010> you

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
then once you got all that together you

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.860 
then once you got all that together you
can<00:03:45.700> throw<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.030> belt<00:03:46.239> on<00:03:46.390> there<00:03:46.570> fun<00:03:46.750> when

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
can throw a belt on there fun when

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.240 
can throw a belt on there fun when
that's<00:03:46.989> about<00:03:47.110> an<00:03:47.230> approximate<00:03:47.739> size<00:03:47.950> that's

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
that's about an approximate size that's

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.220 
that's about an approximate size that's
you<00:03:48.640> know<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.970> lot<00:03:49.750> too<00:03:50.110> big<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.650> then<00:03:51.930> take<00:03:52.930> a

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
you know a lot too big and then take a

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.900 
you know a lot too big and then take a
pulley<00:03:53.680> with<00:03:53.920> a<00:03:53.950> bearing<00:03:54.400> on<00:03:54.520> it<00:03:54.580> doesn't

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
pulley with a bearing on it doesn't

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.790 
pulley with a bearing on it doesn't
matter<00:03:55.209> what<00:03:55.450> size<00:03:55.690> just<00:03:55.989> you<00:03:56.380> know<00:03:56.500> then<00:03:56.680> that

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
matter what size just you know then that

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.110 
matter what size just you know then that
affects<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.280> size<00:03:57.459> of<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:57.610> bolt<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:57.850> have<00:03:58.000> to

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
affects the size of the bolt you have to

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.740 
affects the size of the bolt you have to
stick<00:03:58.270> through<00:03:58.420> there<00:03:59.489> bolt<00:04:00.489> on<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.910> bar<00:04:01.390> onto

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
stick through there bolt on a bar onto

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.150 
stick through there bolt on a bar onto
the<00:04:02.320> bicycle<00:04:02.770> frame<00:04:03.280> about<00:04:04.530> about<00:04:05.530> you<00:04:06.040> know

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
the bicycle frame about about you know

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.310 
the bicycle frame about about you know
there<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.700> then<00:04:07.680> drill<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.709> hole<00:04:09.040> in<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.430> bar

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
there and then drill a hole in the bar

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.140 
there and then drill a hole in the bar
for<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.890> pulley<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:14.610> you<00:04:15.610> can<00:04:15.760> have<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:15.910> clutch

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
for the pulley and you can have a clutch

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.720 
for the pulley and you can have a clutch
like<00:04:16.359> that<00:04:16.540> a<00:04:16.570> do<00:04:17.350> that<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:17.770> it<00:04:17.830> idles<00:04:18.549> I

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
like that a do that and it idles I

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.250 
like that a do that and it idles I
wouldn't<00:04:19.330> recommend<00:04:19.419> having<00:04:19.690> that<00:04:19.900> spring<00:04:20.169> on

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
wouldn't recommend having that spring on

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.510 
wouldn't recommend having that spring on
there<00:04:20.350> I<00:04:20.380> tried<00:04:20.709> to<00:04:20.830> do<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:21.070> so<00:04:21.190> that<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:21.430> could

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
there I tried to do it so that you could

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.969 
there I tried to do it so that you could
go<00:04:21.669> hands-free<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.600> you<00:04:22.690> actually<00:04:23.260> have<00:04:23.620> two

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
go hands-free and you actually have two

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.690 
go hands-free and you actually have two
hands<00:04:24.310> on<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.490> bicycle<00:04:24.910> but<00:04:25.750> that's<00:04:26.320> just

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
hands on the bicycle but that's just

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.220 
hands on the bicycle but that's just
work<00:04:26.880> so<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.330> guess<00:04:27.570> it's<00:04:27.720> stayin<00:04:27.900> like<00:04:28.080> that

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
work so I guess it's stayin like that

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.070 
work so I guess it's stayin like that
and<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:31.050> know<00:04:31.760> this<00:04:32.760> does<00:04:33.240> not<00:04:33.420> have<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.990> be

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
and you know this does not have to be

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.540 
and you know this does not have to be
straight<00:04:34.320> it's<00:04:34.620> always<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:35.160> know<00:04:35.190> people<00:04:35.490> are

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
straight it's always you know people are

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.740 
straight it's always you know people are
always<00:04:35.640> saying<00:04:35.790> like<00:04:36.000> oh<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.090> had<00:04:36.420> a<00:04:36.450> hard<00:04:36.690> time

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
crap by the way anyways I took this

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.130 
crap by the way anyways I took this
motor<00:05:26.940> and<00:05:27.120> when<00:05:27.480> I<00:05:27.510> was<00:05:27.660> mounting<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.050> I

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
motor and when I was mounting it I

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.020 
motor and when I was mounting it I
didn't<00:05:28.380> really<00:05:28.530> consider<00:05:28.730> that<00:05:29.730> it<00:05:29.820> was<00:05:29.910> going

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
didn't really consider that it was going

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.390 
didn't really consider that it was going
to<00:05:30.090> weigh<00:05:30.270> down<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.480> side<00:05:30.810> so<00:05:31.080> much<00:05:31.290> so<00:05:31.560> when

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
to weigh down the side so much so when

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.030 
to weigh down the side so much so when
you're<00:05:32.520> riding<00:05:32.670> it<00:05:32.970> you're<00:05:33.150> riding<00:05:33.480> it<00:05:33.630> like

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
sideways trying to keep her balanced and

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.290 
sideways trying to keep her balanced and
it's<00:05:37.650> just<00:05:37.920> it's<00:05:38.250> just<00:05:38.460> awful<00:05:38.760> especially<00:05:38.910> cuz

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
it's just it's just awful especially cuz

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.490 
it's just it's just awful especially cuz
you're<00:05:39.390> riding<00:05:39.600> with<00:05:39.720> one<00:05:39.930> hand<00:05:40.200> from<00:05:40.380> the

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500

spent $0 on it will eventually be that

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.660 
spent $0 on it will eventually be that
giant<00:06:29.910> wrap<00:06:30.120> over<00:06:30.480> there<00:06:30.630> so<00:06:30.960> uh<00:06:31.370> stay<00:06:32.370> tuned
