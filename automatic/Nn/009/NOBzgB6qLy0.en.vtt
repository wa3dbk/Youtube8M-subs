00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello dear friends today we are with 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.130
 you make an apple pie and 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.420
 dried apricots 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.219
 for this we need to hide 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.230
 ingredients they are also described in the article 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:21.449
 first of all we breed yeast 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:25.070
 then warm milk then cream 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.519
 oil is melted to a liquid state 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.769
 we introduce our future sugar dough eggs 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.840
 salt and add vegetable oil all 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.030
 on prescription 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.489
 mix everything well and pour in 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.350
 our melted yeast 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.350
 once again how to mix 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.350
 sift 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.630
 and start entering our dough all at once 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.890
 not sun and go follow the slope 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:02.150
 dough then translate our dough to 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.150
 flat work surface 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.370
 and there it is already kneaded to the desired 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.410
 consistency 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.750
 but preferably soft 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.870
 then also a little bowl of a little maiden or 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.600
 in the other we cover with vegetable oil 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:23.180
 put our dough close the food 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.830
 film and in this state is sent to 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.650
 refrigerator for an hour or a half 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.270
 in the meantime, let 's do some stuffing . 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.600
 dried apricots which is also pre 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.410
 poured hot water she became soft 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:41.530
 fresh apples I have added jam 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:43.610
 apple here our dough came up 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.420
 we divide it into two parts one 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.920
 a cake base that will serve 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.310
 roll out neatly put in 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.310
 form 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.720
 excess dough then cut then even 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.479
 we lay out the filling with the second plastic 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.520
 Cover with a diameter which is smaller 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.650
 our stuffing and pinch edges 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.300
 but if a little bit just did not work 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.420
 nothing terrible in such a pigtail we 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.690
 we shall make him beautiful when baked 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.180
 will be very cute when our cake 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.239
 a little bit we came up he smeared his testicle 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.870
 we sent to the oven for about 20 minutes 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.930
 to make the cake baked readiness check 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.930
 toothpick 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.370
 if nothing years toothpicks mean 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.140
 all the dough is cooked 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.990
 when a little cake pats cool 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.850
 in such a simple way we take it out 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:46.290
