sites in your disk is on times three

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.500 
sites in your disk is on times three
then<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:06.930> get<00:05:07.110> nine<00:05:07.380> points<00:05:07.860> all<00:05:08.610> disks<00:05:09.300> go

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
then you get nine points all disks go

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.290 
then you get nine points all disks go
back<00:05:09.690> to<00:05:09.900> zero<00:05:10.170> after<00:05:10.470> a<00:05:10.680> flood<00:05:10.980> this<00:05:11.820> ends<00:05:12.240> our
