00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.510
 hello girls today I bring you one more idea 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.840
 for your halloween costume I hope 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.840
 I wish you like it 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.360
 The first thing we are going to do is apply 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.189
 the base on the face we will moisturize 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.950
 well the skin and then we will give the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.039
 basis that we normally use the 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.450
 sponge a little we're going to apply it to 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.450
 all part of the face 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.880
 to touches and circulitos 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.019
 the ears that we do not forget and 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.410
 Apply a cream shadow all over the 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:45.920
 mobile eyelid I take it with my finger 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.920
 Y 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.960
 sometimes I understand you to touch now I'm going to 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:57.589
 catch some pigment and I'll 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.180
 apply to fix the shadow in cream 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:05.330
 always with a little bit of the lid 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.670
 here applied a bit so you do not believe 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.280
 the offer already touches we are going to 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.610
 applying it now let's mark our 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.440
 eyeliner with the bevelled brush and a 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.729
 gel eyeliner 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.090
 before using we have our 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.090
 tabs 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.170
 and now we mark our eyeliner 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.640
 Now with the same brush of the eyeliner 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:46.549
 let's mark a line making the eye 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.630
 from the bottom to our the 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.570
 line 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.789
 now with a white eye pencil we're going 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.299
 to fill all the space that we have 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.299
 left 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.289
 once we have the shape of the eyes 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.230
 let's do some eyelashes in the part 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.460
 below we mark the tabs nava a 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.460
 little in curve 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.400
 A) Yes 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.400
 more chiquititas 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.470
 let's apply a cream blusher 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:44.520
 we take a little 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:48.020
 and we deposit as always we smile 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.020
 and a circle 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.590
 here 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.569
 we give some small 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.620
 we profile our lip in the color that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.620
 we want to get 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.730
 if not from above 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.400
 important that it be redondito in the 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.400
 doll 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.820
 we fill a well 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.870
 we will paint the lower lip 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.870
 whole white 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:37.110
 more with the bevelled brush 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.110
 we plan and we will make a mesh 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.980
 up here 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.800
 let's join them 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.630
 let's lengthen a little bit more here 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:12.720
 in this hole and we're going to paint it whole 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:16.070
 of white and we will mark the teeth 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.070
 with the same missionary 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.150
 he saw me too 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.710
 with a fatty makeup we are going to fill 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.700
 the gap we have left respecting the 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.700
 lines that we have marked 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.570
 getting well the gap here 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:08.850
 now with the red pencil we are going to mark 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.850
 in the guide below 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.150
 before applying the false eyelash 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.510
 let's give level 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:28.640
 in the tabs we're going to apply our 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.640
 eyelash we take the glue 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.159
 and we apply it 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.159
 in the tab 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.160
 we wait about 20 seconds 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.670
 so that to see better 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.780
 and we stick it 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:50.460
 we already have the two tabs attached 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.380
 so now let's go over the 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.660
 eyeliner so that it stays well in the 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.080
 lacrimal and elongate it a little more 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.080
 the eye 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.289
 and the lacrimal remember that a little 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.240
 inside 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.050
 so that it fits well and integrate the 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.030
 eyelash 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.370
 the eye when putting the eyelash that 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.639
 correct it a little bit so we're going to 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:22.930
 back to catch the pigment with the brush 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:25.300
 we take and deposit in the hand and here 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.630
 in the corner 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:32.370
 let's apply and let's go up a bit 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.370
 let's mark the eyebrows 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.419
 round as simulating is on a doll 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.550
 welcome by the base of my eyebrow 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.370
 and now the semicircle 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:55.289
 good demands we already have our 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.749
