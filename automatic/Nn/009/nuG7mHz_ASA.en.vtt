00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
as well when I'm running with him this

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.680 
as well when I'm running with him this
guy<00:00:40.379> seems<00:00:40.649> way<00:00:41.010> more<00:00:41.250> faster<00:00:41.489> also<00:00:42.360> he's

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
guy seems way more faster also he's

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
guy seems way more faster also he's
dribbling<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.379> his<00:00:43.620> face<00:00:43.800> cos<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.309> doesn't

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
dribbling on his face cos that doesn't

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.190 
dribbling on his face cos that doesn't
seem<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.059> great<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.539> when<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.750> play<00:00:45.960> him<00:00:46.110> in

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
seem that great but when you play him in

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900 
seem that great but when you play him in
game<00:00:46.440> there's<00:00:47.010> no<00:00:47.190> problem<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.670> his

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
game there's no problem with his

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.190 
game there's no problem with his
dribbling<00:00:48.239> maybe<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:48.899> he<00:00:49.020> has

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
dribbling maybe it's because he has

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.430 
dribbling maybe it's because he has
pretty<00:00:49.680> high<00:00:49.890> agility<00:00:50.039> things<00:00:50.960> 86<00:00:51.960> which<00:00:52.230> is

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
pretty high agility things 86 which is

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.950 
pretty high agility things 86 which is
very<00:00:52.800> very<00:00:53.039> high<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:54.090> think<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.750> why<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
very very high I think that is why I

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.630 
very very high I think that is why I
find<00:00:55.350> his<00:00:55.500> dribbling<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.980> lot<00:00:56.219> better<00:00:56.460> than

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
it it's still in the circle in

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.859 
it it's still in the circle in
midfield<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.460> how<00:01:47.670> stupid<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.360> was<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
midfield that is how stupid it was and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.620 
midfield that is how stupid it was and
the<00:01:49.320> goalkeeper<00:01:49.729> couldn't<00:01:50.729> save<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.270> also

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
there was a long shot that was

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.030 
there was a long shot that was
travelling<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.090> slow<00:01:54.509> da<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.409> think<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.920> was

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040

the<00:02:27.840> goal<00:02:28.020> was<00:02:28.170> basically<00:02:28.200> open<00:02:29.130> that's<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
the goal was basically open that's the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.190 
the goal was basically open that's the
only<00:02:29.700> time<00:02:29.880> he's<00:02:30.030> called<00:02:30.210> me<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> header<00:02:30.600> but<00:02:31.140> I

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
only time he's called me a header but I

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.690 
only time he's called me a header but I
have<00:02:31.350> crossed<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.710> couple<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.130> times<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.550> him

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700

have crossed a couple of times to him
and<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:33.570> don't<00:02:33.630> think<00:02:33.870> he<00:02:34.140> won<00:02:34.320> me<00:02:34.470> even<00:02:34.950> one

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
and I don't think he won me even one

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.210 
and I don't think he won me even one
header<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:36.780> defenders<00:02:37.440> coming<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.070> him

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
and they're trying to had had their way

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.900 
and they're trying to had had their way
they<00:02:40.050> will<00:02:40.200> win<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.710> most<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.130> time<00:02:41.400> but

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
they will win it to most of the time but

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.820 
they will win it to most of the time but
when<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.540> comes<00:02:42.720> down<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.140> him<00:02:43.650> by

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
when it comes down to just him by

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.350 
when it comes down to just him by
himself<00:02:43.980> with<00:02:44.340> no<00:02:44.490> pressure<00:02:44.730> he<00:02:45.210> will

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360
