 and let's talk about what it is to the 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.489
 quality the quality is fine so 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.559
 it's more however do not expect that you're 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.250
 buying nothing like to say a few bits 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.720
 in the hearing aids are all plastic 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.269
 everything we see here around is 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.440
 plastics even though this seems 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.970
 metal is not metal is plastic has what 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.949
 that are like a kind of screws in 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.829
 the back but they are false they are not 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.320
 they are real screws but despite 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.929
 everything as he mentioned them for the price of 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.550
 $ 35 looks great and they feel 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.670
 well even though they are not high 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.620
 quality as to what the head is 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.679
 band that is called we have what is the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.900
 name of being paint on the part of 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:10.960
 above 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.260
 and it's very very comfortable very nice what 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.110
 which is bread quite soft as you see in 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.410
 the inside has a pillow 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.770
 pretty soft pretty nice like 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.550
 they realize the hearing aids can be 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.450
 change size depending on 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.000
 whatever is comfortable for each person 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.970
 as for what is the pillow with 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.240
 the speakers also the pillow is 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.070
 pretty soft pretty comfortable one thing 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.490
 which I would mention is one of the complaints 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.560
 I have the pillow is not very big 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.600
 a totally round size 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.030
 Personally, I prefer the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.329
 pillows that are more oval than you 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.520
 cover the ear after one hour or 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:00.009
 two hours with the headphones on me 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.750
 for my size I have to remove it 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.270
 for a while because I feel that more than 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.569
 pressure but out of that 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.890

 cable to listen to the hearing aids with 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.799

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.999
 listening 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.469
 I think friends that with that I mention 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:15.189
 all the most important of these 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.889
 headphones 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:20.440
 one last thing to mention as soon as 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.509
 they are offered in different colors 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.479
 colors of course this is the color 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:27.669
 black how do they realize they have color 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.560
 white have red color and have a 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.169
 color blue 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.720
 and I'm going to put the headphones so that 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.780
 you see how they look like good 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.010
 I have them expanded 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:44.360
 to my liking and the side where are the 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.360
 controls would be the right side 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.560
 that's what hearing aids look like when 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.030
 are set I'm going to turn around to 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.030
 that you see first the right side 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.930
 and now we turn around so that 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.930
 see the left side 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.870
 now I show you what is the part of 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.870
 above 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.800
 it's one thing that I like is that there's 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.970
 so much space here among which is the 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.710
 head band and what's in the head that 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.740
 like that there is not as much space as 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.110
 they realize what the horn or the 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.360
 cops who call you are not overly 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.520
 big 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.099
 so friends final conclusions you 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.490
 I recommend the blur I turbay 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:40.479
 robbie keane bluetooh wireless what 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.909
 I recommend 100% for 35 dollars 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:46.210
 I have these hearing aids right now 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:48.169
 an average of about 3 weeks and although 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.370
 believe it or not 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:54.949
 I used the hearing aids all day long 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:59.990
 four or five days without having to load 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:03.729
 the battery lasts a lot and the quality 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.990
 of the music is amazing for $ 35 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.729
 so friends thank you for the video your 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.180
