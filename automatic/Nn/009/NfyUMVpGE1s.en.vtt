very good job
you<00:03:34.579> will<00:03:34.730> need<00:03:34.880> video<00:03:35.209> transmitters<00:03:35.930> I'm

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
you will need video transmitters I'm

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.890 
you will need video transmitters I'm
using<00:03:36.950> 1.2<00:03:37.700> G<00:03:37.940> 1.3<00:03:38.870> G<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:39.319> 5.8<00:03:40.010> GS<00:03:40.340> reference

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
using 1.2 G 1.3 G and 5.8 GS reference

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.170 
using 1.2 G 1.3 G and 5.8 GS reference
1.3<00:03:41.900> G<00:03:42.079> and<00:03:42.319> 1.2<00:03:42.769> G<00:03:43.040> are<00:03:43.220> best<00:03:43.519> because<00:03:43.850> they

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
1.3 G and 1.2 G are best because they

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.900 
1.3 G and 1.2 G are best because they
are<00:03:44.299> less<00:03:44.630> interfered<00:03:45.410> frequencies<00:03:46.160> and<00:03:46.400> they

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
are less interfered frequencies and they

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.900 
are less interfered frequencies and they
have<00:03:47.060> better<00:03:47.299> range<00:03:47.569> as<00:03:47.870> well<00:03:48.100> 5.8<00:03:49.100> G<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.579> good

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
have better range as well 5.8 G is good

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.140 
have better range as well 5.8 G is good
for<00:03:50.180> those<00:03:51.049> people<00:03:51.470> who<00:03:51.590> are<00:03:51.680> going<00:03:51.829> to<00:03:51.950> use

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
for those people who are going to use

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.569 
for those people who are going to use
2.4<00:03:53.150> G<00:03:53.450> radios<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.620> control<00:03:54.950> their<00:03:55.100> airplanes

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
2.4 G radios to control their airplanes

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.789

but<00:03:56.150> again<00:03:56.420> this<00:03:56.780> frequency<00:03:57.350> is<00:03:57.440> very

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
but again this frequency is very

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.030 
but again this frequency is very
cluttered<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.579> easily<00:03:59.510> observe<00:04:00.470> ected<00:04:00.920> by

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
cluttered and easily observe ected by

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.819 
cluttered and easily observe ected by
the<00:04:01.100> obstacles<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:02.030> before<00:04:02.870> we<00:04:03.139> move<00:04:03.170> on<00:04:03.500> one

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
the obstacles so before we move on one

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.559 
the obstacles so before we move on one
thing<00:04:04.040> very<00:04:04.370> very<00:04:04.579> important<00:04:05.060> when<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.389> buy
