Falls<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.079> me<00:01:46.110> eight<00:01:46.619> minutes<00:01:46.920> into<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> game

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
that just went wide I actually thought I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.819

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
thought that one dipped just right over

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.910 
thought that one dipped just right over
two<00:01:54.840> keepers<00:01:55.140> head<00:01:55.320> into<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> back<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.770> the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
there'll be a while I was pretty sure he

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.870

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
would sit me for a few games and then I

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.310 
would sit me for a few games and then I
would<00:04:13.030> finally<00:04:13.270> get<00:04:13.510> my<00:04:13.600> chance<00:04:13.900> but<00:04:13.960> as<00:04:14.140> long

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320
