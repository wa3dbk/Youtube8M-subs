Mijares is the number one contender and

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.529 
Mijares is the number one contender and
most<00:00:51.059> likely<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.690> WBC<00:00:52.199> might<00:00:53.420> order<00:00:54.420> this

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
most likely the WBC might order this

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.360 
most likely the WBC might order this
fight<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.960> make<00:00:55.140> christian<00:00:55.559> maharaj<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
fight and make christian maharaj the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.919 
fight and make christian maharaj the
mandatory<00:00:56.730> challenger<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> good

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
mandatory challenger so this is a good

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.779 
mandatory challenger so this is a good
chance<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.469> might<00:00:58.620> satisfy<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.309> 2014

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
chance that we might satisfy it in 2014

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.419 
chance that we might satisfy it in 2014
it<00:01:00.480> could<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.809> early<00:01:01.140> 2014<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.890> could<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.190> late

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
it could be early 2014 it could be late

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.280 
it could be early 2014 it could be late
2014<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.149> could<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> middle<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.899> 2014
