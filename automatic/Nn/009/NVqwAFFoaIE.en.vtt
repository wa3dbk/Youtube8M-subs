today is a cool little feature that I
found<00:00:11.969> out<00:00:12.179> about<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.570> machine<00:00:12.960> here<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
found out about this machine here a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.150 
found out about this machine here a
couple<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:13.980> minutes<00:00:14.250> ago<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:15.260> that<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.619> that

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
couple of minutes ago and that is that

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.970 
couple of minutes ago and that is that
this<00:00:17.490> machine<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.910> backwards<00:00:18.779> compatible<00:00:18.980> now

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
this machine is backwards compatible now

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800 
this machine is backwards compatible now
for<00:00:20.369> those<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.760> who<00:00:20.970> don't<00:00:21.150> know<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.510> what

for those of you who don't know of what
backwards<00:00:22.529> compatible<00:00:23.010> means<00:00:23.220> basically

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
backwards compatible means basically

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.890 
backwards compatible means basically
what<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.090> means<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:25.410> has<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.099> ability<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
what it means is it has the ability to

previous<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.430> machine<00:00:32.850> being<00:00:33.030> made<00:00:33.390> as

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
previous to this machine being made as

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.620 
previous to this machine being made as
well<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.320> games<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.890> were<00:00:35.059> made<00:00:36.059> especially

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.910 
read the regular Master System games
it'll<00:01:04.290> also<00:01:04.769> read<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> mark<00:01:05.369> 3<00:01:05.820> games<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.920> on

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it'll also read the mark 3 games and on

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.390 
it'll also read the mark 3 games and on
top<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.869> an<00:01:09.990> SG<00:01:10.500> 1000

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
top of that this one here is an SG 1000

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.350 
top of that this one here is an SG 1000
or<00:01:11.900> SG<00:01:12.900> 3000<00:01:13.770> cartridge<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.030> will<00:01:15.150> also

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
read this so it'll read all three of

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.760 
read this so it'll read all three of
them<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.310> yeah<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.640> completely<00:01:21.060> shocked<00:01:21.479> me

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
them and yeah just completely shocked me

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.760 
them and yeah just completely shocked me
because<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.220> know<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.479> from<00:01:25.350> playing<00:01:25.619> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
because I know that from playing it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.910 
because I know that from playing it
before<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.490> know<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.150> it'll<00:01:27.330> play<00:01:27.600> The<00:01:28.530> Master

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
before I know that it'll play The Master

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.910 
before I know that it'll play The Master
System<00:01:29.100> or<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> Master<00:01:29.909> System<00:01:30.060> marked<00:01:30.509> three

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
System or the Master System marked three

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.960 
System or the Master System marked three
cartridges<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.250> knew<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.670> would<00:01:32.759> play

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
cartridges and I knew that it would play

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.679 
cartridges and I knew that it would play
the<00:01:33.150> mark<00:01:33.329> 3<00:01:33.630> only<00:01:34.340> cartridges<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.240> had<00:01:36.479> no

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the mark 3 only cartridges but I had no

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.100 
the mark 3 only cartridges but I had no
idea<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:38.369> would<00:01:38.520> play<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.990> sg-1000<00:01:39.990> or

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
idea that it would play the sg-1000 or

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.850 
idea that it would play the sg-1000 or
3,000<00:01:40.770> cards<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:42.110> it's<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.259> nice<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.530> know

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
3,000 cards so it's really nice to know

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.300 
3,000 cards so it's really nice to know
because<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.790> an<00:01:44.909> SG<00:01:45.240> 1002<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.409> if

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
because I do have an SG 1002 but if

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.770 
because I do have an SG 1002 but if
anything<00:01:47.640> were<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.939> ever<00:01:48.090> happen<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.570> that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
anything were to ever happen to that

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.830 
anything were to ever happen to that
then<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.880> finding<00:01:51.180> another<00:01:51.540> machine

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
then I think finding another machine

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.530 
then I think finding another machine
would<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:52.890> pretty<00:01:53.130> difficult<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:54.240> knowing

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
would be pretty difficult but knowing

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.350 
would be pretty difficult but knowing
that<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.930> Master<00:01:55.619> System<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:56.280> also<00:01:56.880> play<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that the Master System can also play the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.630 
that the Master System can also play the
same<00:01:57.509> games<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> little<00:01:58.950> bit<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.159> comfort

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
same games as a little bit of comfort

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.330 
same games as a little bit of comfort
there<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.270> me<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:01.320> what<00:02:01.860> I'll<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.280> is

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
there for me but what I'll do here is

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.459 
there for me but what I'll do here is
I'll<00:02:02.549> put<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:02.969> each<00:02:03.119> game<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.659> show<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.170> how

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
I'll put in each game and show you how

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.010 
I'll put in each game and show you how
it<00:02:04.649> fires<00:02:05.189> out<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.790> think<00:02:06.329> first<00:02:06.570> off<00:02:06.719> we'll

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
it fires out I think first off we'll

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.460 
it fires out I think first off we'll
start<00:02:07.229> off<00:02:07.320> with<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.849> one<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.629> Master

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
start off with the one for the Master
