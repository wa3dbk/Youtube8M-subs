00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.720 
aware I'm a big astronomy buff and I've
been<00:00:22.350> keeping<00:00:22.680> up<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> lot<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.250> the

been keeping up with a lot of the

been keeping up with a lot of the
findings<00:00:24.689> with<00:00:25.500> with<00:00:26.070> NASA<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.760> what's<00:00:26.970> been

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
findings with with NASA and what's been

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.300 
findings with with NASA and what's been
going<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> curiosity<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.380> today

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
going on with the curiosity and today

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.229 
going on with the curiosity and today
the<00:00:29.880> Curiosity<00:00:30.449> found<00:00:31.460> rocks<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.000> been

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the Curiosity found rocks that have been

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.350 
the Curiosity found rocks that have been
affected<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:34.770> obviously<00:00:35.219> by<00:00:35.460> water<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
affected very obviously by water and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.660 
affected very obviously by water and
this<00:00:36.840> isn't<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.110> first<00:00:37.260> time<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:38.399> have

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
this isn't the first time that we have

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.630 
this isn't the first time that we have
speculated<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.890> Mars<00:00:40.890> could<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.309> houst

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
speculated that Mars could have houst

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.700 
speculated that Mars could have houst
water<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.329> think<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.140> was<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.350> over<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> year

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
water I think it was like over a year

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.580 
water I think it was like over a year
ago<00:00:44.239> there<00:00:45.239> were<00:00:45.329> images<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:46.110> NASA<00:00:46.320> had

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
ago there were images that NASA had

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.639 
ago there were images that NASA had
taken<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:47.219> an<00:00:47.520> orbiter<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.200> they<00:00:49.200> had<00:00:49.379> said

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
taken with an orbiter and they had said

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.100 
taken with an orbiter and they had said
that<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> looked<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.399> there<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:51.110> evidence

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
that it looked like there was evidence

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.189 
that it looked like there was evidence
of<00:00:52.289> water<00:00:52.760> but<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.850> wasn't<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.300> conclusive<00:00:55.050> as

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
of water but it wasn't as conclusive as

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.110 
of water but it wasn't as conclusive as
having<00:00:55.590> rover<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.309> take<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.000> know

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
having rover there to take you know

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.799 
having rover there to take you know
direct<00:00:57.480> feed<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.050> these<00:00:58.710> rocks<00:00:59.629> people<00:01:00.629> who

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
direct feed of these rocks people who

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.439 
direct feed of these rocks people who
have<00:01:00.989> speculated<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:02.039> may<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.449> water

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
have speculated that there may be water

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.380 
have speculated that there may be water
under<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.799> surface<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.400> Mars<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.210> there

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
under the surface of Mars that there

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.330 
under the surface of Mars that there
could<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.630> frozen<00:01:07.200> water<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.920> reason<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.310> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
could be frozen water the reason all of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
could be frozen water the reason all of
this<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.850> incredibly<00:01:09.360> cool<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.110> while

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
this is so incredibly cool is that while

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.649 
this is so incredibly cool is that while
there<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> building<00:01:12.180> blocks<00:01:12.420> of

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
there is one of the building blocks of

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
there is one of the building blocks of
life<00:01:12.720> everywhere<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.130> ever<00:01:14.280> known

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
life everywhere that we have ever known

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.660 
life everywhere that we have ever known
life<00:01:14.939> there<00:01:15.299> has<00:01:15.479> been<00:01:15.689> water<00:01:16.280> things<00:01:17.280> come

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
life there has been water things come

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.039 
life there has been water things come
from<00:01:18.030> water<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> because<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.450> have

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
from water so because of that we have

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.200 
from water so because of that we have
reason<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> believe<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.909> find

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
reason to believe that if we can find

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.749 
reason to believe that if we can find
water<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.900> other<00:01:25.049> places<00:01:25.380> there<00:01:26.310> could<00:01:26.729> be

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
water in other places there could be

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.450 
water in other places there could be
living<00:01:27.299> organisms<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.350> could<00:01:28.530> find<00:01:28.829> other

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
living organisms we could find other

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.810 
living organisms we could find other
life<00:01:29.990> intelligent<00:01:30.990> life<00:01:31.140> probably<00:01:32.009> way<00:01:32.400> way

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
life intelligent life probably way way

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.240 
life intelligent life probably way way
way<00:01:33.000> beyond<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.720> don't<00:01:34.140> think<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:35.009> find

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
way beyond I don't think we will find

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.120 
way beyond I don't think we will find
that<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.549> our<00:01:35.670> lifetimes<00:01:36.380> however<00:01:37.380> finding

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
that in our lifetimes however finding

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.920 
that in our lifetimes however finding
life<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.579> another<00:01:39.270> planet<00:01:39.420> would<00:01:39.810> be

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
life on another planet would be

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.649 
life on another planet would be
spectacular<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.150> we<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.329> reason<00:01:42.630> to

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
spectacular and we have reason to

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.350 
spectacular and we have reason to
believe<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.960> Mars<00:01:43.619> may<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:44.399> been<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:45.149> one

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
believe that Mars may have been at one

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.289 
believe that Mars may have been at one
point<00:01:45.799> inhabitable<00:01:46.799> maybe<00:01:47.520> they<00:01:47.909> had<00:01:48.149> an

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
point inhabitable maybe they had an

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.319 
point inhabitable maybe they had an
atmosphere<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:49.590> maybe<00:01:50.220> there<00:01:50.549> was<00:01:50.820> water

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
atmosphere and maybe there was water

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.780 
atmosphere and maybe there was water
running<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> surface<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.920> Mars<00:01:53.100> really

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
running on the surface of Mars really

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.090 
running on the surface of Mars really
cool<00:01:54.060> what<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.450> think<00:01:54.630> about<00:01:54.869> how<00:01:55.619> long<00:01:55.799> ago

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
cool what to think about how long ago

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.850 
cool what to think about how long ago
that<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:56.820> no<00:01:56.880> idea<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.630> maybe<00:01:58.320> it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
that was we have no idea and maybe it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.160 
that was we have no idea and maybe it
didn't<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.219> water<00:01:59.369> who<00:02:00.149> knows<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.600> even<00:02:01.079> if

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
didn't have water who knows and even if
