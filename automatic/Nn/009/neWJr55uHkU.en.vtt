00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
pasta which is I think the most simplest

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.359 
pasta which is I think the most simplest
dish<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.570> prepare<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.530> basically<00:01:53.040> most

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
dish you can prepare but basically most

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.730 
dish you can prepare but basically most

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
of the times would be bit with some

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.100 
of the times would be bit with some
sauces<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.549> are<00:01:56.729> already<00:01:57.000> prepared<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.840> I

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
sauces that are already prepared and I

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.890 
sauces that are already prepared and I
always<00:01:58.439> felt<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.610> it<00:02:00.329> was<00:02:00.509> pretty

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
always felt that that it was pretty

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.190 
always felt that that it was pretty
tasty<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.680> I've<00:02:02.310> considered<00:02:03.149> myself<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:04.170> I

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
tasty so I've considered myself that I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.850 
tasty so I've considered myself that I
