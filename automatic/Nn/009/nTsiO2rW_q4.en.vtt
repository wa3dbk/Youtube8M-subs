00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.740
 gentlemen passengers we are about to take off on a journey through the history of the 100 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.719
 years of aviation in mexico 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:12.749
 in this stretch 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.749
 we will make a tour of the great salaries 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.679
 Enjoy the trip 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.890
 from the first flight made in Mexico 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.160
 by alberto pravia 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.570
 in 1910 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.320
 The rage for airplanes has nourished the history of aviation in Mexico 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.480
 in this count 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.330
 we can not stop remembering some of the Mexican flights that have left 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.409
 footprint throughout the 20th century 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.950
 and what goes of the 21 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.310
 first of all 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.440
 we can mention the crossings made by the young military pilot emilio 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.770
 carranza in the years 1927 and 1928 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.390
 the last of them the one that would cost him his life 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.610
 on board with lightning 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.289
 He flew from San Diego to Mexico for 20 or 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:08.210
 26 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.210
 many nonstop 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.660
 baptized as mexico excélsior came out that June 11 to 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.440
 Washington 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.510
 villáecija new york 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.880
 however the next day he decided to leave untimely in the direction of 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.530
 Mexico 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.300
 despite the bad weather 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.500
 so a severe thunderstorm 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.720
 take down the plane 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.670
 and this is so 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.950
 losing his life 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.380
 another famous flight 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.910
 is the one that has gone down in history as the bypass around the republic 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.910
 made by Lieutenant Colonel Gustavo Gerlero 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.509
 which started on September 30, 1928 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.710
 and it was extremely successful 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.660
 since almost all the capitals were visited and if such important 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.990
 from Ciudad Juárez to tapachula 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.230
 and from Veracruz to Mazatlán 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.890
 the purpose of the trip was to promote the first plane azkárate wounds 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.060
 cesc and plan 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.120
 also in those years the name of Pablo Sidar became famous when traveling 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.739
 the most important cities in Latin America 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.749
 on a flight started on August 22, 1929 aboard a Douglas plane 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.069
 Bogosian 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.010
 and that it accumulated 2 165 flight hours and 22,500 kilometers traveled 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.449
 conqueror of heaven 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.509
 it was the name of the plane in which francisco sarabia 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:33.919
 he made one of the most memorable duels 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:38.840
 taking off on May 24, 1939 from the central airport of the city of 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:42.179
 Mexico bound for the New York 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:46.599
 finally after ten hours and 48 minutes he arrived at his destination 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.679
 the flight was certified by the fae as a world record and the pilot filled with 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.689
 honors 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:58.499
 However, when the plane returned to Mexico on June 7, the plane failed 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:01.499
 and when trying a courtesan city 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.479
 the height the former workers of the company 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.379
 on June 7, 1957 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.049
 reaching an altitude of one thousand 444 meters above sea level 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.279
 another of the most remembered teachings to date 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.079
 it was the first round the world of a Mexican airplane 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.079
 made in 1967 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.359
 the honors correspond to Héctor Ramírez Almaraz and Manuel Arango 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:34.989
 to the list of great flights in the history of Mexican aviation 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.989
 we can add illustrious names and feats 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.959
 as carlos camacho and his balloon ride through our country of coast to 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.959
 coast in 1967 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.349
 the participation in aerial competitions of derqui rear 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.819
 in 1969 and 1971 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:59.120
 the voyage made in 2005 xisco 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.269
 in accompanying the good 1 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:07.799
 to document the Vosges contained in the network only 190 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.029
 kilograms of weight 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.399
 that was baptized with the name of palocci 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.679
 little butterfly in Nahuatl language 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:16.709
 but nevertheless 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.129
 the flight times are very strict and now we must land 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:25.469
 but we are sure that the technological advances and the intrepidity of the 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:29.240
 Mexican aviators will continue to produce feats to remember 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.279
 We have arrived at our destination passengers 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:36.999
 and we hope you have enjoyed the trance 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:39.999
 thank you for doing
