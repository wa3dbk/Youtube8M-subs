 that go pretty well and very very cheap 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.999
 that we already know that things are very 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.619
 very very difficult so we're going to 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:26.300
 start let's start with this team 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.390
 in which I will present today that is going to 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.310
 be silver hybrid and more let's 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.170
 find Greek players and 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.940
 Portuguese so let's see what 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.010
 we find let's go for them guys 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.420
 this greek goalkeeper 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.640
 here we have janis praise csis 190 now 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.870
 that pretty good goalkeeper makes his 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.059
 work of great great reflections 72 of 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.460
 reflexes will feel pretty good the 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.589
 position 72 for those ones against one 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.199
 that it's always good to have a good 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.659
 goalkeeper with good position and good as 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.120
 these as you see guys on the right the 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.220
 Typical the goal that I always bring 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.140
 with the doormen that only brings one of 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.830
 penalty that I always like to score one 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.909
 and good 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.240
 you see 150 coins the truth that quite 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.789
 of downtown defense here we put this 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.609
 watering that is weeds 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.799
 here we have Greek player of 68 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.500
 rhythm as I remember you I always like 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.999
 put slower in the middle because 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.060
 normally they are usually the highest 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.649
 as you see about 92 maybe it fails a little 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.240
 head but the truth is quite 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:37.209
 it's pretty good at 550 coins and the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.640
 true that yields performs quite well and 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:41.109
 with the price that has 550 coins the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.950
 truth that gives advice guys this 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.929
 greek weed player here we go to the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.049
 another central defense the irrigation that is more 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:53.379
 hand faster than suitcases because that 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.469
 we have it on the left side the 

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:58.390
 olympic player of olympics like 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.329
 you see 150 coins the truth that 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.109
 quite pretty cheap and pretty 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.869
 good as you see 72 rhythm is fast 71 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.160
 of defense and 64 of heads I have to 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.160
 say that it makes very good coverages 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.500
 this kostas manolas moves a lot 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.450
 well for it's because of the defensive zone and the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.970
 true that is good defense guys do not 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.190
 I recommend 100% let's move on to 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.190
 defensive midfielder who is known the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.840
 true this great player maniatis me of 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.489
 defensive closing of olympiacos like 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.389
 You see has some general statistics 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.389
 tremendous 77 dribbling rhythms 70 73 of 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.580
 74 pass defense is pretty good 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:38.130
 Boys 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.170
 the truth that I liked a lot 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.020
 this player have a great exit from the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.960
 work balloon with that 74 of pass that 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.210
 73 defense the only thing that I 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.100
 I wanted him the only thing that always 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.190
 I like to put something more to the poor 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.810
 players that according to 75 but let's go 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.050
 great this maniàtics of the best of 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.020
 team here the great sámaras a 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.630
 I loved it as you can see 8 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.530
 game he plays with me 6 goals 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.810
 193 of uncle and runs 83 that is very very 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.670
 good guys as I always say the only thing 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.930
 what is missing are filigree because to 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.720
 me the midfielder of the bands 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.730
 they should have at least 4 watermarks 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.640
 but good enough good good auctioneer 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.320
 That 193 head helps her a lot and 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.630
 the truth that 64 shot but I 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.760
 I'd put in a lot more because he's hitting her 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.270
 very very strong if you really very 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.580
 good this georgios sámaras 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.470
 let's go through the next to the 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.970
 portuguese 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.530
 Lets put 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.390
 to see what Portuguese we found by 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.390
 here we have manuel 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.390
 manuel dacosta the truth that very powerful 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.590
 very powerful of this of this defense of 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.290
 the three defenses that has been presented 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.890
 is the most the strongest one has a has 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.390
 a very powerful head jump 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.990
 you describe the two files on the right 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.630
 of corner 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.920
 is that as you see and 190 and has 80 of 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.140
 head that is is this player is great 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.480
 in the air game is 75 defense the 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.580
 true that he is a super complete defender 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.880
 now let's move to the midfield 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.070
 defensive that is this one Chinese and it is not 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.130
 something normal in men and manuel bruno 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.710
 china as you see him here 67 of rhythms 70 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.560
 defense and 72 head the truth that 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.970
 you have the statistics that in which 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.950
 we should set ourselves of the media 0 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.050
 defensive you already know the defense rhythm and 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.850
 He heads as well as always usually 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.310
 say the pass so that the 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.260
 ball from below and good that is to say from 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.210
 this player who climbs more than maniatis 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.190
 so you will have to have as always 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.569
 fingers I advise more care in the 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.219
 cons with 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.469
 when you go up as a player but good 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:46.819
 quite does a lot of work for 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:50.020
 three hundred monedillas the truth that 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:53.960
 it's pretty good from md here we have 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.970
 this because that end we're going to put 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.319
 In fact, here we have targi 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.229
 not the truth that a player who also 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:02.360
 it surprised quite very very fast 88 of 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.830
 rhythm and very good long shot the truth 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.949
 those four goals you see on the right 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.020
 the four has been diagonal band 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:12.139
 towards goal and good lonxe from afar 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.669
 the truth that 65 shot I would put him 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.889
 a little more but good the truth that 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.870
 pretty good with his four are four 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.060
 bad leg stars and a greater 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.280
 center in this case one end of the abuse 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.039
 of putting the right quite complete and 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.389
 pretty good here I'll introduce you to 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.250
 the beast of the team the one that has most 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.110
 the one who is most surprised 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.770
 paulo machado very well known most 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:37.789
 you know 74 rhythm 73 77 yes 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.800
 dribble 76 say 78 of pass is bestial 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.259
 smc today as you see in eight games and 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.110
 scored five goals of those five goals 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.520
 is 6 and 6 have been long shoes 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.830
 that has a lapse of impressive 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.260
 guys a shot power 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.790
 it's the silver players that more 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.310
 shooting power that has the truth that 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.540
 I left the amazing one and I'm going to 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.030
 talk about this player and I wanted him 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.740
 try to know to know how to 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.360
 he was really driving in the country and 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.520
 I have to say that for me it is the beast 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.440
 of the team the best player good pass 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.990
 final to the strikers and the truth that 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.430
 very very happy with this player up 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.270

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.800
 who play in Spanish leagues this 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:20.400
 criterion is hugo scallop of player of 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:24.030

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.550
 running perfect diagonals it 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.400
 moves very well in around the 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.260
 defenses looking for holes and that 67 shot 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.020
 pretty good as you see guys is a 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:43.350
 beastliness 12 goals in 8 matches or is
