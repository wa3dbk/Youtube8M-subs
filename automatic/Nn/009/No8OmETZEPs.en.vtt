connector<00:00:55.440> next<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.670> our<00:00:56.699> crimp<00:00:57.030> cap

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
connector next we have our crimp cap

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.310 
connector next we have our crimp cap
which<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.480> actually<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> simplest

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
which is actually the simplest

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.599 
which is actually the simplest
connection<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> could<00:00:59.100> possibly<00:00:59.399> make

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
connection that you could possibly make

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.810 
connection that you could possibly make
make<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:01.079> actually<00:01:01.320> very<00:01:01.559> similar<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.399> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
make it's actually very similar to a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.270 
make it's actually very similar to a
wiring<00:01:03.510> nut<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> home<00:01:04.320> applications<00:01:05.010> but

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
wiring nut in the home applications but

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.310 
wiring nut in the home applications but
we<00:01:05.549> actually<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> crimp<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.810> instead<00:01:07.200> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
we actually have to crimp it instead of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.899 
we actually have to crimp it instead of
actually<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.799> screwing<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> wire

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
actually just screwing it on to the wire

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.969 
actually just screwing it on to the wire
this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> very<00:01:10.229> basic<00:01:10.470> straightforward

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
this is a very basic straightforward

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.609 
this is a very basic straightforward
makes<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> nice<00:01:11.700> good<00:01:12.210> solid<00:01:12.689> connection<00:01:13.170> now

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
makes a nice good solid connection now

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.050 
makes a nice good solid connection now
the<00:01:13.710> downside<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:14.970> imagine

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the downside is if you can imagine

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.450 
the downside is if you can imagine
having<00:01:15.570> about<00:01:15.900> 13<00:01:16.320> other<00:01:16.500> wires<00:01:16.740> around<00:01:17.250> this

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
having about 13 other wires around this

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.190 
having about 13 other wires around this
with<00:01:18.119> crimp<00:01:18.390> caps<00:01:18.600> you're<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
with crimp caps you're going to have a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.109 
with crimp caps you're going to have a
pretty<00:01:19.619> bulky<00:01:20.009> harness<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> try<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.000> back

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
pretty bulky harness to try and get back

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.630 
pretty bulky harness to try and get back
into<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.509> dashboard<00:01:22.189> last<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.340> not<00:01:23.400> least

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
into that dashboard last but not least

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.100 
into that dashboard last but not least
we<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.820> our<00:01:24.060> soldering<00:01:24.450> heat<00:01:24.750> shrink<00:01:24.990> which

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
we have our soldering heat shrink which

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.149 
we have our soldering heat shrink which
is<00:01:25.229> actually<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.590> my<00:01:25.710> favorites<00:01:26.070> because

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
is actually one of my favorites because

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.620 
is actually one of my favorites because
it<00:01:26.369> provides<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> best<00:01:27.240> connection

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
it provides you the best connection

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.950 
it provides you the best connection
possible<00:01:28.220> here<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.509> pre<00:01:30.509> soldered<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
possible here I have pre soldered the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.410 
possible here I have pre soldered the
actual<00:01:31.229> wire<00:01:31.579> before<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.729> heat<00:01:32.970> shrink<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> give

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
actual wire before I heat shrink to give

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.090 
actual wire before I heat shrink to give
you<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> nice<00:01:34.049> example<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.560> what<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.829> actually

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
you a nice example of what it actually

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
you a nice example of what it actually
should<00:01:35.159> look<00:01:35.549> like<00:01:35.729> when<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.390> solder<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.750> wire

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
should look like when you solder a wire

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.090 
should look like when you solder a wire
when<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.320> actually<00:01:37.560> twist<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> wire

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
when you actually twist the wire

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.760 
when you actually twist the wire
together<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.390> heat<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> actual

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
together and you heat up the actual

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.980 
together and you heat up the actual
copper<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:42.090> want<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> make<00:01:42.450> sure<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> solder

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
copper you want to make sure the solder

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.590 
copper you want to make sure the solder
soaks<00:01:43.380> all<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> way<00:01:44.159> through<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> DAB

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
soaks all the way through it's not a DAB

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600 
soaks all the way through it's not a DAB
not<00:01:46.439> half<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.860> wire<00:01:47.009> because<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:47.490> not

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
not half the wire because that's not

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.039 
not half the wire because that's not
going<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> give<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> nice<00:01:48.210> solid<00:01:48.420> true

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
going to give you a nice solid true

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.469 
going to give you a nice solid true
connection<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.520> here<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> soldering

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
connection so here we have the soldering

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
connection so here we have the soldering
heat<00:01:51.659> shrink<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.799> tell<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> very

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
heat shrink as you can tell it's a very

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.130 
heat shrink as you can tell it's a very
nice<00:01:53.700> solid<00:01:54.240> connection<00:01:54.720> I'm<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.930> gonna<00:01:55.079> be

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
nice solid connection I'm not gonna be

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.319 
nice solid connection I'm not gonna be
able<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.350> rip<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.619> apart<00:01:56.000> unlike<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> buck

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
able to rip that apart unlike a buck

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.260 
able to rip that apart unlike a buck
connector<00:01:57.719> which<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.020> hey<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> may<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.799> able<00:01:58.950> to

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
connector which I hey I may be able to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.819 
connector which I hey I may be able to
just<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:01.409> pulled<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.680> right

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
just like that just pulled it right

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.450 
just like that just pulled it right
apart<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.930> order<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.740> make<00:02:04.950> sure<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.219> yeah

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
apart so in order to make sure this yeah

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.760 
apart so in order to make sure this yeah
the<00:02:05.700> heat<00:02:05.850> shrink<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.180> properly<00:02:06.570> applied<00:02:06.770> we

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
the heat shrink is properly applied we

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.949 
the heat shrink is properly applied we
do<00:02:07.950> need<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> lighter<00:02:08.879> or<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.300> heat<00:02:09.539> source<00:02:09.750> in

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
do need a lighter or a heat source in

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.230 
do need a lighter or a heat source in
general<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.640> heat<00:02:11.640> up<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.790> heat<00:02:12.120> shrink

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
general and heat up the heat shrink

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.560 
general and heat up the heat shrink
over<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.480> solder<00:02:13.720> connection<00:02:15.360> see<00:02:16.360> there<00:02:16.540> I

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
over the solder connection see there I

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.840 
over the solder connection see there I
take<00:02:16.720> some<00:02:16.900> heat<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:18.160> once<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.370> get<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:18.640> the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
take some heat and once you get that the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.060 
take some heat and once you get that the
wire<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.150> nice<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.510> insulated<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:20.890> got<00:02:21.040> a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
wire is nice and insulated and you got a

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.250 
wire is nice and insulated and you got a
nice<00:02:21.280> solid<00:02:21.490> connection<00:02:22.060> now<00:02:22.900> we're<00:02:23.110> actually

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
nice solid connection now we're actually

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.060 
nice solid connection now we're actually
going<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.530> show<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.830> real-world

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
going to show you the real-world

from Metra here I use the 18 to 22 gauge
buck<00:02:34.510> connector<00:02:34.900> as<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.800> can<00:02:35.920> see<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.250> bulk

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
buck connector as you can see the bulk

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.960 
buck connector as you can see the bulk
of<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> wires<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.960> got<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.140> pretty<00:02:38.650> good

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
of the wires you got a pretty good

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.310 
of the wires you got a pretty good
thickness<00:02:39.970> there<00:02:40.360> Justin<00:02:40.810> Buck<00:02:40.960> connectors

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
thickness there Justin Buck connectors

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.320 
thickness there Justin Buck connectors
and<00:02:41.440> that's<00:02:41.590> not<00:02:41.740> all<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.040> wires<00:02:42.220> connected<00:02:43.120> I

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
and that's not all the wires connected I

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.900 
and that's not all the wires connected I
still<00:02:43.570> have<00:02:43.750> my<00:02:43.990> power<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.320> I<00:02:44.500> need<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.770> do<00:02:44.920> so

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
still have my power that I need to do so

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.390 
still have my power that I need to do so
as<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.090> can<00:02:46.210> see<00:02:46.270> they're<00:02:46.540> pretty<00:02:46.900> thick<00:02:47.400> then

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
as you can see they're pretty thick then

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.250 
as you can see they're pretty thick then
we<00:02:48.490> have<00:02:48.610> our<00:02:48.730> solder<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.240> heat<00:02:49.390> shrink<00:02:49.660> now

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
we have our solder and heat shrink now

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.870 
we have our solder and heat shrink now
granted<00:02:50.590> only<00:02:50.680> did<00:02:50.890> about<00:02:50.920> five<00:02:51.280> wires<00:02:51.640> here

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
granted only did about five wires here

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.940 
granted only did about five wires here
but<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.120> could<00:02:52.210> tell<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.720> major<00:02:53.260> difference

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
but you could tell the major difference

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.910 
but you could tell the major difference
on<00:02:54.160> how<00:02:55.030> less<00:02:55.510> thick<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.110> actual<00:02:56.410> harness<00:02:56.770> is

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
on how less thick the actual harness is

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.290 
on how less thick the actual harness is
so<00:02:57.040> it's<00:02:57.160> make<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.460> much<00:02:57.640> easier<00:02:57.670> for<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.270> to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
so it's make it much easier for you to

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.370 
so it's make it much easier for you to
get<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.570> back<00:02:58.720> into<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.050> -<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.600> other

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
get it back into the - so other

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.750 
get it back into the - so other
connectors<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:02.920> could<00:03:03.040> be<00:03:03.100> also<00:03:03.250> utilized

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
connectors that could be also utilized

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.220 
connectors that could be also utilized
we<00:03:03.880> got<00:03:04.000> our<00:03:04.090> crimp<00:03:04.300> caps<00:03:04.510> already<00:03:04.810> covered<00:03:05.140> we

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
we got our crimp caps already covered we

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.170 
we got our crimp caps already covered we
got<00:03:05.350> our<00:03:05.440> 18<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.860> 22<00:03:06.130> gauge<00:03:06.460> buck<00:03:06.700> connector<00:03:07.060> we

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
got our 18 to 22 gauge buck connector we

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.030 
got our 18 to 22 gauge buck connector we
also<00:03:07.360> have<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.690> different<00:03:07.960> size<00:03:08.320> of<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.530> buck

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
also have a different size of a buck

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.860 
also have a different size of a buck
connector<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.400> got<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.580> 14<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.180> 16<00:03:10.480> gauge

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
connector you got the 14 to 16 gauge

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.020 
connector you got the 14 to 16 gauge
which<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.620> obviously<00:03:12.010> using<00:03:12.490> larger<00:03:12.880> wire

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
which is obviously using larger wire

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.480 
which is obviously using larger wire
applications<00:03:13.690> so<00:03:14.500> say<00:03:14.770> if<00:03:14.890> you're<00:03:15.040> joining

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
applications so say if you're joining

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.730 
applications so say if you're joining

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
two grounds together you probably want

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.950 
two grounds together you probably want
to<00:03:17.800> use<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:18.370> 14<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.850> 16<00:03:19.090> gauge<00:03:19.390> well<00:03:19.600> connector

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
seen in the industry you get the twist

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.980 
seen in the industry you get the twist
and<00:03:33.280> tape<00:03:33.520> which<00:03:34.240> obviously<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:34.750> can<00:03:34.870> see

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990
