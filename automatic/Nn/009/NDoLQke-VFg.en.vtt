it's<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.340> neat<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> speak<00:01:43.229> because

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
it's not really neat so to speak because

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.160 
it's not really neat so to speak because
I<00:01:44.340> mean<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.390> doesn't<00:01:45.720> matter<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.140> me

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
I mean it really doesn't matter to me

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.270 
I mean it really doesn't matter to me
because<00:01:46.380> they're<00:01:46.680> gonna<00:01:46.770> come<00:01:46.920> after<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.130> have

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
because they're gonna come after I have

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.609 
because they're gonna come after I have
a<00:01:47.310> basic<00:01:47.670> shape<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.420> reason<00:01:48.659> why<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.810> do<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.170> so

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
a basic shape the reason why I do is so

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.350 
a basic shape the reason why I do is so
they<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> shape<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.939> curls<00:01:51.180> can

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
they can have a shape the curls can

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
they can have a shape the curls can
maintain<00:01:51.540> their<00:01:52.079> shape<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.470> not<00:01:52.799> keep<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.399> on

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
maintain their shape or not keep it on

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.219 
maintain their shape or not keep it on
