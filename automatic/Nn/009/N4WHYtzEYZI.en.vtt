first<00:06:04.960> we<00:06:05.139> have<00:06:05.259> to<00:06:05.379> route<00:06:05.560> them<00:06:05.710> through<00:06:05.979> the

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
first we have to route them through the

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.409 
first we have to route them through the
little<00:06:06.729> wire<00:06:06.849> holder<00:06:08.610> and<00:06:09.610> then<00:06:09.819> we<00:06:09.940> can<00:06:10.150> plug

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
little wire holder and then we can plug

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.059 
little wire holder and then we can plug
them<00:06:10.509> back<00:06:10.659> in<00:06:10.900> remember<00:06:11.770> there<00:06:11.889> are<00:06:11.949> two

down on this particular model there's
four<00:07:06.110> locating<00:07:06.590> pins<00:07:06.830> that<00:07:07.610> you<00:07:07.669> have<00:07:07.760> to<00:07:07.880> make

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
four locating pins that you have to make

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.909 
four locating pins that you have to make
sure<00:07:08.120> the<00:07:08.240> top<00:07:08.419> goes<00:07:08.600> down<00:07:08.630> onto<00:07:09.260> before<00:07:09.830> you

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
sure the top goes down onto before you

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:11.220 
sure the top goes down onto before you
snap<00:07:10.160> it<00:07:10.190> into<00:07:10.430> place

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.230
