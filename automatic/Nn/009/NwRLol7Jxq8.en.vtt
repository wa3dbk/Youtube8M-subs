00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
think for this one we should go with the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.040 
think for this one we should go with the
bottle<00:03:25.850> style<00:03:26.090> because<00:03:26.270> is<00:03:26.360> going<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.570> be<00:03:26.750> very

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
bottle style because is going to be very

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.540 
bottle style because is going to be very
effective<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.740> it's<00:03:27.890> really<00:03:28.070> going<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.340> work

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
effective and it's really going to work

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.120
