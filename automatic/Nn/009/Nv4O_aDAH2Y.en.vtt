that<00:02:07.759> I<00:02:07.970> am<00:02:08.149> NOT<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.690> attractive<00:02:09.410> one<00:02:09.769> in<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
that I am NOT the attractive one in the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.580 
that I am NOT the attractive one in the
relationship<00:02:10.250> which<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.209> why<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.630> generally

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
relationship which is why I generally

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.530 
relationship which is why I generally
keep<00:02:12.769> that<00:02:13.010> information<00:02:13.280> private<00:02:14.000> now<00:02:14.180> so

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
keep that information private now so

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.120 
keep that information private now so
here's<00:02:14.840> my<00:02:14.900> reasoning<00:02:15.410> behind<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.739> here<00:02:16.010> is

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
here's my reasoning behind this here is

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.610 
here's my reasoning behind this here is
my<00:02:16.370> method<00:02:17.329> of<00:02:17.420> thinking<00:02:17.570> I<00:02:17.900> figured<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.440> if

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
my method of thinking I figured that if

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.580 
my method of thinking I figured that if
I<00:02:18.860> am<00:02:18.980> still<00:02:19.310> put<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.610> guy<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:20.079> about<00:02:21.079> 30<00:02:21.350> years

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
I am still put the guy in about 30 years

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.460 
I am still put the guy in about 30 years
or<00:02:21.739> so<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.070> will<00:02:22.370> finally<00:02:22.910> get<00:02:23.150> my<00:02:23.660> chance<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:24.350> be

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
or so I will finally get my chance to be

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.660 
or so I will finally get my chance to be
the<00:02:24.709> fabulous<00:02:25.190> one<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.549> relationship

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
the fabulous one in the relationship

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.490 
the fabulous one in the relationship
because<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.510> will<00:02:26.690> have<00:02:26.810> been<00:02:26.959> using<00:02:27.140> skincare

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
because I will have been using skincare

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.590 
because I will have been using skincare
products<00:02:28.070> for<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.280> past<00:02:28.489> 30<00:02:28.730> years<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.209> he

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
products for the past 30 years and he

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.030 
products for the past 30 years and he
won't<00:02:29.780> have<00:02:29.930> been<00:02:30.049> using<00:02:30.230> anything<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.920> if

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
won't have been using anything and if

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.850 
won't have been using anything and if
that's<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.430> only<00:02:31.459> way<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.730> can<00:02:31.850> get<00:02:32.060> ahead<00:02:32.860> I'll

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
that's the only way I can get ahead I'll

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.500 
that's the only way I can get ahead I'll
take<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.310> however<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:35.030> are<00:02:35.060> probably
