00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:17.400
 hello there you are first tungsten 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.340
 Yaroslavl videoblogger November 5th of this 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.000
 of the year comes the new part of the game call of 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.930
 duty 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.020
 I basically played all parts of this 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.320
 Mana games, even the legendary something 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.749
 I like to play this game 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.600
 recently lost to battlefield 3 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:42.809
 part of it seemed to be something not very 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.999
 call of duty for another thing entirely 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.489
 some kind of atmosphere 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:49.729
 you can even say that nothing else 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.309
 play only play this game before 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:56.489
 of course he played then there were consoles 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.489
 dandy there sega after all and platform 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.499
 games me sony first console was 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.150
 and now in computer games almost 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:08.850
 We do not play from the past that I was the 2 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.790
 duck tales game pc version am 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.820
 adapted something not really liked 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.870
 and call of duty, I'm really, really looking forward to this 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.360
 especially like the game then take a rifle 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.760
 with a telescopic sight and walk there 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.350
 anyone 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.070
 postrelivat quietly what some 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.460
 the enemies are bad of course that control in 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.370
 this keyboard game would surely be 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.890
 support for joystick as set-top boxes too 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.560
 because I'm still 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.350
 platformers player on computers 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.570
 I play because not so much 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.570
 convenient to play not on the keyboard she 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.690
 joystick is a completely different thing altogether 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.940
 the requirement there is not particularly large 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.720
 besides i have now at the moment 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.750
 on computer 12 gigs of RAM 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.550
 quad core processor 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:08.880
 geforce gt 650 video card i am not 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.920
 I am mistaken so I hope that although not 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.910
