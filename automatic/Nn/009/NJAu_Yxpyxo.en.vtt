00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
has a lot of texture to it and how to

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.680 
has a lot of texture to it and how to
style<00:00:14.309> with<00:00:14.700> my<00:00:14.910> favorite<00:00:15.360> tool<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.660> choice

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
style with my favorite tool of choice

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.630 
style with my favorite tool of choice
which<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> flat<00:00:16.529> iron<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.520> my

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
which is the flat iron so this is my

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.550 
which is the flat iron so this is my
client<00:00:18.029> Renata<00:00:18.270> as<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.630> can<00:00:18.779> see<00:00:18.990> she<00:00:19.199> has<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
client Renata as you can see she has a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.250 
client Renata as you can see she has a
lot<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.859> hair<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.490> her<00:00:21.240> layers<00:00:21.480> start<00:00:21.900> really

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
lot of hair and her layers start really

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.140 
lot of hair and her layers start really
really<00:00:22.500> short<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.039> front<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:23.699> her<00:00:23.820> length

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
really short in the front but her length

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.349 
really short in the front but her length
is<00:00:24.390> long<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.529> back<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.180> way<00:00:27.330> that

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
is long in the back so the way that

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.390 
is long in the back so the way that
we've<00:00:27.689> been<00:00:27.720> cutting<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.769> she's<00:00:29.070> kind<00:00:29.310> of

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
we've been cutting this is she's kind of

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.460 
we've been cutting this is she's kind of
grown<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.820> out<00:00:29.939> from<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.539> layered<00:00:30.810> cut<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.289> was

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
grown it out from a layered cut that was

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.069 
grown it out from a layered cut that was
really<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.279> dramatic<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:33.809> we're

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
really really dramatic and so now we're

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.959 
really really dramatic and so now we're
just<00:00:34.260> blending<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.890> hair<00:00:35.130> but<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.670> want<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
just blending in the hair but we want to

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.610 
just blending in the hair but we want to
make<00:00:36.120> sure<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.510> there<00:00:36.750> isn't<00:00:36.989> any<00:00:37.380> place

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
make sure that there isn't any place

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.010 
make sure that there isn't any place
where<00:00:37.890> there's<00:00:38.100> too<00:00:38.520> much<00:00:38.879> texture<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.540> too

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
where there's too much texture is too

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
where there's too much texture is too
dense<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.590> I'm<00:00:41.100> kind<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.850> clean

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
dense so I'm kind of just going to clean

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.510 
dense so I'm kind of just going to clean
up<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.540> lines<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.079> little<00:00:43.230> bit<00:00:43.430> directing<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
up the lines a little bit directing the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.029 
up the lines a little bit directing the
hair<00:00:44.700> forward<00:00:45.090> too<00:00:45.600> close<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> shortest

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
hair forward too close to the shortest

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.639 
hair forward too close to the shortest
length<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.789> also<00:00:47.940> sliding<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> hair

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
length but also sliding down on the hair

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.410 
length but also sliding down on the hair
so<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.010> don't<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.489> remove<00:00:50.760> much<00:00:51.059> length

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
so we don't have to remove much length

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.319 
so we don't have to remove much length
from<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> bottom<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.370> that's<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.059> we'll<00:00:54.180> do

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
from the bottom so that's what we'll do

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.709 
from the bottom so that's what we'll do
first<00:00:54.539> I'm<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> use<00:00:55.140> sheers<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:57.480> like

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
first I'm going to use sheers and I like

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.810 
first I'm going to use sheers and I like
to<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> lot<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.620> dry<00:00:58.829> cutting<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.489> shears

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
to do a lot of dry cutting with shears

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.319 
to do a lot of dry cutting with shears
because<00:01:00.620> it<00:01:01.620> gives<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.010> more<00:01:02.219> precise<00:01:02.699> cut<00:01:03.090> and

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
because it gives a more precise cut and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.509 
because it gives a more precise cut and
also<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.530> see<00:01:04.830> everything<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.369> I'm<00:01:05.489> doing

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
also I can see everything that I'm doing

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.030 
also I can see everything that I'm doing
it's<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.150> more<00:01:06.390> controlled<00:01:06.689> way<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.380> keeping

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
it's a more controlled way of keeping

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.969 
it's a more controlled way of keeping
the<00:01:08.460> inch<00:01:08.939> trimmed<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.229> thick<00:01:10.439> hair<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the inch trimmed so with thick hair I

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.370 
the inch trimmed so with thick hair I
always<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.180> project<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.720> up<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.350> how

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
always like to project it up and see how

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.830 
always like to project it up and see how
full<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> ends<00:01:14.400> are<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:15.420> with<00:01:15.720> her

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
full of the ends are because with her

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.300 
full of the ends are because with her
hair<00:01:16.080> when<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.470> curled<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.920> want<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.189> make

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
hair when it's curled you want to make

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.520 
hair when it's curled you want to make
sure<00:01:17.490> there<00:01:17.729> aren't<00:01:17.880> any<00:01:18.060> harsh<00:01:18.720> lines<00:01:19.110> or

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
sure there aren't any harsh lines or

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.289 
sure there aren't any harsh lines or
harsh<00:01:19.830> shelves<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> hair<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
harsh shelves in the hair as we like to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.960 
harsh shelves in the hair as we like to
call<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.619> basically<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.759> use<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
call it so basically I'm going to use a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.940 
call it so basically I'm going to use a
notching<00:01:24.600> technique<00:01:25.020> when<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.770> on

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
notching technique when I'm going in on

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.080 
notching technique when I'm going in on
her<00:01:26.070> ends

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.260 

so<00:01:31.090> what<00:01:31.270> this<00:01:31.420> is<00:01:31.630> doing<00:01:31.920> primarily<00:01:32.920> is

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
so what this is doing primarily is

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.780 
so what this is doing primarily is
removing<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.480> split<00:01:34.720> ends<00:01:34.900> but<00:01:35.230> it's<00:01:35.380> also

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
removing the split ends but it's also

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.000 
removing the split ends but it's also
giving<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:36.910> edge<00:01:37.120> more<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.630> softer<00:01:38.350> more<00:01:38.830> of<00:01:38.920> a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
giving the edge more a softer more of a

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.310 
giving the edge more a softer more of a
soft<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.640> wispy<00:01:40.000> kind<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.330> feel<00:01:40.510> so<00:01:40.990> it's<00:01:41.170> not

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
soft to wispy kind of feel so it's not

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.230 
soft to wispy kind of feel so it's not
so<00:01:41.650> hard<00:01:41.980> and<00:01:42.160> heavy<00:01:42.340> when<00:01:42.640> she<00:01:42.850> wears<00:01:43.000> her

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
so hard and heavy when she wears her

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.060 
so hard and heavy when she wears her
hair<00:01:43.390> curly<00:01:43.900> which<00:01:44.110> she<00:01:44.290> has<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.560> option<00:01:44.740> to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
hair curly which she has the option to

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.880 
hair curly which she has the option to
do<00:01:45.220> or<00:01:45.430> strength

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.410 

now<00:01:51.890> as<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.250> can<00:01:52.400> see<00:01:52.460> her<00:01:52.850> layers<00:01:53.119> are

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
now as you can see her layers are

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.539 
now as you can see her layers are
starting<00:01:53.900> to<00:01:54.049> gradually<00:01:54.590> come<00:01:54.950> down<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.250> little

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
starting to gradually come down a little

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.760 
starting to gradually come down a little
bit<00:01:55.760> longer<00:01:56.060> around<00:01:56.510> her<00:01:56.659> face<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.380> we<00:01:57.500> want<00:01:57.680> to

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
bit longer around her face so we want to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.890 
bit longer around her face so we want to
continue<00:01:58.040> to<00:01:58.250> follow<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.670> same<00:01:58.909> line<00:01:59.150> but

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
continue to follow the same line but

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:13.890 
continue to follow the same line but
just<00:01:59.930> soften<00:02:00.500> them<00:02:00.590> up<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.860> little<00:02:01.040> bit

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.899 

so<00:02:14.900> I'm<00:02:15.080> going<00:02:15.439> in<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.950> I'm<00:02:16.040> removing<00:02:16.610> some

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
so I'm going in and I'm removing some

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:43.510 
so I'm going in and I'm removing some
length<00:02:17.150> from<00:02:17.450> her<00:02:17.629> front

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.790 

so<00:02:44.060> now<00:02:44.240> I'm<00:02:44.360> in<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.660> back<00:02:44.960> of<00:02:44.990> Renata's<00:02:45.560> hair

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
so now I'm in the back of Renata's hair

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.800 
so now I'm in the back of Renata's hair
where<00:02:46.070> most<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.490> her<00:02:46.640> length<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.630> like

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
where most of her length is and I like

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.630 
where most of her length is and I like
to<00:02:47.960> do<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.110> technique<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:48.890> call<00:02:48.980> fan

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
to do a technique that I call fan

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.970 
to do a technique that I call fan
cutting<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:50.630> basically<00:02:50.930> project<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.770> hair

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
cutting so I basically project the hair

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.360 
cutting so I basically project the hair
out<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.490> about<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:53.030> 45<00:02:53.960> degree<00:02:53.990> angle<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.800> then

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
out to about a 45 degree angle and then

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
out to about a 45 degree angle and then
I<00:02:55.640> spread<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.630> hair<00:02:56.840> out<00:02:57.050> like<00:02:57.320> so<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.180> kind

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
I spread the hair out like so so it kind

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.330 
I spread the hair out like so so it kind
of<00:02:59.420> looks<00:02:59.570> like<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.750> fan<00:02:59.990> and<00:03:00.800> now<00:03:01.040> what<00:03:01.220> I'm

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
of looks like a fan and now what I'm

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.670 
of looks like a fan and now what I'm
going<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.610> do<00:03:01.820> is<00:03:02.060> basically<00:03:02.300> use<00:03:03.170> my<00:03:03.410> guide

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
going to do is basically use my guide

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.230 
going to do is basically use my guide
from<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.220> shorter<00:03:04.550> hair<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:04.970> previously

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
from the shorter hair that I previously

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.890 
from the shorter hair that I previously
cut<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.250> basically<00:03:07.250> cut<00:03:07.490> almost<00:03:07.850> every<00:03:08.570> piece

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
cut and basically cut almost every piece

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.530 
cut and basically cut almost every piece
of<00:03:08.930> hair<00:03:09.260> individually<00:03:10.160> almost<00:03:10.580> so<00:03:11.120> there<00:03:11.360> has

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
of hair individually almost so there has

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.930 
of hair individually almost so there has
a<00:03:11.570> nice<00:03:12.020> soft<00:03:12.590> brown<00:03:12.890> movement<00:03:13.490> there's<00:03:13.700> not

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
a nice soft brown movement there's not

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.050 
a nice soft brown movement there's not
too<00:03:14.150> much<00:03:14.330> weight<00:03:14.600> and<00:03:14.840> one<00:03:15.050> place<00:03:15.260> or<00:03:15.530> another

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
too much weight and one place or another

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.460 
too much weight and one place or another
what<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.240> is<00:03:17.390> going<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:17.660> do<00:03:17.840> when<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.230> hair

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
what this is going to do when the hair

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.490 
what this is going to do when the hair
is<00:03:18.710> it's<00:03:19.460> throwing<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:20.240> it's<00:03:20.390> laying<00:03:20.600> down<00:03:20.960> is

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
is it's throwing it it's laying down is

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.550 
is it's throwing it it's laying down is
you'll<00:03:21.860> be<00:03:22.040> able<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.400> see<00:03:22.760> basically<00:03:23.570> each

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
you'll be able to see basically each

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.250 
you'll be able to see basically each
hair<00:03:25.100> move<00:03:25.400> differently<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.420> it'll<00:03:26.690> all<00:03:26.840> sit

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
hair move differently and it'll all sit

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.610 
hair move differently and it'll all sit
on<00:03:27.500> top<00:03:27.860> of<00:03:28.100> one<00:03:28.280> another<00:03:28.580> in<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.840> very<00:03:30.080> uniform

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
on top of one another in a very uniform

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.170 
on top of one another in a very uniform
manner<00:03:30.920> but<00:03:31.370> not<00:03:31.880> too<00:03:32.210> precise<00:03:32.690> where<00:03:33.080> there's

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
manner but not too precise where there's

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.599 
manner but not too precise where there's
heavy<00:03:34.840> shelving<00:03:35.469> or<00:03:35.620> like<00:03:35.799> stacking<00:03:36.159> like<00:03:36.579> I

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
heavy shelving or like stacking like I

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.229 
heavy shelving or like stacking like I
was<00:03:36.879> talking<00:03:37.090> about<00:03:37.329> earlier<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.790> I'm<00:03:39.939> going

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
was talking about earlier so I'm going

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.979 
was talking about earlier so I'm going
in<00:03:40.420> once<00:03:40.629> again<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.319> I'm<00:03:41.409> removing<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:43.659> split

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
in once again and I'm removing the split

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.399 
in once again and I'm removing the split
hair<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.920> basically<00:03:45.879> cutting<00:03:46.569> everything<00:03:46.959> in

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
hair and basically cutting everything in

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.970 
hair and basically cutting everything in
a<00:03:47.670> circular<00:03:48.670> pattern<00:03:49.140> so<00:03:50.140> when<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.409> fans<00:03:50.709> out

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
a circular pattern so when it fans out

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.890 
a circular pattern so when it fans out
there's<00:03:51.670> too<00:03:51.790> much<00:03:51.969> weight<00:03:52.239> here<00:03:52.569> I'm<00:03:52.689> going

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
there's too much weight here I'm going

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.360 
there's too much weight here I'm going
to<00:03:52.989> take<00:03:53.170> that<00:03:53.409> out

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.390 

so<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.090> always<00:03:59.390> pick<00:03:59.750> up<00:03:59.900> a<00:04:00.140> large<00:04:00.440> section<00:04:00.980> just

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
so I always pick up a large section just

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.910 
so I always pick up a large section just
to<00:04:01.580> make<00:04:01.760> sure<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:02.420> have<00:04:02.959> a<00:04:02.989> guide<00:04:03.319> of<00:04:03.709> what<00:04:03.890> I

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
to make sure I have a guide of what I

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.640 
to make sure I have a guide of what I
already<00:04:04.220> cut<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:04.970> that<00:04:05.599> way<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:05.780> know<00:04:05.959> with<00:04:06.470> my

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
already cut and that way I know with my

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.520 
already cut and that way I know with my
next<00:04:06.950> section<00:04:07.099> where<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.849> go<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:08.319> once<00:04:09.319> again

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
next section where to go so once again

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.500 
next section where to go so once again
I'm<00:04:09.860> going<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.129> pull<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.400> out<00:04:10.580> in<00:04:10.819> the<00:04:10.910> fan<00:04:11.180> and

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
I'm going to pull it out in the fan and

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.629 
I'm going to pull it out in the fan and
I'm<00:04:12.170> just<00:04:12.410> going<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.650> trim<00:04:12.950> away<00:04:15.430> now<00:04:16.430> when<00:04:16.609> I

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
I'm just going to trim away now when I

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.659 
I'm just going to trim away now when I
comb<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.120> hair<00:04:17.239> down<00:04:17.570> I'm<00:04:17.870> just<00:04:18.079> looking<00:04:18.440> for

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
comb the hair down I'm just looking for

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.400 
comb the hair down I'm just looking for
bits<00:04:19.669> of<00:04:19.880> pieces<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:20.570> might<00:04:20.780> look<00:04:21.049> a<00:04:21.229> little

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
bits of pieces that might look a little

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.190 
bits of pieces that might look a little
bit<00:04:21.709> more<00:04:21.979> heavy<00:04:22.280> than<00:04:22.580> others

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.630 
to flow into one another nice and softly
it's<00:04:53.490> going<00:04:53.850> to<00:04:54.030> make<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.840> style<00:04:55.470> look<00:04:55.920> a<00:04:56.250> lot

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
it's going to make the style look a lot

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.150 
it's going to make the style look a lot
better<00:04:56.940> in<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.510> long<00:04:57.690> run<00:04:57.990> it<00:04:58.230> grows<00:04:58.590> out<00:04:58.860> a

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
better in the long run it grows out a

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.080 
better in the long run it grows out a
lot<00:04:59.730> more<00:05:00.000> nicer<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.550> don't<00:05:02.730> have<00:05:02.910> to

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
lot more nicer and you don't have to

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.690 
lot more nicer and you don't have to
worry<00:05:03.330> too<00:05:03.660> much<00:05:03.690> about<00:05:04.110> maintenance<00:05:04.890> when

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
worry too much about maintenance when

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.640 
worry too much about maintenance when
it's<00:05:05.910> cut<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.420> a<00:05:06.540> way<00:05:06.690> where<00:05:06.930> everybody<00:05:07.440> can

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
it's cut in a way where everybody can

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.300 
it's cut in a way where everybody can
maintain<00:05:07.890> it<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.370> same<00:05:09.980> so<00:05:10.980> I'm<00:05:11.130> moving

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
maintain it the same so I'm moving

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.490 
maintain it the same so I'm moving
around<00:05:11.730> to<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.210> right<00:05:12.450> side<00:05:12.720> of<00:05:12.870> my<00:05:12.990> head<00:05:13.020> and

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
around to the right side of my head and

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.950 
around to the right side of my head and
I'm<00:05:14.040> still<00:05:14.310> using<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.790> center<00:05:15.120> point<00:05:15.420> where

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
I'm still using the center point where

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.810 
I'm still using the center point where
her<00:05:16.110> layers<00:05:16.350> are<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.860> shortest<00:05:17.250> as<00:05:17.490> a<00:05:17.520> guide

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
her layers are the shortest as a guide

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.990 
her layers are the shortest as a guide
to<00:05:18.180> basically<00:05:19.020> govern<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:20.010> evenness<00:05:20.550> around

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
to basically govern the evenness around

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.990 
to basically govern the evenness around
her<00:05:21.180> head<00:05:21.420> as<00:05:21.630> you<00:05:22.110> can<00:05:22.290> see<00:05:22.500> my<00:05:23.250> guide<00:05:23.490> is<00:05:23.700> here

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
her head as you can see my guide is here

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.840 
her head as you can see my guide is here
and<00:05:24.210> in<00:05:24.840> there<00:05:25.080> some<00:05:25.620> thinner<00:05:25.860> spots<00:05:26.280> here<00:05:26.670> and

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
and in there some thinner spots here and

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.040 
and in there some thinner spots here and
that's<00:05:27.210> what<00:05:27.330> I'm<00:05:27.420> going<00:05:27.630> to<00:05:27.690> blend<00:05:27.900> in

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
that's what I'm going to blend in

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.070 
that's what I'm going to blend in
together<00:05:28.260> so<00:05:29.190> we'll<00:05:29.400> pull<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.210> hair<00:05:30.420> up<00:05:30.600> to

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
together so we'll pull the hair up to

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:45.970 
together so we'll pull the hair up to
the<00:05:31.200> guide<00:05:31.410> stand<00:05:32.370> it<00:05:32.670> out<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.390> then<00:05:33.870> cut<00:05:34.170> away

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.010 

when<00:05:46.880> you're<00:05:47.030> cutting<00:05:47.210> layers<00:05:47.570> the<00:05:47.840> main

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
when you're cutting layers the main

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.540 
when you're cutting layers the main
thing<00:05:48.260> to<00:05:48.440> remember<00:05:48.680> is<00:05:48.980> that<00:05:49.010> you<00:05:49.280> kind<00:05:49.490> of

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
thing to remember is that you kind of

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.070 
thing to remember is that you kind of
want<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.820> connect<00:05:50.150> the<00:05:50.300> dots<00:05:50.450> you<00:05:50.750> want<00:05:50.960> to

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
want to connect the dots you want to

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.350 
want to connect the dots you want to
connect<00:05:51.470> this<00:05:52.280> point<00:05:52.640> here<00:05:52.910> to<00:05:52.940> this<00:05:53.300> point

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
connect this point here to this point

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.940 
connect this point here to this point
and<00:05:53.870> you<00:05:53.990> don't<00:05:54.140> want<00:05:54.380> to<00:05:54.470> have<00:05:54.650> any

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
and you don't want to have any

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.310 
and you don't want to have any
consistencies<00:05:55.820> in<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.120> hair<00:05:56.360> and<00:05:56.600> between

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
consistencies in the hair and between

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.780 
consistencies in the hair and between
that<00:05:57.500> because<00:05:57.860> when<00:05:58.010> it's<00:05:58.220> laying<00:05:58.460> down

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
that because when it's laying down

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.210 
that because when it's laying down
you'll<00:05:59.480> see<00:05:59.780> that<00:06:00.020> that's<00:06:00.320> where<00:06:00.710> it's<00:06:00.980> either

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
you'll see that that's where it's either

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.950 
you'll see that that's where it's either
going<00:06:01.430> to<00:06:01.490> be<00:06:01.610> too<00:06:01.850> heavy<00:06:02.030> or<00:06:02.210> it's<00:06:02.570> too<00:06:02.690> short

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
going to be too heavy or it's too short

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.410 
going to be too heavy or it's too short
or<00:06:03.250> something's<00:06:04.250> wrong<00:06:04.460> but<00:06:04.730> if<00:06:04.850> you<00:06:05.000> see<00:06:05.240> that

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
or something's wrong but if you see that

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.730 
or something's wrong but if you see that
there's<00:06:05.630> a<00:06:05.870> fool

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
there's a fool

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.130 
there's a fool
concise<00:06:07.490> line<00:06:07.910> going<00:06:08.420> straight<00:06:08.450> down<00:06:08.960> or

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
concise line going straight down or

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.380 
concise line going straight down or
straight<00:06:09.650> around<00:06:09.770> like<00:06:10.280> the<00:06:10.430> fan<00:06:10.670> then<00:06:11.270> you

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
straight around like the fan then you

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.390 
straight around like the fan then you
bring<00:06:11.600> pretty<00:06:11.930> much<00:06:12.110> know<00:06:12.380> that<00:06:13.100> you're
