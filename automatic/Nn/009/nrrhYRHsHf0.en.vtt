CD and that have copy protection using

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.940 
CD and that have copy protection using
clonecd<00:01:37.320> should<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> trick<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.250> fine

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
clonecd should do the trick just fine

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.530 
clonecd should do the trick just fine
however<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.400> all<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> newer<00:01:41.880> games<00:01:42.210> that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
however for all the newer games that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.420 
however for all the newer games that
have<00:01:42.630> been<00:01:42.780> released<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.290> DVD<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.860> recent

have been released on DVD in recent

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.760 
have been released on DVD in recent
years<00:01:44.509> pretty<00:01:45.509> much<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.170> them<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.530> very

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
years pretty much all of them have very

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
years pretty much all of them have very
strong<00:01:47.070> copy<00:01:47.399> protections<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.899> won't<00:01:49.079> be

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
strong copy protections and you won't be

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.630 
strong copy protections and you won't be
able<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.500> copy<00:01:49.710> them<00:01:49.950> with<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> program<00:01:50.430> like

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
able to copy them with a program like

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.100 
able to copy them with a program like
clone<00:01:51.180> CD<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:52.140> they're<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.530> DVD<00:01:53.070> so

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
clone CD because they're on DVD so

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.359 
clone CD because they're on DVD so
really<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.799> quite<00:01:55.950> hard<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
really it's going to be quite hard to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.190 
really it's going to be quite hard to
make<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> copy<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.090> these<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.659> you'll<00:01:58.079> just

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
make a copy of these and you'll just

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.870 
make a copy of these and you'll just
