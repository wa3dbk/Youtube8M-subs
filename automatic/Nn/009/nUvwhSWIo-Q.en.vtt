and I'm gonna get a twist I'm gonna slip

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.700 
and I'm gonna get a twist I'm gonna slip
on<00:01:45.400> a<00:01:45.700> jump<00:01:46.240> ring<00:01:46.480> and<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.200> reason<00:01:47.470> why<00:01:47.590> we

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
on a jump ring and the reason why we

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.140 
on a jump ring and the reason why we
want<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.920> use<00:01:48.010> closed<00:01:48.280> jump<00:01:48.550> rings<00:01:48.820> is<00:01:49.000> the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
want to use closed jump rings is the

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.630 
want to use closed jump rings is the
open<00:01:49.480> ones<00:01:49.660> tend<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.140> come<00:01:50.380> apart<00:01:50.740> so<00:01:51.010> that's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
open ones tend to come apart so that's

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.730 
open ones tend to come apart so that's
why<00:01:51.790> we<00:01:51.940> want<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.120> use<00:01:52.240> closed<00:01:52.510> ones<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.320> the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
why we want to use closed ones and the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.050 
why we want to use closed ones and the
first<00:01:53.950> thing<00:01:54.100> I'm<00:01:54.190> going<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.370> do<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.730> close

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
first thing I'm going to do is close

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.110 
first thing I'm going to do is close
this<00:01:55.390> wrap<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:59.320> just<00:01:59.350> wrap<00:02:00.010> it<00:02:00.040> around

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
this wrap and just wrap it around

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.030 
this wrap and just wrap it around
three<00:02:03.020> or<00:02:03.110> four<00:02:03.140> times<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.680> want<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:03.860> try<00:02:03.980> to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
three or four times you want to try to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.420 
three or four times you want to try to
stay<00:02:04.250> consistent<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:04.970> if<00:02:05.000> you<00:02:05.120> wrap<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.450> three

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
stay consistent so if you wrap it three

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.740 
stay consistent so if you wrap it three
four<00:02:07.430> times<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.000> want<00:02:08.150> to<00:02:08.240> do<00:02:08.300> that<00:02:08.450> every

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
four times and you want to do that every

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.490 
four times and you want to do that every
time<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:10.670> then<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.850> next<00:02:11.060> thing<00:02:11.150> we<00:02:11.300> do<00:02:11.500> we're

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
time and then the next thing we do we're

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
go start the loop before I close it I

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.080 
go start the loop before I close it I
want<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.150> link<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.450> into<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.960> next<00:02:50.260> jump<00:02:50.470> ring

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
want to link it into the next jump ring

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.450 
want to link it into the next jump ring
this<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.150> where<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.480> get<00:02:52.660> confused<00:02:53.280> usually<00:02:54.280> and

closed you never have to open this side
again<00:05:37.020> this<00:05:38.020> sides<00:05:38.290> still<00:05:38.560> open<00:05:38.950> slightly<00:05:39.670> and

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
again this sides still open slightly and

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.200 
again this sides still open slightly and
what<00:05:40.510> it'll<00:05:40.660> do<00:05:40.870> is<00:05:41.050> it'll<00:05:41.230> hook<00:05:41.410> in<00:05:41.970> this<00:05:42.970> side

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
what it'll do is it'll hook in this side

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.230 
what it'll do is it'll hook in this side
and<00:05:43.450> since<00:05:43.900> that's<00:05:44.110> a<00:05:44.230> little<00:05:44.440> loose<00:05:45.240> you

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
and since that's a little loose you

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.180 
and since that's a little loose you
might<00:05:46.450> want<00:05:46.660> to<00:05:46.720> close<00:05:46.900> it<00:05:46.990> just<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.920> little<00:05:48.070> bit

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
might want to close it just a little bit

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.920 
might want to close it just a little bit
so<00:05:48.490> that<00:05:48.640> there's<00:05:48.820> a<00:05:48.880> little<00:05:49.120> tension<00:05:49.510> trying

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
so that there's a little tension trying

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.110 
so that there's a little tension trying
to<00:05:50.050> get<00:05:50.230> it<00:05:50.320> on<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:50.620> off<00:05:50.740> that<00:05:51.700> way<00:05:51.820> it's<00:05:51.970> less

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
to get it on and off that way it's less

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.340 
to get it on and off that way it's less
likely<00:05:52.330> to<00:05:52.480> fall<00:05:52.750> off<00:05:52.930> when<00:05:53.050> you're<00:05:53.200> wearing

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
likely to fall off when you're wearing

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.750 
likely to fall off when you're wearing
it<00:05:53.500> and<00:05:54.010> then<00:05:54.130> you've<00:05:54.250> completed<00:05:54.640> your

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
it and then you've completed your

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.210 
it and then you've completed your
bracelet
