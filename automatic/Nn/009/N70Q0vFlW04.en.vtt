00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.109 
up until he look it's not that great of
gameplay<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.290> don't<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.490> will<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> think

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
gameplay I don't do that will I think

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.420 
gameplay I don't do that will I think
I'm<00:01:21.299> nine<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.659> nine<00:01:22.140> when<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> shelter<00:01:22.860> nuke

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
I'm nine and nine when the shelter nuke

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.620 
I'm nine and nine when the shelter nuke
starts<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.740> i'll<00:01:25.740> give<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.909> link<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
starts so i'll give you a link in the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.440 
starts so i'll give you a link in the
video

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
video

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.149 
video
where<00:01:28.719> the<00:01:28.990> killstreak<00:01:29.409> starts<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:29.979> can

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
where the killstreak starts and you can

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.440 
where the killstreak starts and you can
skip<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.579> quality<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.680> anyway<00:01:33.250> what<00:01:34.210> I

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
skip the quality so anyway what I

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.499 
skip the quality so anyway what I
recommend<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.200> do<00:01:35.350> on<00:01:35.770> wasteland<00:01:36.759> or<00:01:37.149> any<00:01:37.270> map

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
recommend to do on wasteland or any map

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.469 
recommend to do on wasteland or any map
like<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:37.960> is<00:01:38.409> to<00:01:38.829> not<00:01:39.100> go<00:01:39.520> in<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.880> middle<00:01:40.179> like

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
like it is to not go in the middle like

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.840 
like it is to not go in the middle like
this<00:01:41.189> because<00:01:43.799> staying<00:01:44.799> on<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.100> sides<00:01:45.399> means

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
this because staying on the sides means

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.399 
this because staying on the sides means
that<00:01:46.149> you're<00:01:46.299> going<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.569> die<00:01:46.750> much<00:01:47.079> less

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
that you're going to die much less

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.700 
that you're going to die much less
because<00:01:48.090> people<00:01:49.090> will<00:01:49.539> not<00:01:49.750> be<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:50.110> year

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
because people will not be a year

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.050 
because people will not be a year
they're<00:01:50.979> going<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.189> be<00:01:51.280> focusing<00:01:51.490> on<00:01:51.850> the

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
they're going to be focusing on the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.760 
they're going to be focusing on the
center<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.569> happy<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:55.210> not<00:01:55.689> a<00:01:56.079> lot<00:01:56.740> of

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
center you happy and you not a lot of

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.219 
center you happy and you not a lot of
action<00:01:57.310> you're<00:01:57.460> less<00:01:57.939> actions<00:01:58.420> happening<00:01:58.840> on

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
action you're less actions happening on

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.320 
action you're less actions happening on
the<00:01:59.439> edges<00:01:59.860> which<00:02:00.549> means<00:02:00.789> you<00:02:00.939> can<00:02:01.119> pick

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
the edges which means you can pick

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.020 
the edges which means you can pick
people<00:02:01.720> off<00:02:01.840> four<00:02:02.110> volumes<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.740> center<00:02:03.130> now

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
people off four volumes the center now

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.479 
people off four volumes the center now
here<00:02:04.959> I<00:02:05.579> don't<00:02:06.579> think<00:02:06.909> I<00:02:07.149> go<00:02:07.899> to<00:02:07.959> the<00:02:08.319> edges<00:02:08.679> or

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
here I don't think I go to the edges or

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.259 
here I don't think I go to the edges or
I<00:02:09.519> try<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:09.940> make<00:02:10.299> it<00:02:10.329> shot<00:02:10.690> because<00:02:12.269> actually

when<00:05:01.599> I<00:05:01.719> was<00:05:01.900> another<00:05:02.110> shoot<00:05:02.349> here<00:05:02.729> that's

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
when I was another shoot here that's

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.070 
when I was another shoot here that's
really<00:05:03.939> annoying<00:05:04.180> when<00:05:04.389> you<00:05:04.599> shoot<00:05:04.840> someone

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
really annoying when you shoot someone

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.890 
really annoying when you shoot someone
and<00:05:05.529> then<00:05:06.270> someone<00:05:07.270> else<00:05:07.419> kills<00:05:07.719> them<00:05:07.870> first

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
and then someone else kills them first

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.119 
and then someone else kills them first
so<00:05:08.500> that<00:05:08.830> just<00:05:09.069> gives<00:05:09.129> me<00:05:09.340> a<00:05:10.620> nice<00:05:11.620> little<00:05:11.919> head
