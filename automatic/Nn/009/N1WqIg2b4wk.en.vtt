00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
does is they use their wave system and

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.629 
does is they use their wave system and
they<00:00:13.110> use<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.740> most<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.309> their<00:00:14.429> running

they use this in most of their running
shoes<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.420> see<00:00:15.570> with<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.900> Nirvana<00:00:16.470> the

shoes you can see with this Nirvana the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.740 
shoes you can see with this Nirvana the
wave<00:00:17.070> plate<00:00:17.400> actually<00:00:17.789> starts<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
wave plate actually starts up in the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.420 
wave plate actually starts up in the
forefoot<00:00:19.230> different<00:00:19.980> than<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> Waverider

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
forefoot different than the Waverider

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.939 
forefoot different than the Waverider
and<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.449> inspire<00:00:21.930> we're<00:00:22.380> starting<00:00:22.680> up<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
and the inspire we're starting up in the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.950 
and the inspire we're starting up in the
forefoot<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.880> wave<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.240> accomplishing

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
forefoot what the wave is accomplishing

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.019 
forefoot what the wave is accomplishing
is<00:00:25.140> its<00:00:25.350> dispersing<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> force<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.670> energy

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
is its dispersing the force and energy

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.550 
is its dispersing the force and energy
when<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.390> come<00:00:27.599> down<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.900> your<00:00:27.960> forefoot

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
when you come down on your forefoot

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.470 
when you come down on your forefoot
throughout<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.279> whole<00:00:29.490> shoe<00:00:29.820> also<00:00:30.150> when

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
throughout the whole shoe also when

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.880 
throughout the whole shoe also when
you're<00:00:30.570> coming<00:00:30.689> down<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.929> heel<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.650> just

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
you're coming down the heel it just

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.430 
you're coming down the heel it just
disperses<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.000> energy<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> lot<00:00:33.600> better<00:00:33.870> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
disperses that energy a lot better so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.530 
disperses that energy a lot better so
you<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.800> starts<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:35.399> comes<00:00:36.149> all<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
you can see it starts here comes all the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.750 
you can see it starts here comes all the
way<00:00:36.570> through<00:00:37.050> comes<00:00:37.590> around<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.430> see<00:00:38.640> on

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
way through comes around and you see on

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.450 
way through comes around and you see on
the<00:00:38.850> medial<00:00:39.210> side<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.989> wave<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.460> exaggerated

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the medial side the wave is exaggerated

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.639 
the medial side the wave is exaggerated
and<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:41.879> that's<00:00:42.059> doing<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.750> helping<00:00:43.170> control

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and what that's doing is helping control

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.529 
and what that's doing is helping control
that<00:00:43.800> pronation<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.640> your<00:00:44.850> foot<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> ankle

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
that pronation as your foot and ankle

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.770 
that pronation as your foot and ankle
roll<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.190> really<00:00:47.460> sets<00:00:48.090> back<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> little

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
roll in and it really sets back a little

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.020 
roll in and it really sets back a little
bit<00:00:48.899> further<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.829> arch<00:00:50.039> controlling<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
bit further on the arch controlling that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.209 
bit further on the arch controlling that
heel<00:00:51.360> bone<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.170> see<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.710> comes<00:00:52.949> up<00:00:53.070> back

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
heel bone as you see is it comes up back

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.860 
heel bone as you see is it comes up back
up<00:00:53.370> into<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> forefoot<00:00:53.940> there's<00:00:54.180> an<00:00:54.329> extra

fit<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.710> helps<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.100> wrap<00:01:44.310> around<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.729> foot

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
fit just helps it wrap around that foot

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.630 
fit just helps it wrap around that foot
very<00:01:45.329> nicely<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.170> nothing<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.920> really

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
very nicely and nothing is really

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.910 
very nicely and nothing is really
pushing<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.299> top<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.810> foot<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.530> go

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
pushing on top of the foot as you go

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.440 
pushing on top of the foot as you go
through<00:01:50.130> your<00:01:50.189> gait<00:01:50.369> cycle<00:01:50.610> off<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> toe<00:01:51.210> off

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
through your gait cycle off a toe off

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.469 
through your gait cycle off a toe off
there<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.350> overall<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.040> wave<00:01:53.460> nirvana<00:01:53.909> really

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
there so overall the wave nirvana really

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.929 
there so overall the wave nirvana really
just<00:01:54.659> has<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> nice<00:01:55.200> snug<00:01:55.829> fit<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.670> their

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.979 
will hold up longer than the shoe you
can<00:02:20.769> see<00:02:21.010> here<00:02:21.489> these<00:02:21.730> little<00:02:22.060> pods<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.810> guess

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
can see here these little pods I guess

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.869 
can see here these little pods I guess
you<00:02:23.140> can<00:02:23.260> say<00:02:23.530> they're<00:02:23.739> called<00:02:23.920> sensor<00:02:24.430> points

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
you can say they're called sensor points

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.270 
you can say they're called sensor points
right<00:02:25.239> here<00:02:25.269> right<00:02:25.780> here<00:02:26.140> right<00:02:26.290> here<00:02:26.590> right

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
here right here if you could feel them

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.289 
here right here if you could feel them
they're<00:02:29.319> pretty<00:02:29.890> rigid<00:02:30.340> there<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.060> very

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
they're pretty rigid there it's a very

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.410 
they're pretty rigid there it's a very
solid<00:02:31.930> durable<00:02:32.200> nylon<00:02:32.860> plastic<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.030> it's

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
solid durable nylon plastic and it's

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.569 
solid durable nylon plastic and it's
actually<00:02:34.810> attached<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.099> inside

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
actually attached to the to the inside

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.520 
actually attached to the to the inside
wave<00:02:36.940> system<00:02:37.629> and<00:02:37.870> what<00:02:38.079> they've<00:02:38.230> done<00:02:38.470> here

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
wave system and what they've done here

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.380 
wave system and what they've done here
is<00:02:38.859> put<00:02:39.099> these<00:02:39.549> here<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:39.940> give<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.239> little

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
is put these here to give you a little

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.660 
is put these here to give you a little
bit<00:02:40.569> more<00:02:40.810> stability<00:02:41.170> as<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:42.189> pronator<00:02:42.519> is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
bit more stability as the pronator is

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.339 
bit more stability as the pronator is
going<00:02:42.879> through<00:02:43.090> its<00:02:43.209> gait<00:02:43.420> cycle<00:02:43.720> they're

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
going through its gait cycle they're

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.869 
going through its gait cycle they're
doing<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:44.769> medial<00:02:45.159> side<00:02:45.400> here<00:02:45.670> so

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
doing it on this medial side here so

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.210 
doing it on this medial side here so
back<00:02:46.359> of<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.569> heel<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.049> then<00:02:47.230> also<00:02:47.709> coming<00:02:48.069> up

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
back of the heel and then also coming up

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.430 
back of the heel and then also coming up
into<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.640> forefoot<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.540> somebody's<00:02:50.019> rolling

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
into the forefoot so somebody's rolling

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.960 
into the forefoot so somebody's rolling
through<00:02:50.620> their<00:02:50.769> gait<00:02:50.980> cycle<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.849> the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
through their gait cycle and the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.190 
through their gait cycle and the
pronator<00:02:52.299> since<00:02:52.569> they're<00:02:52.720> kind<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:52.959> rolling

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
pronator since they're kind of rolling

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.530 
pronator since they're kind of rolling
in<00:02:53.590> these<00:02:54.010> sensor<00:02:54.370> points<00:02:54.730> just<00:02:55.209> give<00:02:55.359> it<00:02:55.480> a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
in these sensor points just give it a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.410 
in these sensor points just give it a
little<00:02:55.780> bit<00:02:55.989> more<00:02:56.349> stability<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:57.459> also

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
little bit more stability and also

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.839 
little bit more stability and also
traction<00:02:59.049> as<00:02:59.230> somebody's<00:03:00.040> coming<00:03:00.310> off<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.459> and

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
traction as somebody's coming off of and

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.520 
traction as somebody's coming off of and
putting<00:03:01.060> extra<00:03:01.209> pressure<00:03:01.299> on<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.109> inside<00:03:02.500> of

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
putting extra pressure on the inside of
