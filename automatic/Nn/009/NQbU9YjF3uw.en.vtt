00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 he wants to be his champion team 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.890
 have and and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.900
 and team of players he chooses from 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.750
 to play against 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.500
 so the champion team against but also 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.150
 all of them 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.770
 players we have fc twente 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.490
 football but intent 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.430
 actually your champion's hair 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.869
 team on location to get with with 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.760
 with the remains where I all have more 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.609
 You have felt your tent in a recent one 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.120
 just for 100 becomes big names 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.800
 Ronald de Boer John Bosman through forest field 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.920
 jan gaasbeek fred rutten other pope 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:45.090
 england the angels hellema who 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.039
 eljero elia and novich 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.670
 comfort of course but good here this 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.670
 crucial 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.430
 yes very nice an appropriate if you like 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.739
 play in that chip that has been around for so long 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.480
 and so by the way to a club with the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.890
 exception that idea has that with ajax 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.719
 has been 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.379
 yes that is that is that you never do that 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.670
 more with it 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.920
 and therefore I really don't find it anymore 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.760
 then rightly so that the sander that would 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.020
 to get 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.340
 just a foreign once again 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.680
 very nice that I can be there 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.159
 because he has me late for the question 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.810
 so that I really think it's a wonderful yes 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.860
 building of twente and also to one 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.930
 without a good reliable pan 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.960
 I still think that is very clever 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.009
 he has performed say so when I 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.610
 can walk in here today gently 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.049
 can partly handle van van cooth oh yes me 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.350
 I am curious what will come out sensibly 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.110
 as 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.390
 course of statue then I am 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.799
 wondering what sander gets because yes that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.049
 is of course much more than coming here 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.220
 thank you for we have to go a bit 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.570
 start still empty I fear and help you 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.310
 must be able to lead it off 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.070
 there is more in the short corner and bosker 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.600
 there may still be three jobs there 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.310
 good ring from the bosker in the latter 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.840
 minute as a free kick should 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.710
 take on sand bosker the will succeed 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.710
 shame the fuse 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.070
 So kazan them against the weapons of dancing 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.479
 scored alley from bosker 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.860
 I have sometimes scored an opponent 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.240
 but I don't know if freedom of choice 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.340
 fired duty for that I don't know 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.340
 but i do know i shot 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.560
 if you want this point and you can join 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.000
 then try another free kick 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.020
 would rather not play against him i play 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.720
 rather with him and yes this also depends 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.360
 angles then not frost mx but I go 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.030
 anyway a few minutes more bumpy 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.410
 if necessary on a stool but yes I go 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.970
 anyway a few minutes in the middle 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.320
 i think sanne just needs a big one 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.960
 be a party 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.340
 and I think that should be good 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.350
 will admit at the time the flute 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.300
 goes wild that we will be in 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.410
 so that the so yes we will do it like me 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.540
 there just has to be a party for that 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.970
 him and for the club and I think it 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.290
 a very beautiful yes yes, they have tony 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.360
 but for him what he already one 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.709
 has meant for this club and one 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.230
 which I have every success 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.350
 experienced at 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.660
 yes it is nice bosker with theo janssen 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.610
 and andrÃ© ooijer 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.800
 experienced rotting together I have 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.650
 Farewell the matches that of players 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.380
 and so on this that do not have 25 years 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.240
 sat at a club we do not have the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.920
 widget should be bigger to just throws in 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.739
 mean yes nicest are here it falls one 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.190
 is full and there I hope 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.320
 anyway that it kills people 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.480
 to show him the last aspects 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.040
 And yes that you just like that very much 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.510
 People come up to it and it a lot 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.310
 cozy belongs in that very many players 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.989
 are to 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.940
 to turn it to the front reading again 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.660
 so to see at work 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.660
 population of fitters
