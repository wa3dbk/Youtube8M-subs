aside from standard options but also

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.990 
aside from standard options but also
many<00:01:39.990> variations<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.829> example<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.759> get

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
many variations for example you get

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.580 
many variations for example you get
standard<00:01:42.360> weapons<00:01:42.509> switches<00:01:43.049> such<00:01:43.350> as

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
standard weapons switches such as

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.109 
standard weapons switches such as
instead<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.070> having<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.369> struggle<00:01:44.549> shotgun<00:01:44.970> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
instead of having a struggle shotgun you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.569 
instead of having a struggle shotgun you
have<00:01:45.360> akimbo<00:01:45.720> magnums<00:01:46.259> which<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.189> pretty<00:01:47.399> cool

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
have akimbo magnums which is pretty cool

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.580 
have akimbo magnums which is pretty cool
actually<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.180> changes<00:01:48.750> gameplay<00:01:49.079> quite<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> bit

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
actually it changes gameplay quite a bit

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.499 
actually it changes gameplay quite a bit
and<00:01:49.770> changes<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> way<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.759> play<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
and changes the way you play and

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.490 
and changes the way you play and
conscience<00:01:52.140> or<00:01:52.290> certain<00:01:52.560> important<00:01:52.860> which

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
conscience or certain important which

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.950 
conscience or certain important which
so<00:01:53.650> anyone<00:01:53.890> who<00:01:53.980> comes<00:01:54.100> at<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.960> however

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
so anyone who comes at you however

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.570 
so anyone who comes at you however
they'll<00:01:56.230> so<00:01:56.530> if<00:01:56.650> you've<00:01:56.770> actually<00:01:57.100> really

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
they'll so if you've actually really

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.130 
they'll so if you've actually really
changed<00:01:57.820> gameplay<00:01:58.210> for<00:01:58.480> example<00:01:58.930> this<00:01:59.080> one

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
changed gameplay for example this one

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.050 
changed gameplay for example this one
which<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.620> my<00:01:59.860> personal<00:02:00.070> favorite<00:02:00.250> if<00:02:00.910> he

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
which is my personal favorite if he

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.030 
which is my personal favorite if he
infected<00:02:01.480> all<00:02:01.810> have<00:02:02.050> juggernaut<00:02:02.470> suits<00:02:02.770> so

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
infected all have juggernaut suits so

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.370 
infected all have juggernaut suits so
they<00:02:03.280> have<00:02:03.460> much<00:02:03.790> more<00:02:03.820> health<00:02:04.270> however<00:02:04.810> to

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
they have much more health however to

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.990 
they have much more health however to
counter<00:02:05.800> this<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.100> survivors<00:02:06.610> will<00:02:06.850> have

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
counter this the survivors will have

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.910 
counter this the survivors will have
heaven<00:02:07.300> weaponry<00:02:07.660> such<00:02:07.930> as<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.350> lmg<00:02:08.710> you<00:02:08.770> can

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
heaven weaponry such as the lmg you can

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.710 
heaven weaponry such as the lmg you can
see<00:02:09.070> here<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.550> as<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:09.970> secondary<00:02:10.450> they<00:02:10.630> have

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
see here and as a secondary they have

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.440 
see here and as a secondary they have
RPGs<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:12.220> as<00:02:12.490> usual<00:02:12.880> once<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.209> get<00:02:13.330> enough

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
RPGs then as usual once you get enough

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.030 
RPGs then as usual once you get enough
uninfected<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.230> become<00:02:14.500> one<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.680> them<00:02:14.830> you

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
uninfected you become one of them you

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.350 
uninfected you become one of them you
get<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.220> job<00:02:15.370> not<00:02:15.520> suit<00:02:15.760> which<00:02:16.030> means<00:02:16.300> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
get the job not suit which means you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.640 
get the job not suit which means you
have<00:02:16.480> loads<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.780> health<00:02:16.990> but<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.230> move<00:02:17.380> really

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
have loads of health but you move really

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.949 
have loads of health but you move really
slowly<00:02:17.920> now<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:18.880> third<00:02:19.180> variation<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.780> pretty

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
slowly now the third variation is pretty

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.360 
slowly now the third variation is pretty
much<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.110> exact<00:02:20.470> opposite<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.950> last<00:02:21.130> one

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
much the exact opposite the last one

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.800 
much the exact opposite the last one
each<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.850> these<00:02:21.910> fibers<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.420> given<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.690> drug

for<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.630> change<00:02:25.810> after<00:02:26.020> you<00:02:26.080> have<00:02:26.170> shotguns

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
for a change after you have shotguns

for a change after you have shotguns
which<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.400> completely<00:02:27.880> different<00:02:28.360> as<00:02:28.540> it

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
which is completely different as it

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.120 
which is completely different as it
means<00:02:28.840> they<00:02:28.989> can<00:02:29.140> call<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.380> from<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.620> range<00:02:29.830> of

means they can call you from a range of
course<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:30.760> means<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.150> survivors<00:02:31.630> have

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
course this means the survivors have

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.540 
course this means the survivors have
more<00:02:32.080> help<00:02:32.320> how<00:02:32.560> they<00:02:32.770> move<00:02:32.980> really<00:02:33.280> slowly

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
more help how they move really slowly

people always flock to so they're

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.580 
people always flock to so they're
basically<00:02:57.970> untouchable<00:02:58.630> by<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.019> infected

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
basically untouchable by the infected

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.759 
basically untouchable by the infected
and<00:03:00.160> it's<00:03:01.090> really<00:03:01.510> annoying<00:03:01.660> because<00:03:02.110> every

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
and it's really annoying because every

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.259 
and it's really annoying because every
single<00:03:03.070> player<00:03:03.250> on<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.459> survivor<00:03:03.760> team<00:03:04.000> just

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
single player on the survivor team just

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.750 
single player on the survivor team just
goes<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.140> that<00:03:05.290> point<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.769> it<00:03:06.280> makes<00:03:06.459> and

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
goes to that point and it makes and

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.220 
goes to that point and it makes and
basically<00:03:07.030> impossible<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.780> kill<00:03:07.900> for<00:03:08.110> be

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
basically impossible to kill for be

basically impossible to kill for be
infected<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:09.250> basically<00:03:09.430> ruins<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.209> game

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
infected it basically ruins the game

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.870 
infected it basically ruins the game
mode<00:03:10.630> in<00:03:10.810> my<00:03:10.930> opinion<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:12.519> would<00:03:12.700> have<00:03:12.820> been

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
mode in my opinion it would have been

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.490 
mode in my opinion it would have been
nice<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.150> see<00:03:13.510> infinity<00:03:14.140> will<00:03:14.260> somehow

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
nice to see infinity will somehow

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.509
