00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
basically hair typing is just a system

that<00:00:38.489> people<00:00:38.820> came<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.180> with<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.960> be

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109 
that people came up with so it can be

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.520 
that people came up with so it can be
like<00:00:40.289> oh<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.609> type<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.480> hair<00:00:42.839> you<00:00:43.260> have

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
that is what it is and that's what it's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.060 
that is what it is and that's what it's
supposed<00:01:01.769> to<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.339> some<00:01:02.969> might<00:01:03.149> ask<00:01:03.420> why<00:01:04.350> hair

typing<00:01:05.549> became<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> thing<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.750> assume<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.740> was

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
typing became a thing I assume it was

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.160 
typing became a thing I assume it was
just<00:01:08.069> so<00:01:08.190> that<00:01:08.460> people<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:09.030> find<00:01:09.240> others<00:01:09.780> with

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
just so that people can find others with

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.529 
just so that people can find others with
similar<00:01:10.500> hair<00:01:10.920> textures<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.580> theirs<00:01:11.940> and

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
similar hair textures to theirs and

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.359 
similar hair textures to theirs and
maybe<00:01:12.960> they<00:01:13.200> figure<00:01:13.560> oh<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.069> the<00:01:14.159> same

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
maybe they figure oh we have the same

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.969 
maybe they figure oh we have the same
hair<00:01:14.640> type<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.530> use<00:01:16.679> the<00:01:16.800> same

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
hair type so we can use the same

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.550 
hair type so we can use the same
products<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.789> my<00:01:18.360> twist<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.929> will<00:01:19.170> look<00:01:19.350> like

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
products or my twist out will look like

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.290 
products or my twist out will look like
yours<00:01:19.920> list<00:01:20.190> out<00:01:20.369> because<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.149> same

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
yours list out because we have the same

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.080 
yours list out because we have the same
hair<00:01:21.360> type<00:01:21.899> or<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.280> oh<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.550> have<00:01:23.909> your

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
hair type or you know oh I have your

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.109 
hair type or you know oh I have your
hair<00:01:24.300> type<00:01:24.569> so<00:01:24.929> when<00:01:25.740> my<00:01:25.860> hair<00:01:26.069> grows<00:01:26.340> longer<00:01:26.729> I

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
hair type so when my hair grows longer I

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.059 
hair type so when my hair grows longer I
should<00:01:27.330> expect<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.960> look<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.170> yours<00:01:28.740> all

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
should expect it to look like yours all

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.100 
should expect it to look like yours all
of<00:01:29.340> which<00:01:29.580> you<00:01:30.090> should<00:01:30.119> definitely<00:01:30.600> avoid

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
of which you should definitely avoid

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.340 
of which you should definitely avoid
doing<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:33.060> use<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.929> certain

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
doing just because I use a certain

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.949 
doing just because I use a certain
product<00:01:35.149> doesn't<00:01:36.149> mean<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:36.539> your<00:01:36.750> hair<00:01:36.929> is

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:36.959 
product doesn't mean that your hair is

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:38.809 
product doesn't mean that your hair is
gonna<00:01:37.259> react<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.709> same<00:01:37.890> way<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.549> product

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
gonna react the same way to that product

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.760 
gonna react the same way to that product
I<00:01:39.149> think<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.539> lot<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.780> people<00:01:40.020> need<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.409> really

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
I think a lot of people need to really

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.370 
I think a lot of people need to really
back<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.219> and<00:01:41.670> realize<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.509> hair<00:01:42.750> typing<00:01:43.200> is

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
back in and realize that hair typing is

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.300 
back in and realize that hair typing is
just<00:01:44.039> a<00:01:44.219> generalization<00:01:44.969> it<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.380> exact<00:01:47.009> in

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
just a generalization it is not exact in

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.429 
just a generalization it is not exact in
any<00:01:47.729> way<00:01:47.939> shape<00:01:48.149> or<00:01:48.329> form<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.960> actually<00:01:49.409> I

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
any way shape or form and actually I

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.260 
any way shape or form and actually I
think<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.829> whole<00:01:50.009> hair<00:01:50.340> typing<00:01:50.729> system<00:01:50.880> is

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
think the whole hair typing system is

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.539 
think the whole hair typing system is
pretty<00:01:51.570> flawed<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.009> does<00:01:53.280> nothing

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
pretty flawed because it does nothing

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.420 
pretty flawed because it does nothing
but<00:01:54.000> tells<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.570> your<00:01:55.200> curl<00:01:55.439> pattern<00:01:55.859> it<00:01:56.189> says

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
but tells you your curl pattern it says

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.609 
but tells you your curl pattern it says
your<00:01:56.609> texture<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.719> your<00:01:57.840> texture<00:01:58.229> refers<00:01:58.590> to

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
your texture but your texture refers to

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.950 
your texture but your texture refers to
the<00:01:59.009> individual<00:01:59.609> strands<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.329> your<00:02:00.479> hair<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the individual strands on your hair and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.080 
the individual strands on your hair and
the<00:02:01.079> thickness<00:02:01.409> or<00:02:01.740> thinness<00:02:02.039> of<00:02:02.460> them<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the thickness or thinness of them so

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.880 
the thickness or thinness of them so
it's<00:02:03.210> not<00:02:03.299> really<00:02:03.689> your<00:02:03.840> texture<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.619> just

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
it's not really your texture it's just

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.730 
it's not really your texture it's just
your<00:02:05.369> curl<00:02:05.670> pattern<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.409> let's<00:02:07.409> all<00:02:07.560> be

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
your curl pattern and let's all be

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.199 
your curl pattern and let's all be
honest<00:02:08.070> just<00:02:08.459> because<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.850> have<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.060> same

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
honest just because we have the same

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.140 
honest just because we have the same
curl<00:02:09.509> pattern<00:02:09.869> does<00:02:10.019> not<00:02:10.049> mean<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.709> have

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
curl pattern does not mean that we have

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.290 
curl pattern does not mean that we have
