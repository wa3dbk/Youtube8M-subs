we<00:00:34.170> use<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> piano<00:00:34.620> basically<00:00:35.250> as<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> prop

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700

looks like he's here actually like doing
something<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.840> working<00:00:46.410> which<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.860> haven't

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
something and working which I haven't

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.799 
something and working which I haven't
you<00:00:47.579> know<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.879> kind<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.120> overall<00:00:48.570> leads

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
you know just kind of like overall leads

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.660 
you know just kind of like overall leads
to<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> believability<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.250> photo<00:00:50.579> shoot

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670

itself<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> overall<00:00:51.899> concept<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.469> just

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
itself so the overall concept was just

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.590 
itself so the overall concept was just
create<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> relatively<00:00:53.760> natural-looking

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
create like a relatively natural-looking

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.900 
create like a relatively natural-looking
portrait<00:00:55.140> based<00:00:55.530> around<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.489> piano<00:00:56.699> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
portrait based around the piano and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.820 
we're focusing on one big prop and in
this<00:01:17.970> case<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.630> piano<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.530> behind

this case it's the piano that's behind
us<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.310> sitting<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.880> room

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
already and we thought it might be

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.789 
already and we thought it might be
pretty<00:01:23.100> interesting<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.790> use<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.140> doing

changed<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> little<00:01:46.770> bit<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> little

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
changed a little bit to be like a little

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.980 
changed a little bit to be like a little
bit<00:01:47.790> lighter<00:01:48.060> color<00:01:48.329> maybe<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.810> bit

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
bit lighter color maybe a little bit

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.920 
bit lighter color maybe a little bit
more<00:01:49.619> casual<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> top<00:01:51.750> maybe

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
more casual because this is a top maybe

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.870 
more casual because this is a top maybe
like<00:01:52.200> you're<00:01:52.560> sitting<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.100> basement<00:01:53.460> or

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
like you're sitting in a basement or

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.179 
like you're sitting in a basement or
something<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.299> composing<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.500> song<00:01:55.950> or

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
something like that composing a song or

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.039 
something like that composing a song or
writing<00:01:56.430> some<00:01:56.610> lyrics<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.540> props<00:01:57.780> kind<00:01:57.990> of

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
writing some lyrics so the props kind of

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.600 
writing some lyrics so the props kind of
like<00:01:58.170> build<00:01:58.469> into<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> concept<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.460> vice

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
like build into the concept and vice

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.039 
like build into the concept and vice
versa<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.240> our<00:02:00.329> camera<00:02:00.570> settings<00:02:00.689> for<00:02:00.960> this

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
versa so our camera settings for this

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.630 
versa so our camera settings for this
shot<00:02:01.200> we're<00:02:01.350> shooting<00:02:01.590> at<00:02:01.680> 1-over<00:02:02.100> sixtieth

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
shot we're shooting at 1-over sixtieth

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.069 
shot we're shooting at 1-over sixtieth
of<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.759> second<00:02:03.030> which<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.329> still<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> relatively

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
of a second which is still a relatively

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.660 
of a second which is still a relatively
low<00:02:04.380> shutter<00:02:04.740> speed<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.130> wanted<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.490> make<00:02:05.640> sure

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
low shutter speed I wanted to make sure

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.190 
low shutter speed I wanted to make sure
a<00:02:05.820> lot<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.210> light<00:02:06.390> from<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> lamp<00:02:06.780> is

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
a lot of the light from the lamp is

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.770 
a lot of the light from the lamp is
actually<00:02:07.950> lighting<00:02:08.940> our<00:02:09.090> subject<00:02:09.479> here<00:02:09.629> we

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
actually lighting our subject here we

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.660 
actually lighting our subject here we
are<00:02:09.810> using<00:02:10.110> strobes<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.800> case<00:02:10.979> but<00:02:11.250> we're

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
are using strobes in this case but we're

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.940 
are using strobes in this case but we're
okay<00:02:11.910> using<00:02:12.150> some<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.629> light

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
okay using some of the light

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.949 
okay using some of the light
from<00:02:13.129> a<00:02:13.400> lamp<00:02:13.879> here<00:02:14.060> we're<00:02:14.360> also<00:02:14.599> shooting<00:02:14.780> at

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
from a lamp here we're also shooting at

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.259 
from a lamp here we're also shooting at
1.4<00:02:15.739> aperture<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:16.580> it's<00:02:16.730> super<00:02:17.090> shallow

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
1.4 aperture so it's super shallow

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:17.890 
1.4 aperture so it's super shallow
depth-of-field

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
depth-of-field

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.420 
depth-of-field
again<00:02:18.410> we're<00:02:18.560> focusing<00:02:18.890> directly<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.400> our

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
again we're focusing directly on our

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.009 
again we're focusing directly on our
subject<00:02:19.879> add<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.269> little<00:02:20.540> tip<00:02:20.720> when<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:20.930> guys

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
subject add a little tip when you guys

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.360 
subject add a little tip when you guys
are<00:02:21.170> doing<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:21.440> if<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:21.980> don't<00:02:22.069> want<00:02:22.250> your

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
are doing this if you don't want your

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.860 
are doing this if you don't want your
subject<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.879> middle<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.660> frame

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
subject in the middle of the frame

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.780 
subject in the middle of the frame
sometimes<00:02:24.290> we'll<00:02:24.470> do<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> focus<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.250> then<00:02:25.400> move

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
sometimes we'll do a focus and then move

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.100 
sometimes we'll do a focus and then move
recompose<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.599> then<00:02:26.690> take<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.989> picture

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
recompose and then take the picture

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.500 
recompose and then take the picture
focus<00:02:27.709> move<00:02:28.489> take<00:02:28.879> a<00:02:28.910> picture

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
focus move take a picture

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.970 
focus move take a picture
what<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:29.870> would<00:02:30.080> not<00:02:30.200> recommend<00:02:30.380> doing<00:02:30.769> is

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
what I would not recommend doing is

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.190 
what I would not recommend doing is
focusing<00:02:31.489> once<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.000> then<00:02:32.360> taking<00:02:32.870> pictures

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
focusing once and then taking pictures

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.839 
focusing once and then taking pictures
for<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.769> know<00:02:33.890> three<00:02:34.220> or<00:02:34.400> four<00:02:34.550> minutes

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
for you know three or four minutes

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.670 
for you know three or four minutes
because<00:02:35.030> focus<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:35.959> gonna<00:02:36.050> change<00:02:36.349> constantly

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
because focus is gonna change constantly

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.020 
because focus is gonna change constantly
especially<00:02:37.069> when<00:02:37.459> you're<00:02:37.580> using<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.849> shallow

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
especially when you're using a shallow

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.759 
especially when you're using a shallow
depth<00:02:38.269> field<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.780> focus<00:02:39.140> in<00:02:39.230> between<00:02:39.530> almost

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
depth field so I focus in between almost

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.970 
depth field so I focus in between almost
every<00:02:40.130> single<00:02:40.430> shot<00:02:40.660> our<00:02:41.660> ISO<00:02:42.290> here<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.739> just

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
every single shot our ISO here is just

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.160 
every single shot our ISO here is just
200<00:02:43.160> so<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:43.970> room<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.510> just<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.810> little<00:02:45.049> bit

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
200 so this room is just a little bit

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.530 
200 so this room is just a little bit
brighter<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:46.130> know<00:02:46.220> it's<00:02:46.430> inside<00:02:46.700> we're

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
brighter it's you know it's inside we're

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.729 
brighter it's you know it's inside we're
not<00:02:47.690> getting<00:02:47.930> any<00:02:48.049> sunlight<00:02:48.530> from<00:02:48.650> the

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
not getting any sunlight from the

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.500 
not getting any sunlight from the
outside<00:02:49.099> so<00:02:49.250> it's<00:02:49.400> it's<00:02:49.790> not<00:02:49.910> incredibly<00:02:50.330> dark

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
outside so it's it's not incredibly dark

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.819 
outside so it's it's not incredibly dark
but<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.930> did<00:02:51.200> want<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.440> make<00:02:51.530> sure<00:02:51.590> we're

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
but I did want to make sure we're

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.470 
but I did want to make sure we're
getting<00:02:51.950> some<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.430> light<00:02:52.610> from<00:02:52.970> from<00:02:53.329> here

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
getting some of the light from from here

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.699 
getting some of the light from from here
as<00:02:53.599> well<00:02:53.780> as<00:02:53.930> just<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.230> little<00:02:54.470> bit<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.650> the

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
as well as just a little bit of the

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.050 
as well as just a little bit of the
ambient<00:02:55.040> from<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.280> room<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:55.790> we're<00:02:55.910> lighting

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
ambient from the room so we're lighting

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.729 
ambient from the room so we're lighting
for<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.329> shot<00:02:56.569> is<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.840> relatively<00:02:57.560> simple

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
for the shot is a relatively simple

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.740 
for the shot is a relatively simple
we've<00:02:58.040> got<00:02:58.220> four<00:02:58.640> lights<00:02:59.239> that<00:02:59.480> are<00:02:59.569> kind<00:02:59.690> of

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
we've got four lights that are kind of

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.910 
we've got four lights that are kind of
contributing<00:03:00.200> we've<00:03:00.349> got<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.590> overall

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
contributing we've got the overall

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.020 
contributing we've got the overall
ambient<00:03:01.340> which<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.610> what<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.849> guys<00:03:01.970> are

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
ambient which is what you guys are

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.030 
ambient which is what you guys are
seeing<00:03:02.360> now<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.989> second<00:03:03.290> light<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:03.650> coming

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
seeing now the second light is coming

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.440 
seeing now the second light is coming
from<00:03:04.190> this<00:03:04.370> lamp<00:03:04.640> which<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.090> can't<00:03:05.299> really

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
from this lamp which I can't really

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.970 
from this lamp which I can't really
adjust<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.840> power<00:03:06.049> on<00:03:06.319> this<00:03:06.500> or<00:03:06.860> anything

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
adjust the power on this or anything

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.319 
adjust the power on this or anything
like<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.549> have<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.730> get<00:03:07.849> my<00:03:07.970> camera

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
like that so I have to get my camera

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.390 
like that so I have to get my camera
settings<00:03:08.540> right<00:03:08.780> for<00:03:09.349> the<00:03:09.410> ambient<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.040> for

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
settings right for the ambient and for

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.220 
settings right for the ambient and for
what<00:03:10.519> this<00:03:10.670> lamp<00:03:10.940> is<00:03:11.090> doing<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.540> then<00:03:12.019> we

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
what this lamp is doing and then we

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.920 
what this lamp is doing and then we
bring<00:03:12.440> in<00:03:12.620> our<00:03:12.860> two<00:03:13.190> other<00:03:13.519> lights<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:14.060> one<00:03:14.840> of

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
bring in our two other lights and one of

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.300 
bring in our two other lights and one of
the<00:03:14.989> lights<00:03:15.170> is<00:03:15.349> actually<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:15.769> can't<00:03:16.040> see<00:03:16.220> it

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
the lights is actually you can't see it

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.610 
the lights is actually you can't see it
here<00:03:16.489> it's<00:03:16.640> it's<00:03:17.090> outside<00:03:17.630> of<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.840> door<00:03:18.109> like

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
here it's it's outside of the door like

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.470 
here it's it's outside of the door like
way<00:03:18.980> far<00:03:19.280> away<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:19.730> what<00:03:19.850> it's<00:03:19.970> doing<00:03:20.120> is<00:03:20.299> it's

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
way far away and what it's doing is it's

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.210 
way far away and what it's doing is it's
firing<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.900> light<00:03:21.079> almost<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.920> exact<00:03:22.190> same

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
firing a light almost the exact same

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.400 
firing a light almost the exact same
axis<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.090> what<00:03:23.269> was<00:03:23.420> what<00:03:23.900> would<00:03:24.019> be<00:03:24.139> hitting

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
axis of what was what would be hitting

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.319 
axis of what was what would be hitting
the<00:03:24.620> light<00:03:24.829> so<00:03:25.100> a<00:03:25.130> light<00:03:25.489> is<00:03:25.670> basically<00:03:26.060> gonna

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
the light so a light is basically gonna

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.870 
the light so a light is basically gonna
light<00:03:26.569> up<00:03:26.600> part<00:03:27.260> of<00:03:27.500> Glenn's<00:03:27.769> face<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.220> our

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
light up part of Glenn's face and our

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.729 
light up part of Glenn's face and our
strobe<00:03:29.299> that's<00:03:29.600> way<00:03:29.840> outside<00:03:30.049> there<00:03:30.560> it's

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
strobe that's way outside there it's

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.349 
strobe that's way outside there it's
just<00:03:30.920> on<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.069> seven<00:03:31.340> inch<00:03:31.459> reflector<00:03:31.639> shining<00:03:32.239> I

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
just on a seven inch reflector shining I

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:33.610 
just on a seven inch reflector shining I
mean<00:03:32.510> it's<00:03:32.600> like<00:03:32.690> 10<00:03:32.959> feet<00:03:33.109> out<00:03:33.230> there<00:03:33.290> shining

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
mean it's like 10 feet out there shining

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.650 
mean it's like 10 feet out there shining
through<00:03:34.010> door<00:03:34.280> all<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.970> way<00:03:35.060> back<00:03:35.239> here<00:03:35.480> and

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
through door all the way back here and

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.240 
through door all the way back here and
that's<00:03:35.720> just<00:03:35.930> gonna<00:03:36.079> light<00:03:36.290> his<00:03:36.500> light<00:03:36.889> face

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
that's just gonna light his light face

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.800 
that's just gonna light his light face
with<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.639> same<00:03:37.850> type<00:03:38.120> of<00:03:38.150> light<00:03:38.359> so<00:03:38.540> we've<00:03:38.690> got

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
with the same type of light so we've got

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.319 
with the same type of light so we've got
a<00:03:38.840> CTO<00:03:39.260> gel<00:03:39.350> on<00:03:39.829> that<00:03:40.370> as<00:03:40.519> well<00:03:40.700> which<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.000> kind

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
a CTO gel on that as well which is kind

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.780 
a CTO gel on that as well which is kind
of<00:03:41.389> giving<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.810> same<00:03:42.049> light<00:03:42.650> profile<00:03:43.100> as<00:03:43.370> this

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
of giving the same light profile as this

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.490 
of giving the same light profile as this
would<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:44.209> where<00:03:44.480> this<00:03:44.630> falls<00:03:44.900> off<00:03:45.109> the<00:03:45.319> other

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
would so where this falls off the other

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.629 
would so where this falls off the other
light<00:03:45.680> is<00:03:45.769> just<00:03:45.980> kind<00:03:46.130> of<00:03:46.160> taking<00:03:46.459> its<00:03:46.579> place

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
light is just kind of taking its place

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.940 
light is just kind of taking its place
the<00:03:47.420> next<00:03:47.630> light<00:03:47.720> we're<00:03:47.870> using<00:03:48.049> is<00:03:48.380> another

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
the next light we're using is another

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.520 
the next light we're using is another
it's<00:03:49.850> just<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.420> seven<00:03:50.840> inch<00:03:51.049> reflector<00:03:51.200> with

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
it's just a seven inch reflector with

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.259 
it's just a seven inch reflector with
the<00:03:51.590> CTO<00:03:51.889> that's<00:03:52.190> right<00:03:52.430> up<00:03:52.549> here<00:03:52.730> that's<00:03:53.120> kind

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
the CTO that's right up here that's kind

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.910 
the CTO that's right up here that's kind
of<00:03:53.359> pointed<00:03:53.690> up<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.079> out<00:03:54.139> towards<00:03:54.829> the

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
of pointed up and out towards the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.199 
of pointed up and out towards the
ceiling<00:03:55.069> which<00:03:55.370> is<00:03:55.400> giving<00:03:55.730> us<00:03:55.790> a<00:03:55.910> little<00:03:56.030> bit

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
ceiling which is giving us a little bit

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.819 
ceiling which is giving us a little bit
more<00:03:56.329> ambient<00:03:56.660> but<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.200> little<00:03:57.440> bit<00:03:57.590> of<00:03:57.709> it's

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
more ambient but a little bit of it's

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.559 
more ambient but a little bit of it's
coming<00:03:58.010> out<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.489> because<00:03:59.030> we're<00:03:59.420> shooting

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
coming out and because we're shooting

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.479 
coming out and because we're shooting
from<00:03:59.900> this<00:04:00.170> angle<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:00.709> Glenn<00:04:01.040> was<00:04:01.220> looking

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
from this angle and Glenn was looking

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.190 
from this angle and Glenn was looking
like<00:04:01.639> this<00:04:01.790> it's<00:04:02.329> giving<00:04:02.599> us<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.810> little<00:04:03.019> bit<00:04:03.109> of

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
like this it's giving us a little bit of

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.589 
like this it's giving us a little bit of
rim<00:04:03.410> on<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:04.099> side<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.340> him<00:04:04.609> as<00:04:04.760> well<00:04:04.910> so<00:04:05.209> that

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
rim on the side of him as well so that

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.150 
rim on the side of him as well so that
light<00:04:05.810> is<00:04:05.930> shooting<00:04:06.200> for<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.650> ambient<00:04:07.069> as

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
light is shooting for the ambient as

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.460 
light is shooting for the ambient as
well<00:04:07.790> as<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.120> rim<00:04:08.269> now<00:04:08.599> we<00:04:08.989> weren't<00:04:09.349> playing

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
well as the rim now we weren't playing

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.990 
well as the rim now we weren't playing
with<00:04:09.650> like<00:04:09.889> color<00:04:10.130> temperature<00:04:10.489> too<00:04:10.669> much<00:04:10.849> in

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
with like color temperature too much in

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.400 
with like color temperature too much in
this<00:04:11.090> we<00:04:11.269> didn't<00:04:11.510> want<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:11.780> do<00:04:11.870> like<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.169> warm

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
this we didn't want to do like the warm

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.559 
this we didn't want to do like the warm
to<00:04:12.590> cool<00:04:12.769> we<00:04:13.310> started<00:04:13.639> playing<00:04:13.849> around<00:04:13.970> with<00:04:14.269> a

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
to cool we started playing around with a

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.060 
to cool we started playing around with a
little<00:04:14.810> bit<00:04:14.900> cooler<00:04:15.200> color<00:04:15.470> temperatures<00:04:15.889> but

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
little bit cooler color temperatures but

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.680 
little bit cooler color temperatures but
it<00:04:16.160> looked<00:04:16.310> contrived<00:04:16.669> like<00:04:17.090> why<00:04:17.329> would<00:04:17.539> there

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
it looked contrived like why would there

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.930 
it looked contrived like why would there
be<00:04:17.720> like<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.470> blue<00:04:18.709> or<00:04:18.919> a<00:04:18.950> green<00:04:19.010> light<00:04:19.459> in<00:04:19.700> this

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
be like a blue or a green light in this

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.789 
be like a blue or a green light in this
scene<00:04:20.209> which<00:04:20.630> looks<00:04:20.900> like<00:04:21.019> a<00:04:21.049> basement<00:04:21.409> scene

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
scene which looks like a basement scene

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.980 
scene which looks like a basement scene
or<00:04:21.950> whatever<00:04:22.210> so<00:04:23.210> we<00:04:23.419> wound<00:04:23.599> up<00:04:23.690> scratching

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
or whatever so we wound up scratching

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.690 
or whatever so we wound up scratching
that<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:24.380> just<00:04:24.560> made<00:04:24.800> everything<00:04:25.250> warm<00:04:25.490> so

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
that and just made everything warm so

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.040 
that and just made everything warm so
our<00:04:25.940> light<00:04:26.300> is<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.479> bit<00:04:26.690> warm

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
our light is a bit warm

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.740 
our light is a bit warm
or<00:04:27.110> ambient<00:04:27.650> is<00:04:27.919> warm<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.400> our<00:04:28.819> two<00:04:29.419> strobes

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
or ambient is warm and our two strobes

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.930 
or ambient is warm and our two strobes
are<00:04:29.930> warm<00:04:30.110> as<00:04:30.229> well<00:04:30.410> now<00:04:31.280> one<00:04:31.490> thing<00:04:31.639> that<00:04:31.699> was

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
are warm as well now one thing that was

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.820 
are warm as well now one thing that was
kind<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.150> like<00:04:32.270> throwing<00:04:32.509> us<00:04:32.720> off<00:04:32.870> is<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.620> wall

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
kind of like throwing us off is the wall

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.800 
kind of like throwing us off is the wall
behind<00:04:34.039> us<00:04:34.340> was<00:04:34.580> actually<00:04:34.699> completely<00:04:35.330> white

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
behind us was actually completely white

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.450 
behind us was actually completely white
well<00:04:36.050> there<00:04:36.199> was<00:04:36.289> like<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.500> mural<00:04:36.919> here<00:04:37.159> when<00:04:37.370> we

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
well there was like a mural here when we

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.939 
well there was like a mural here when we
started<00:04:37.849> and<00:04:38.139> it<00:04:39.139> was<00:04:39.530> just<00:04:39.710> really

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
started and it was just really

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.559 
started and it was just really
distracting<00:04:40.580> though<00:04:40.789> the<00:04:40.970> white<00:04:41.150> wall<00:04:41.330> kind

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
distracting though the white wall kind

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.450 
distracting though the white wall kind
of<00:04:41.690> like<00:04:41.840> took<00:04:42.169> attention<00:04:42.979> away<00:04:43.069> from<00:04:43.190> our

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
of like took attention away from our

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.249 
of like took attention away from our
subject<00:04:43.639> so<00:04:44.210> we've<00:04:44.449> got<00:04:44.599> this<00:04:44.720> curtain<00:04:45.110> and

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
subject so we've got this curtain and

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.930 
subject so we've got this curtain and
just<00:04:45.409> kind<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.590> strung<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:45.979> up<00:04:46.069> back<00:04:46.430> here<00:04:46.759> and

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
just kind of strung it up back here and

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.119 
just kind of strung it up back here and
shooting<00:04:47.449> at<00:04:47.539> an<00:04:47.629> angle<00:04:47.900> this<00:04:48.289> took<00:04:48.530> care<00:04:49.099> of

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
shooting at an angle this took care of

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:50.890 
shooting at an angle this took care of
about<00:04:49.310> half<00:04:49.580> of<00:04:49.759> the<00:04:49.849> shot<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:50.240> during<00:04:50.810> the

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
about half of the shot and during the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.320 
about half of the shot and during the
photo<00:04:51.080> shoot<00:04:51.349> we<00:04:51.560> had<00:04:51.740> Zach<00:04:52.580> actually<00:04:53.000> holding

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
photo shoot we had Zach actually holding

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.570 
photo shoot we had Zach actually holding
a<00:04:53.479> reflector<00:04:53.960> like<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.139> black<00:04:54.440> reflector<00:04:54.949> right

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
a reflector like a black reflector right

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.189 
a reflector like a black reflector right
behind<00:04:55.819> our<00:04:55.970> subject<00:04:56.150> as<00:04:56.449> well<00:04:56.479> not<00:04:56.960> high

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
behind our subject as well not high

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.540 
behind our subject as well not high
enough<00:04:57.229> to<00:04:57.470> where<00:04:57.590> it<00:04:57.770> would<00:04:57.860> block<00:04:58.099> the<00:04:58.340> brim

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
enough to where it would block the brim

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.040 
enough to where it would block the brim
light<00:04:58.729> but<00:04:59.150> high<00:04:59.270> enough<00:04:59.479> to<00:04:59.630> where<00:04:59.659> in<00:05:00.020> the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
light but high enough to where in the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.839 
light but high enough to where in the
frame<00:05:00.440> you<00:05:00.470> could<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:01.159> could<00:05:01.340> see<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.699> black

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
frame you could you could see the black

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.760 
frame you could you could see the black
reflector<00:05:02.360> in<00:05:02.479> there<00:05:02.659> what<00:05:03.169> it's<00:05:03.289> gonna<00:05:03.409> do<00:05:03.620> is

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
reflector in there what it's gonna do is

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.740 
reflector in there what it's gonna do is
it's<00:05:03.800> gonna<00:05:04.039> make<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.280> a<00:05:04.430> lot<00:05:04.610> easier<00:05:04.789> later<00:05:05.539> on

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
it's gonna make it a lot easier later on

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.870 
it's gonna make it a lot easier later on
if<00:05:05.960> we<00:05:06.110> decide<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.470> in<00:05:06.830> post-production<00:05:07.250> if<00:05:07.699> we

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
if we decide to in post-production if we

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.580 
if we decide to in post-production if we
decide<00:05:08.150> to<00:05:08.180> like<00:05:08.419> put<00:05:08.659> a<00:05:08.690> dark-colored<00:05:09.080> wall

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
decide to like put a dark-colored wall

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.589 
decide to like put a dark-colored wall
in<00:05:10.159> here<00:05:10.430> like<00:05:10.550> maybe<00:05:10.789> we<00:05:10.970> should<00:05:11.150> have<00:05:11.270> waffle

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
in here like maybe we should have waffle

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.480 
in here like maybe we should have waffle
it's<00:05:11.750> like<00:05:11.960> wood<00:05:12.259> paneling<00:05:12.770> it'll<00:05:13.190> be<00:05:13.280> pretty

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
it's like wood paneling it'll be pretty

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.550 
it's like wood paneling it'll be pretty
easy<00:05:13.610> to<00:05:13.909> put<00:05:14.060> that<00:05:14.240> in<00:05:14.449> after<00:05:15.229> the<00:05:15.319> fact

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
easy to put that in after the fact

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.200 
easy to put that in after the fact
because<00:05:15.800> we<00:05:16.220> have<00:05:16.370> that<00:05:16.520> like<00:05:16.759> very<00:05:16.789> nice

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
because we have that like very nice

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.670 
because we have that like very nice
cleaned<00:05:17.479> up<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:17.870> if<00:05:17.960> we<00:05:17.990> don't<00:05:18.169> decide<00:05:18.469> to<00:05:18.590> do

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
cleaned up and if we don't decide to do

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.260 
cleaned up and if we don't decide to do
it<00:05:18.800> not<00:05:19.039> a<00:05:19.069> big<00:05:19.280> deal<00:05:19.460> we<00:05:19.940> still<00:05:20.150> have<00:05:20.240> a

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
it not a big deal we still have a

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.760 
it not a big deal we still have a
background<00:05:20.630> that's<00:05:20.780> not<00:05:20.990> very<00:05:21.169> distracting

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
background that's not very distracting

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.200 
background that's not very distracting
composition<00:05:22.430> we<00:05:22.580> wanted<00:05:22.849> this<00:05:22.969> to<00:05:23.120> be

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
composition we wanted this to be

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.300 
composition we wanted this to be
relatively<00:05:23.690> tight<00:05:23.990> I'm<00:05:24.530> shooting<00:05:24.889> basically

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
relatively tight I'm shooting basically

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.399 
relatively tight I'm shooting basically
from<00:05:25.520> this<00:05:25.849> angle<00:05:26.060> for<00:05:26.599> the<00:05:26.900> majority<00:05:27.139> of<00:05:27.319> the

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
from this angle for the majority of the

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:28.809 
from this angle for the majority of the
shot<00:05:27.560> I<00:05:27.710> wanted<00:05:27.949> to<00:05:28.039> make<00:05:28.159> sure<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.430> lamp<00:05:28.639> was

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819 
shot I wanted to make sure the lamp was

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.510 
shot I wanted to make sure the lamp was
in<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.240> image<00:05:29.830> obviously<00:05:30.830> our<00:05:30.949> subjects<00:05:31.460> in

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
in the image obviously our subjects in

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.279 
in the image obviously our subjects in
the<00:05:31.610> image<00:05:31.849> the<00:05:32.150> piano<00:05:32.599> as<00:05:32.780> well<00:05:32.960> as<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.169> piece

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
the image the piano as well as the piece

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:34.749 
the image the piano as well as the piece
of<00:05:33.409> paper<00:05:33.500> so<00:05:33.800> we<00:05:33.889> wanted<00:05:34.130> to<00:05:34.190> be<00:05:34.310> relatively

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
of paper so we wanted to be relatively

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.879 
of paper so we wanted to be relatively
tight<00:05:34.940> this<00:05:35.449> is<00:05:35.630> obviously<00:05:36.199> like<00:05:36.469> this<00:05:36.620> room

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
tight this is obviously like this room

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.920 
tight this is obviously like this room
is<00:05:37.069> not<00:05:37.310> it<00:05:37.729> doesn't<00:05:38.030> look<00:05:38.270> like<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.599> final

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
is not it doesn't look like the final

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.899 
is not it doesn't look like the final
image<00:05:39.199> like<00:05:39.409> pretty<00:05:39.710> much<00:05:39.770> at<00:05:40.099> all<00:05:40.280> so<00:05:40.639> we<00:05:40.789> had

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 
image like pretty much at all so we had

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:42.219 
image like pretty much at all so we had
to<00:05:41.000> be<00:05:41.090> pretty<00:05:41.330> tight<00:05:41.539> because<00:05:41.719> we're<00:05:42.020> kind<00:05:42.110> of

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
to be pretty tight because we're kind of

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.370 
to be pretty tight because we're kind of
creating<00:05:42.620> a<00:05:42.800> little<00:05:43.279> bit<00:05:43.520> of<00:05:43.729> a<00:05:44.110> little<00:05:45.110> bit<00:05:45.259> of

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
creating a little bit of a little bit of

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.959 
creating a little bit of a little bit of
a<00:05:45.469> fantasy<00:05:45.979> here<00:05:46.190> especially<00:05:46.639> with<00:05:46.819> what

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:46.969 
a fantasy here especially with what

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:49.300 
a fantasy here especially with what
we've<00:05:47.120> done<00:05:47.300> with<00:05:47.659> the<00:05:47.779> walls<00:05:47.990> so<00:05:48.380> because<00:05:49.069> the

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
we've done with the walls so because the

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.040 
we've done with the walls so because the
images<00:05:49.909> don't<00:05:50.090> look<00:05:50.270> like<00:05:50.389> what<00:05:50.569> the<00:05:50.659> room<00:05:50.840> is

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
images don't look like what the room is

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.080 
images don't look like what the room is
if<00:05:51.259> we<00:05:51.380> were<00:05:51.469> to<00:05:51.529> zoomed<00:05:52.219> out<00:05:52.430> you'd<00:05:52.669> see<00:05:52.880> too

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
if we were to zoomed out you'd see too

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.390 
if we were to zoomed out you'd see too
much<00:05:53.270> of<00:05:53.509> the<00:05:53.630> actual<00:05:53.960> room<00:05:54.199> that<00:05:54.800> we're<00:05:54.919> in<00:05:54.949> so

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
much of the actual room that we're in so

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.370 
much of the actual room that we're in so
we<00:05:55.490> wanted<00:05:55.729> to<00:05:55.789> be<00:05:55.909> really<00:05:56.180> close<00:05:56.389> and<00:05:56.719> just

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
we wanted to be really close and just

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.320 
we wanted to be really close and just
make<00:05:57.529> sure<00:05:57.560> that<00:05:57.830> also<00:05:58.250> with<00:05:58.729> you<00:05:59.029> know<00:05:59.210> with

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
make sure that also with you know with

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.749 
make sure that also with you know with
Glenn<00:05:59.539> when<00:05:59.719> he<00:05:59.810> was<00:05:59.930> posing<00:06:00.310> we<00:06:01.310> had<00:06:01.430> to<00:06:01.550> kind

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
Glenn when he was posing we had to kind

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.279 
Glenn when he was posing we had to kind
of<00:06:01.789> like<00:06:01.909> get<00:06:02.120> closer<00:06:02.419> and<00:06:02.659> closer<00:06:02.840> and<00:06:03.110> closer

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
of like get closer and closer and closer

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:04.809 
of like get closer and closer and closer
so<00:06:03.860> it<00:06:03.919> was<00:06:04.039> almost<00:06:04.159> like<00:06:04.310> you<00:06:04.400> were<00:06:04.490> doing

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:04.819 
so it was almost like you were doing

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.180 
so it was almost like you were doing
this<00:06:05.000> sometimes<00:06:05.449> and<00:06:05.870> the<00:06:06.529> more<00:06:06.710> he<00:06:06.740> spreads

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
this sometimes and the more he spreads

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.740 
this sometimes and the more he spreads
out<00:06:07.340> they're<00:06:07.520> more<00:06:07.699> like<00:06:08.000> negative<00:06:08.389> space<00:06:08.599> is

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
out they're more like negative space is

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.659 
out they're more like negative space is
going<00:06:08.930> to<00:06:08.990> be<00:06:09.080> in<00:06:09.169> this<00:06:09.259> image<00:06:09.590> and<00:06:09.740> the<00:06:10.460> more

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
going to be in this image and the more

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.189 
going to be in this image and the more
we<00:06:10.819> would<00:06:10.940> have<00:06:11.060> to<00:06:11.180> like<00:06:11.300> back<00:06:11.509> up<00:06:11.539> to<00:06:11.870> include

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 
we would have to like back up to include

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:13.540 
we would have to like back up to include
more<00:06:12.409> of<00:06:12.529> the<00:06:12.590> room<00:06:12.800> so<00:06:13.039> we<00:06:13.130> wanted<00:06:13.370> to<00:06:13.430> make

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
more of the room so we wanted to make

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.430 
more of the room so we wanted to make
sure<00:06:13.610> that<00:06:13.969> the<00:06:14.419> composition<00:06:14.719> and<00:06:15.020> the<00:06:15.080> posing

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
sure that the composition and the posing

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.719 
sure that the composition and the posing
went<00:06:15.770> together<00:06:15.889> and<00:06:16.069> they<00:06:16.279> were<00:06:16.370> both<00:06:16.520> really

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
went together and they were both really

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:18.309 
went together and they were both really
tight<00:06:17.060> so<00:06:17.360> that's<00:06:17.539> the<00:06:17.659> whole<00:06:17.779> shot<00:06:18.050> basically

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
tight so that's the whole shot basically

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:19.990 
tight so that's the whole shot basically
we<00:06:18.740> started<00:06:19.159> off<00:06:19.279> with<00:06:19.520> a<00:06:19.580> completely

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
we started off with a completely

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.790 
we started off with a completely
different<00:06:20.270> lighting<00:06:20.750> setup<00:06:21.080> we<00:06:21.259> had<00:06:21.469> this

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
different lighting setup we had this

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.820 
different lighting setup we had this
wall<00:06:22.190> was<00:06:22.400> covered<00:06:23.360> it<00:06:23.870> was<00:06:23.990> actually<00:06:24.319> a<00:06:24.349> mural

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
wall was covered it was actually a mural

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.830 
wall was covered it was actually a mural
here<00:06:25.099> we<00:06:25.279> had<00:06:25.490> a<00:06:25.729> light<00:06:25.940> coming<00:06:26.180> from<00:06:26.300> the<00:06:26.599> top

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
here we had a light coming from the top

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.839 
here we had a light coming from the top
down<00:06:27.500> and<00:06:27.529> we<00:06:27.979> were<00:06:28.069> gonna<00:06:28.190> be<00:06:28.279> shooting<00:06:28.669> at

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
down and we were gonna be shooting at

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.120 
down and we were gonna be shooting at
this<00:06:29.180> angle<00:06:29.389> with<00:06:29.779> Glenn<00:06:30.069> originally<00:06:31.069> I

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
this angle with Glenn originally I

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.559 
this angle with Glenn originally I
thought<00:06:31.340> that<00:06:31.520> might<00:06:31.639> look<00:06:31.849> interesting<00:06:32.389> but

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:32.569 
thought that might look interesting but

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:34.059 
thought that might look interesting but
in<00:06:32.690> the<00:06:32.779> end<00:06:32.930> it<00:06:33.050> just<00:06:33.080> wound<00:06:33.409> up<00:06:33.529> being<00:06:33.740> not

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:34.069 
in the end it just wound up being not

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:35.950 
in the end it just wound up being not
the<00:06:34.250> shot<00:06:34.430> that<00:06:34.639> we<00:06:34.729> wanted<00:06:35.000> so<00:06:35.449> we<00:06:35.539> covered<00:06:35.839> up

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
the shot that we wanted so we covered up

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.480 
the shot that we wanted so we covered up
these<00:06:36.110> walls<00:06:36.409> we<00:06:36.589> changed<00:06:36.949> our<00:06:37.070> lighting<00:06:37.370> we

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
these walls we changed our lighting we

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.850 
these walls we changed our lighting we
went

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
went

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.409 
went
with<00:06:38.039> like<00:06:38.159> a<00:06:38.189> rim<00:06:38.550> lighting<00:06:38.759> style<00:06:39.030> instead

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 
with like a rim lighting style instead

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:42.140 
with like a rim lighting style instead
of<00:06:39.539> directly<00:06:39.719> from<00:06:40.139> above<00:06:40.500> and<00:06:40.939> took<00:06:41.939> like

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
of directly from above and took like

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.580 
of directly from above and took like
what<00:06:42.360> you<00:06:42.629> know<00:06:42.719> could<00:06:42.960> be<00:06:43.080> seen<00:06:43.259> as<00:06:43.409> like<00:06:43.530> a

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
what you know could be seen as like a

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.439 
what you know could be seen as like a
somewhat<00:06:44.310> like<00:06:44.520> real<00:06:44.729> moment<00:06:45.120> where<00:06:45.270> he's

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:45.449 
somewhat like real moment where he's

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.749 
somewhat like real moment where he's
actually<00:06:45.629> sketching<00:06:46.400> something<00:06:47.400> down<00:06:47.580> at<00:06:47.699> a

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
actually sketching something down at a

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.570 
actually sketching something down at a
piece<00:06:47.939> paper<00:06:48.180> so<00:06:48.479> and<00:06:49.319> explaining<00:06:49.710> it<00:06:49.919> it<00:06:50.039> it's

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
piece paper so and explaining it it it's

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.279 
piece paper so and explaining it it it's
totally<00:06:50.969> fabricated<00:06:51.180> but<00:06:51.719> the<00:06:51.840> end<00:06:51.990> shot<00:06:52.139> is

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
totally fabricated but the end shot is

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:53.959 
totally fabricated but the end shot is
supposed<00:06:52.530> to<00:06:52.590> look<00:06:52.770> at<00:06:53.189> least<00:06:53.430> somewhat<00:06:53.789> real

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:53.969 
supposed to look at least somewhat real

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:55.850 
supposed to look at least somewhat real
and<00:06:54.270> that's<00:06:54.389> that's<00:06:55.050> the<00:06:55.229> whole<00:06:55.379> point<00:06:55.560> of<00:06:55.710> it

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
and that's that's the whole point of it

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.529 
and that's that's the whole point of it
