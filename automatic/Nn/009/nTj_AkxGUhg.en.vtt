00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 And then I'll make another video today. 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.120
 This time I'll be showing you 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.919
 some of my cheese, my desk, right? 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.580
 Some modifications I made to it are 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.860
 painting and the removal of bay from hds 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.059
 I also made fighting filming and 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.240
 show you have a lot of people 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.090
 question which office use and I think 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.619
 that is because it is different from the color such 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.810
 I 'll be filming I was watching 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.330
 to you expect to be the subject video 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 Okay, well guys here in that part. 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.769
 I'll show you there will have another side 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.460
 on my left side but usually I 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.040
 I sit on the side of the acrylic and I 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.280
 I did the painting on that side I read shishi 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.410
 and she's all right, I do not know why 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.239
 I got there thinking it would be good and I do not know 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.230
 Do you have to leave or not? 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.300
 and here these black tires here is me 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.260
 I took all of them or a few thousand that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.570
 broke the serve 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.870
 I do not know I got there I had put 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.690
 this piece of acrylic and I painted more 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.480
 I left all that matte paint has a 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.080
 normal spray and I'm perfect 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.650
 was perfect last is that at the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.290
 The top I did the painting gave a lot of work. 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.500
 to remove this part of the cabinet 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.080
 because it is separate and I did not know 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.479
 How to remove this is the size of the front 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.110
 that this does not know how I moved here 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.570
 In this part I put tape ne and I 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.340
 that I wanted to leave the man and 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.780
 remove this part you did not know was 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.009
 dead to do here in 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:39.270
 and such and gave a work here in the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.520
 front in front I painted the little 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.700
 did not stay just to do our part 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.759
 it was easy just to remove it from the inside 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.979
 is that normal life 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.939
 and this is the left part of the case 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.960
 that I left here too I 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.439
 I arrived too 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.020
 It 's plastic but I left a knowing 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.350
 if she could of charlie sheen is also the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.200
 grade in January full and is lateral 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.780
 was also closed because the last time 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.019
 that I had an old note I painted 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.090
 he and I had not closed and 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.250
 over time tighten bolts 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.410
 thing to realize that peeling paint 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.200
 so I asked the store's face the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.959
 sierra where it rains is via I always saw the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.060
 topics on the internet about painting and 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.209
 They said I had to chay this time I 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.590
 I accepted with very good 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.530
 beauty with part inside the cabinet 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.079
 already lost without the cap here are all 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.019
 here's a cooler of 12 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.790
 I use it to cool the head 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.900
 in place of the study is that even here 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.750
 formerly had the bahia that you 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.819
 put his head like this and I removed it 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.470
 table with 11 goals on four fronts 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.900
 very small 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.900
 offer you can come closer 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:07.310
 had the four children here 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:11.510
 and they were just going to get me a 6970 and 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.960
 she does not fit in it she did not give 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.490
 right from here 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:21.400
 from here on so it does not work 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.990
 this part here until I folded one 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.150
 bit because because I 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.540
 I tried to batch the top of my board 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.640
 morning in two batches 16 x is has been 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.830
 upper and lower down then I had I 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.600
 had to wear 6970 on the bottom and 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.630
 then I use a peculiar one is the 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.600
 orrezinho or 220 basic is nothing 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.880
 too much to occupy less space in the 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.620
 cabinet of a legal generation 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.730
 he has a healing controller is 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.300
 seeing that the planet generating a little slow 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.770
 You have a controller here behind you. 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.120
 So much a wind this business here 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:04.390
 it's very strong 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:08.380
 I use 2 tablespoons peace up here what 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.380
 the two of 140 there from memory but he is 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:15.430
 are two two-day modules of the 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:19.080
 voter and a 4g mb module that I 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:22.510
 I did until the last boxe use in bed, right? 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:28.750
 and then the motherboard that I 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:32.560
 use at 1 in 489 gtd pro it is a 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:38.020
 amd motherboard is obvious right? 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.090
 zoom phenom x4 965 3.4 out of stock 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.400
 do not overclock, right? 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.960
 wake up, but we have a cure 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.940
 do not score and do not do as 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.090
 thank you 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.640
 It is the source of the world to follow a source 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.450
 be modular I took her example here 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.730
 our 21 of 750 vacancies 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:03.220
 very good, this source I have here 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:06.640
 I have a cable-and pay you 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.950
 collection extension gap is much the 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.730
 I think it makes the young man beautiful and 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:15.250
 This is where I'm going to show here and if he 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:19.020
 and filming it the ugly here and found the 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.020
 ips final this year 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.630
 that is the controller psalm it 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:32.530
 controls our colleagues in lakes that 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:38.670
 bring that is the disguise discount it 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:43.120
 controls the purpose of the part is a 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.950
 focused to a crazier lighting that 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.470
 plays more in power 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.180
 I always left at the most I did not call 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.300
 right on the motherboard because I do not know 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.810
 this controller it decreases a 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.000
 the maximum strength of the course then I 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.710
 did not always leave it on the motherboard 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.650
 because it is still, so it stays 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.840
 annoying noise for these things here 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:13.590
 little red question underneath it 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:17.860
 is the dodo tek controller've talked right 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:20.050
 561 of the tac that will probably be the 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.850
 enter the negotiation this week you 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.220
 it does not work it's for sale 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:30.810
 has other rates than what is being 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:30.810
 And that's where the full name is, right? 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:40.049
 good good wine 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:41.819
 it does not matter is wrong, but it 's 

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:44.759
 chance that takes away the cap both campaign 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:48.059
 Tam supports the cover strip is thus e 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:50.519
 connected but that's it folks to you guys 

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:52.739
 who did not know the office yet I 

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:55.079
 White did not take many pictures of him took 

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:58.949
 the solar focus was just too damn good 

00:06:55.079 --> 00:07:02.179
 This is a cooler master storm scott 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:05.099
 and it was all black I'll post one 

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:08.669
 one of the pictures in the description that 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:11.069
 That's it. 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:14.269
 who liked the jewel of a favorite 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:14.269
 That will help me a lot.
