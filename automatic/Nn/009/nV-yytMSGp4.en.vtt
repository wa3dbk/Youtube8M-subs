 hi everyone my name is Olya 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.290
 if you are subscribed to any 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.660
 book sola something means venus 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.460
 stopped and figure how 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.170
 fiercely people argue which book 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.450
 better electronic or 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.970
 paper when I was not e 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.439
 books I was a strong supporter 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.240
 paper books and yet after some 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.250
 time the ebook came to me in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.590
 I didn't understand how I used to be 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.590
 underestimate this thing she seemed to me 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.480
 just incredible convenient and considered 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.219
 says that after a couple of weeks my wild 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.290
 delight passed and I realized that 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.630
 email and pages I already become boring 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.360
 so today i will tell you about the pros 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.760
 and cons of paper and electronic books and 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.530
 I will make my choice unfortunately about 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.750
 choosing an e- book, I do not litter you 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.969
 because that's the book I most 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.620
 the first is pocketbook touch 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.289
 most popular e-book 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.870
 now maybe if you look and 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.980
 the description on you will also like it 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.079
 e-book lightweight compact 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.910
 so on a vacation instead of a huge 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.850
 quantities of paper books you can take 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.260
 only her on my book already 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.430
 probably more than a thousand books and i am for sure 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.870
 e-book is definitely not growing 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.180
 pizza hands you on a wet climate 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.260
 such a wedge and gives you the opportunity 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.810
 familiarize yourself with them before you 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.210
 spend on her money that is to understand 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.970
 whether you like it or not and whether it is necessary 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.620
 on paper I never take 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.990
 owl ebook in the subway because 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.120
 I'm afraid that she will be accepted for a shake 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.040
 steal from some e-books 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.500
 there is a backlight which is not good for 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.460
 your eyes because it's all the same technique 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.750
 he excludes such books 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.330
 Sasha is agree 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.700
 nothing replaces 40 paper pages 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.510
 and the ritual itself them turning it over 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.790
 as an addiction 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.770
 an important book of power from the metro give 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.650
 to a friend and read anywhere because 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.810
 any light will be convenient for you 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.580
 paper books do not harm the eyes cr 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.560
 biotech walking distance 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.810
 if you suddenly forgot the name of the book 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.690
 you can remember her in appearance 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.790
 beautiful design of books tagging on 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.160
 the fields I was very interested to read 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.760
 the book that I read in my 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.380
 belly to lead mom and realize what we are with 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.200
 do not pay attention to the same 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.840
 things unfortunately this price of some i don't 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.420
 is insanely expensive for example one book 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.000
 from the game Martin 's series of thrones is worth 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.170
 something rubles probably this is one of 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.110
 the reasons why i still donâ€™t 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.610
 presents not once my paper 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.680
 books fall apart i have rights to 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.110
 eyes when I was on vacation bravely 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.230
 these books were in soft covers because 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.000
 that cd tdh covers are very difficult to keep 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.070
 with a conclusion we want to say that 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.200
 I do not see much point in buying 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.150
 e-book to those people who are few 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.750
 read books and this book is not created 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.450
 in order to exit a paper book she 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.100
 drowned in order to replace it then 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.330
 when we can't take a few books 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.050
 yourself on vacation 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.330
 thus facilitating everyday life such bibliophile 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.850
 way the debate about which book is better 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.440
 paper electronic does not make sense 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.970
 because these books complement each 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.040
 friend on this all if you liked 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.810
 this video you can put a finger 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.459
 up or subscribe to my channel 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.080
 read only good books for now 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.350
 by the way i'm not big 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.209
 fan of Dostoevsky and only this book 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.050
 I had a paper version and 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.050
 electronic books
