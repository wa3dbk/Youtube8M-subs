there were two kids and Irina shrunk
down<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.930> space<00:01:37.170> show<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.619> used<00:01:37.829> those

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
down the space show and used those

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.859 
down the space show and used those
children<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.610> hostages<00:01:38.790> start<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
children as hostages start to this

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.749 
children as hostages start to this
storyline<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.500> completely<00:01:41.100> omitted<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
storyline is completely omitted from the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.100 
storyline is completely omitted from the
Mighty<00:01:41.939> Morphin<00:01:42.210> Power<00:01:42.450> Rangers

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.569 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers
so<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> reason<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.920> time<00:01:44.100> device<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.549> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
so the reason that the time device is a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.359 
so the reason that the time device is a
space<00:01:44.939> shuttle<00:01:45.149> no<00:01:46.049> reason<00:01:46.530> makes<00:01:46.770> no<00:01:47.040> sense

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
space shuttle no reason makes no sense

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.460 
space shuttle no reason makes no sense
so<00:01:47.850> now<00:01:48.000> they<00:01:48.149> alter<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.600> time<00:01:48.840> device<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.350> go

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
so now they alter this time device to go

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.810 
so now they alter this time device to go
into<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.860> time<00:01:50.100> portal<00:01:50.430> thing<00:01:50.610> that's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
into the time portal thing that's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.219 
into the time portal thing that's
driving<00:01:51.180> around<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> streets<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.840> Earth<00:01:52.020> and

eventually<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.890> stops<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.430> shoots<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.729> very

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
eventually it stops and shoots a very

portal is detected by Zordon so he

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.510

up the red ranger so obviously that
entire<00:03:03.370> time<00:03:03.760> dimension<00:03:04.210> was<00:03:04.330> located

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
entire time dimension was located

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.600 
entire time dimension was located
entirely<00:03:05.260> within<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.800> skyscraper<00:03:06.370> downtown

this closeup of the red ranger shows a
quarry<00:03:08.980> in<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.190> background<00:03:09.550> even<00:03:09.670> though<00:03:09.820> we

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
quarry in the background even though we

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.090 
quarry in the background even though we
just<00:03:10.330> saw<00:03:10.570> him<00:03:10.810> come<00:03:11.020> out<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.320> building<00:03:11.530> the

just saw him come out of a building the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.320 
just saw him come out of a building the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
other Rangers get out the time to

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.730 
other Rangers get out the time to
mention<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.750> now<00:03:13.870> they<00:03:14.050> are<00:03:14.170> also<00:03:14.410> in<00:03:14.560> a

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
mention and now they are also in a

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.140 
mention and now they are also in a
quarry<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.280> red<00:03:15.459> ranger<00:03:15.820> calls<00:03:16.030> with

quarry the red ranger calls with

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.790 
quarry the red ranger calls with
dinosaur<00:03:16.660> power<00:03:16.870> but<00:03:17.080> for<00:03:17.200> some<00:03:17.350> reason<00:03:17.650> only

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
dinosaur power but for some reason only

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.650 
dinosaur power but for some reason only
one<00:03:18.100> of<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.280> dinosaurs<00:03:18.790> actually<00:03:19.240> show<00:03:19.450> up

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
one of the dinosaurs actually show up

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.840 
one of the dinosaurs actually show up
what<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.440> going<00:03:20.590> on<00:03:21.070> now<00:03:21.550> I<00:03:21.580> should<00:03:21.820> mention

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
what is going on now I should mention

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.610 
what is going on now I should mention
the<00:03:22.420> Japanese<00:03:22.870> show<00:03:23.050> these<00:03:23.230> scenes<00:03:23.470> were

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
the Japanese show these scenes were

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.350 
the Japanese show these scenes were
taken<00:03:23.920> from<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.220> time<00:03:24.640> dimension<00:03:25.030> was

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
taken from the time dimension was

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.910 
taken from the time dimension was
actually<00:03:25.690> described<00:03:26.020> more<00:03:26.200> like<00:03:26.440> an<00:03:26.620> illusion

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
actually described more like an illusion

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.350 
actually described more like an illusion
and<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.370> kind<00:03:27.550> of<00:03:27.580> makes<00:03:27.760> sense<00:03:27.910> right<00:03:28.180> they

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
and that kind of makes sense right they

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.760 
and that kind of makes sense right they
thought<00:03:28.660> they<00:03:28.840> were<00:03:28.900> in<00:03:29.020> a<00:03:29.110> weird<00:03:29.350> dimension

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
thought they were in a weird dimension

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.810 
thought they were in a weird dimension
but<00:03:29.920> really<00:03:30.220> they<00:03:30.340> were<00:03:30.430> in<00:03:30.550> a<00:03:30.610> skyscraper

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
but really they were in a skyscraper

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.699 
but really they were in a skyscraper
downtown<00:03:31.300> it<00:03:31.870> just<00:03:32.050> makes<00:03:32.260> me<00:03:32.410> wonder<00:03:32.530> though

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
downtown it just makes me wonder though

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.380 
downtown it just makes me wonder though
why<00:03:32.950> did<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.250> American<00:03:33.700> riders<00:03:34.030> suddenly

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
why did the American riders suddenly

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.060 
why did the American riders suddenly
call<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.750> time<00:03:35.020> warp<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.500> talk<00:03:35.650> about<00:03:35.800> time

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
call it a time warp and talk about time

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.980 
call it a time warp and talk about time
travel<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:36.580> stuff<00:03:36.820> it<00:03:37.150> had<00:03:37.330> nothing<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.870> do

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
travel and stuff it had nothing to do

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.420 
travel and stuff it had nothing to do
with<00:03:38.080> time<00:03:38.350> travel<00:03:38.380> they<00:03:38.980> could<00:03:39.130> have<00:03:39.220> kept

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
with time travel they could have kept

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.830 
with time travel they could have kept
calling<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:39.790> an<00:03:39.910> illusion<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.600> would<00:03:40.720> have

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
calling it an illusion and it would have

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.930 
calling it an illusion and it would have
made<00:03:40.990> more<00:03:41.290> sense<00:03:41.490> moving<00:03:42.490> on<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.760> knight

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
made more sense moving on the knight

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.610 
made more sense moving on the knight
gets<00:03:43.120> defeated<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.930> then<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.200> Rangers<00:03:44.560> the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.140 
gets defeated and then the Rangers the
