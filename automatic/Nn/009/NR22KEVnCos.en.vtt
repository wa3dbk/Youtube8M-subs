so the first really good well decent
place<00:00:05.100> for<00:00:05.400> pets<00:00:05.640> farming<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:07.099> right<00:00:08.099> here

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400

place for pets farming is a right here
in<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.610> barrens<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.300> it's<00:00:09.480> really

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
in the barrens and it's really

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.209 
in the barrens and it's really
convenient<00:00:10.230> because<00:00:11.630> bulvar<00:00:12.630> mar<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.219> really

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
convenient because bulvar mar is really

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.919 
convenient because bulvar mar is really
close<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.820> it's<00:00:15.089> only<00:00:15.269> about<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.570> one<00:00:15.780> minute

leaping hatchling which I have in my bag

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.510 
leaping hatchling which I have in my bag
here<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:24.049> I<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.590> far<00:01:25.890> I've<00:01:26.009> gotten<00:01:26.340> four<00:01:28.369> I'm<00:01:29.369> not

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
here I I so far I've gotten four I'm not

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310 
here I I so far I've gotten four I'm not
sure<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.030> nest<00:01:30.270> will<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.049> now

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
sure if the nest will be here right now

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.569 
sure if the nest will be here right now
but<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.450> find<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.049> under<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.950> found<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
but you can find it under I found it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.179 
but you can find it under I found it
twice<00:01:35.880> under<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.450> tree<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:38.119> once<00:01:39.119> over<00:01:39.509> here

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
twice under this tree and once over here

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.710 
twice under this tree and once over here
but<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:43.350> nest<00:01:43.619> should<00:01:43.979> always<00:01:44.280> spawn<00:01:44.720> under

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
but the nest should always spawn under

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.719 
but the nest should always spawn under
tree<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.229> believe<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.649> spawns<00:01:46.920> every<00:01:47.250> six<00:01:47.520> hours

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
tree I believe it spawns every six hours

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.920 
tree I believe it spawns every six hours
and<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.869> only<00:01:52.590> spawns<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.850> upper<00:01:54.360> area

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
and it only spawns in the upper area

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
and it only spawns in the upper area
right<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.390> what<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.170> double

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
right here so just what I do is I double

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.209 
right here so just what I do is I double
check<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.780> run<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:01.020> at<00:02:01.170> once<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.649> then<00:02:01.950> back

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
check I run up at once and then back

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.380 
check I run up at once and then back
down<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.729> again<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:05.700> nest<00:02:05.909> isn't<00:02:06.270> always

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
down it again and the nest isn't always

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.169 
down it again and the nest isn't always
there<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.530> usually<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:08.160> not<00:02:08.610> many<00:02:08.819> people

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
there but it usually is not many people

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.140 
there but it usually is not many people
farm<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.750> anymore<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:11.239> especially<00:02:13.940> not<00:02:14.940> so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150

people steal it a lot but what I found
to<00:02:58.500> be<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.709> most<00:02:58.860> effective<00:02:59.670> way<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:02.790> farm

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
to be the most effective way to a farm

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.830 
to be the most effective way to a farm
is<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.080> leave<00:03:04.380> an<00:03:04.590> alt<00:03:04.860> log<00:03:05.730> dog<00:03:06.090> out<00:03:06.390> in

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
is to just leave an alt log dog out in

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.610 
is to just leave an alt log dog out in
the<00:03:07.260> spawn<00:03:07.650> area<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.310> check<00:03:09.209> every<00:03:09.900> every

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
the spawn area and check every every

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.210 
the spawn area and check every every
time<00:03:10.830> every<00:03:11.310> once<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.910> while<00:03:12.470> anyway<00:03:13.470> this

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
time every once in a while anyway this

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.770 
time every once in a while anyway this
is<00:03:14.489> in<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.120> wetlands<00:03:15.480> right<00:03:16.260> here<00:03:17.660> enter<00:03:18.660> this

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
is in the wetlands right here enter this

is in the wetlands right here enter this
little<00:03:19.140> cave<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:21.260> this<00:03:22.260> is<00:03:22.410> another<00:03:22.800> nest

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
little cave and this is another nest

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.330 
little cave and this is another nest
that<00:03:23.910> contains<00:03:24.420> purple<00:03:24.989> eggs<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:29.010> could<00:03:29.190> be

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
that contains purple eggs so it could be

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.699 
that contains purple eggs so it could be
anywhere<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.150> entire<00:03:30.239> cave<00:03:33.440> let's<00:03:34.440> find

of the nest same thing with the leaping

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.580 
of the nest same thing with the leaping
actually<00:06:54.260> but<00:06:56.300> those<00:06:57.300> are<00:06:57.480> just<00:06:57.510> some<00:06:57.840> three

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
actually but those are just some three

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.720 
actually but those are just some three
areas<00:06:58.980> you<00:06:59.220> can<00:06:59.340> farm<00:06:59.670> that<00:07:01.100> the<00:07:02.100> crimson<00:07:02.520> well

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:02.730 
areas you can farm that the crimson well

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.990 
areas you can farm that the crimson well
tiny<00:07:03.180> crimson<00:07:03.630> whomp<00:07:03.810> is<00:07:04.310> most<00:07:05.310> hard<00:07:05.610> to<00:07:05.790> get

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
tiny crimson whomp is most hard to get

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.240 
tiny crimson whomp is most hard to get
out<00:07:06.210> of<00:07:06.270> the<00:07:06.570> three<00:07:06.840> I<00:07:06.870> showed<00:07:07.230> but<00:07:07.620> obviously

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
out of the three I showed but obviously

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.870 
out of the three I showed but obviously
it<00:07:08.580> is<00:07:09.510> the<00:07:10.410> most<00:07:10.620> valuable<00:07:10.860> because<00:07:11.550> if<00:07:11.820> I

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
it is the most valuable because if I

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.900 
it is the most valuable because if I
hard<00:07:12.150> it<00:07:12.270> is<00:07:12.360> to<00:07:12.570> get<00:07:13.640> one<00:07:14.640> hundred<00:07:14.880> percent

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910 
hard it is to get one hundred percent

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.740 
hard it is to get one hundred percent
look<00:07:16.640> some<00:07:17.640> people<00:07:17.670> get<00:07:18.060> it<00:07:18.180> on<00:07:18.300> their<00:07:18.510> third
