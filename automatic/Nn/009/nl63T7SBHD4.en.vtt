00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.340 
that but again we're going to do the
best<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:31.090> try<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.300> keep<00:01:31.510> our<00:01:31.690> halfpipe<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.200> get

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
best to try to keep our halfpipe and get

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.430

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
it going as fast as possible and then

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.960 
it going as fast as possible and then
along<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.500> round<00:01:35.830> lines<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.550> stuff<00:01:36.850> I

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
along the round lines of that stuff I

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.190
