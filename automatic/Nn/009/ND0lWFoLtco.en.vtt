of the mountain then as you move forward

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.150 
of the mountain then as you move forward
add<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> little<00:00:54.510> bit<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.690> crimson<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.980> can

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
add a little bit of crimson you can

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.529
