the aim then just to try and get a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.320 
the aim then just to try and get a
little<00:02:15.040> bit<00:02:15.220> more<00:02:15.370> influence<00:02:15.880> support<00:02:16.270> of

little bit more influence support of

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.940 
little bit more influence support of

influence in the Football Club in the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.500 
influence in the Football Club in the
direction<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.700> very<00:02:18.910> quickly<00:02:19.150> when

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
direction and very quickly when

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.910 
direction and very quickly when
everything<00:02:19.989> started<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.410> go<00:02:20.530> wrong<00:02:20.709> with<00:02:20.770> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
everything started to go wrong with the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.060 
everything started to go wrong with the
club<00:02:21.400> yet<00:02:21.610> again<00:02:21.880> we<00:02:22.150> started<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.989> try<00:02:23.830> and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
club yet again we started to try and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.800 
club yet again we started to try and
form<00:02:24.310> some<00:02:24.610> sort<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.910> safety<00:02:25.209> net<00:02:25.390> we

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
form some sort of safety net we

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.870 
form some sort of safety net we
seriously<00:02:26.230> thought<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:26.980> quite<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.520> period<00:02:27.580> of

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
seriously thought for quite a period of

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.300 
seriously thought for quite a period of
time<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.270> club<00:02:28.420> might<00:02:28.660> disappear<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:30.010> seemed

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
time the club might disappear it seemed

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.070 
time the club might disappear it seemed
like<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.790> way<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.090> which<00:02:31.120> we<00:02:31.390> could<00:02:31.570> save<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
like a way in which we could save the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.830 
like a way in which we could save the
club<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:33.459> trust<00:02:33.760> they<00:02:34.120> were<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.270> catalyst<00:02:34.810> to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
club the trust they were the catalyst to

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.620 
club the trust they were the catalyst to
say<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.380> when<00:02:36.010> when<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.670> existing<00:02:37.239> owners

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
say that when when the existing owners

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.020 
say that when when the existing owners
having<00:02:38.350> suffered<00:02:38.770> several<00:02:39.130> administrations

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
having suffered several administrations

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.670 
having suffered several administrations
were<00:02:40.660> actually<00:02:40.959> obviously<00:02:41.080> screwing<00:02:41.470> things

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
were actually obviously screwing things

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.430 
were actually obviously screwing things
up<00:02:41.890> then<00:02:42.610> could<00:02:43.570> they<00:02:43.720> then<00:02:43.900> go<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.170> help<00:02:44.350> and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
our history which is the championship

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.040 
our history which is the championship
once<00:04:54.060> we<00:04:54.210> get<00:04:54.360> there<00:04:54.600> we'll<00:04:54.750> have<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.930> have<00:04:55.020> a

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
once we get there we'll have to have a

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:02.420 
once we get there we'll have to have a
