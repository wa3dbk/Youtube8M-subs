00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the letters are removed so if you add

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.330 
the letters are removed so if you add
the<00:01:18.240> missing<00:01:18.540> letters<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.049> says<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.830> rank<00:01:20.130> is

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
alive it rises and falls based on how

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550

well<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.640> played<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.090> overall<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:25.200> based<00:01:25.439> on

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
well you played it overall it's based on

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.469 
well you played it overall it's based on
how<00:01:25.740> many<00:01:25.799> downs<00:01:26.189> versus<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.850> final<00:01:27.240> round

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
how many downs versus your final round

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.080 
how many downs versus your final round
lower<00:01:28.229> downs<00:01:28.590> count<00:01:29.009> against<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.610> more<00:01:29.880> than

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
lower downs count against you more than

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.060 
lower downs count against you more than
downs<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> later<00:01:30.900> rounds<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.799> need<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
downs in the later rounds you need to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.069 
downs in the later rounds you need to
make<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> high<00:01:32.670> rounds<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.509> rise<00:01:33.750> in

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
make it to the high rounds to rise in

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.920 
make it to the high rounds to rise in
right<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.689> how

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
right so there you have it that is how

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.080 
right so there you have it that is how
the<00:01:36.990> u<00:01:37.320> zombie<00:01:37.770> ranking<00:01:38.159> system<00:01:38.610> works<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the u zombie ranking system works and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.760 
the u zombie ranking system works and
this<00:01:39.270> actually<00:01:39.630> makes<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.930> lot<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> sense<00:01:40.530> so

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
this actually makes a lot of sense so

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.429 
this actually makes a lot of sense so
for<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.729> longest<00:01:42.060> time<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.750> thought<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.020> in

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
for the longest time we thought that in

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.499 
for the longest time we thought that in
your<00:01:43.799> rank<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.340> spaced<00:01:44.579> off<00:01:44.790> your<00:01:44.970> kills<00:01:45.240> over

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
your rank we spaced off your kills over

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.380 
your rank we spaced off your kills over
your<00:01:45.869> downs<00:01:46.079> your<00:01:46.500> k/d<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.030> find<00:01:48.270> out

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
your downs your k/d but as we find out

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.300 
your downs your k/d but as we find out
that<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.689> based<00:01:48.899> off<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.110> your<00:01:49.470> rounds<00:01:49.920> over

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that it's based off of your rounds over

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.090 
that it's based off of your rounds over
downs<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:51.299> also<00:01:51.689> makes<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.380> lot<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.680> sense

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
downs this also makes a lot of sense

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.550 
downs this also makes a lot of sense
because<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:54.180> notice<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.290> had<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
because we notice that as you had a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.120 
because we notice that as you had a
higher<00:01:55.799> KD<00:01:56.399> your<00:01:57.329> rank<00:01:57.630> went<00:01:57.930> up<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
higher KD your rank went up but the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.010 
higher KD your rank went up but the
higher<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.880> go<00:02:00.030> into<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> round<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
higher you go into the round so the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.980 
higher you go into the round so the
higher<00:02:01.259> your<00:02:01.619> KD<00:02:02.040> should<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.780> were<00:02:03.960> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
higher your KD should be so if I were to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.160 
higher your KD should be so if I were to
have<00:02:04.439> at<00:02:04.619> around<00:02:04.909> 31,000<00:02:05.909> downs<00:02:06.149> my<00:02:06.899> downs

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
have at around 31,000 downs my downs

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.410 
have at around 31,000 downs my downs
over<00:02:07.380> rounds<00:02:07.799> would<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:08.069> 30<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.640> my<00:02:09.119> kills

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
over rounds would be 30 and my kills

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.839 
over rounds would be 30 and my kills
over<00:02:09.629> downs<00:02:09.899> would<00:02:10.229> be

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
over downs would be

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.789 
over downs would be
1,000<00:02:11.659> and<00:02:11.900> then<00:02:12.140> if<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.379> were<00:02:12.499> to<00:02:12.650> make<00:02:12.739> it

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
1,000 and then if I were to make it

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.830 
1,000 and then if I were to make it
around<00:02:13.159> 40<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.640> have<00:02:13.760> 2,000<00:02:14.390> kills<00:02:14.599> with<00:02:14.810> one

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
around 40 and have 2,000 kills with one

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.429 
around 40 and have 2,000 kills with one
down<00:02:15.260> my<00:02:15.920> KD<00:02:16.400> would<00:02:16.609> be<00:02:16.760> 2,000<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:17.719> my<00:02:18.079> rounds

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
down my KD would be 2,000 and my rounds

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.459 
down my KD would be 2,000 and my rounds
over<00:02:18.680> downs<00:02:18.950> would<00:02:19.310> be<00:02:19.579> 40<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:21.019> kind<00:02:21.349> of

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469 
over downs would be 40 and it kind of

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.190 
over downs would be 40 and it kind of
grows<00:02:21.799> very<00:02:22.310> similarly<00:02:22.999> they<00:02:23.569> sort<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:23.989> grow

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
grows very similarly they sort of grow

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.170 
grows very similarly they sort of grow
almost<00:02:24.499> at<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.099> same<00:02:25.370> rate<00:02:25.700> although<00:02:26.060> of

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
almost at the same rate although of

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.729 
almost at the same rate although of
course<00:02:26.239> your<00:02:26.659> numbers<00:02:27.019> are<00:02:27.260> going<00:02:27.439> to<00:02:27.530> differ

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
course your numbers are going to differ

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.500 
course your numbers are going to differ
depending<00:02:27.889> on<00:02:28.250> how<00:02:28.370> many<00:02:28.430> kills<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:28.939> get<00:02:29.180> in<00:02:29.359> a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
depending on how many kills you get in a

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.479 
depending on how many kills you get in a
game<00:02:29.719> so<00:02:30.019> if<00:02:30.109> I<00:02:30.200> make<00:02:30.379> it<00:02:30.469> around<00:02:30.680> 40<00:02:31.099> in<00:02:31.310> a

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
game so if I make it around 40 in a

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.250 
game so if I make it around 40 in a
multiplayer<00:02:31.849> game<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.389> my<00:02:32.959> team<00:02:33.230> is

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
multiplayer game and my team is

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.379 
multiplayer game and my team is
basically<00:02:33.680> carrying<00:02:34.370> me<00:02:34.639> the<00:02:34.819> whole<00:02:35.060> time

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
basically carrying me the whole time

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.990 
basically carrying me the whole time
then<00:02:36.260> I'm<00:02:36.560> not<00:02:36.739> really<00:02:36.799> gonna<00:02:37.340> rank<00:02:37.669> up

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
then I'm not really gonna rank up

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.909 
then I'm not really gonna rank up
I<00:02:38.030> actually<00:02:38.239> know<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.540> still<00:02:38.930> am<00:02:39.260> gonna<00:02:39.500> rank<00:02:39.739> up

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:39.919 
I actually know I still am gonna rank up

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.500 
I actually know I still am gonna rank up
but<00:02:40.069> we<00:02:40.189> thought<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.669> the<00:02:40.700> old<00:02:40.939> system<00:02:41.359> that

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
but we thought in the old system that

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.599 
but we thought in the old system that
you<00:02:41.599> would<00:02:41.840> not<00:02:42.019> rank<00:02:42.319> up<00:02:42.560> but<00:02:42.980> clearly<00:02:43.310> all

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
you would not rank up but clearly all

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.280 
you would not rank up but clearly all
you<00:02:43.790> need<00:02:43.939> to<00:02:44.030> do<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.419> get<00:02:44.659> into<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.109> high

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
you need to do is get into the high

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.920 
you need to do is get into the high
rounds<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.769> not<00:02:45.950> die<00:02:46.159> too<00:02:46.219> often<00:02:46.819> but<00:02:47.480> anyway

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
rounds and not die too often but anyway

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.539 
rounds and not die too often but anyway
guys<00:02:48.109> my<00:02:48.409> name<00:02:48.560> is<00:02:48.590> John<00:02:48.949> that's<00:02:49.280> how<00:02:49.489> the
