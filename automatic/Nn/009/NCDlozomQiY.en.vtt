really<00:00:31.510> like<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.810> analogy<00:00:32.079> if<00:00:32.619> if<00:00:33.309> we<00:00:33.550> take

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
really like the analogy if if we take

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.389 
really like the analogy if if we take
the<00:00:33.850> bus<00:00:34.090> analogy<00:00:34.719> right<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.559> bus<00:00:35.829> being<00:00:36.219> the

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
the bus analogy right the bus being the

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.580 
the bus analogy right the bus being the
organization<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.480> values<00:00:37.870> really<00:00:38.079> are<00:00:38.320> how

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
organization the values really are how

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.860 
organization the values really are how
we<00:00:38.650> treat<00:00:39.280> each<00:00:39.460> other<00:00:39.790> when<00:00:40.450> we're<00:00:40.630> hanging

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
we treat each other when we're hanging

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.390 
we treat each other when we're hanging
out<00:00:41.110> on<00:00:41.410> that<00:00:41.890> bus

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
out on that bus

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.550 
out on that bus
so<00:00:42.820> putting<00:00:43.600> yours<00:00:43.840> together<00:00:44.110> what<00:00:44.440> are<00:00:44.530> the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
so putting yours together what are the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.810 
so putting yours together what are the
characteristics<00:00:45.220> of<00:00:45.310> a<00:00:45.340> great<00:00:45.460> value

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
characteristics of a great value

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.010 
characteristics of a great value
statement<00:00:46.210> let's<00:00:46.420> take<00:00:46.570> a<00:00:46.600> look

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
statement let's take a look

statement let's take a look
I<00:00:48.000> recommend<00:00:49.000> no<00:00:49.570> more<00:00:49.810> than<00:00:49.960> seven<00:00:50.320> I've<00:00:50.470> seen

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
I recommend no more than seven I've seen

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.770 
I recommend no more than seven I've seen
really<00:00:51.070> long<00:00:51.430> value<00:00:51.790> statements<00:00:52.210> and<00:00:52.360> if<00:00:52.540> you

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
really long value statements and if you

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.750 
really long value statements and if you
want<00:00:52.989> people<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.410> actually<00:00:53.800> behave<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:54.489> act

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
on these values people have to be able

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.100 
on these values people have to be able
to<00:00:56.559> remember<00:00:56.890> them<00:00:57.250> so<00:00:57.820> no<00:00:58.420> more<00:00:58.570> than<00:00:58.630> seven

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
statement after it is really helpful and

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.080 
statement after it is really helpful and
useful<00:01:10.409> they<00:01:11.409> need<00:01:11.619> to<00:01:11.740> be<00:01:11.859> shared<00:01:12.219> ideas<00:01:12.819> so

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
useful they need to be shared ideas so

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.449 
useful they need to be shared ideas so
the<00:01:13.479> point<00:01:13.899> here<00:01:14.229> is<00:01:14.259> everybody<00:01:14.859> has<00:01:15.039> values

00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:15.459 
the point here is everybody has values

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.639 
the point here is everybody has values
you<00:01:15.639> have<00:01:15.819> values<00:01:16.149> I<00:01:16.329> have<00:01:16.509> values<00:01:16.929> we<00:01:17.409> hold

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
you have values I have values we hold

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:18.989 
you have values I have values we hold
different<00:01:17.770> things<00:01:18.100> true<00:01:18.310> as<00:01:18.429> individuals

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:18.999 
different things true as individuals

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:21.719 
different things true as individuals
we're<00:01:19.450> asking<00:01:20.049> for<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:20.289> shared<00:01:20.799> set<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.520> values

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
we're asking for a shared set of values

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.029 
we're asking for a shared set of values
again<00:01:22.420> things<00:01:22.659> that<00:01:22.810> guide<00:01:23.079> our<00:01:23.109> behavior<00:01:23.859> as

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
again things that guide our behavior as

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.870 
again things that guide our behavior as
an<00:01:24.549> organization<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.450> lastly<00:01:26.409> it<00:01:26.679> may<00:01:27.159> be<00:01:27.549> in

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
an organization and lastly it may be in

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.789 
an organization and lastly it may be in
your<00:01:28.090> mission<00:01:28.420> statement<00:01:28.539> don't<00:01:29.469> worry<00:01:29.679> about

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
your mission statement don't worry about

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.949 
your mission statement don't worry about
it<00:01:30.009> we<00:01:30.609> get<00:01:30.759> a<00:01:30.789> little<00:01:30.999> tripped<00:01:31.209> up<00:01:31.389> on<00:01:31.539> how<00:01:31.749> all

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
it we get a little tripped up on how all

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.330 
it we get a little tripped up on how all
these<00:01:32.139> pieces<00:01:32.409> come<00:01:32.740> together<00:01:32.889> mission

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
these pieces come together mission

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.219 
these pieces come together mission
vision<00:01:33.459> values<00:01:33.639> but<00:01:34.179> we're<00:01:34.630> asking<00:01:35.079> for

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
vision values but we're asking for

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.929 
vision values but we're asking for
separate<00:01:35.950> statements<00:01:36.670> because<00:01:36.819> they<00:01:36.880> do

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
separate statements because they do

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.389 
separate statements because they do
separate<00:01:37.450> things<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.929> in<00:01:38.079> this<00:01:38.200> case<00:01:38.499> values

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
separate things and in this case values

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.779 
separate things and in this case values
again<00:01:39.819> helps<00:01:40.240> us<00:01:40.420> guide<00:01:40.779> our<00:01:41.109> behavior<00:01:41.429> so<00:01:42.429> you

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
again helps us guide our behavior so you

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.669 
again helps us guide our behavior so you
know<00:01:42.909> people<00:01:43.689> always<00:01:43.840> ask<00:01:43.959> me<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.349> a<00:01:44.380> really

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
know people always ask me to a really

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.440 
know people always ask me to a really
new<00:01:44.799> value<00:01:45.099> statement<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.639> I<00:01:45.819> would<00:01:45.849> say<00:01:46.149> well

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
new value statement and I would say well

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.559 
new value statement and I would say well
technically<00:01:47.319> you<00:01:47.499> don't<00:01:47.619> need<00:01:47.799> any<00:01:47.920> any<00:01:48.880> of

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
technically you don't need any any of

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:50.639 
technically you don't need any any of
these<00:01:49.749> statements<00:01:50.020> mission<00:01:50.380> vision<00:01:50.499> values

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
these statements mission vision values

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.279 
these statements mission vision values
or<00:01:50.950> whatever<00:01:51.069> the<00:01:51.310> case<00:01:51.490> may<00:01:51.639> be<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.810> value

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
or whatever the case may be but value

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:54.629 
or whatever the case may be but value
statements<00:01:53.709> are<00:01:53.799> so<00:01:54.039> important<00:01:54.609> because

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639 
statements are so important because

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.690 
statements are so important because
again<00:01:54.969> they<00:01:55.359> really<00:01:55.719> help<00:01:55.929> us<00:01:56.109> say<00:01:56.799> what<00:01:57.490> are

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
again they really help us say what are

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.789 
again they really help us say what are
you<00:01:57.909> allowed<00:01:58.599> to<00:01:58.630> do<00:01:58.929> what<00:01:59.139> do<00:01:59.200> we<00:01:59.289> expect<00:01:59.380> from

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
you allowed to do what do we expect from

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.379 
you allowed to do what do we expect from
your<00:01:59.950> behavior<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.549> again<00:02:00.939> what<00:02:01.119> is<00:02:01.209> dis

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:01.389 
your behavior and again what is dis

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:02.550 
your behavior and again what is dis
allowable<00:02:01.840> if<00:02:01.959> you<00:02:02.049> don't<00:02:02.200> do<00:02:02.349> these<00:02:02.499> things

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
allowable if you don't do these things

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.459 
allowable if you don't do these things
perhaps<00:02:03.549> or<00:02:03.849> fireable<00:02:04.149> offenses<00:02:04.630> which<00:02:05.289> kind

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
perhaps or fireable offenses which kind

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.109 
perhaps or fireable offenses which kind
of<00:02:05.529> brings<00:02:05.679> us<00:02:05.859> to<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:06.130> how<00:02:06.549> do<00:02:06.609> you<00:02:06.759> use<00:02:06.969> it

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
of brings us to this how do you use it

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.359 
of brings us to this how do you use it
piece<00:02:07.299> so<00:02:07.959> one<00:02:08.500> of<00:02:08.530> those<00:02:08.739> things<00:02:09.009> kind<00:02:09.310> of

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
piece so one of those things kind of

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.030 
piece so one of those things kind of
skipping<00:02:09.610> here<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:10.000> reinforcement<00:02:10.750> and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
skipping here to reinforcement and

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.470 
skipping here to reinforcement and
consequences<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.280> if<00:02:12.489> we're<00:02:12.700> we're<00:02:13.120> saying

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
consequences so if we're we're saying

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.180 
consequences so if we're we're saying
example<00:02:13.840> respect<00:02:14.349> is<00:02:14.560> an<00:02:14.680> important<00:02:15.069> value

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
example respect is an important value

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.270 
example respect is an important value
Lars<00:02:15.670> then<00:02:16.239> we<00:02:16.659> need<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.930> reinforce<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.680> in

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
Lars then we need to reinforce that in

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.430 
Lars then we need to reinforce that in
our<00:02:18.849> performance<00:02:19.360> management<00:02:19.510> reviews<00:02:20.170> for

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
our performance management reviews for

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.619 
our performance management reviews for
example<00:02:20.890> or<00:02:21.250> perhaps<00:02:21.760> there<00:02:22.000> are<00:02:22.030> rewards<00:02:22.239> or

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
example or perhaps there are rewards or

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.839 
example or perhaps there are rewards or
consequences<00:02:23.379> for<00:02:23.860> actually<00:02:24.250> living<00:02:24.549> out

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
consequences for actually living out

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.720 
consequences for actually living out
those<00:02:25.150> values<00:02:26.159> having<00:02:27.159> a<00:02:27.250> value<00:02:27.519> statement

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
those values having a value statement

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.280 
those values having a value statement
and<00:02:28.090> not<00:02:28.299> doing<00:02:28.599> anything<00:02:28.900> with<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.200> but

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
and not doing anything with it but

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.520 
and not doing anything with it but

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
putting it on the website is not useful

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.780 
putting it on the website is not useful
doing<00:02:32.530> something<00:02:32.860> thinking<00:02:33.010> with<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.459> around

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
doing something thinking with it around

doing something thinking with it around
training<00:02:34.230> brown-bag<00:02:35.230> lunches<00:02:35.680> what<00:02:35.950> is

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
training brown-bag lunches what is

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.339 
training brown-bag lunches what is
respect<00:02:36.430> really<00:02:36.730> mean<00:02:36.910> for<00:02:37.269> example<00:02:37.750> how<00:02:38.290> do

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
respect really mean for example how do

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.100 
respect really mean for example how do
we<00:02:38.530> show<00:02:39.340> respect<00:02:39.579> what<00:02:40.360> does<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.480> action

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
we show respect what does that action

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.360 
we show respect what does that action
look<00:02:41.349> like<00:02:41.560> well<00:02:41.739> you<00:02:41.799> ask<00:02:41.980> those<00:02:42.160> questions

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
look like well you ask those questions

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.160 
look like well you ask those questions
they<00:02:43.060> get<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.239> little<00:02:43.480> hard<00:02:43.690> they<00:02:43.810> get<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> little

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
they get a little hard they get a little

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.850 
they get a little hard they get a little
touchy-feely

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
touchy-feely

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.160 
touchy-feely
but<00:02:45.519> we're<00:02:45.670> asking<00:02:46.150> for<00:02:46.299> behavior<00:02:46.900> and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
but we're asking for behavior and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.839 
but we're asking for behavior and
behavior<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.040> pretty<00:02:48.250> personal

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
behavior is pretty personal

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.930 
behavior is pretty personal
right<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:49.709> alignment<00:02:50.709> is<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:50.980> last<00:02:51.190> thing<00:02:51.430> on

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
right so alignment is the last thing on

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.270 
right so alignment is the last thing on
how<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.480> use<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.079> perhaps<00:02:53.769> customer

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
how to use it so perhaps customer

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.039 
how to use it so perhaps customer
satisfaction<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:54.970> one<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.239> your<00:02:55.359> values<00:02:55.720> well

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
then you should have a policy that

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.309 
then you should have a policy that
you'll<00:02:57.790> have<00:02:57.970> Auto<00:02:58.239> percent<00:02:58.660> satisfaction

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
you'll have Auto percent satisfaction

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.650 
you'll have Auto percent satisfaction

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
particular exercise and the process

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.099 
particular exercise and the process
should<00:03:27.160> not<00:03:27.400> be<00:03:27.669> getting<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.269> room<00:03:28.510> about<00:03:29.049> a

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
should not be getting in a room about a

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
say well why don't we all believe in

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.229 
say well why don't we all believe in
because<00:03:32.889> you<00:03:33.370> know<00:03:33.609> you<00:03:33.669> kind<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.030> need<00:03:34.209> to

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
because you know you kind of need to

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.069 
because you know you kind of need to
think<00:03:34.540> about<00:03:34.780> it

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
think about it

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.250 
think about it
so<00:03:35.590> it's<00:03:35.859> personal<00:03:36.190> it's<00:03:36.959> individual<00:03:37.959> and

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
so it's personal it's individual and

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.500 
so it's personal it's individual and
that<00:03:38.290> means<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.190> would<00:03:39.310> send<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:39.940> out<00:03:40.060> via<00:03:40.450> a

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
that means I would send it out via a

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.360 
that means I would send it out via a
survey<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.530> would<00:03:41.709> make<00:03:41.919> sure<00:03:42.130> it's

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
survey and I would make sure it's

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.170

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
back the right answer which kind of goes

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.080 
back the right answer which kind of goes
without<00:03:53.470> saying<00:03:53.769> but<00:03:53.980> what's<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.730> question

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
together make sure it's not hollow when

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.170 
together make sure it's not hollow when
everybody<00:04:24.520> has<00:04:24.669> input<00:04:25.120> into<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.450> process

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
everybody has input into the process

everyone's included then you have a

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.980 
everyone's included then you have a
value<00:04:28.340> statement<00:04:28.759> that<00:04:28.880> has<00:04:29.030> some<00:04:29.300> meaning<00:04:29.810> as
