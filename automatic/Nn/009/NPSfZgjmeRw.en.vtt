means<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.890> it's<00:04:38.100> going<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.310> be<00:04:38.570> essentially

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
means that it's going to be essentially

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.690 
means that it's going to be essentially
just<00:04:39.990> something<00:04:40.620> for<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.860> weekend<00:04:41.280> something

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
just something for the weekend something

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.180 
just something for the weekend something
for<00:04:41.880> fun<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.420> even<00:04:43.050> if<00:04:43.260> it<00:04:43.410> rains<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:43.800> won't<00:04:44.040> be

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
for fun and even if it rains I won't be

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.960 
for fun and even if it rains I won't be
able<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.550> use<00:04:44.730> it<00:04:44.760> unlike<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.570> miata<00:04:46.190> so<00:04:47.190> it's

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
able to use it unlike the miata so it's

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.030 
able to use it unlike the miata so it's
definitely<00:04:48.480> something<00:04:48.870> I<00:04:49.140> got<00:04:49.380> that<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:49.890> have

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
definitely something I got that I have

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.530 
definitely something I got that I have
to<00:04:50.190> think<00:04:50.400> about<00:04:50.490> one<00:04:51.030> thing<00:04:51.240> that's<00:04:51.480> a

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
to think about one thing that's a

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.200 
to think about one thing that's a
downside<00:04:52.050> though<00:04:52.260> is<00:04:52.290> that<00:04:52.470> my<00:04:52.830> fiance<00:04:53.490> who<00:04:53.820> I

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
downside though is that my fiance who I

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.360 
downside though is that my fiance who I
really<00:04:54.750> want<00:04:55.020> her<00:04:55.200> to<00:04:55.560> continue<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:56.160> learn<00:04:56.310> how

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
really want her to continue to learn how

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.250 
really want her to continue to learn how
to<00:04:56.610> drive<00:04:56.850> stick<00:04:57.150> she<00:04:57.480> won't<00:04:57.690> be<00:04:57.810> able<00:04:57.840> to

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
to drive stick she won't be able to

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.020 
to drive stick she won't be able to
drive<00:04:59.010> it<00:04:59.040> because<00:04:59.520> it<00:04:59.669> does<00:04:59.820> require

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
drive it because it does require

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.180 
drive it because it does require
motorcycle<00:05:00.930> endorsement<00:05:01.020> and<00:05:01.500> she<00:05:01.680> has<00:05:01.830> zero

the<00:05:05.640> pull<00:05:05.820> our<00:05:05.940> slingshot<00:05:06.540> is<00:05:06.870> at<00:05:07.230> as<00:05:07.410> close

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
the pull our slingshot is at as close

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.180 
the pull our slingshot is at as close
number<00:05:08.280> two<00:05:08.460> right<00:05:08.669> now<00:05:09.500> between<00:05:10.500> that<00:05:10.980> and

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
number two right now between that and

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.220 
number two right now between that and
the<00:05:11.400> miata<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:12.360> next<00:05:12.600> car<00:05:12.780> that<00:05:12.930> I'm<00:05:13.050> thinking

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
the miata the next car that I'm thinking

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.740 
the miata the next car that I'm thinking
about<00:05:13.470> is<00:05:13.890> going<00:05:14.490> to<00:05:14.610> be<00:05:14.730> used<00:05:15.030> and<00:05:15.300> that's<00:05:15.570> a

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
about is going to be used and that's a

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.750 
about is going to be used and that's a
BMW<00:05:16.350> 335i<00:05:18.020> so<00:05:19.020> what's<00:05:19.590> good<00:05:19.860> about<00:05:19.950> the<00:05:20.190> BMW

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
BMW 335i so what's good about the BMW

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.330 
BMW 335i so what's good about the BMW
335i<00:05:21.360> is<00:05:21.600> that<00:05:21.960> it'll<00:05:22.169> be<00:05:22.290> the<00:05:22.770> least

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
335i is that it'll be the least

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.880 
335i is that it'll be the least
expensive<00:05:23.790> of<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.330> three<00:05:24.560> probably<00:05:25.560> coming

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
expensive of the three probably coming

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.279 
expensive of the three probably coming
in<00:05:26.040> just<00:05:26.430> under<00:05:26.760> 20<00:05:27.090> grand<00:05:27.360> is<00:05:27.600> what<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.960> do

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
in just under 20 grand is what I do

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.409 
in just under 20 grand is what I do
willing<00:05:28.499> to<00:05:28.559> spend<00:05:28.800> on<00:05:29.009> one<00:05:29.249> with<00:05:29.699> a<00:05:29.729> 335i

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
willing to spend on one with a 335i

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:31.969 
willing to spend on one with a 335i
obviously<00:05:31.169> it's<00:05:31.319> going<00:05:31.349> to<00:05:31.529> be<00:05:31.649> the<00:05:31.770> most

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
obviously it's going to be the most

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.070 
obviously it's going to be the most
comfortable<00:05:32.300> it's<00:05:33.300> going<00:05:33.539> to<00:05:33.569> be<00:05:33.719> the<00:05:33.869> largest

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
comfortable it's going to be the largest

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.379 
comfortable it's going to be the largest
car<00:05:34.649> it's<00:05:34.979> going<00:05:35.189> to<00:05:35.249> be<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.969> most<00:05:36.180> luxurious

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
car it's going to be the most luxurious

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.040 
car it's going to be the most luxurious
of<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.319> three<00:05:38.059> but<00:05:39.059> the<00:05:39.180> downsides<00:05:39.689> of<00:05:39.869> the

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
of the three but the downsides of the

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.450 
of the three but the downsides of the
335<00:05:40.710> is<00:05:41.099> that<00:05:42.020> just<00:05:43.020> like<00:05:43.159> almost<00:05:44.159> all

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
335 is that just like almost all

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.290 
335 is that just like almost all
generations<00:05:45.029> of<00:05:45.629> M<00:05:45.960> models<00:05:46.649> if<00:05:47.610> you<00:05:47.819> don't<00:05:48.059> get

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
generations of M models if you don't get

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.239 
generations of M models if you don't get
the<00:05:48.599> MU<00:05:49.349> don't<00:05:49.559> get<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:49.770> limited<00:05:50.129> slip

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:50.249 
the MU don't get a limited slip

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.450 
the MU don't get a limited slip
differentials<00:05:51.089> so<00:05:51.389> with<00:05:51.779> the<00:05:51.869> 335i<00:05:52.529> people

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.639 
differentials so with the 335i people
put<00:05:53.639> a<00:05:53.669> lot<00:05:53.729> of<00:05:53.909> power<00:05:54.180> into<00:05:54.569> them<00:05:54.719> but<00:05:55.319> the

issue comes with putting power down to

power<00:06:09.300> but<00:06:09.930> I've<00:06:10.050> always<00:06:10.199> really<00:06:10.559> loved<00:06:10.949> the

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
styling of the 335i I really love how to

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.249 
styling of the 335i I really love how to
me<00:06:14.759> it<00:06:14.999> actually<00:06:15.089> looks<00:06:15.449> better<00:06:15.539> than<00:06:16.020> the

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
me it actually looks better than the

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.339 
me it actually looks better than the
m3's<00:06:16.409> of<00:06:17.009> that<00:06:17.129> generation<00:06:17.779> and<00:06:18.779> I<00:06:19.169> don't

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
m3's of that generation and I don't

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:21.559 
m3's of that generation and I don't
think<00:06:19.589> I'll<00:06:19.709> be<00:06:20.009> getting<00:06:20.159> an<00:06:20.520> m3<00:06:20.729> because<00:06:21.330> of

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569 
think I'll be getting an m3 because of

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.889 
think I'll be getting an m3 because of
cost<00:06:22.469> but<00:06:22.979> the<00:06:23.069> 335i<00:06:23.729> would<00:06:24.119> definitely<00:06:24.689> be<00:06:24.869> a

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:24.899 
cost but the 335i would definitely be a

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:27.100 
cost but the 335i would definitely be a
fun<00:06:25.259> car<00:06:25.529> to<00:06:25.559> drive<00:06:25.680> it<00:06:26.520> would<00:06:26.610> also<00:06:26.639> be

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
fun car to drive it would also be

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.049 
fun car to drive it would also be
convenient<00:06:28.110> it<00:06:28.740> would<00:06:28.889> be<00:06:28.949> a<00:06:28.979> larger<00:06:29.430> car<00:06:29.699> that

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:30.059 
convenient it would be a larger car that

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:32.089 
convenient it would be a larger car that
you<00:06:30.449> know<00:06:30.569> my<00:06:30.809> parents<00:06:31.349> won't<00:06:31.529> have<00:06:31.709> issues
