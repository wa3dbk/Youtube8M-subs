00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.950
 Hello dear 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.970
 water today we have such excursions 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.160
 here 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.820
 experienced taunts on fountain sergei 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.520
 Valerievich grows in his garden 66 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.369
 grape varieties and he tells us 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.779
 how to care for him like 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.420
 feed up how to stare look 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.990
 if anyone is interested and now too 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.730
 some very useful information 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.450
 please tell me why are we here 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.760
 want to see 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.340
 we have previously filmed a program where 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:46.430
 I showed the seedlings as they say 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.400
 about in the breeding ground before the seedlings that they 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.850
 in small plastic cups there with 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.620
 small escape well with this escape 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.020
 Here we are with such small shoots and I 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.570
 told me that these seedlings have two 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.059
 paths after all two paths of landing that is from 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.020
 This glass plant immediately in the garden if 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.210
 the weather is worth a good warm roast or 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.479
 planted them with the beginning of large 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.380
 containers for comparison here we are now 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.060
 with you and see this here I landed 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.369
 looked at what was spring this year 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.200
 we have such early warm from light here 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.520
 promised that rigoletto will start and 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.800
 so I landed 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.550
 here is this sapling somewhere I had 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.390
 landed tenths or even twenties 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.290
 the dates of May 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.300
 dropped him and now he see he sits 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.259
 gave a little increase well, sort of like not 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.990
 growing and getting sick maybe even 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.050
 a little bit and well, everything is probably from the fact that 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.720
 it's very cold now and wet there 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.940
 we even have it in my lane 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.670
 I was told that even here overseas were 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.990
 even before the temperature reached 0 degrees and 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.270
 even to -1 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.550
 Well, this sapling was mean 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.759
 originally planted and here's another option 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:12.140
 yes the fact that the same sapling was planted 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:14.600
 Here in the tank, he is a bottle and here 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.819
 see what the result is due to 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.670
 the fact that he stands with me even in the garden I 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.349
 I came to water it 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.720
 but the earth com warmed up 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.569
 warms up very powerful and you see in 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.849
 the roots are closely here the roots closely then 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.430
 have seen them over there so they verzily in 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.069
 here they are not visible to them 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.150
 dough he roots powerfully develops due to 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.400
 the fact that it is warming 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.740
 once the roots grow it means it starts 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.880
 grow very much and that 's how it is 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.210
 says top to yard 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.370
 but again how brightly I say this when he 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.530
 you grow in this condition also not 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.550
 need to think that he does not need any 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.010
 care here too we fight it 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.120
 remove stepchildren here they are stepchildren we 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.220
 remove them all this is necessary in order to 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.310
 Here is this vine we matured it 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:11.160
 It should jun 11's these little essentially 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:16.050
 delete and here as a result we finish with 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.570
 that the fall was formed 2 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.640
 well or maximum here 3 escape if he 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.830
 leads a weak escape I'll cut it 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.830
 so leave no bones two escapes and 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.660
 transplant it into the ground or can be well 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.210
 in the autumn I do not advise late but somewhere 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.870
 in late August or mid-August here 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.240
 this sapling 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.180
 need to transplant it and transplant here 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:46.310
 up to this level that is you understand here 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.600
 bury it out of it 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.070
 the only thing that I told 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.660
 gardeners that before this 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.510
 of course it was necessary to plant the tank 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.340
 plastic bag scales need that 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.880
 you could have flown the pouch out and pull out 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.370
 rearrange here but it advise gardeners 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.760
 inexperienced beginner I get 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.100
 pretty good i dry this one 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.700
 whom he shrinks a little neatly 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.770
 I cut 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.540
 and I can even carefully transplant it 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.220
 during the summer, in principle, painless 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.750
 still remind our please with the people 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.530
 You said that you cant 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.080
 fight this seedling when i 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.610
 annoyed tilt when i plant i 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.500
 I will set at such an angle here 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.170
 can be so planted or can 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.820
 look at this 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.090
 this escape has gone deeper 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.980
 the ground here this escape was tilted and here 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.740
 see if I planted it 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.500
 condition here he plays it will be possible 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.510
 leaned in easily and he just as easily and 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.700
 rises yes that's as easy and and 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.830
 rises rises if you have to be it 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.560
 raise need to let in it is easy to play 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.169
 if you land like this upright 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.780
 on upright what have you got when your eyes 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.580
 will become so fat you will begin to bend 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.660
 even now his hammocks are not 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.210
 in vain yes therefore everything is clear 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.040
 Well, dear gardeners see what 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.250
 useful information 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.380
 we have in the middle lane to make 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.290
 some kind of time running for development 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.810
 seedlings can be planted here 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.360
 such tanks that made their way earthen 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.580
 com they got there planted in 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.260
 such technology sapling basically in 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.700
 next year you can get it already 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:35.900
 the first group of the same that is in the second year 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:40.850
 his life can get 1 guest 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.850
 Well, thank you very much very valuable experience
