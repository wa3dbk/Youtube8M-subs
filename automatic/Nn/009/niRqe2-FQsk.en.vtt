 black ops 2 to big and mw3 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.229
 and with description so what do today 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.630
 actually crazy is mine exactly 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.939
 round beat like that and before that goes 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.119
 namely not at all where to start 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.439
 best of all we have so first 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.509
 so that we explain 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.060
 we do not have any right now 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:41.070
 Three years you can almost two 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:43.560
 years on youtube the thing is namely 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.520
 like me, I came to you there 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.820
 I had something with 114 113 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.820
 subscribers 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.270
 then he will find the danger 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.700
 that something with 1000 resource and has 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.450
 has your youtube concept was following 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.280
 that you're kind of a guest commentary on it 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.700
 offers or hosts we wanted that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.100
 actually 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.570
 So as I said I had subscribers 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.250
 had then written to me when she 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.039
 had a good gameplay even if they did 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.140
 had no channel or on 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.569
 and just tried her video 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.159
 a little bit circulating and yes me 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.780
 hab thank has gratefully accepted 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.519
 she then commented on the subscriber 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.890
 or better, the audience, too 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.870
 the possibility given the gameplay 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.170
 comment yourself and then join them 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.700
 I have to be uploaded on my channel 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.150
 some gameplay with me on the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.829
 channel of guests came to a stand 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.810
 that the thing so I'm looking forward 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.549
 as I said before and so far she has 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:46.090
 me then directly as synonymous as accepted 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:53.239
 Gameplay and that does not know dna or 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:54.829
 that has to be sent in the gameplay 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.349
 so it was in the winkl that we 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.959
 then had a lot of contact live 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.609
 and only that will be a lot of year 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.930
 youtube did it together 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.590
 me also visit me 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.859
 home and gave my wife that they were 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.859
 still times 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.079
 We also understood each other blindly 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.629
 have one or the other video on 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.150
 made my channel and yes I am 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.769
 Me too my first start on youtube 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.530
 and I think that's good too 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.329
 so some others youtuber so the one 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.459
 or other sweet ones give themselves the chance 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.379
 so into the foreground to put in 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.750
 of still guest gameplays or 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.639
 guest commentary is still the start 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.620
 the three newcomers 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.120
 There are many who just do not stop that 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.159
 possibility or just not that 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.500
 audience had to upload videos 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.970
 and yes, they had them with me 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.139
 chance to upload the video and 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.040
 maybe 10,567 subscribers more too 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.439
 many have helped who have 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.269
 then also extremely thanks for me 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.739
 I definitely cool but you have to 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.659
 to say yes now that the channel 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.419
 unfortunately fell asleep and with my 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:08.449
 woman now in new opened the 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:12.319
 panthers or stocks fish she knows 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:14.509
 the hotel guests next to one say the 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.859
 In conclusion the name is whether the fires 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:27.340
 a helicopter threatens to be in the rib 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:29.830
 in action see how exactly the thing 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.990
 actually so donation what was so and 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.879
 why was and anyway it will be first 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.069
 all consists together with fango 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:43.689
 I came to the subject three times 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:48.819
 on one imaginary list the other 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:50.919
 theme still and soja the game is mp3 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.210
 a story in itself are the 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.520
 last few days we are already here 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.279
 nice games appeared for example 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.979
 do you all know I have a lot already 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:01.840
 often thought scary what do you think 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.629
 from this bowl so for this 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.879
 my game of course me 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:09.219
 personally i find uphill science and 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:23.650
 I think that's the best game now 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:26.409
 shown game gambled or I have them 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.240
 only attached to black ops 11 games 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.560
 say that so mw2 is mine 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.349
 after all, still one of the 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.270
 best games ever but think big 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.009
 definitely better than black ops 2 so 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.599
 that's because it's just features 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.000
 You can open and close gates 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.500
 to open when the broken 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.789
 do it like that and that 's easy with the 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.259
 Holidays just share a bit 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.940
 I think that's the only way you can do it 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.319
 act and say the door now 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.479
 to make the move so we just 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:51.789
 free and can just go forward 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.270
 look and also map technical it is 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.270
 just cool 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:02.710
 the thing is but the following so with the 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:06.150
 to make history , and so on 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:09.279
 then I have the whole tld co star 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.139
 well so i meet cornelius the 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:13.960
 people see the one successes it again 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.990
 quite often that I have so many and 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.240
 Here a three in the background man 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.240
 so just meet if I find really 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.490
 Mist you imagine once in cod mw2 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.300
 so imagine yourselves before his mind 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.599
 eye 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.520
 cod mw2 then we got out of there 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:32.949
 play out the peg 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.530
 then we have the youtuber way and the 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:37.330
 g8er kimbo so then we imagine that 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:41.590
 Shield if a shield the level us 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:44.710
 From mp3 as fast as it is so agile 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:48.340
 as it is and yes and what are still taking 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:51.340
 from black ops 2 takers that donna axes 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.650
 was as nice as a gum by the 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.259
 edge flies and then I think I have 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:59.830
 our perfect cod meat still 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:02.590
 be on cd goes well well the financial statements 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:05.409
 I like the magic and stuff like that and cool 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.990
 the new sequences themselves have it 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:09.280
 nicely done the cost and then 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.530
 you would have the nice cod that one 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.569
 gambling could end without end 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.280
 where the weaning mixture of all so 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:17.110
 It would be pretty cool though 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.669
 I also find the big killstreaks 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.380
 I have to say that although it is a right 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:22.360
 high game the meet nothing 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.080
 so a blind chicken meets more than 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.520
 a helicopter in the sky quite honestly 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.440
 therefore the killstreaks of mw2 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.090
 People definitely head though me 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.860
 i would say ghost i maps because of me 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.659
 you can actually find it pretty cool 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.580
 hide in the high grass and 

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:37.900
 there is also a box rum or 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:43.780
 Anything else, I think it's cool 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:45.430
 So not that I'm on the tail as well as many 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:49.060
 kids hammer because here are still 800 port 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.949
 even something he can do again briefly 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.940
 talking about cinema mode is that of 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:56.500
 was looked out so now that is 

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.300
 game to an end if we have a god 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.659
 Others continue to talk about cod 

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:13.740
 cost and general cod or say 

00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:13.740
 and yes thank you for being there
