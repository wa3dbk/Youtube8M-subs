the time the Montego jumbo twist crochet

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.480 
the time the Montego jumbo twist crochet
braid<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:09.030> fast<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.900> easy<00:00:10.080> style<00:00:10.620> since

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
braid is a fast and easy style since

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.629 
braid is a fast and easy style since
it's<00:00:11.730> done<00:00:12.000> with<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.599> single<00:00:13.110> looped<00:00:13.380> top<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.190> is

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
it's done with a single looped top it is

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.760 
it's done with a single looped top it is
a<00:00:14.670> lot<00:00:14.910> more<00:00:15.120> secure<00:00:15.599> than<00:00:15.900> anything<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.590> has

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
a lot more secure than anything that has

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.849 
a lot more secure than anything that has
a<00:00:17.039> double<00:00:17.430> tail<00:00:17.699> braid<00:00:18.140> to<00:00:19.140> install<00:00:19.619> these

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
a double tail braid to install these

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.800 
a double tail braid to install these
you're<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> need<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.119> create<00:00:21.300> your

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
you're going to need to create your

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.750 
you're going to need to create your
braided<00:00:22.230> base<00:00:22.439> which<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.369> six

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
braided base which is going to have six

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.240 
braided base which is going to have six
or<00:00:23.910> seven<00:00:24.330> cornrows<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.590> girl<00:00:25.949> would<00:00:26.220> have

or seven cornrows this girl would have

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.820 
or seven cornrows this girl would have
way<00:00:26.910> too<00:00:26.970> many<00:00:27.300> cornrows<00:00:27.900> for<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.560> style

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
way too many cornrows for this style

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.179 
way too many cornrows for this style
they're<00:00:29.400> also<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> little<00:00:30.539> too<00:00:30.810> tight<00:00:31.170> as<00:00:31.529> you

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
they're also a little too tight as you

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.180 
they're also a little too tight as you
can<00:00:32.369> tell<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:33.149> has<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> lot<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.989> bulk<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.770> so

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
can tell this has a lot of bulk to it so

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
can tell this has a lot of bulk to it so
you're<00:00:35.340> gonna<00:00:35.489> want<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.820> build<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.270> cornrows

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
you're gonna want to build your cornrows

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.979 
you're gonna want to build your cornrows
a<00:00:36.809> little<00:00:37.380> bit<00:00:37.559> looser<00:00:38.149> okay<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.510> install

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
a little bit looser okay to install

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.840 
a little bit looser okay to install
these<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.890> we're<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.700> we're

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
these what we're going to do is we're

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.459 
these what we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.149> use<00:00:42.300> our<00:00:42.660> latch<00:00:42.870> hook<00:00:43.079> tool<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
going to use our latch hook tool and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.380 
going to use our latch hook tool and
we're<00:00:43.559> gonna<00:00:43.649> go<00:00:43.860> down<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> opposite

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
we're gonna go down in the opposite

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.750 
we're gonna go down in the opposite
direction<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.469> want<00:00:46.620> our<00:00:46.860> braids<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.550> lay

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
direction that we want our braids to lay

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.330 
direction that we want our braids to lay
so<00:00:48.510> since<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.930> want<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.379> braid<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.070> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
so since I want this braid going in this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.880 
so since I want this braid going in this
direction<00:00:50.399> I'm<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.199> pull<00:00:52.530> in

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
direction I'm going to have to pull in

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.939 
direction I'm going to have to pull in
the<00:00:53.399> opposing<00:00:54.180> direction<00:00:54.770> let's<00:00:55.770> take<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the opposing direction let's take a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.189 
the opposing direction let's take a
closer<00:00:56.309> look<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:57.719> sure<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.960> leave

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
closer look at that be sure to leave

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.420 
closer look at that be sure to leave
ample<00:00:58.739> space<00:00:59.100> between<00:00:59.879> each<00:01:00.120> braid<00:01:01.190> push<00:01:02.190> your

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
ample space between each braid push your

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.830 
ample space between each braid push your
latch<00:01:02.640> hook<00:01:02.879> underneath<00:01:03.539> your<00:01:03.989> cornrow<00:01:05.840> grab

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
latch hook underneath your cornrow grab

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.130 
latch hook underneath your cornrow grab
ahold<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.979> top<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> twist<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.150> pull

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
ahold of the top of the twist and pull

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.590 
ahold of the top of the twist and pull
it<00:01:10.290> back<00:01:10.500> through<00:01:11.869> next<00:01:12.869> open<00:01:13.619> up<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.950> loop

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
it back through next open up the loop

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600 
it back through next open up the loop
pull<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.630> tail<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> braid<00:01:16.770> through<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
pull the tail of the braid through the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.609 
pull the tail of the braid through the
loop<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:20.210> cinch<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> down<00:01:21.390> tightly<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
loop and cinch it down tightly to the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:32.950 
loop and cinch it down tightly to the
braid<00:01:27.229> next<00:01:28.229> adjust<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.280> into<00:01:29.759> position

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.480 

because<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> bulkier<00:01:34.829> style<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.430> we

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
because this is a bulkier style and we

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.160 
because this is a bulkier style and we
do<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.180> leave<00:01:36.390> some<00:01:36.689> room<00:01:36.900> between

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
do have to leave some room between

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.289 
do have to leave some room between
braids<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.920> order<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> fill<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.970> not

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
braids in order to fill it out and not

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.109 
braids in order to fill it out and not
be<00:01:39.450> too<00:01:39.659> heavy<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.979> want<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.700> make

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
be too heavy what we want to do is make

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.789 
be too heavy what we want to do is make
sure<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.570> install<00:01:42.990> these<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
sure that we install these in a

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.340 
sure that we install these in a
simulated<00:01:44.490> Brickley<00:01:44.939> pattern<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:46.140> that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
simulated Brickley pattern what that

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
simulated Brickley pattern what that
means<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.829> where<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.490> ones<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.420> row

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
means is where you have ones in a row

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.010 
means is where you have ones in a row
above<00:01:48.930> you're<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.189> offset<00:01:50.880> them<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
above you're going to offset them on the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.280 
above you're going to offset them on the
row<00:01:52.170> above<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.759> row<00:01:53.909> below<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.360> so

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
row above it and the row below it so

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.840 
row above it and the row below it so
what<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.619> means<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.070> where<00:01:56.250> there<00:01:56.430> are<00:01:56.549> two

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
what that means is where there are two

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.149 
what that means is where there are two
on<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.360> row<00:01:57.570> there<00:01:57.990> should<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.290> one<00:01:58.500> directly

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
on this row there should be one directly

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.030 
on this row there should be one directly
in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> middle<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.420> either<00:02:00.840> side<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
in the middle and on either side of the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.249 
in the middle and on either side of the
braids<00:02:02.250> coming<00:02:02.460> down<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.509> will<00:02:03.719> create<00:02:03.990> a

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
braids coming down that will create a

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.980 
braids coming down that will create a
look<00:02:04.649> that's<00:02:04.950> not<00:02:05.130> too<00:02:05.430> scalping<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.840> we're

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
look that's not too scalping so we're
