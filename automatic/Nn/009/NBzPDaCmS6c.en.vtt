00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:09.400
 Well, once our figure is 

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:11.920
 completely dry 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.279
 you will notice that the paper gets a 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.279
 very big firmness then 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.540
 let's continue what we will do to 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.730
 then it will be resangar as 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.810
 you see the papier mache while its texture does not 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.820
 it's so great slab even so the 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.820
 imperfections are notorious 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.100
 if we paint this surface goes 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.370
 to be corrugated with many edges 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.950
 for that it will be necessary to use a 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.850
 wall resonator that I got in 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.850
 any hardware store 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.820
 I recommend that you do not use the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.730
 resonator is a 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.010
 material more resistant to the moment of 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.860
 dried and also does not crumble 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.660
 moment that has solidified we are going to 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.110
 start then to work it for this 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.600
 it will not be necessary to use oblivion and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.940
 we're going to need to have a little bit of 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.040
 water with which we will be helping 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.990
 Smoothing the surface is very simple 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.750
 you're just going to take it with your finger and what 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.750
 let's go placing on the surface 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.330
 this way we will go 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.730
 distributing until the edges 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.170
 are covered we will be placing 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.170
 a little more quantity 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.080
 do not worry if you do not have any left now 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.150
 ready because it's a bit complicated with 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.530
 the pure finger leave a surface 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.229
 completely smooth 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.170
 because the edges of the paper do not 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.830
 allow and also because the consistency 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.950
 of this resonator is very pasty 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.400
 so when you pass your finger maybe you 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.310
 it arises but there is no problem because 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.530
 in a moment 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.189
 let's give it a much more finished 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.009
 smooth with the water that we have here for 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.039
 help them we are going to go it working for 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.899
 areas by sections because it's likely 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.120
 that as soon as you finish putting everything 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.269
 the resonator in the whole body will go 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.790
 drying where you started to place 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.390
 first then we wet a little 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.970
 fingers 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.630
 only and we will be doing the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.630
 surface 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.200
 in this way 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.129
 very simple 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.540
 these economic resonators actually 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:44.480
 the little boats like these that have 475 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.069
 milliliters 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.049
 with 475 ml it does not even yield as 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.659
 up to four or five figures of this 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.840
 size and the cost is very low around 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.480
 of the three dollars and as I tell you 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.060
 would give us as for five or four 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.209
 figures of this size drying is 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.610
 relatively fast actually it 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:12.970
 It may take about two hours and 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.970
 ready and good once it has dried 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.250
 that is completely dry then 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.590
 let's see if he had any 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.590
 imperfection that is very notorious 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.010
 and if that is the case, then it will be necessary to sand 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.590
 I recommend it to be a thin sandpaper 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.530
 soft to leave the surface without 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.450
 scratches and as smooth as possible 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.650
 once we finish sanding it 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.080
 so if we are going to start painting you 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.580
 I recommend using colors ports to 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.810
 this flashy phosphorescent work 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.000
 because it is the concept of an alebrije 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.180
 for that good we are going to help us 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.860
 obviously with a brush and the paints 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.720
 that we will use will be paintings 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.470
 acrylic paint design 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.630
 will do 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.080
 to put it to your liking 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.390
 for example 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.600
 I'm going to paint his wings red 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.370
 we will then have something like this 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.040
 now let's continue with the legs 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.750
 let's paint them only the four 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.970
 of a single color I think a blue 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.950
 clearly it goes well'll teach you a trick 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.710
 to be able to delimit to be able to do 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.540
 margins in this case to be able to do 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.610
 a line and so that we do not miss the 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.800
 painting from a margin 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.680
 You can use or help with 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.090
 Water markers is much easier 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.400
 with a marker that with a brush 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.849
 well since we have delineated 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.649
 flowers 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:51.209
 as far as the margin of 

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:54.149
 our red color then yes with a 

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:55.600
 little bit of more confidence we can start to 

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:59.220
 Brushes 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.700
 well let's go then to continue painting 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.100
 actually the colors the forms are 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.910
 only suggested because you can 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.350
 use the colors you want 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.350
 which in the end is good 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.610
 create the decoration or the figures 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.540
 what you like best 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.790
 this is only a recommendation 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.190
 we can also with the help of a stick 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.410
 of orange go marking point by point 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.420
 to form these flowers and is that we 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.330
 will be perfect to decorate the torso 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.820
 of our pig how will you also notice 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.430
 I have put some small circles in 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.670
 the wings this with the help of a straw 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.100
 a straw taking a little paint 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.080
 I have been placing or sealing small 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.300
 circuits 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.340
 this is the final result I hope you 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.930
 I liked it, I thank you very much 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.939
 have followed through these videos and 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.060
 through this time in our video 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:59.560
 course I hope you liked it I hope 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.450
 that you have left some learning 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.450
 For my part, he has been in this video 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.930
 course is very well until 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.930
 next
