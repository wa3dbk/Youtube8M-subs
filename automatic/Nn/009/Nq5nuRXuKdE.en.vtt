00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.390
 sister elza all the characters of the 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.970
 animation were produced with the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.080
 more advanced computing tools 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.300
 print shop 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.520
 see the work of the animator to give 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.490
 motion to the snowman 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.320
 the dubbing is also laborious olave ​​for 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.660
 example is just fun 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.710
 thanks to the lines interpreted with the actor 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.710
 josh war 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.030
 olaf connects the two sisters to the past and 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.950
 their childhood and the work remained until 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.740
 For me I was invited to make a 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.050
 dialogue and show how the 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.789
 dubbing an animation the voice actor 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.160
 You need to interpret the lines in 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.790
 synchronization with the mouth movements of the 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.560
 character higher one used to walk 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.170
 lay org 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.940
 I ask the director Chris Banca 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.489
 because he believes that frozen is 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.920
 considered a phenomenon to thank the 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.610
 this part of success is due to the 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.950
 music 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.110
 the songs are exciting and fun 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.570
 the characters are also very good 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.900
 The songs in the film are a 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.440
 part of the entire soundtrack performed by 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.440
 this orchestra 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.239
 and the joyful goal music was 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.250
 Oscar for Best Original Song and Actress 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.099
 will ask honey who plays the princess 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.769
 elza will sing the theme at the 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.840
 oscar is 71 I think the song 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.160
 represents a moment of transformation 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.160
 of the character 8 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.110
 with favoritism in the categories of 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.450
 best animation and original song 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.599
 the screenwriter of the film does not hide the 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.599
 joy 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.450
 the neo alarm draws many people 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.670
 do not know but the studio disney never 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.130
 won an animation Oscar because the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.959
 relatively new category with 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.040
 10 years ago we were cheering 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.200
 very 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.450
 but the dispute is not so easy either 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.680
 competes for the best animation 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.680
 cross films 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.700
 my evil favorite 2 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:50.200
 It is this celestino n ne and lives in the wind 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.830
 remains to know if frozen an adventure 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.450
 freezing will assert your 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:05.489
 favoritism at night only in the 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.379
 report tomorrow you will understand 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.659
 because dubbing is a technique 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.720
 essential in cinema 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.019
 even outside the animations in spain says 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.019
 yellow
