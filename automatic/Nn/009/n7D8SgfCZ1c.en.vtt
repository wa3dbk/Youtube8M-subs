00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.810
 luci silva and then what would it be like if the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.120
 sailors were the pirates and 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.460
 pirates were the sailors on which side 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.130
 would be stronger there occurs maybe 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.100
 Imagine flies away Imagine falling on the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.199
 garp boom you want it with a pirate I 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.600
 I think the pirates would be stronger than me. 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.340
 I think the navy is stronger in the babies 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.070
 wanted so the navy just is not stronger 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.029
 because there is a code of honor 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.710
 technically among the sailors because 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.869
 They did not want me to be a pirate and leave. 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.850
 killing general kind kills everyone is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.649
 fuck if the guy time the speed of light 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.480
 will kill in the blink of an eye and will not 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.100
 no one and now as a mother he can not 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.200
 make their intention to protect civilians 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.300
 the aquino also imagines with the pirate 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.789
 does the man everyone leaves the scene 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.829
 focus in general anne if the way 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.780
 mania since it was general silva before 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.700
 also as a pirate would be very 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.289
 more serious, I'll keep thinking about it 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.629
 For a long time I believe that the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.239
 would be more powerful 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.859
 the navy does not occur one is the navy but 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.579
 does not kill the woman's will in the brain 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.230
 damn 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.690
 now I got confused a pirate line 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.339
 so I believe that in this matter in 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.790
 green of its sailors 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.860
 pirates the pirates were sailors the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.450
 pirates're still giving r pirates 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.159
 would be stronger than pirates 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.720
 would those who are the current marine 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.430
 the current sailors if I am not pirate 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.170
 since I think that the sailors 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.119
 control and have not seen or thought 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.890
 closer control stronger but 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.390
 Finally, pirates can also 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.220
 equip the line a force but still 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.049
 so other pirate sailors as 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.880
 strongest even inspired quoted a 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.189
 carbon black dot in the next brain 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.710
 the holy cheer asks the worst 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.509
 series defect with environments being well 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.610
 sincere for you I could say that the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.420
 worst fault is not having every day but I 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.880
 I see several and several and several and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.619
 several things that I consider to be 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.540
 defective world at once 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.000
 one for example not being all of one more 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.490
 example and I do not know when I had another 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.470
 An interesting example is not to be every day 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.570
 Just a joke, something I do not like. 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.090
 that does not roll death in the relationship 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.180
 the episode that happened this week that 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.010
 Wacky was killed subordinate 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.900
 Bartolomeu does not show him killing the guy 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.520
 does not show cutting the head does not show 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.740
 these things, whether you like it or not 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.810
 human being is like the people of injury he 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.700
 likes to see blood I think one 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.990
 not be so bloodthirsty in this 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.360
 question but I think it charges by itself 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.040
 dealing with pirates and navies in view of 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.570
 little more bloodthirsty knows the maximum 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.760
 which appeared now because it and became 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.920
 a madman in the chest and no blood spurting 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.810
 It was okay that she died dying for the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.730
 Flemish and then yes Joan I think the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.730
 risk of being a little more bloodthirsty 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.380
 in battles a more aggressive thing 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.660
 this one defect that I see thus 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.420
 in that question is a kitchen 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.700
 a lot for little children despite the story 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.770
 being too fucking like that makes a 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.959
 I do not know if this 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.400
 intention of the other when doing this but I 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.530
 I think it could be a bit more 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.300
 aggressive in these parts rafael meira 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.340
 what are your expectations for the 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.590
 manga characters that appear in the 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.540
 anime type of donor chosen etc. 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.489
 it was like button and such between the 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.739
 characters to be introduced January to 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.860
 my expectation is always regarding 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.510
 voice and color as you sell wrote the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.810
 bartolomeu as soon as it came out in colors 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.640
 his officers I got kind of cool 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.680
 beauty does not have a yellow hair that already 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.360
 I remembered he does not have a hair 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.980
 white that would bring me any other 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.019
 old white hair then hair 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.489
 green cool beauty but is a person from 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.260
 green hair as I remember so far 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.790
 Green Hair interest may have can 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.190
 have more people hair even can have 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.720
 modified a kiss but I'm friends with 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.730
 others I already start to remember someone 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.500
 now for example that breaks Rebecca 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.299
 appears with pink hair you speak 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.130
 Fuck you already have the ball and the hair. 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.860
 coast to china a roche with pink hair 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.510
 I have a cardigan with pink hair I 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.799
 I think when I went to work there a little 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.079
 You know you could have put some 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.060
 A different thing is always me 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.160
 I hope I think it 's the color though. 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.980
 influence more but the voice I'm enjoying 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.180
 enough of the roses since even you who 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.769
 Did this question be interesting? 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.450
 Until this I tell you how you 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.690
 I like naruto too, I 'm 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.850
 noticing a bunch of naruto voice actors 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.680
 come to keep seeming type 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.690
 Oscar said the job is ending here. 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.630
 and let's go once there it will last 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.670
 because it is the soldier has voice of iran 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.160
 naruto the bartolomeu has the voice of xi 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.710
 camaro naruto own the same Saturday 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.090
 has the voice in the fight this part of voice is 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.950
 surprising me because when 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.930
 said the cavendish will have the voice 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.280
 of the gharafa and nut leaves we will have 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.870
 more place will be the same 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.060
 source will it be the time I saw 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.580
 you do not speak that twig then the voice 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.010
 the character is the only one I 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.510
 I did not like beginning x is when the voice 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.370
 he started that final little voice was 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.200
 because I expected a stronger voice is the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.850
 face looked like a fuck character more 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.610
 Fuck, there's no point in a new one. 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.710
 phase sucks if the voice now 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.420
 when the character then is that a 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.950
 my concern is more the voice because the 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.200
 voice she may not let the character 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.750
 more fuck was the case of the rocket and I 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.150
 I thought the victory was already out so that 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.250
 his voice appeared I said ok 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.040
 It seemed a lot more fucking. 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.720
 now is get a gray type character is 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.300
 a character who had everything to be 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:05.850
 fuck does not like it afterwards but the voice 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:07.590
 He left me like this at first. 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.180
 worry is always with the voice then 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.040
 I am enjoying quite button and I liked the 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.720
 voice though little yellow rose if 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.550
 Did not you say you're grandma to call? 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.470
 cavendish does not mention that there is more 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.110
 Well, then I 'm really enjoying it and 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.480
 have good expectations now I realize that 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.540
 they managed to find the range 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.400
 so pulls such a character in combination with 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.050
 such a voice and that's not very interesting 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.020
 that's the kind of thing you can 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.910
 character appearing a thick voice 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.910
 imagine for example an enem with the voice 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:41.340
 with him that something happens 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.780
 unfortunately so far has not happened and 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.540
 I hope it does not continue 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.670
 Pablo well, but you ate branded a cloud. 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.850
 not fully developed 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:54.840
 so you are half beast ufpr br 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.490
 the iran denies if fuck boy jefinho silva 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.770
 Do you think you could cut the 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.740
 bartolomeu's barrier crazy hand me 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.020
 cut off the verb with armament rack in the 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.750
 the whole body the verb with aquino 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:10.200
 armament in the whole body of the band funk 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.090
 armament of rap where the ball and wacky 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.500
 cut the belly of the lipstick blush should be 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.770
 Nothing for me cut the island too. 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.530
 put ideals to the knockout 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.860
 the wing pilot is the al depends then here 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.750
 Yes, I think he can cut it. 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.270
 bartolomeu's barrier looks like he knows 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.699
 now I'm going to have my bar 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.009
 lipstick, that's it, it 's at least the fourth 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:34.139
 but it's also obvious and that's it 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:36.750
