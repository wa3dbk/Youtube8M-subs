00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
knowing that Mudkip doesn't actually get

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.820 
knowing that Mudkip doesn't actually get
its<00:03:38.340> ground<00:03:38.580> typing<00:03:39.000> yet<00:03:39.180> does<00:03:39.930> plenty<00:03:40.530> of

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
its ground typing yet does plenty of

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.210 
its ground typing yet does plenty of
damage<00:03:41.299> he<00:03:42.299> goes<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.660> skull<00:03:43.040> cleans<00:03:44.040> me

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
damage he goes for the skull cleans me

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.300 
damage he goes for the skull cleans me
right<00:03:44.820> out<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.329> thought<00:03:46.019> maybe<00:03:46.410> maybe<00:03:46.799> maybe<00:03:47.130> I

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
right out I thought maybe maybe maybe I

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.319 
right out I thought maybe maybe maybe I
might<00:03:47.519> live<00:03:47.670> it<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.000> then<00:03:48.440> unfortunately<00:03:49.440> not

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
might live it and then unfortunately not

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.300 
might live it and then unfortunately not
so<00:03:51.329> I<00:03:51.360> lose<00:03:51.600> Chimchar<00:03:51.900> for<00:03:52.350> about

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
so I lose Chimchar for about

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.770 
so I lose Chimchar for about
three-quarters<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.150> Mudkip<00:03:54.450> after

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
three-quarters of a Mudkip after

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.569 
three-quarters of a Mudkip after
leftovers<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.620> not<00:03:55.860> probably<00:03:56.130> not<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.310> problem

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
leftovers so not probably not a problem

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.080 
leftovers so not probably not a problem
I<00:03:57.150> send<00:03:57.810> out<00:03:57.930> my<00:03:58.850> Turtwig

even<00:04:28.630> though<00:04:28.810> I'm<00:04:28.930> really<00:04:29.860> halfed<00:04:30.690> by<00:04:31.690> the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
even though I'm really halfed by the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.890 
even though I'm really halfed by the
burn<00:04:32.020> which<00:04:33.010> is<00:04:33.130> unfortunate<00:04:33.700> but<00:04:33.910> what<00:04:34.780> can

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
burn which is unfortunate but what can

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.190 
burn which is unfortunate but what can
you<00:04:34.990> do

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.200 

so<00:04:38.200> now<00:04:38.380> he<00:04:38.440> is<00:04:38.740> going<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.430> switch<00:04:39.730> into<00:04:40.030> his

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
so now he is going to switch into his

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.730 
so now he is going to switch into his
dratini<00:04:40.540> knowing<00:04:41.080> he<00:04:41.230> can<00:04:41.380> pretty<00:04:41.620> much

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
dratini knowing he can pretty much

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.070 
dratini knowing he can pretty much
resist<00:04:42.160> whatever<00:04:42.430> I<00:04:42.490> want<00:04:42.700> to<00:04:42.760> go<00:04:42.880> for<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.870> I'm

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
resist whatever I want to go for and I'm

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.320 
resist whatever I want to go for and I'm
burnt<00:04:44.410> so<00:04:44.740> he<00:04:45.010> can<00:04:45.190> just<00:04:45.640> pretty<00:04:45.820> much<00:04:46.000> set<00:04:46.240> up

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
burnt so he can just pretty much set up

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.840 
burnt so he can just pretty much set up
in<00:04:46.420> my<00:04:46.510> face<00:04:46.720> here<00:04:47.020> I<00:04:47.590> decide<00:04:48.340> that<00:04:48.370> it'd<00:04:48.700> be<00:04:48.820> a

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
in my face here I decide that it'd be a

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.340 
in my face here I decide that it'd be a
good<00:04:48.910> idea<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.450> stay<00:04:49.690> in<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.050> hit<00:04:50.140> him<00:04:50.230> with

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
good idea to stay in and hit him with

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.400 
good idea to stay in and hit him with
the<00:04:50.470> super<00:04:50.800> power<00:04:51.040> because<00:04:51.850> for<00:04:52.570> some<00:04:52.810> reason

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
the super power because for some reason

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.460 
the super power because for some reason
oh<00:04:53.440> no<00:04:53.770> seed<00:04:54.010> bomb<00:04:54.190> sorry<00:04:54.520> seed<00:04:55.000> bomb<00:04:55.470> that

oh no seed bomb sorry seed bomb that

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.440 
oh no seed bomb sorry seed bomb that
