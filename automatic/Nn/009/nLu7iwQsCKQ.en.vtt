00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.230
 task number you read the conditions which of 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.719
 data numbers is rational 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:14.759
 the solution is an irrational number called 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:20.670
 number that cannot be represented as 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:25.580
 m divided by n irreducible fraction in 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.580
 which mn whole numbers 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.939
 irrational number can be represented 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.250
 only as a decimal periodic 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.559
 fraction 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.690
 in our case, we will try some 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.920
 way to transform each of our 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.489
 numbers and in appearance to find out how 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.450
 she his 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.450
 let's start with the first 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:55.950
 the first number we have is the root of 1.6 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.540
 1.6 can be represented as 16 dozen 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.190
 in order to extract the root of the fraction 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:07.210
 need to extract the root from the numerator and 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.450
 the root and the denominator of the guy from the numerator 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.869
 we have four and the denominator we have 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.020
 root is not retrieved 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:21.100
 our number has the form of a fraction only 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.940
 denominator it is not an integer therefore 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:30.640
 data number is irrational 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:34.270
 set + 2 number root of 169 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.670
 as we know it is equal to 13 this is ours 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.909
 rational number 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:45.670
 third number root of 3 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:50.470
 sixth degree root of 3 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.690
 can be represented as three degrees 1 2 and 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.479
 all this is the sixth degree in the construction 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.950
 degree to degree indicators 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:03.020
 multiply so we get 3 in 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.250
 degree 1 2 multiply by 6 or 33 which 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.979
 equal to 27 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.979
 this number is also rational 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:22.790
 last fourth 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:30.080
 root of 6.1 1 4 kind of irregular 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:31.910
 fractions obtained root of 25 4 to 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.420
 extract the root of the fraction need to extract 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.890
 root from the numerator and extract the root and 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.290
 the denominator of the numerator will get the top five 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.489
 denominator get here as you see we 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.739
 presented this number as a fraction where 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.870
 numerator and denominator for integers 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.630
 accordingly it is also rational 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.190
 number 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.500
 tasks we needed to figure out which 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:03.880
 numbers is irrational it is with us 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:07.299
 only one is the number 1 answer one 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.299
 thanks, goodbye
