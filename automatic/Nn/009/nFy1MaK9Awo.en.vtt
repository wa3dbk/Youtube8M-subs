00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.000 

we're<00:04:50.200> guess<00:04:50.320> we're<00:04:50.440> going<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:50.620> do<00:04:50.800> a<00:04:50.830> whole

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
we're guess we're going to do a whole

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.400 
we're guess we're going to do a whole
lap<00:04:51.220> in<00:04:51.520> this<00:04:51.730> view<00:04:52.030> then<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.810> looking<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.290> the

side

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.840 

it's<00:04:58.110> only<00:04:58.380> one<00:04:58.590> way<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.830> ruin<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.580> race<00:04:59.820> for
