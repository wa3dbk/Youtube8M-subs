 today we are going to cook a delicious recipe 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.259
 for many reasons because we talk about 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.809
 roasted chicken for me one a 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.309
 wonderful ingredient because because what 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:29.050
 you can cook and in the case of cooking 

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:31.210
 a whole chicken you can use it not for 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.130
 a meal but for two and even for 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.719
 three for lunch for dinner and 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.670
 for breakfast the next day 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.860
 so I'm going to show you how we're going to 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.080
 implement this us so that for 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.640
 have two or three meals in a very 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.170
 simple let's start first that 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.440
 everything with what is going to be a chick 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.329
 whole we are going to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.460
 in a certain way glacier with a 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.559
 I touch olive oil so that 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.449
 that helps us with the process of 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.649
 golden brown once when 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.870
 place in the oven is going to brown 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.610
 perfect way then we're going to add you 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.629
 a touch of fresh black pepper 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.629
 freshly ground 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.590
 I will not add salt at this point 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.900
 because because I want it to be gilded of that 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.460
 way and then to use it depending 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.619
 of the recipe that you are going to use if you go to 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.090
 make a sandwich with chicken the 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.320
 actions when taking it 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.039
 directly then what are we going to do 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.580
 now we are going to take it to a little tray 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:31.110
 we take it so we put the tray and 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.110
 I hear a little bird comes with him 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.550
 so what are we going to do now I'm going to 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.170
 take a little rosemary some 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.330
 aromatic herbs and we will place them 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.310
 in the chicken cavity I have here a 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.929
 little bit of thyme that the 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.880
 herbs when we put them in the 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.530
 good cavity what they do is give us a 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.299
 tremendous amount of perfume now a 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.789
 very important trick I have here a 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.920
 head of garlic and what we are going to do is 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.170
 cut it to the entire half as well as the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.100
 come and then with this with this part 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.690
 let's start playing the surface 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.960
 of the chicken so that to give us that 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.119
 aroma that spectacular essence 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.920
 Gesture true then once already 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.950
 we have that ready I'm going to take it to 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.319
 oven very important truth come 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.620
 with me how long and how much 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.420
 temperature or how much temperature 375 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.810
 degrees for about an hour and 20 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.959
 minutes we get this this wonderful 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.430
 bird that you look how good it looks 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.080
 golden on the outside juices and 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.600
 is inside we're going to make a 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.280
 vinaigrette a vinaigrette that in this case 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.900
 it's a chomsky yonki vinaigrette because 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.790
 has bits of ingredients that 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.000
 let's add I'm going to add a bit of 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.920
 olive oil a little bit of vinegar in 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.300
 this case I'm using red wine that 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.120
 I like it a lot, we're going to start 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.200
 mix to incorporate it and in this 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.769
 point let's add parsley a little bit 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.150
 of thyme and a little touch of onion 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.300
 well chopped then look at you 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.489
 in the vinaigrette that I have at this point 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.950
 a vinaigrette a little different and with 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.590
 an impressive amount of flavor 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.350
 Now let's take the chick here and 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.020
 you notice 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.550
 what we are going to do , we are going to cut 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.350
 so all those juices run well 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.390
 well fine juice quoted look at you from that 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.270

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.640
 on a plate I will show you the part 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.250
 most important of the chick we take it 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.900

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.920
 then we cut here we finish the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.020
 list and to finish you look at the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.060

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.920
 of greater need and there you have two
