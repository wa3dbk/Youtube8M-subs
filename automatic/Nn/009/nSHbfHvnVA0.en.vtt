00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.820
 blog today and that I am on the way 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.860
 not quite to Cologne yet 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.509
 and we make first of all have my 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.490
 small cafe with no coffee I go 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.060
 not from the household about nothing else 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.289
 good at come out and I thought so 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.420
 but make the top fast 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.019
 food from the supermarket the man 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.390
 get ready to lead in between 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.460
 can eat right there what are there 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.559
 I have received my pot now 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.020
 all brought here for you and me 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.010
 briefly explain the selection first 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.559
 here we have the buttermilk that is 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.079
 a wholesome food though 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.899
 it is in liquid form is buttermilk 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.719
 just wonderfully tolerable for many 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.329
 People are also very good at saturating them 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.460
 if you still combine it and it is 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.020
 very cheap that means all food 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.699
 which I have selected here too 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.289
 pretty cheap because I mean 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.379
 Of course you could now too 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.799
 just as biologically appropriate 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.659
 fair and handmade sushi 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.000
 always have a lunch break 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.340
 or to snack with us in the fight around 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.610
 For example, in Giant department store there 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.890
 in the department store itself so an extra so 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.960
 shooting gallery where the fresh sushi 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.820
 prepare then check it off and you do it 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.280
 but can take as a cost 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.170
 small bag seven euros or sun 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.159
 So let's be realistic 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.159
 level and capitalist and that's why 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.430
 here a buttermilk for 40 cents or so 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.710
 that has a few carbohydrates that's up 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.000
 a protein little fat so perfect for 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:50.220
 in between so then protein source here 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.210
 as a kind of salmon which is also available at 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.640
 lidl the chambers directly as they are 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.280
 These are smoked salmon 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.450
 in the end, it is so remy it is 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.090
 maybe not another kind 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.649
 I know, but there is aldi everywhere 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.680
 at lidl at each store meanwhile 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.080
 a kind of smoked ax smoked 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.170
 you can pack the one here 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.360
 Just buy the pack directly and then 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.050
 you can always be well dosed small 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.210
 simply eat it easily 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.880
 perfect source of protein in between without 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.060
 that she has to prepare her perfectly yes 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.320
 I also need to come next from 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.420
 protein for a small vitamin bomb here 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.420
 tomatoes turn are very good for the heart 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:45.360
 especially frequency such a small shell 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.920
 has a lot of tomato direction almost 500 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.530
 come and I always buy when 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.670
 I'm on the way cherry tomatoes 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.380
 cherry tomatoes just because you 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.650
 the incredibly handy easy fast 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.440
 can eat what it was already 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.290
 you usually have holes in it 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.730
 who do not see you have no holes 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.670
 in there you can but with 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.620
 a fork for example in the office or 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.010
 somewhere with knives and holes in it 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.540
 make two three four holes and then 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.780
 you just keep it and that 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.700
 sink and powerful and can 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.260
 shake as she goes through and then flows 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.269
 the dirty water out there and you 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.600
 have to say your whole little bowl 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.370
 washed 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.560
 then it drips off and then you have the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.530
 all day or the next two 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.110
 days, so to speak, with you your perfect bowl 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.480
 small tomatoes in between 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.019
 Food number three top snacks out 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.580
 the supermarket food number four 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.030
 are here 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:52.650
 such small again very tasty 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.510
 Just goat cheese he too 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.310
 really good spring wells because I 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.799
 vettel are still missing a bit and 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.560
 that's why they come here and now 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.390
 yes, just goat cheese in between 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.489
 It's very filling when you take it with you 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.500
 For example, the tomatoes can be combined 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.750
 you eat two three little slices 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.750
 then again the packaging keeps itself 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.330
 also a whole 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.770
 all without refrigerator it good 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.780
 at this goat cheese because he was right 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.239
 is dry and not now anyway 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.769
 mozzarella or so and choosing the 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.520
 many tastes as mozzarella me 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.150
 hate mozzarella so number five mixed 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.140
 Nazi should not be missed 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.150
 also healthy spring sources for 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.620
 in between you can also see 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.420
 ideally combine with the need 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.670
 for example and they are 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.950
 reclosable the whole thing very much 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.710
 Practical for traveling makes you look 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.590

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.780
 that is also the end of this strip 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.000
 So five foods on the go 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:54.880
