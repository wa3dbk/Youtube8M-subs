good for your colon so anyway so I have
that<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.390> then<00:02:48.890> some<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.160> know<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.580> am<00:02:51.090> a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
that and then some of you know I am a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.940 
that and then some of you know I am a
true<00:02:51.630> believer<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:52.110> making<00:02:52.290> sure<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.680> you've

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
true believer in making sure that you've

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.430 
true believer in making sure that you've
got<00:02:52.980> saturated<00:02:53.640> fats<00:02:53.940> added<00:02:54.360> in<00:02:55.110> with<00:02:55.260> your

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
got saturated fats added in with your

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.220 
got saturated fats added in with your
protein<00:02:55.830> doing<00:02:56.160> protein<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.019> is<00:02:58.140> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
protein doing protein and this is the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.860 
protein doing protein and this is the
practice<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:59.120> but<00:03:00.120> I've<00:03:00.239> even<00:03:00.480> read<00:03:00.690> that

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.250 

Vince<00:03:04.130> Gironda<00:03:05.130> used<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.790> do<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.959> lot<00:03:07.200> of

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
Vince Gironda used to do and a lot of

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.600 
Vince Gironda used to do and a lot of
people<00:03:07.440> thought<00:03:07.530> he<00:03:07.590> was<00:03:07.739> psycho<00:03:08.160> but<00:03:08.340> then<00:03:08.519> it

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
people thought he was psycho but then it

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.940 
people thought he was psycho but then it
turns<00:03:08.820> out<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.060> science<00:03:09.420> says<00:03:09.570> that

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
turns out the science says that

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.400 
turns out the science says that
saturated<00:03:10.950> fat<00:03:11.070> with<00:03:11.370> your<00:03:11.489> protein<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.690> order

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
saturated fat with your protein in order

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.710 
saturated fat with your protein in order
to<00:03:13.590> really

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
to really

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.770 
to really
simile<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:15.500> utilize<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:17.000> protein<00:03:17.450> that's<00:03:17.570> in

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
simile and utilize the protein that's in

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.770 
simile and utilize the protein that's in
it<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.800> that's<00:03:19.280> that's<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.390> little<00:03:20.450> bit<00:03:20.720> of

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
it so that's that's it a little bit of

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.150 
it so that's that's it a little bit of
water<00:03:20.960> shake<00:03:22.900> now<00:03:23.900> I'm<00:03:24.170> assuming<00:03:24.320> that<00:03:24.860> all<00:03:25.130> of

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
water shake now I'm assuming that all of

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.830 
water shake now I'm assuming that all of
you<00:03:25.430> guys<00:03:25.580> with<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.880> recipe<00:03:26.300> books<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.690> stuff

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
you guys with the recipe books and stuff

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.050 
you guys with the recipe books and stuff
out<00:03:26.990> there<00:03:27.140> got<00:03:27.410> much<00:03:27.860> better<00:03:29.080> protein<00:03:30.080> shake

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
out there got much better protein shake

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.480 
out there got much better protein shake
recipes<00:03:32.060> than<00:03:32.270> I<00:03:32.390> do<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:32.840> what<00:03:33.830> I'm<00:03:33.980> going<00:03:34.460> to

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
recipes than I do so what I'm going to

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.090 
recipes than I do so what I'm going to
ask<00:03:34.640> you<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.880> do<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.150> if<00:03:35.300> you<00:03:35.420> could<00:03:35.860> again<00:03:36.860> just

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
ask you to do is if you could again just

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.200 
ask you to do is if you could again just
another<00:03:37.460> thing<00:03:37.610> that<00:03:37.670> Mike<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.090> are

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
another thing that Mike and I are

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.940 
another thing that Mike and I are
thinking<00:03:38.450> about<00:03:38.510> doing<00:03:38.840> if<00:03:39.350> you<00:03:39.590> could<00:03:39.740> put

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
thinking about doing if you could put

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.580 
thinking about doing if you could put
your<00:03:40.100> favorite<00:03:40.400> protein<00:03:41.330> shake<00:03:41.750> recipe<00:03:42.380> and

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
your favorite protein shake recipe and

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.730 
your favorite protein shake recipe and
the<00:03:43.130> comment<00:03:43.610> box<00:03:44.090> down<00:03:44.300> below<00:03:44.450> what<00:03:45.410> we'll<00:03:45.590> do

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
the comment box down below what we'll do

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.770 
the comment box down below what we'll do
is<00:03:45.890> we're<00:03:46.040> going<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.190> compile<00:03:46.640> them<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.240> make

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
is we're going to compile them and make

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.760 
is we're going to compile them and make
like<00:03:48.050> like<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.070> best<00:03:49.250> protein<00:03:49.550> shakes<00:03:50.770> from

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
like like the best protein shakes from

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.100 
like like the best protein shakes from
lean<00:03:52.010> Hydra<00:03:52.340> muscle<00:03:52.640> fan<00:03:52.880> is<00:03:53.090> available<00:03:53.660> so

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
lean Hydra muscle fan is available so

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.180 
lean Hydra muscle fan is available so
what<00:03:54.350> we'll<00:03:54.470> do<00:03:54.560> is<00:03:54.620> we'll<00:03:54.740> wrap<00:03:54.920> them<00:03:55.100> all

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
what we'll do is we'll wrap them all

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.520 
what we'll do is we'll wrap them all
like<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.000> little<00:03:56.330> report<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:57.110> they<00:03:57.200> give<00:03:57.410> it

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
like a little report and they give it

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.770 
like a little report and they give it
out<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.830> everybody<00:03:58.070> just<00:03:58.520> as<00:03:58.640> a<00:03:58.730> bonus<00:03:59.120> for

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
out to everybody just as a bonus for

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.800 
out to everybody just as a bonus for
something<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.980> think<00:04:01.670> it'd<00:04:01.850> be<00:04:01.880> helpful<00:04:02.660> to

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
something and I think it'd be helpful to

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.690 
something and I think it'd be helpful to
you<00:04:02.930> second<00:04:03.650> link<00:04:03.800> so<00:04:03.920> looking<00:04:04.160> forward<00:04:04.310> to

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
you second link so looking forward to

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.650 
you second link so looking forward to
learning<00:04:04.820> more<00:04:05.000> a<00:04:05.120> little<00:04:05.270> bit<00:04:05.300> more<00:04:05.540> about

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
learning more a little bit more about

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.900 
learning more a little bit more about
you<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.110> your<00:04:06.200> protein<00:04:06.620> shakes<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.670> again<00:04:07.880> I

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
you and your protein shakes and again I

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.500 
you and your protein shakes and again I
want<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.180> thank<00:04:08.240> you<00:04:08.630> I'll<00:04:09.200> see<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.380> later
