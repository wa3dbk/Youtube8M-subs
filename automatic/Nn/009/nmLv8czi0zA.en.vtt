alternative products are found on the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.820 
alternative products are found on the
internet<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.630> know<00:00:09.690> searching<00:00:10.050> around<00:00:10.320> and

internet you know searching around and
browsing<00:00:11.730> testing<00:00:12.330> trying<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.219> one<00:00:14.219> thing<00:00:14.429> I

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
browsing testing trying and one thing I

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.710 
browsing testing trying and one thing I
found<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.120> know<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.780> had<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.609> switch

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
found you know I had this switch

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.429 
found you know I had this switch
I<00:00:18.750> think<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:19.740> an<00:00:19.890> EMS<00:00:20.600> heavy<00:00:21.600> duty<00:00:21.990> switch

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
I think it's an EMS heavy duty switch

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.750 
I think it's an EMS heavy duty switch
with<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> charge<00:00:23.789> port<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:25.460> basically<00:00:26.460> for

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
with a charge port so it's basically for

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.700 
with a charge port so it's basically for
a<00:00:26.789> nickel<00:00:27.060> metal<00:00:27.150> hydride<00:00:27.300> batteries<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.500> is

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
a nickel metal hydride batteries this is

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.040 
a nickel metal hydride batteries this is
something<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.310> connect<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.840> from<00:00:30.840> one

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
something that you connect to from one

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.799 
something that you connect to from one
side<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.769> plug<00:00:31.980> into<00:00:32.160> your<00:00:32.460> receiver<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.600> on

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
side you plug into your receiver and on

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.720 
side you plug into your receiver and on
the<00:00:33.960> other<00:00:34.079> side<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:35.070> plug<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.460> into<00:00:35.610> your

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the other side you plug it into your

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.229 
the other side you plug it into your
batteries<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.809> connected<00:00:37.200> over<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
batteries so you connected over here and

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.250 
batteries so you connected over here and
your<00:00:39.239> battery<00:00:39.920> and<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.879> allows<00:00:42.360> you'd<00:00:42.690> know

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
your battery and this allows you'd know

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.240 
your battery and this allows you'd know
you<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.250> battery<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> switch<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.710> then

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
you get battery to the switch and then

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.670 
you get battery to the switch and then
from<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> switch<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> receiver<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.410> if

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
from the switch to the receiver so if

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.549 
from the switch to the receiver so if
you<00:00:49.860> turn<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.370> off<00:00:50.719> there's<00:00:51.719> no<00:00:51.809> power<00:00:52.140> going

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you turn it off there's no power going

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.060 
you turn it off there's no power going
from<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.520> battery<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.539> receiver<00:00:55.020> or<00:00:55.800> from

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
from the battery to the receiver or from

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.260 
from the battery to the receiver or from
the<00:00:56.160> switch<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> receiver

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the switch to the receiver

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.750 
the switch to the receiver
but<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.170> allows<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
but then this allows you one is in the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.939 
but then this allows you one is in the
off<00:00:59.879> position<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:01.320> board<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.770> can

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
off position and this board you can

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.470 
off position and this board you can
connect<00:01:02.250> your<00:01:02.309> charging<00:01:02.850> port<00:01:02.879> from<00:01:03.270> your

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
connect your charging port from your

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.820 
connect your charging port from your
charger<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.080> charge<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.500> batteries

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
charger and then charge your batteries

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.030 
charger and then charge your batteries
and<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:06.000> once<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.840> turn<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.290> over

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and then once you turn this over

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.770 
and then once you turn this over
then<00:01:09.380> this<00:01:10.380> disables<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.880> connection<00:01:12.600> from

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
then this disables the connection from

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.660 
then this disables the connection from
the<00:01:12.930> port<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.409> battery<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.920> enables<00:01:14.460> it

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the port to the battery and enables it

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.100 
the port to the battery and enables it
from<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.700> battery<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.360> receiver<00:01:18.689> so

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
from the battery to the receiver so

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.270 
from the battery to the receiver so
that's<00:01:19.290> how<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> get<00:01:19.590> power<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.130> got<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that's how you get power and you got a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.600 
that's how you get power and you got a
little<00:01:20.580> door<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.420> covers<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
little door here that covers the the

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.810 
little door here that covers the the
switch

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
switch

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.039 
switch
so<00:01:24.180> these<00:01:24.830> switch<00:01:25.830> costs<00:01:26.340> about<00:01:26.520> $10<00:01:27.210> 11<00:01:27.689> some

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
so these switch costs about $10 11 some

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.780 
so these switch costs about $10 11 some
places<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.560> found<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:28.950> $15<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:31.280> hey<00:01:32.280> it's

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
switches on the off position then your

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.530 
switches on the off position then your
charging<00:02:48.319> port<00:02:48.349> is<00:02:49.040> enabled<00:02:49.609> in<00:02:49.849> sends<00:02:50.269> power

charging port is enabled in sends power

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.490 
charging port is enabled in sends power
to<00:02:50.900> your<00:02:51.049> battery<00:02:51.409> so<00:02:52.159> you<00:02:52.220> can<00:02:52.459> connect<00:02:53.060> your

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
to your battery so you can connect your

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.349 
to your battery so you can connect your
charging<00:02:54.500> port<00:02:54.709> here<00:02:55.549> your<00:02:55.700> charger<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.239> this

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
charging port here your charger to this

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.659 
charging port here your charger to this
plug<00:02:56.659> and<00:02:57.230> then<00:02:57.349> if<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.620> flip<00:02:58.189> the<00:02:58.219> switch<00:02:58.370> to

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669 
plug and then if you flip the switch to

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.940 
plug and then if you flip the switch to
turn<00:02:58.849> it<00:02:58.909> on<00:02:59.150> then<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.049> play<00:03:00.200> Nissan<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.769> see

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
turn it on then the play Nissan and see

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.610 
turn it on then the play Nissan and see
this<00:03:01.310> shows<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.239> little<00:03:02.450> light<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.379> this

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
this shows you a little light so this

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.129 
this shows you a little light so this
little<00:03:03.919> green<00:03:04.069> LED<00:03:04.639> tells<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:05.959> the

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
little green LED tells you that the

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.470 
little green LED tells you that the
plane<00:03:06.349> is<00:03:06.379> on<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.189> I<00:03:07.219> think<00:03:07.519> is<00:03:08.060> actually

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
plane is on so I think is actually

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.690 
plane is on so I think is actually
better<00:03:08.659> than<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.989> other<00:03:09.290> one<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:10.219> quality

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
better than the other one the quality

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.960 
better than the other one the quality
seems<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.870> same<00:03:12.169> the<00:03:12.680> cables<00:03:13.040> are<00:03:13.220> above<00:03:13.400> sync

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
seems the same the cables are above sync

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.020 
seems the same the cables are above sync
thickness<00:03:14.359> guess<00:03:15.109> they<00:03:15.260> translate<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.310> can

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
thickness guess they translate I can

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.339 
thickness guess they translate I can
trust<00:03:17.209> me<00:03:17.389> the<00:03:17.540> same<00:03:17.720> amount<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:18.019> powers

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
trust me the same amount of powers

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.869 
trust me the same amount of powers
nothing<00:03:18.859> you're<00:03:19.010> gonna<00:03:19.069> put<00:03:19.340> too<00:03:19.489> much<00:03:19.609> power

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
nothing you're gonna put too much power

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.020
