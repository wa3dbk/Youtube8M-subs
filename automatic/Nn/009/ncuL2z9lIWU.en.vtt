00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello everyone today we have all 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.120
 apple novelties the iphone 6 and the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.069
 iphone 6 plus and also support watch 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.840
 As they are all I am for Gonzalez and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.599
 these are the bits of information more 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.460
 important in beat fit bundled mx lords 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.719
 today we are going to talk about pure pop 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.340
 as much as I would like to talk a little 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.320
 of motorola and the new motorcycle equipment 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.670
 x the engine and the twist sixty amount 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.500
 I bet you will give these days with the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.150
 covers the entire internet with its 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.400
 past event that took this past 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.689
 Tuesday September 9 we started the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.369
 event directly with time 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.109
 announcing the new generation of 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.550
 iphones which were two models that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.780
 they are quite similar 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.370
 these new iphones have a body 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.380
 aluminum that is rounded in the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.180
 edges that meets subtly with the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.160
 glass that is also copied in the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.260
 shores so that you feel of a single 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.000
 piece these equipments are bigger to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.920
 iPhone 5 comparison is there that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.739
 have a 4 inch screen and now 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.820
 the iPhone 6 will have a 4.7 screen 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.280
 inches a resolution of 1,334 by 750 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.550
 pixels and the iphone 6 plus will have a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.940
 5.5 largest screen yet 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.100
 inches with 1080p resolution and both 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.630
 screens are hd retina that promises 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.270
 have a better color experience 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.710
 contrast and also better brightness is 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.719
 Iphones tones are also a little more 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.810
 fast with the new processor at 8 of 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:18.930
 64 bits that is 25% faster than the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.340
 7 50% more efficient processor in 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.429
 as to graphics and the good thing is that 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.289
 It will also be 50% more sufficient in 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.270
 issue of energy so possibly 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.369
 do not exhaust us so much the battery too 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.780
 our iphones includes the m 8 that is 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.549
 devotes mainly to everything that is 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.439
 issue of an accelerometer movement 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.840
 gyroscope and also the new barometer 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.460
 that will detect its second relative height 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.649
 by the stuff of iphone 6 the internet 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.179
 mobile will last up to 10 hours and 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.399
 also the iphone 6 plus battery 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.380
 It can last up to 12 hours with internet 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.649
 mobile according to them can also last 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.539
 up to 10 days the iphone 6 on standby and 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.259
 also the iphone 6 plus can wait 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.729
 up to 16 days on standby according to them I doubt 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.409
 much that these numbers are realistic 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.700
 but we'll have to try it to see if 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.860
 it is true the camera of these new 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.179
 iphones changes a little we continue with 8 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.829
 megapixels that I personally 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.500
 a little disappointed considering that already 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.840
 We've been 3 years with 8 megapixels since 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.730
 the iphone 4s what did improve was the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.930
 opening and also the sensor that helps 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.060
 focus a little faster 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.409
 and it removes a bit of noise from the photo 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.060
 the iphone 6 plus has a function 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.129
 added that it has optical stabilization 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.469
 so the lens moves a little to 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.510
 stabilize the image better this does not 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.859
 has the iphone 6 the video now improve 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.890
 in both models since now you can 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:30.450
 record video up to 1080p to 60 frames 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.870
 per second and can also record video 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.000
 in slow motion up to 240 frames per 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.829
 second is double compared to 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.480
 iphone 5 s can also do take 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.609
 stabilized very similar to how 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.829
 do the instagram and you can also 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.209
 be timelapse with these cell phones but 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.069
 the most important function these iphone 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.019
 is that they now support the payment system 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.030
 to popeye so you can be your 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.430
 credit cards on cell phone and you can 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.500
 pay at any store using in epsy 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.129
 and you can confirm your purchase through 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.290
 Of 2 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.669
 Haitian so that everyone is safe when 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.409
 I already had these a long time ago 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.719
 with google wallet and other applications 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.790
 but possibly this will help the 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.980
 system becomes more popular in many 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.379
 stores iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.959
 They are available in three golden colors 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.450
 silver and gray space at a price of 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.360
 199 dollars with contract for the version 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.320
 of 16 gb 299 dollars for 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:26.520
 of 64 GB and $ 399 for the version 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.980
 of 128 GB and the iPhone 6 plus will cost 100 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.860
 dollars more starting from the 299 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.430
 dollars for the 16 gb version 399 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.700
 for the 64 and 499 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.530
 dollars for the 128 gb version we go 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.850
 to talk about it will go on sale this 19 of 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.220
 September in several countries 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.390
 obviously not including mexico so 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.370
 We will have to wait until they are 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.230
 available in our country and to see 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.850
 what price does not sell them now we 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.530
 we went to the great surprise element that 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.630
 It was the first smart watch from Apple 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.340
 which will be called simply apple 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.540
 watch the depor wax has several 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.130
 new features has a screen 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.720
 rectangular retina that is not only 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.610
 it detects touch but also 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.590
 detects the force so you can activate 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.750
 different functions depending on what 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.700
 so much force you apply to the screen this 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.080
 retina screen and a digital crown or 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.580
 the little wheel that has the side of the 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.530
 watches will usually be the 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.630
 tools to navigate in this watch 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.579
 so it can be your mini adding to the 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.810
 elements with this new wheel this 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.459
 device focuses on showing you the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.800
 relevant information in a space 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.840
 small as the weather notifications and 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.730
 exaggerated emails 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.230
 among other brief information someone who 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.970
 also joins the action in the power 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.190
 steering that you can call with only 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.270
 raise your wrist and say hey city to 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.460
 ask for your agenda information 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.470
 directions to get to a place or 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.540
 even send a message to some 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.740
 contact with voice dictation with lapos 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.570
 white you can answer different 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.830
 messages with only your voice or also 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.810
 you can choose different options 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.520
 predetermined messages so you do not 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.229
 have to speak in public in a way 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.940
 uncomfortable including the per uach can 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.470
 answer your phone calls with 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.570
 the microphone and the speaker that come 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.280
 integrated into the watch support so no 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.960
 it will be necessary to take out a cell phone for some 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.880
 Short call can answer messages 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.680
 with phrases that certain cartoons 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.510
 we have discouraged that according to me 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.790
 Teaching was already dead long ago 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.130
 You can also send your pulse 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.139
 and if it seems that the mandate is the 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.070
 new way of linking the 21st century the 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.930
 approach that I do gave to this 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.700
 device is all about health and 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.400
 the exercise including several sensors 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.900
 like the gps pulse sensor and also 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.150
 accelerometer that is coupled with the 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.190
 m 8 processor of your iphone for 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.830
 process in a more accurate way all 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.840
 your walking data exercises ideas 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.820
 by bike and other exercises 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.660
 ios 8 health applications and also 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.820
 the expression of health 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.980
 inside the water they will take enough strength 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.930
 with all this information within this 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.000
 watch but the most novel thing about the uach is 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.920
 which also supports the apei system 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.780
 so you do not need to take out your cards or 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.370
 your phone to pay only close 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.900
 your watch to a bank terminal 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.420
 some store and the charge is made 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.670
 automatically on your card is a 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.430
 low blow against android web is rock 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.440
 will come in two sizes 38 millimeters and 42 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.450
 millimeters height and there are several logos 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.670
 with different materials in the x watch 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.590
 stainless steel in the uach sports of 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.200
 aluminum and you can also choose the 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.630
 support watch edition that will be gold a 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.410
 pink gold support will be available 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.660
 early 2015 at a price of 350 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.220
 dollars that is a pretty high price to 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.260
 comparison of all the logos with angel 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.360
 web but we'll see how people buy it 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.200
 is the next step for vol 1 is 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.900
 positive that an experience 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.100
 completely new that is not something new 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.930
 in general since watches 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.030
 smart had already existed since the 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.520
 samsung with the galaxy and also google 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.110
 with the web android but it's work 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.450
 of a then it is usually to take something that 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.890
 already exists but do it well you what 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.210
 think of the apple news is worth the 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.310
 worth not worth 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.870
 copying are really copying us 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.430
 they buy our devices 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.050
 they gave their opinion here below in the 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.060
 comments but it's good when 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.139
 bits of information in steps orbit tips 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.849
 if you like it uploaded to German and it's 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.620
 Top add it to your favorites and 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.819
 they share the then network leaders
