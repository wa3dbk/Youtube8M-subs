 Sitting just touches, and loses to thoughts The song you hear reminds you that it is permissible to cry You did not ask to know what he says to others And when he is here calms down, you are not good in wars 

00:00:52.417 --> 00:01:10.773
 Wearing a different face, nothing to do with you, to do with you occupying thousands of lands, maybe I'll live with you in the meantime 

00:01:18.336 --> 00:01:51.667
 And for years it has been like this, the consolation in alcohol and another ball to take, and it draws from you. All the lipstick on your lips has been smeared everywhere. Maybe I'll come to you and I'll hug you instead. 

00:01:52.006 --> 00:02:10.066
 Wearing a different face, nothing to do with you, to do with you occupying thousands of lands, maybe I'll live with you there 

00:02:11.142 --> 00:02:44.336
 After all, at the end of the day he does not give you anything you really need and since you're all the same, you sit and cry after the end of the day he does not give you anything you really need and since you're all the same, you sit and cry 

00:02:45.911 --> 00:03:21.142
 Wearing a different face, there is nothing to do with you, to do with you conquering thousands of lands, maybe there I will live with you wearing a different face .. occupying thousands of lands, where I will live with you for now
