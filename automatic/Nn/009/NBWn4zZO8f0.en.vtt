00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:44.520 
old mw2 map but anyway oh it's not
really<00:00:43.390> about<00:00:43.480> the<00:00:43.570> gameplay<00:00:43.809> like<00:00:44.170> I've<00:00:44.320> said

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.020 
really about the gameplay like I've said
before<00:00:44.589> whenever<00:00:45.129> I<00:00:45.280> post<00:00:45.489> an<00:00:45.610> infected

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
before whenever I post an infected

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.360 
before whenever I post an infected
gameplay<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:47.019> topic<00:00:47.379> of<00:00:47.649> that<00:00:47.920> videos

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
than actual gameplay itself so that's

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.509
