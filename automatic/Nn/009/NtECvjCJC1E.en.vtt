00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
next thing I need to do is to check my

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.590 
next thing I need to do is to check my
pressure<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:53.850> feels<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> right

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
pressure it feels like the right

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.450 
pressure it feels like the right
pressure<00:00:54.899> kind<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.500> tight<00:00:55.680> not<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.129> tight<00:00:56.340> as

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
pressure kind of tight not as tight as

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.209 
pressure kind of tight not as tight as
you<00:00:56.579> would<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.879> for<00:00:57.090> printing<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:57.829> nice<00:00:58.829> firm

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
newsprint also so that I won't get any

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.490 
newsprint also so that I won't get any
of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.330> material<00:01:06.900> onto<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.619> felt<00:01:09.290> now<00:01:10.290> I'm

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
have to go outside to do that because

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.289 
have to go outside to do that because
it's<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.970> toxic<00:01:15.509> fumes<00:01:16.320> I'm<00:01:16.850> going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.939> open<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
lacquer onto the back of this print then

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.460 
lacquer onto the back of this print then
I'm<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.880> rush<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.540> put<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> paper

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
I'm going to rush in and put the paper

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.350 
I'm going to rush in and put the paper
on<00:01:25.799> my<00:01:26.070> block<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.909> through<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> press

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
on my block and get it through the press

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.359 
on my block and get it through the press
before<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> lacquer<00:01:28.200> has<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> chance<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> dry

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
before the lacquer has a chance to dry

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.999 
before the lacquer has a chance to dry
it's<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.150> solvents<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.840> make<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.290> toner

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it's the solvents that make the toner

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:46.220 
it's the solvents that make the toner
dissolve<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.240> embed<00:01:33.689> itself<00:01:33.840> into<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> wood

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:02:11.210 

this<00:01:46.830> is<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.130> trickiest<00:01:47.520> stage

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.930 

I<00:02:12.290> may<00:02:13.290> have<00:02:13.440> got<00:02:13.650> too<00:02:13.860> much<00:02:14.010> spray<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.640> this

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
I may have got too much spray on it this

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.290 
I may have got too much spray on it this
time

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.120 

not<00:02:21.300> too<00:02:21.510> bad<00:02:21.750> if<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.350> want<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.620> try<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:22.860> I

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
not too bad if you want to try this I

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.860 
not too bad if you want to try this I
just<00:02:23.190> have<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.670> warn<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.690> might<00:02:24.840> take

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
just have to warn you that it might take

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.230 
just have to warn you that it might take
a<00:02:25.110> number<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.620> tries<00:02:26.010> should<00:02:26.820> point<00:02:27.000> out<00:02:27.180> too

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
a number of tries should point out too

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.200 
a number of tries should point out too
that<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.960> wood<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:28.890> use<00:02:29.220> has<00:02:29.460> been<00:02:29.670> sanded

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
that the wood that I use has been sanded

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.140 
that the wood that I use has been sanded
very<00:02:30.480> smooth<00:02:30.900> with<00:02:31.320> 400<00:02:32.070> grit<00:02:32.100> sandpaper<00:02:32.730> so

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
very smooth with 400 grit sandpaper so

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.910 
very smooth with 400 grit sandpaper so
it's<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.480> as<00:02:33.660> smooth<00:02:34.020> as<00:02:34.230> glass<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.530> the

it's just as smooth as glass and the
smoother<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:36.300> clearer<00:02:36.630> your<00:02:36.870> image

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200

at<00:02:42.780> least<00:02:42.810> as<00:02:43.170> well<00:02:43.200> as<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.770> I'm<00:02:44.490> going<00:02:44.790> to

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
at least as well as this I'm going to

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.580 
at least as well as this I'm going to
show<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.150> what<00:02:45.420> happens<00:02:45.780> when<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.020> transfer

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
show you what happens when you transfer

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.390 
show you what happens when you transfer
a<00:02:46.620> color<00:02:47.040> laser<00:02:47.370> print<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:48.980> here's<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.070> color

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
a color laser print to here's a color

a color laser print to here's a color
laser<00:02:50.640> print<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.360> had<00:02:51.660> done<00:02:51.870> at<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.320> local

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
laser print that I had done at a local

laser print that I had done at a local
color<00:02:54.480> printer<00:02:54.900> laser<00:02:55.200> printer<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:56.459> is<00:02:56.670> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
color printer laser printer this is the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.470 
color printer laser printer this is the
way<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.120> reads<00:02:57.330> right<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.640> this<00:02:59.640> was<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.330> way

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
way it reads right and this was the way

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.840 
way it reads right and this was the way
it<00:03:00.900> read<00:03:01.230> wrong<00:03:01.590> now<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:01.980> colors<00:03:02.400> are<00:03:02.580> dull

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
it read wrong now the colors are dull

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.140 
it read wrong now the colors are dull
because<00:03:03.750> I've<00:03:03.930> already<00:03:04.140> transferred<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.160> and

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
because I've already transferred it and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.570 
because I've already transferred it and
this<00:03:06.240> is<00:03:06.420> how<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.630> finished<00:03:07.459> what<00:03:08.459> the

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
this is how the finished what the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.610 
this is how the finished what the
refinish<00:03:09.000> results<00:03:09.510> are<00:03:09.720> it's<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.380> same

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
refinish results are it's the same

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.850 
refinish results are it's the same
technique<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.340> sprayed<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.209> back<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.570> this

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
technique I sprayed the back of this

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.130 
technique I sprayed the back of this
color<00:03:13.860> laser<00:03:14.130> print<00:03:14.520> with<00:03:15.140> transparent

color laser print with transparent
lacquer<00:03:16.350> thinner<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.790> quickly<00:03:18.209> put<00:03:18.540> it

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
lacquer thinner and I quickly put it

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.650 
lacquer thinner and I quickly put it
into<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:18.989> press<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.650> ran<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.250> through<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.730> hope

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
into a press and ran it through I hope

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.270 
into a press and ran it through I hope
