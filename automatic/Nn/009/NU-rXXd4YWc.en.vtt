to be glycerine glycerine is a love and
hate<00:00:31.920> relationship<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.120> water<00:00:33.329> soluble

hate relationship it's a water soluble
in<00:00:34.170> its<00:00:34.320> plant<00:00:34.649> base<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.460> have

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
in its plant base you do have

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.030 
in its plant base you do have
animal-based<00:00:36.210> glycerin<00:00:36.870> where<00:00:37.350> most<00:00:37.620> plant

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
animal-based glycerin where most plant

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.860 
animal-based glycerin where most plant
the<00:00:38.250> most<00:00:38.430> glycerin<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.690> hair

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the most glycerin that you see in hair

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.630 
the most glycerin that you see in hair
products<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.290> plant<00:00:40.559> base<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.280> humectant

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
products is plant base it's a humectant

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.560 
products is plant base it's a humectant
so<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.620> purpose<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.980> human<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.879> grab

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so the purpose of a human is to grab

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.680 
so the purpose of a human is to grab
moisture<00:00:46.559> from<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.460> environment<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.329> bring

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
moisture from the environment and bring

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.619 
moisture from the environment and bring
it<00:00:48.840> into<00:00:49.050> your<00:00:49.230> hair<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.120> that's<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.390> good

it into your hair and that's a good
thing<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.289> take<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.739> moisture<00:00:53.250> from<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
thing it can take that moisture from the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.340 
thing it can take that moisture from the
atmosphere<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.149> bring<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> into<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.960> hair

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
atmosphere and bring it into your hair

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.900 
atmosphere and bring it into your hair
the<00:00:55.530> second<00:00:56.010> part<00:00:56.190> -<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.610> make<00:00:56.789> it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the second part - what if you make it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.150 
the second part - what if you make it
does<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.539> prevents<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.230> moisture<00:00:58.920> from

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
does is it prevents the moisture from

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.939 
does is it prevents the moisture from
evaporating<00:00:59.910> out<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.750> your<00:01:00.989> hair<00:01:01.230> allowing

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
evaporating out of your hair allowing

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.579 
evaporating out of your hair allowing
your<00:01:02.100> hair<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.760> stay<00:01:03.480> moisturized<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.379> long

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
your hair to stay moisturized for a long

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.620 
your hair to stay moisturized for a long
time<00:01:04.890> well<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.339> all<00:01:05.489> sounds<00:01:05.909> great<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.180> why

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
time well that all sounds great but why

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.600 
time well that all sounds great but why
is<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.990> bad<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.229> my<00:01:07.560> hair<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.400> where

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
is that bad for my hair this is where

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.109 
is that bad for my hair this is where
the<00:01:08.790> temperature<00:01:09.299> sets<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.340> are<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the temperature sets in if you are in a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.770 
the temperature sets in if you are in a
fahrenheit<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.290> 60<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> above<00:01:14.420> you're<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.659> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
fahrenheit of 60 and above you're in a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
fahrenheit of 60 and above you're in a
humid<00:01:16.470> climate<00:01:16.759> environment<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.880> human<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
humid climate environment is human and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.920 
humid climate environment is human and
so<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.680> humectants<00:01:20.670> job<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.750> grab

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
so then the humectants job is to grab

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.200 
so then the humectants job is to grab
all<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.530> moisture<00:01:22.740> from<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.430> humidity<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
all that moisture from the humidity and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.359 
all that moisture from the humidity and
bring<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.750> into<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.200> hair<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.040> to

bring it into your hair it's going to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.880 
bring it into your hair it's going to
saturate<00:01:27.180> your<00:01:27.390> hair<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.110> you're<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.560> okay

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
it's gonna become frizzy and you step

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.600 
it's gonna become frizzy and you step
out<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.810> door<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.619> best<00:01:40.950> twist<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.400> ever

to have moisture during the winter and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.630 
to have moisture during the winter and
you<00:02:44.840> use<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.200> glycerin<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> risk<00:02:46.549> you

you use the glycerin this is a risk you

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.160 
you use the glycerin this is a risk you
have<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.970> take<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.450> environment<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.989> use

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
have to take the environment to use

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.140 
have to take the environment to use
products<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.709> do<00:02:48.920> have<00:02:49.160> glycerin<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.910> if<00:02:50.030> you

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
products that do have glycerin in if you

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.180 
products that do have glycerin in if you
have<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:50.540> between<00:02:50.690> basically<00:02:51.260> 50<00:02:51.709> Fahrenheit

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
have it between basically 50 Fahrenheit

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.850 
have it between basically 50 Fahrenheit
that<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:52.970> great<00:02:53.480> atmosphere<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:54.319> use

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
that is a great atmosphere to use

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.130 
that is a great atmosphere to use
glycerin<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:55.849> it<00:02:56.090> just<00:02:56.329> depends<00:02:56.750> on<00:02:56.840> your<00:02:56.900> hair

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140

sounds<00:03:28.910> great<00:03:29.269> right<00:03:29.540> but<00:03:29.989> here's<00:03:30.350> the

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
sounds great right but here's the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.250 
sounds great right but here's the
downside<00:03:30.799> with<00:03:31.579> coconut<00:03:32.060> oil<00:03:32.299> is<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.989> fact

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
downside with coconut oil is the fact

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.300 
downside with coconut oil is the fact
that<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.769> is<00:03:34.250> a<00:03:34.459> protein<00:03:35.299> based<00:03:35.750> oil<00:03:36.500> meaning

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
that it is a protein based oil meaning

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.520 
that it is a protein based oil meaning
when<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:37.670> penetrates<00:03:38.359> within<00:03:38.959> your<00:03:39.230> hair

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
when it penetrates within your hair

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.479 
when it penetrates within your hair
cuticle<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.760> then<00:03:41.269> binds<00:03:41.720> itself<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:43.250> your

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
cuticle it then binds itself to your

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.940 
cuticle it then binds itself to your
keratin<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.480> protein<00:03:44.810> in<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.470> coconut

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
keratin and that protein in the coconut

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.879 
keratin and that protein in the coconut
oil<00:03:46.100> those<00:03:46.519> amino<00:03:46.850> acids<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:48.170> protein<00:03:48.739> of

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
oil those amino acids and the protein of

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.250 
oil those amino acids and the protein of
your<00:03:49.040> keratin<00:03:49.549> will<00:03:50.150> then<00:03:50.329> bind<00:03:50.660> together<00:03:50.959> and

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
your keratin will then bind together and

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.590 
your keratin will then bind together and
make<00:03:51.620> your<00:03:51.799> hair<00:03:52.040> stronger<00:03:52.639> which<00:03:53.269> is<00:03:53.450> why

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
make your hair stronger which is why

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.990 
make your hair stronger which is why
most<00:03:53.900> low<00:03:54.290> porosity<00:03:54.590> don't<00:03:55.220> like<00:03:55.400> coconut<00:03:55.849> oil

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
most low porosity don't like coconut oil

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.569 
most low porosity don't like coconut oil
is<00:03:56.299> because<00:03:56.720> you<00:03:57.410> can<00:03:57.620> get<00:03:57.739> product<00:03:58.190> build<00:03:58.400> up

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
is because you can get product build up

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.610 
is because you can get product build up
another<00:03:58.970> thing<00:03:59.239> that<00:03:59.389> coconut<00:03:59.690> oil<00:03:59.810> does<00:04:00.260> is

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
another thing that coconut oil does is

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.460 
another thing that coconut oil does is
that<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:01.069> also<00:04:01.370> has<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.940> ability<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.540> reduce

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
that it also has the ability to reduce

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.910 
that it also has the ability to reduce
your<00:04:04.160> hair<00:04:04.370> porosity<00:04:04.730> how<00:04:05.359> again<00:04:06.049> it<00:04:06.319> binds<00:04:06.709> to

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
your hair porosity how again it binds to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.460 
your hair porosity how again it binds to
that<00:04:07.130> keratin<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:08.299> amino<00:04:08.599> acid<00:04:09.079> in<00:04:09.230> that

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
that keratin the amino acid in that

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.620 
that keratin the amino acid in that
coconut<00:04:09.859> oil<00:04:10.069> will<00:04:10.430> then<00:04:10.609> make<00:04:10.819> your<00:04:11.030> keratin

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
coconut oil will then make your keratin

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.170 
coconut oil will then make your keratin
stronger<00:04:12.200> in<00:04:12.349> your<00:04:12.530> hair<00:04:12.799> lower<00:04:13.549> your<00:04:13.940> hair

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
stronger in your hair lower your hair

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.379 
stronger in your hair lower your hair
cuticle<00:04:14.810> making<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.799> stronger<00:04:16.280> if<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:17.180> have

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
cuticle making it stronger if you have

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.420 
cuticle making it stronger if you have
low<00:04:17.599> porosity<00:04:17.900> hair<00:04:18.229> you<00:04:18.739> don't<00:04:18.859> need<00:04:19.220> your

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
low porosity hair you don't need your

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.029 
low porosity hair you don't need your
cuticle<00:04:19.910> lowered<00:04:20.239> anymore<00:04:20.750> that<00:04:21.530> may<00:04:21.829> make

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
cuticle lowered anymore that may make

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.030 
cuticle lowered anymore that may make
your<00:04:22.250> hair<00:04:22.490> dry

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
your hair dry

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.070 
your hair dry
embrittle<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.820> don't<00:04:24.120> need<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.420> use<00:04:24.570> coconut

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
embrittle you don't need to use coconut

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.930 
embrittle you don't need to use coconut
oil<00:04:25.260> if<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.650> doesn't<00:04:25.980> work<00:04:26.100> for<00:04:26.280> your<00:04:26.400> hair<00:04:26.640> you

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
oil if it doesn't work for your hair you

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.000 
oil if it doesn't work for your hair you
can<00:04:26.970> lessen<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.720> effects<00:04:28.050> of<00:04:28.200> coconut<00:04:28.590> oil<00:04:28.710> by

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
can lessen the effects of coconut oil by

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.520 
can lessen the effects of coconut oil by
actually<00:04:29.520> mixing<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:30.270> with<00:04:30.450> like<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.690> olive<00:04:30.990> oil

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
actually mixing it with like a olive oil

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.810 
actually mixing it with like a olive oil
jojoba<00:04:32.160> oil<00:04:32.930> or<00:04:33.930> other<00:04:34.200> oil<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:34.920> it's<00:04:35.130> not<00:04:35.400> that

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
jojoba oil or other oil so it's not that

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.180 
jojoba oil or other oil so it's not that
strong<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.600> penetrating<00:04:37.350> but<00:04:37.740> that's<00:04:37.920> just

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
strong and penetrating but that's just

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.230 
strong and penetrating but that's just
one<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.610> options

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
one of the options

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.910 
one of the options
oh<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.570> one<00:04:39.690> of<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.930> greatest<00:04:40.200> benefits

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
oh and one of the greatest benefits

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.820 
oh and one of the greatest benefits
coconut<00:04:41.700> oil<00:04:41.910> is<00:04:42.240> is<00:04:42.710> prevents<00:04:43.710> the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
coconut oil is is prevents the

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.310 
coconut oil is is prevents the
penetration<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.670> moisture<00:04:45.180> loss<00:04:45.450> from<00:04:46.200> the

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
penetration of moisture loss from the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.930 
penetration of moisture loss from the
air<00:04:46.500> in<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.770> environment<00:04:47.280> basically<00:04:47.790> when

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
air in the environment basically when

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.370 
air in the environment basically when
we're<00:04:48.090> talking<00:04:48.240> about<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.720> glycerin

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
we're talking about that glycerin

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.530 
we're talking about that glycerin
usually<00:04:50.100> if<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.400> do<00:04:50.460> use<00:04:50.760> a<00:04:50.790> product<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.240> does

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
usually if I do use a product that does

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.270 
usually if I do use a product that does
have<00:04:51.720> glycerin<00:04:52.200> this<00:04:52.380> is<00:04:52.530> why<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:52.710> put<00:04:53.010> coconut

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
have glycerin this is why I put coconut

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.880 
have glycerin this is why I put coconut
oil<00:04:53.580> on<00:04:53.880> my<00:04:54.030> hair<00:04:54.180> afterwards<00:04:54.840> because<00:04:55.590> if

oil on my hair afterwards because if

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.240 
oil on my hair afterwards because if

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
about aloe vera it's a plant gel that's

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.130 
about aloe vera it's a plant gel that's

vera<00:05:31.290> is<00:05:31.650> water<00:05:31.980> the<00:05:32.580> benefit<00:05:33.120> of<00:05:33.150> aloe<00:05:33.450> vera

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
vera is water the benefit of aloe vera

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.690 
vera is water the benefit of aloe vera
versus<00:05:34.290> water<00:05:34.530> is<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:34.920> fact<00:05:35.130> that<00:05:35.220> that<00:05:35.430> water

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
versus water is the fact that that water

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.480 
versus water is the fact that that water
is<00:05:35.880> a<00:05:35.910> lot<00:05:36.120> more<00:05:36.330> viscous<00:05:37.020> meaning<00:05:38.010> that<00:05:38.190> it<00:05:38.340> is

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
is a lot more viscous meaning that it is

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.970 
is a lot more viscous meaning that it is
thicker<00:05:38.910> than<00:05:39.060> water<00:05:39.260> the<00:05:40.260> benefit<00:05:40.800> to<00:05:40.950> that

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
thicker than water the benefit to that

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.130 
thicker than water the benefit to that
is<00:05:41.400> is<00:05:41.580> that<00:05:41.730> when<00:05:41.940> it<00:05:42.030> goes<00:05:42.300> into<00:05:42.600> your<00:05:42.810> hair

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
is is that when it goes into your hair

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.040 
is is that when it goes into your hair
shaft<00:05:43.470> it<00:05:43.710> stays<00:05:44.160> longer<00:05:45.060> in<00:05:45.570> your<00:05:45.780> hair

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
shaft it stays longer in your hair

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.350 
shaft it stays longer in your hair
versus<00:05:46.560> when<00:05:46.740> you<00:05:46.770> put<00:05:47.010> water<00:05:47.280> water<00:05:48.060> will

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
versus when you put water water will

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.720 
versus when you put water water will
evaporate<00:05:48.600> a<00:05:49.110> lot<00:05:49.380> quicker<00:05:49.710> than<00:05:49.860> aloe<00:05:50.580> vera

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
evaporate a lot quicker than aloe vera

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.580 
evaporate a lot quicker than aloe vera
because<00:05:50.970> aloe<00:05:51.330> vera<00:05:51.540> is<00:05:51.750> a<00:05:51.780> viscous<00:05:52.320> material

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
because aloe vera is a viscous material
