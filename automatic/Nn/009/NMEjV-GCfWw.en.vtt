00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the original that was a core development

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.609 
the original that was a core development
principle<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.360> us<00:01:18.540> as<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.869> game<00:01:19.080> needed<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
had to make sure that that feeling was

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.850 
had to make sure that that feeling was
identical<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.110> experience<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.760 
everybody remembered ten years ago
because<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.020> really<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.320> gift<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
because this is really a gift to the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.890 
because this is really a gift to the
fans<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.490> way<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.750> relive<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
fans this is a way to relive the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.420 
fans this is a way to relive the
experience<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.439> playing<00:01:34.619> halo<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.159> for<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
experience of playing halo one for the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.830 
experience of playing halo one for the
first<00:01:35.640> time<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.329> wanted<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.720> make

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
first time so we really wanted to make

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.719 
first time so we really wanted to make
sure<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.170> identical<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.400> way<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.610> did

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
sure it was identical and the way we did

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.609 
sure it was identical and the way we did
that<00:01:38.909> was<00:01:38.970> actually<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.780> fun<00:01:39.960> technical<00:01:40.439> trick

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that was actually a fun technical trick

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.050 
that was actually a fun technical trick
we're<00:01:40.799> actually<00:01:40.920> running<00:01:41.250> portions<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.909> two

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
we're actually running portions of two

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.120 
we're actually running portions of two
engines<00:01:42.390> at<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> same<00:01:42.810> time<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
engines at the same time so the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.800 
engines at the same time so the
underlying<00:01:44.520> code<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.939> code<00:01:45.090> controlling<00:01:45.720> how

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
underlying code the code controlling how

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.569 
underlying code the code controlling how
the<00:01:45.869> game<00:01:46.110> feels<00:01:46.380> how<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.619> AI<00:01:46.829> reacts<00:01:47.280> all<00:01:47.460> of

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the game feels how the AI reacts all of

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.370 
the game feels how the AI reacts all of
that<00:01:47.700> stuff<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.570> lot<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> original

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
that stuff is a lot of it's the original

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.319 
that stuff is a lot of it's the original
halo<00:01:49.860> 1<00:01:50.100> code<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.579> was<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.090> best

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
halo 1 code and that was really the best

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.700 
halo 1 code and that was really the best
way<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.750> us<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> ensure<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.560> game

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
way for us to ensure that the game

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.410 
way for us to ensure that the game
played<00:01:52.979> exactly<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.640> same<00:01:53.820> as<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> did<00:01:54.210> 10

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
played exactly the same as it did 10

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.389 
played exactly the same as it did 10
years<00:01:54.450> ago<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.680> top<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.070> we've

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
years ago but on top of that we've

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.429 
years ago but on top of that we've
layered<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.939> new<00:01:57.060> graphics<00:01:57.509> engine<00:01:57.659> that

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
layered a new graphics engine that

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.929 
layered a new graphics engine that
allows<00:01:58.530> us<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.369> make<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> game<00:01:59.909> look

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
allows us to you know make the game look

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.490 
allows us to you know make the game look
fantastic<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.840> look<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> current

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
fantastic and look like a current

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.990 
fantastic and look like a current
generation<00:02:01.950> title<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.880> great

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
generation title so it's really a great

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.330 
generation title so it's really a great
mix<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> two<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.770> at<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> end<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> day

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
mix of the two so at the end of the day

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.679 
mix of the two so at the end of the day
you<00:02:05.399> know<00:02:05.579> your<00:02:05.729> halo<00:02:05.880> fan<00:02:06.090> gets<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.420> game<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.150 
plays exactly like they remember but
looks<00:02:09.269> like<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> current<00:02:09.810> generation<00:02:10.259> title<00:02:10.590> we

looked<00:02:29.070> 10<00:02:29.340> years<00:02:29.550> ago<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:30.150> here<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.080> this

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
looked 10 years ago so here it is this

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.040

because this just lets you go back in

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.950 
because this just lets you go back in
time<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.280> see<00:02:38.820> exactly<00:02:38.970> how<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.570> game<00:02:39.750> look

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
time and see exactly how this game look

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.420 
time and see exactly how this game look
10<00:02:40.140> years<00:02:40.170> ago<00:02:40.440> but<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.740> fun<00:02:40.890> part<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.400> can

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
10 years ago but the fun part is you can

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.670 
10 years ago but the fun part is you can
come<00:02:41.730> back<00:02:41.850> at<00:02:42.030> any<00:02:42.180> time<00:02:42.270> so<00:02:43.140> classic<00:02:43.530> mode
