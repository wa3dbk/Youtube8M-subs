00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello that such friends welcome to in 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.500
 this next chapter of the course of 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.090
 bots my name is Carlos Arturo and well 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.610
 because today in this chapter we are going to see 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.410
 about the most specific articles 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.450
 about the headlines that we can give to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.070
 the articles in this case good I 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.900
 I have what is the representation of a 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.330
 article that good is very small but 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.580
 It could be bigger and I have my owner 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.080
 with a subtext of title this text of 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.090
 we do that we can agra through the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.340
 labels mont and this title good then 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.989
 it's a tick a title like any 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.610
 well, your offers us a class 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.350
 that we can add to give it a 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.390
 look different to what is our 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.040
 holder of our articles 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.409
 or good any headline that we 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.680
 let's have this change is known as 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:51.600
 page header ie a header 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.430
 page and the only thing we are going to do is 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.870
 the next good thing here I have my 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.909
 structure the only thing I have is a 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.129
 container inside I have two trick like 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.739
 you can see I have a gnaw after I have 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.049
 down another one on the first road I have a 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.630
 good column of 12 and inside I have my 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.700
 holder is a h 1 with its label is very 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.380
 for the subtext 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.210
 and then on the next robot I have 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.340
 also another kind of column with 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.590
 our paragraph is the only thing we have 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.380
 Well, what we can do is that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.170
 we can add a class to what it is 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.189
 our day in this case I here I have 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.439
 what is the road 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.390
 then I have the columns and how 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.460
 make this header I'm going to 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.230
 enclose within other dif are already 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.840
 inflated to put the class page header 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.940
 and with page keller we're going to get a 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.740
 change in what is our article 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.810
 well our title then 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.360
 we update and as you can see we have 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.940
 a different space and we add this 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.190
 small line is practically the only thing 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.480
 that makes this kind of page lose but 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.670
 good as you can see gives us an aspect 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.310
 pretty cool in our articles 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.200
 we can make very minimalist articles 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.420
 with this a simple background with our 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.250
 title in our article and that's it and 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.440
 this little line makes it look very 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.240
 well then remember the only thing that 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.880
 you need is to put the page keller class 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.000
 in a day and this one has to lock 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.790
 your holder or in this case the owner 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.380
 it can also be content is supposed 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.180
 what should you use for holders 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.760
 because you add a title a little bit 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.400
 greater between what is the line and the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.020
 content above but well what 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.020
 you can use as you want 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.330
 I hope sex and page header 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.370
 so we 'll see later that's been all 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.350
 for this little chapter I know it is 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.390
 very small these chapters are being 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.220
 well because the truth is that there is not much 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.750
 content regarding the booster website 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.240
 things are still missing a little bit more 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.800
 complex but we will reach them and 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.900
 finally before the video is made 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.570
 tell you that in the other videos 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.220
 I've been making an error because 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.560
 we are using looks to be 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.480
 responsible and saint and I have committed a 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.180
 mistake because I forgot to add a 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.000
 very important label if I forget 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.440
 add the newport goal then I ask you 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.930
 an apology for not having added it in 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.090
 others and I will try not to forget 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.700
 the other chapters add it if 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.190
 you have a problem with your design 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.380
 responsive or with this label what 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.360
 you solve remember then it is the only thing 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.980
 that you need to know the good label 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.250
 well you know I add it here in 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.750
 substitutes enlarged goal two points 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.210
 newport I do this using the plugin 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.140
 of emmett and well then simply have 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.270
 that in mind 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.130
