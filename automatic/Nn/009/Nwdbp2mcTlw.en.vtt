00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.490 
but I feel like the item descriptions
don't<00:01:37.729> have<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.970> many<00:01:39.450> clues<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.049> them<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.290> ah

itself so

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.270 
itself so
some<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.680> some<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.010> descriptions

dark<00:02:32.560> souls<00:02:32.620> but<00:02:33.370> i<00:02:33.400> think<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.790> effect<00:02:34.360> that

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
dark souls but i think the effect that

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.870 
dark souls but i think the effect that
you<00:02:34.600> will<00:02:34.780> get<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.200> look<00:02:36.100> fairly<00:02:36.370> fairly

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
you will get a look fairly fairly

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.210

talk anything about that sorry but we
don't<00:03:22.989> have<00:03:23.110> next<00:03:23.410> dark<00:03:24.220> souls<00:03:24.400> for<00:03:24.850> next-gen

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
don't have next dark souls for next-gen

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.370 
don't have next dark souls for next-gen
in<00:03:25.360> mind<00:03:25.540> at<00:03:25.690> all<00:03:25.780> right<00:03:25.989> now<00:03:26.080> there's<00:03:26.260> no

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
in mind at all right now there's no

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.420 
in mind at all right now there's no
plans<00:03:26.620> but<00:03:27.900> when<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.230> programmers<00:03:30.010> created

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
plans but when the programmers created

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.990 
plans but when the programmers created
the<00:03:30.550> new<00:03:30.700> game<00:03:30.940> engine

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
the new game engine

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.120 
the new game engine
you<00:03:32.510> know<00:03:32.600> their<00:03:33.110> programmers<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.860> they<00:03:33.950> want

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
you know their programmers and they want

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.280 
you know their programmers and they want
to<00:03:34.220> create<00:03:34.400> an<00:03:34.550> engine<00:03:34.850> with<00:03:35.630> all<00:03:35.810> sorts<00:03:36.050> of

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
to create an engine with all sorts of

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.320 
to create an engine with all sorts of
different<00:03:36.350> options<00:03:36.950> in<00:03:37.070> mind<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.580> it's<00:03:38.180> not

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
different options in mind and it's not

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.690 
different options in mind and it's not
necessary<00:03:38.780> next-gen<00:03:39.470> consoles<00:03:40.070> but<00:03:40.370> i<00:03:40.430> think

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
necessary next-gen consoles but i think

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.430 
necessary next-gen consoles but i think
you<00:03:40.940> know<00:03:41.180> we<00:03:41.360> want<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:41.660> try<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:41.990> create<00:03:42.290> an

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
you know we want to try and create an

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.770 
you know we want to try and create an
engine<00:03:42.740> for<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.220> new<00:03:43.880> generations<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.750> come

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
engine for the new generations to come

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.930 
engine for the new generations to come
so<00:03:45.260> all<00:03:45.860> of<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.070> technology<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:46.670> they<00:03:46.880> were

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
so all of the technology that they were

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.330 
so all of the technology that they were
really<00:03:47.360> able<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.810> create<00:03:48.170> newly<00:03:48.530> for<00:03:49.130> dark

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
really able to create newly for dark

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
guys tried to implement that in a way

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.400 
guys tried to implement that in a way
that<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.269> didn't<00:04:17.480> upset<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.870> original<00:04:18.260> or

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
that it didn't upset the original or

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.670 
that it didn't upset the original or
parcels<00:04:18.919> one<00:04:19.130> um<00:04:20.019> again<00:04:21.019> in<00:04:21.260> terms<00:04:21.440> of<00:04:21.560> the

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
parcels one um again in terms of the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.740 
parcels one um again in terms of the
lore<00:04:21.890> happens<00:04:22.790> in<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:22.940> same<00:04:23.150> universe<00:04:23.570> but

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
lore happens in the same universe but

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.010 
lore happens in the same universe but
different<00:04:24.050> places<00:04:24.230> so<00:04:24.650> by<00:04:25.460> my<00:04:26.120> correct<00:04:26.510> answer

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
different places so by my correct answer

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.659 
different places so by my correct answer
for<00:04:27.169> that<00:04:27.200> is<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.530> lures<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.190> stories<00:04:28.520> don't

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
for that is the lures the stories don't

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.130 
for that is the lures the stories don't
