now<00:00:02.370> once<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:03.149> have<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.540> length<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:04.200> chain

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
now once you have the length of chain

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.299 
now once you have the length of chain
that<00:00:06.690> you<00:00:06.750> need<00:00:07.049> you're<00:00:07.500> ready<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.950> do<00:00:08.069> what's

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
that you need you're ready to do what's

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.330 
that you need you're ready to do what's
called<00:00:08.519> casting<00:00:08.970> off<00:00:09.620> so<00:00:10.620> what<00:00:10.800> I've<00:00:10.920> done<00:00:11.130> is

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
called casting off so what I've done is

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.850 
called casting off so what I've done is
I've<00:00:11.490> taken<00:00:11.519> my<00:00:12.360> wire<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.870> I've<00:00:13.110> cut<00:00:13.590> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
I've taken my wire and I've cut the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.189 
I've taken my wire and I've cut the
excess<00:00:14.370> off<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.089> bowl<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.690> I've

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
excess off of this bowl and I've

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.080 
excess off of this bowl and I've
probably<00:00:16.440> left<00:00:16.830> myself<00:00:17.310> about<00:00:17.520> 12<00:00:17.880> or<00:00:18.060> 13

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
probably left myself about 12 or 13

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.310 
probably left myself about 12 or 13
inches<00:00:18.930> now<00:00:20.270> what<00:00:21.270> I'm<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> do<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:22.080> I'm

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
inches now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.700 
inches now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.769> gently<00:00:23.420> lift<00:00:26.630> my<00:00:27.630> loop<00:00:27.930> off<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.529> my

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
going to gently lift my loop off of my

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.040 
going to gently lift my loop off of my
school<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.910> was<00:00:30.090> going<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.510> lift<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.900> over

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
school like I was going to lift it over

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.180 
school like I was going to lift it over
a<00:00:32.570> loop<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.410> important<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.010> know<00:00:35.160> that

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
a loop now it's important to know that

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.280 
a loop now it's important to know that
when<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.700> get<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> end<00:00:36.270> you're<00:00:36.930> not<00:00:37.050> going

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
when you get to the end you're not going

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.350 
when you get to the end you're not going
to<00:00:37.350> wrap<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:38.100> time<00:00:38.460> you're<00:00:38.760> just<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:39.270> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
to wrap this time you're just going to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.209 
to wrap this time you're just going to
lift<00:00:39.750> off<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:43.200> I'm<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> take<00:00:44.010> my

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
lift off and then I'm going to take my

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.610 
lift off and then I'm going to take my
little<00:00:44.399> excess<00:00:44.850> piece<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.239> wire<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.230> had

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
little excess piece of wire that I had

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:57.660 
little excess piece of wire that I had
and<00:00:47.039> I'm<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.270> run<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.660> through<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.370> loop

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:06.300 

I'll<00:00:58.670> lift<00:00:58.970> off<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.480> next<00:01:01.630> loop<00:01:03.760> take<00:01:04.760> my<00:01:04.970> wire

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
I'll lift off the next loop take my wire

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:16.380 
I'll lift off the next loop take my wire
run<00:01:07.310> it<00:01:07.430> through<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.760> loop

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.380 

and<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.200> is<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.500> part<00:01:17.770> can<00:01:18.040> that<00:01:18.910> can<00:01:19.120> draw

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
and this is the part can that can draw

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:29.790 
and this is the part can that can draw
be<00:01:19.450> nutty<00:01:20.670> trying<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.910> get<00:01:22.150> it<00:01:28.290> okay<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.560> once

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
be nutty trying to get it okay and once

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.100 
be nutty trying to get it okay and once
I've<00:01:29.920> done<00:01:29.980> that<00:01:30.510> polished<00:01:31.510> off<00:01:31.690> my<00:01:31.900> third

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
I've done that polished off my third

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:49.780 
I've done that polished off my third
loop<00:01:37.920> Lizzie's<00:01:38.920> talking<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.550> us

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.980 

so<00:01:50.330> there's<00:01:50.570> three<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:53.240> then<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.630> will<00:01:53.780> lift

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
so there's three and then I will lift

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.380 
so there's three and then I will lift
off<00:01:54.200> my<00:01:54.440> fourth<00:01:54.680> loop<00:01:54.950> here<00:01:55.370> and<00:01:58.060> run<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.180> wire

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
off my fourth loop here and run the wire

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:17.420 
off my fourth loop here and run the wire
through<00:02:01.720> my<00:02:02.720> horse<00:02:02.960> loop

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.350 

so<00:02:18.430> now<00:02:18.670> all<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:20.200> my<00:02:20.500> lips<00:02:20.800> are<00:02:21.430> held<00:02:22.090> together

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
so now all for my lips are held together

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.140 
so now all for my lips are held together
here<00:02:22.900> at<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.050> top<00:02:23.230> now<00:02:24.130> we'll<00:02:24.460> go<00:02:24.640> ahead<00:02:24.670> and

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
here at the top now we'll go ahead and

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.760 
here at the top now we'll go ahead and
pull<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.570> out<00:02:27.270> yeah<00:02:28.270> buddy

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.310 

so<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.160> have<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.610> really<00:02:34.030> nice<00:02:34.320> long

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
so that you have a really nice long
