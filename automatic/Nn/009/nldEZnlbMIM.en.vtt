is said to be the first mobile
application<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:15.630> HDR<00:00:15.929> it's<00:00:16.260> actually<00:00:16.619> tone

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
application for HDR it's actually tone

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.820 
application for HDR it's actually tone
mapping<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:18.050> people<00:00:19.050> kind<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.320> mix<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.680> two

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
mapping and people kind of mix the two

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.230 
mapping and people kind of mix the two
together<00:00:20.010> because<00:00:20.520> they<00:00:20.670> can't<00:00:20.910> give<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
together because they can't give the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.109 
together because they can't give the
similar<00:00:22.050> effect<00:00:22.410> giving<00:00:23.160> example<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.640> HDR

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
similar effect giving example with HDR

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.460 
similar effect giving example with HDR
is<00:00:24.390> when<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.600> taking<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> picture<00:00:25.050> that's

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
is when you taking a picture that's

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.920 
is when you taking a picture that's
under<00:00:25.710> exposed<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.359> take<00:00:27.510> another<00:00:27.720> one

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
under exposed and you take another one

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.210 
under exposed and you take another one
that's<00:00:28.080> over<00:00:28.289> exposing<00:00:28.650> merge<00:00:29.010> those<00:00:29.160> two

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that's over exposing merge those two

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.209 
that's over exposing merge those two
together<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> perfect<00:00:30.960> exposure<00:00:31.410> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
together in a perfect exposure of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.030 
together in a perfect exposure of
everything<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.850> mean<00:00:33.000> you're<00:00:33.120> leaving<00:00:33.270> some

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
everything I mean you're leaving some

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.490 
everything I mean you're leaving some
examples<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.820> guys<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.360> check<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.809> some<00:00:37.410> of

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
examples you guys can check out some of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.229 
examples you guys can check out some of
this<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:37.920> tone<00:00:38.190> mapping<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.820> some<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.120> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
this can be tone mapping and some of it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.360 
this can be tone mapping and some of it
will<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.420> HDR<00:00:41.600> now<00:00:42.600> tone<00:00:43.020> mapping<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.590> Alyssa

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
will be HDR now tone mapping is Alyssa

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.700 
will be HDR now tone mapping is Alyssa
ends<00:00:45.120> giving<00:00:45.660> example<00:00:46.050> let's<00:00:46.170> say<00:00:46.260> I'm<00:00:46.320> taking

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
ends giving example let's say I'm taking

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.029 
ends giving example let's say I'm taking
a<00:00:46.890> picture<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.879> safari<00:00:48.739> on<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.250> desert<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
a picture of a safari on the desert and

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.910 
a picture of a safari on the desert and
so<00:00:53.039> let's<00:00:53.250> say<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.399> know<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.940> red<00:00:54.210> sand<00:00:54.920> of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
so let's say you know I have red sand of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.090 
so let's say you know I have red sand of
Browns<00:00:56.370> it'll<00:00:56.760> say<00:00:56.850> brown<00:00:57.149> sand<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
Browns it'll say brown sand and I have a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.849 
Browns it'll say brown sand and I have a
red<00:00:59.309> Ferrari<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.570> black<00:01:00.870> tires<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
red Ferrari I have black tires and I

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.939 
red Ferrari I have black tires and I
have<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.039> blue<00:01:02.489> sky<00:01:02.850> ok<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:04.439> tone<00:01:04.710> mapping

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
have a blue sky ok now what tone mapping

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.410 
have a blue sky ok now what tone mapping
is<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.850> there's<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.119> bunch

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
is going to do is that there's a bunch

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.050 
is going to do is that there's a bunch
of<00:01:06.570> colors<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.200> your<00:01:07.770> LCD<00:01:08.220> screen<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:08.880> your

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
of colors that your LCD screen or your

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.630 
of colors that your LCD screen or your
electronic<00:01:09.630> display<00:01:10.020> cannot<00:01:10.920> display<00:01:11.369> but

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
electronic display cannot display but

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.050 
electronic display cannot display but
the<00:01:11.729> data<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.990> JPEG<00:01:13.500> are<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.640> bitmap

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the data is in the JPEG are the bitmap

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
the data is in the JPEG are the bitmap
or<00:01:15.299> whatever<00:01:15.540> your<00:01:15.750> device<00:01:16.259> takes<00:01:16.470> are<00:01:16.770> using

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
or whatever your device takes are using

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.719 
or whatever your device takes are using
your<00:01:17.400> video<00:01:17.759> file<00:01:19.009> so<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.280> does<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
your video file so what it does is it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.550 
your video file so what it does is it
takes<00:01:21.030> those<00:01:21.270> colors<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.080> can't<00:01:22.380> be

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
takes those colors that can't be

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.730 
takes those colors that can't be
displayed<00:01:23.240> let's<00:01:24.240> say<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.600> Ferrari<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
displayed let's say for the Ferrari the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.550 
displayed let's say for the Ferrari the
red<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.000> bring<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.810> more<00:01:28.170> red

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
red and it's going to bring in more red

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.929 
red and it's going to bring in more red
and<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.520> bringing<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.060> nice<00:01:31.070> papi<00:01:32.070> color<00:01:32.640> to

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
and so bringing a nice papi color to

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.719 
and so bringing a nice papi color to
your<00:01:33.420> safari<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.680> not<00:01:34.799> pop<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.100> detail

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
your safari and it's not pop the detail

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.730 
your safari and it's not pop the detail
in<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> sky<00:01:36.150> especially<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:36.990> clouds

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
in the sky especially if you have clouds

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.719 
in the sky especially if you have clouds
and<00:01:38.070> stuff<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:40.189> keep<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.340> mind<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and stuff like that keep in mind that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.270 
and stuff like that keep in mind that
something<00:01:42.240> sometimes<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.110> isn't<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.070> best

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
something sometimes this isn't the best

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.069 
something sometimes this isn't the best
way<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.549> film<00:01:45.060> people<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.780> does

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
way to film people because it does

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.920 
way to film people because it does
exaggerate<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> skin<00:01:47.250> tones<00:01:47.520> however<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
exaggerate the skin tones however it's a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.810 
exaggerate the skin tones however it's a
really<00:01:49.110> cool<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.710> tone<00:01:50.100> mapping<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.549> cool<00:01:50.729> if

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
really cool the tone mapping is cool if

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.450 
really cool the tone mapping is cool if
you're<00:01:50.909> doing<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.350> building<00:01:52.350> sky<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.220> stuff

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
you're doing like building sky and stuff

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.510 
you're doing like building sky and stuff
like<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:55.200> know<00:01:55.259> trees<00:01:55.680> or<00:01:56.009> flowers<00:01:56.490> or

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
like that you know trees or flowers or

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.609 
like that you know trees or flowers or
whatever<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.719> anyway<00:01:57.990> let's<00:01:58.140> open<00:01:58.380> up<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
whatever so anyway let's open up the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.459 
whatever so anyway let's open up the
application<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.780> right<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.960> filter<00:02:01.350> is

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
application and right now the filter is

okay<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.190> now<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.340> turn<00:02:52.609> that<00:02:52.790> back<00:02:53.030> on<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:53.510> you

okay so now I turn that back on so you

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.080 
okay so now I turn that back on so you
can<00:02:53.900> see<00:02:54.109> how<00:02:56.950> exaggerated<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.099> is<00:02:58.280> now<00:02:58.940> you're

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
can see how exaggerated it is now you're

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.699 
can see how exaggerated it is now you're
not<00:02:59.180> can<00:02:59.390> be<00:02:59.480> able<00:02:59.629> to<00:02:59.690> see<00:02:59.810> this<00:02:59.959> exactly<00:03:00.470> how

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
not can be able to see this exactly how

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.720 
not can be able to see this exactly how
I<00:03:00.739> see<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:02.980> because<00:03:03.980> i'm<00:03:04.099> filming<00:03:04.310> off<00:03:04.519> at<00:03:04.670> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
I see it because i'm filming off at the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.780 
I see it because i'm filming off at the
camcorder<00:03:05.299> but<00:03:06.109> there<00:03:06.620> is<00:03:06.650> some<00:03:07.160> right<00:03:07.430> here

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
camcorder but there is some right here

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.789 
camcorder but there is some right here
in<00:03:08.000> this<00:03:08.150> black<00:03:08.480> part<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.170> checkerboard

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
in this black part of the checkerboard

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.280 
in this black part of the checkerboard
in<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.160> stone<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:11.329> is<00:03:11.540> becoming<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:12.079> red

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
in the stone and this is becoming a red

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.710 
in the stone and this is becoming a red
so<00:03:12.950> it's<00:03:13.099> pulling<00:03:13.489> out<00:03:13.640> detail<00:03:14.209> that<00:03:14.510> is

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
so it's pulling out detail that is

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.849 
so it's pulling out detail that is
really<00:03:15.379> hard<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.799> see<00:03:17.079> here<00:03:18.079> we<00:03:18.169> go<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.319> the

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
really hard to see here we go to the

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.349 
really hard to see here we go to the
second<00:03:19.549> on<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.090> third<00:03:20.329> filter<00:03:20.630> this<00:03:21.560> one<00:03:21.829> is

second on the third filter this one is

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.240

hydra-matic<00:03:23.359> range<00:03:23.959> on<00:03:24.290> saturation<00:03:25.160> is

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
hydra-matic range on saturation is

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.870 
hydra-matic range on saturation is

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
medium mood is cool and landscape now

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.729 
medium mood is cool and landscape now
that<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.660> white<00:03:29.810> part<00:03:30.079> of<00:03:30.169> the<00:03:30.260> stone<00:03:30.500> right

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
that the white part of the stone right

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.220 
that the white part of the stone right
here<00:03:30.950> that's<00:03:31.099> in<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.489> black<00:03:31.750> that's<00:03:32.750> shown<00:03:33.019> up

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
here that's in the black that's shown up

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.610 
here that's in the black that's shown up

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
as black on the ipod touch and let me

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.530 
as black on the ipod touch and let me
just<00:03:36.769> see<00:03:36.889> if<00:03:36.919> I<00:03:37.130> can<00:03:37.280> film<00:03:37.639> a<00:03:37.819> lil<00:03:38.060> bit<00:03:38.269> of<00:03:38.389> this

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
just see if I can film a lil bit of this

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.539 
just see if I can film a lil bit of this
maybe<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:39.079> can<00:03:39.230> see<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:40.010> can<00:03:40.069> probably<00:03:40.310> see

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
maybe you can see you can probably see

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.120 
maybe you can see you can probably see
some<00:03:40.790> light<00:03:41.030> right<00:03:41.299> here<00:03:41.680> that's<00:03:42.680> in<00:03:42.980> the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
some light right here that's in the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.449 
some light right here that's in the
stone<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:44.329> it's<00:03:44.660> really<00:03:45.290> pulling<00:03:45.709> out<00:03:45.889> detail

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
stone so it's really pulling out detail

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.610 
stone so it's really pulling out detail
that's<00:03:46.639> harder<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.030> see<00:03:47.329> this<00:03:47.930> is<00:03:48.169> so<00:03:48.500> you<00:03:48.590> can

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
that's harder to see this is so you can

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.940 
that's harder to see this is so you can
get<00:03:48.739> an<00:03:48.859> idea<00:03:48.919> of<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.900> now<00:03:50.900> what<00:03:51.290> I<00:03:51.319> do<00:03:51.440> kind<00:03:51.889> of

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
have the iphone 3gs is kind of cool

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.880 
have the iphone 3gs is kind of cool
because<00:04:28.510> you<00:04:28.780> can<00:04:28.810> kind<00:04:29.200> emulate<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:29.860> cheap

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
because you can kind emulate that cheap

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.740 
because you can kind emulate that cheap
VHS<00:04:32.890> camcorder<00:04:33.610> look<00:04:34.090> because<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.420> colors

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
VHS camcorder look because the colors

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.260 
VHS camcorder look because the colors
are<00:04:34.780> kind<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.110> wacky<00:04:35.380> so<00:04:35.830> it's<00:04:36.760> kind<00:04:37.000> of<00:04:37.030> cool

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
are kind of wacky so it's kind of cool

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.410 
are kind of wacky so it's kind of cool
for<00:04:37.450> that<00:04:37.600> now<00:04:38.470> if<00:04:38.620> you're<00:04:38.830> on<00:04:39.240> one<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.360> the

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
for that now if you're on one of the

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.880 
for that now if you're on one of the
newer<00:04:40.690> devices<00:04:40.990> where<00:04:41.290> you<00:04:41.350> don't<00:04:41.530> have<00:04:41.650> the

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
newer devices where you don't have the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.350 
newer devices where you don't have the
full<00:04:42.640> by<00:04:42.760> three<00:04:43.000> ratio<00:04:44.760> we<00:04:45.760> could<00:04:46.060> do<00:04:46.180> what<00:04:46.330> you

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
full by three ratio we could do what you

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.990 
full by three ratio we could do what you
could<00:04:46.630> put<00:04:46.870> some<00:04:47.110> masking<00:04:47.560> tape<00:04:47.590> over<00:04:48.220> and<00:04:48.430> I

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
could put some masking tape over and I

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.410 
could put some masking tape over and I
probably<00:04:49.360> recommend<00:04:49.930> going<00:04:50.200> to<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:50.980> know

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
probably recommend going to you know

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.960 
probably recommend going to you know
cbso<00:04:52.420> ever<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:52.960> if<00:04:53.260> you<00:04:53.710> know<00:04:53.830> that<00:04:53.970> those

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
cbso ever and if you know that those

cbso ever and if you know that those
yellow<00:04:55.630> sticky<00:04:56.620> things<00:04:56.980> you<00:04:57.250> people<00:04:57.520> write

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
yellow sticky things you people write

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.750 
yellow sticky things you people write
notes<00:04:58.210> on<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:59.800> can<00:04:59.950> put<00:05:00.220> that<00:05:00.370> over<00:05:00.550> the

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
notes on you can put that over the

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.950 
notes on you can put that over the

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
screen a little bit it's probably

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.210

around with it take some videos and try

to figure out where it is and try to get
that<00:05:07.420> four<00:05:07.750> by<00:05:07.900> three<00:05:07.930> that<00:05:08.860> you<00:05:08.950> can<00:05:09.100> emulate

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
that four by three that you can emulate

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.970 
that four by three that you can emulate
VHS<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.360> one<00:05:10.900> of<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.050> reasons<00:05:11.380> for<00:05:11.470> emulating

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
VHS and one of the reasons for emulating

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.870 
VHS and one of the reasons for emulating
VHS<00:05:13.020> look<00:05:14.020> is<00:05:14.230> because<00:05:14.530> VHS<00:05:15.100> look<00:05:15.370> is<00:05:15.520> actually

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
VHS look is because VHS look is actually

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.150 
VHS look is because VHS look is actually
having<00:05:16.120> a<00:05:16.150> little<00:05:16.360> bit<00:05:16.420> of<00:05:16.480> a<00:05:16.570> comeback

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
having a little bit of a comeback

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.010 
having a little bit of a comeback
because<00:05:18.160> of<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.550> retro<00:05:18.910> thing<00:05:19.150> you<00:05:19.900> know<00:05:19.960> a

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
millimeter or whatever this is an easy

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.180 
millimeter or whatever this is an easy
way<00:05:36.040> to<00:05:36.070> emulate<00:05:36.580> that<00:05:36.760> look<00:05:36.970> if<00:05:37.120> you<00:05:37.240> need<00:05:37.390> it

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
way to emulate that look if you need it

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.620 
way to emulate that look if you need it
one<00:05:39.190> other<00:05:39.310> thing<00:05:39.430> this<00:05:39.730> only<00:05:40.000> records<00:05:40.510> in

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
one other thing this only records in

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.660

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
360p so there was a little bit of a

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.270 
360p so there was a little bit of a
bummer<00:05:42.970> however<00:05:43.960> if<00:05:44.290> you're<00:05:45.010> looking<00:05:45.250> for
