00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.370
 every day I open with the knowledge 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:21.029
 that more people can not be saved here 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.029
 I try to make enemies all the more 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.179
 and it's just a matter of time 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.179
 that I have an opponent whose power 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.279
 I did not grow 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.120

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.989
 Harry Osborn really cares 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.980
 RoÃŸkopf has been under surveillance 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.660

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.570

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.030

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.320

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.600
