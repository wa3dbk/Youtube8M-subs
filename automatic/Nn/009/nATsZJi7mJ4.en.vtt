so<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> 1994<00:00:11.250> YJ<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.840> vent<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:14.099> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
so this is a 1994 YJ the vent for the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.660 
so this is a 1994 YJ the vent for the
differential<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.150> on<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.230> passenger<00:00:16.770> side

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.070 

that's<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.880> dana<00:00:21.300> 30<00:00:22.699> differential<00:00:23.699> ah<00:00:25.670> and

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
that's a dana 30 differential ah and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.790 
that's a dana 30 differential ah and
your<00:00:28.080> vent<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.710> right<00:00:29.460> there<00:00:30.349> this<00:00:31.349> one<00:00:31.590> is

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
your vent is right there this one is

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.060 
your vent is right there this one is
missing<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:33.050> adapter<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> hose<00:00:34.680> so

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
missing the adapter and the hose so

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.440 
missing the adapter and the hose so
we're<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> get<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.000> fixed<00:00:36.239> up

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
that goes into the differential part

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.500 
that goes into the differential part

differential is properly vented is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.240 
differential is properly vented is
essential<00:01:16.590> if<00:01:16.740> you're<00:01:16.830> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.040> going

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
essential if you're going to going

debris into your differential through

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.420 
debris into your differential through
this<00:01:24.030> vent<00:01:24.450> hole<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> take<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
this vent hole so we're going to take a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.770 
this vent hole so we're going to take a
wire<00:01:26.610> brush<00:01:26.880> we're<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.330> clean<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.720> up

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
wire brush we're going to clean this up

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.690 
wire brush we're going to clean this up
real<00:01:28.439> nice<00:01:28.650> we're<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> make<00:01:29.579> sure

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.850 
take a little tube brush and clean out
the<00:01:35.369> inside<00:01:35.430> there<00:01:36.030> when<00:01:36.390> we're<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:36.659> finished

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
the inside there when we're all finished

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.289 
the inside there when we're all finished
we're<00:01:37.860> going<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.070> end<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.250> servicing<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
we're going to end up servicing the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.480 
we're going to end up servicing the
differential<00:01:39.869> -<00:01:40.049> doing<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.650> fluid<00:01:41.009> change<00:01:41.250> on

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
differential - doing a fluid change on

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.109 
differential - doing a fluid change on
it<00:01:41.990> now<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.020> got<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> little<00:01:43.470> vent<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.310> put<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it now I got a little vent to put a

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.780 
it now I got a little vent to put a
little<00:01:45.240> bit<00:01:45.360> RTV<00:01:46.159> around<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> edge<00:01:47.399> there

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
little bit RTV around the edge there

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.399 
little bit RTV around the edge there
obviously<00:01:48.540> we're<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:48.869> making<00:01:49.110> sure<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.320> don't

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
obviously we're not making sure we don't

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.280 
obviously we're not making sure we don't
get<00:01:49.560> any<00:01:49.670> inside<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.909> tube<00:01:51.119> all<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.170> now

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
get any inside of the tube all right now

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.990 
get any inside of the tube all right now
we're<00:01:52.439> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> set<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> tube<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
we're going to set this in the tube and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.319 
we're going to set this in the tube and
I<00:01:54.299> take<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> little<00:01:55.530> hammer<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.090> tap<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.240> in

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
I take a little hammer and tap it in

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.459 
I take a little hammer and tap it in
place<00:02:01.850> alright<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:03.030> got<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.299> little<00:02:04.020> vent<00:02:04.290> in

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
place alright we got the little vent in

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.740 
place alright we got the little vent in
place<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:06.000> bit<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.210> our<00:02:06.360> TV

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
place just a little bit of our TV

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.479 
place just a little bit of our TV
squeezing<00:02:07.380> around<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.680> edges<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.129> like<00:02:08.250> we

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
