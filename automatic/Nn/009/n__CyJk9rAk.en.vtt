00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
that's 12 and a quarter Jersey then you

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.650 
that's 12 and a quarter Jersey then you

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
so what you're doing that you're saving

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.130 
so what you're doing that you're saving
so<00:04:59.120> much<00:04:59.240> faith<00:04:59.480> in<00:04:59.510> departments<00:05:00.050> like

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
so much faith in departments like

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.180 
so much faith in departments like

sometimes<00:05:46.729> even<00:05:47.090> two<00:05:47.270> years<00:05:47.510> there's<00:05:48.169> a<00:05:48.260> lot

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
sometimes even two years there's a lot

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.700 
sometimes even two years there's a lot
involved<00:05:49.100> in<00:05:49.460> every<00:05:49.729> single<00:05:50.030> product<00:05:50.240> they

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.840 
involved in every single product they
are<00:05:51.710> made<00:05:52.070> to<00:05:52.250> look<00:05:52.400> extremely<00:05:53.240> simple<00:05:53.750> and

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
are made to look extremely simple and

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.370 
are made to look extremely simple and
and<00:05:55.850> they're<00:05:56.300> very<00:05:56.330> very<00:05:56.840> easy<00:05:57.140> to<00:05:57.350> operate
