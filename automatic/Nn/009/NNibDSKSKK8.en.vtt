00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 if there is a plant that evokes the 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.200
 sun is the oleander and yet 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.440
 it's a plant that's easy to 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.440
 cuttings 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.330
 the success of a laurel cuttings 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.430
 roses must pass by the choice 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.650
 from the end of the rod that you go 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.730
 take off if you take a stem that 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.500
 is too long you will have 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.539
 difficulties for recovery then 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.010
 often on a laurel there are young people 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.680
 shoots and it's a young shoot whose 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.690
 the in between are not tight enough this is the 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.490
 ideal cutting to succeed especially 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.259
 especially the cutting does not have to be 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.760
 buttonhole with future flowers on it 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.309
 now that we have cut our 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.460
 cuttings we need a glass a glass 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.839
 two-thirds full of water a piece 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.640
 of charcoal we're going 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.260
 put inside then the 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.670
 particularity of charcoal that 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.219
 will prevent the water from getting bad 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.409
 smells the water will always be clear 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.870
 and then a stretch film 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.719
 we will start by putting the film 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.359
 stretchy on the green gold the reason is 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.800
 quite simple if to avoid precisely 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.909
 evaporation that is to say that the 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.949
 cutting live to practically 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.269
 the suffocated but simply the stem 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.000
 now we are going to do our 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.479
 cuttings so this is a cutting that has 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.180
 many 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.219
 between us we have several leaves so 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.200
 several areas of leaves we will cut 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:17.790
 just under the sheet but before the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:23.579
 cut we will first remove the leaves 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.579
 without tearing the rod on both sides 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.840
 now we have our coach 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.909
 which is located here we go 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.250
 cut right under the knot and we're going 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.990
 now put this cuttings into the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.479
 green then to avoid evaporation 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.990
 we can always cut the end 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.759
 leaves 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.039
 now here is our cuttings is 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.380
 ready we will be able to put it to 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.789
 inside and pricking it into our 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.509
 film and will go to make it a whole 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:55.179
 little hole right in the middle and we're going 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.179
 Slide the way such tempering cuttings 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.700
 slightly in the water now here 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.990
 our cuttings and finish with this movie 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.299
 stretchable it will prevent evaporation 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.499
 count several weeks 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.170
 several months to have the first 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:10.720
 roots mostly exposed his cuttings of 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.100
 oleanders in the sun well at the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.100
 light and well to heat
