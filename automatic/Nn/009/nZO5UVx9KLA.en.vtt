bought a hold another system today I
actually<00:00:14.969> went<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.330> get<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.510> battery<00:00:15.750> which

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
actually went to get a battery which

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.410 
actually went to get a battery which
you'll<00:00:16.230> see<00:00:16.260> later<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:17.630> kinetic<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:20.070> good

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
you'll see later a kinetic and it's good

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.120 
you'll see later a kinetic and it's good
and<00:00:21.420> we've<00:00:21.870> got<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> cheap<00:00:22.290> amplifier<00:00:22.860> to<00:00:23.010> hook

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
and we've got a cheap amplifier to hook

originally ran in here somebody had an

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.590 
originally ran in here somebody had an
amplifier<00:02:23.880> run<00:02:24.090> into<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.890> wow<00:02:25.890> man<00:02:26.600> push

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
amplifier run into this wow man push

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.550 
amplifier run into this wow man push
about<00:02:28.310> 50<00:02:29.310> watts<00:02:29.520> through<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:29.940> shitty<00:02:30.240> wire

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
about 50 watts through that shitty wire

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.510 
about 50 watts through that shitty wire
that's<00:02:31.560> coming<00:02:31.980> out<00:02:32.070> we're<00:02:32.250> going<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.430> put

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
that's coming out we're going to put

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.880 
that's coming out we're going to put
some<00:02:32.580> real<00:02:33.020> i'm<00:02:34.020> going<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.200> put<00:02:34.320> american<00:02:34.710> base

some real i'm going to put american base
wire<00:02:35.160> through<00:02:35.430> there<00:02:36.560> yeah<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:38.070> sound

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
wire through there yeah it sound

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.260 
wire through there yeah it sound
explorer<00:02:42.980> well<00:02:43.980> i<00:02:44.010> figured<00:02:44.370> i'd<00:02:44.490> try<00:02:45.150> to

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
explorer well i figured i'd try to

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.430 
explorer well i figured i'd try to
explain<00:02:45.630> count<00:02:45.900> while<00:02:46.050> you're<00:02:46.170> getting<00:02:46.350> ready

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
explain count while you're getting ready

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.130 
explain count while you're getting ready
to<00:02:46.590> see<00:02:46.910> in<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.090> next<00:02:48.240> videos<00:02:48.630> i'm<00:02:48.930> going<00:02:49.080> to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
to see in the next videos i'm going to

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.690 
to see in the next videos i'm going to
split<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.500> video<00:02:49.800> up<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.130> probably<00:02:50.340> like

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
split this video up and probably like

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.620 
split this video up and probably like
like<00:02:51.110> four<00:02:52.110> parts<00:02:52.530> counting<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.340> one<00:02:53.630> this

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
like four parts counting this one this

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.880 
like four parts counting this one this
felt<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:54.960> when<00:02:55.110> people<00:02:55.380> are<00:02:55.440> doing<00:02:55.650> searches

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
felt like when people are doing searches

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.770 
felt like when people are doing searches
and<00:02:56.190> stuff<00:02:56.370> they<00:02:56.550> can<00:02:56.610> see<00:02:56.850> clamp<00:02:57.150> results<00:02:57.600> for

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
and stuff they can see clamp results for

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.430 
and stuff they can see clamp results for
what<00:02:57.930> they're<00:02:58.080> looking<00:02:58.320> for<00:02:58.350> but<00:02:59.930> we<00:03:00.930> tested

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
what they're looking for but we tested

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.800 
what they're looking for but we tested
these<00:03:01.620> amps<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.580> infinity<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.300> actually

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
these amps the infinity is actually

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.950 
these amps the infinity is actually
monoblock<00:03:04.670> with<00:03:05.670> two<00:03:05.880> channels<00:03:06.390> for<00:03:06.600> easier

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
monoblock with two channels for easier

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.870 
monoblock with two channels for easier
hookups<00:03:08.000> but<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.090> all<00:03:09.210> goes<00:03:09.390> together<00:03:09.600> in<00:03:09.900> one

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
hookups but it all goes together in one

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.990 
hookups but it all goes together in one
it's<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:12.090> 611<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:13.340> still<00:03:14.340> believes<00:03:14.610> supposed<00:03:14.940> to

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
it's a 611 a still believes supposed to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.790 
it's a 611 a still believes supposed to
be<00:03:15.060> 600<00:03:15.600> watts

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
be 600 watts

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.980 
be 600 watts
and<00:03:19.020> we<00:03:20.020> clamped<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.560> we<00:03:20.770> clamp<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.990> American

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
and we clamped it we clamp the American

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.880 
and we clamped it we clamp the American
Legacy<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:24.580> we<00:03:25.000> test<00:03:25.300> it<00:03:25.480> on<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:26.020> we<00:03:26.500> tested

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
Legacy and we test it on and we tested

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.610 
Legacy and we test it on and we tested
the<00:03:27.040> battery<00:03:27.760> capacitor<00:03:28.390> let's<00:03:29.320> you'll<00:03:29.470> see

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
the battery capacitor let's you'll see

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.920 
the battery capacitor let's you'll see
like<00:03:29.800> probably<00:03:30.070> in<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.340> last<00:03:30.520> video<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:33.930> this

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
like probably in the last video and this

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.190 
like probably in the last video and this
one<00:03:35.140> you<00:03:35.260> guys<00:03:35.320> know<00:03:35.680> what<00:03:35.710> you're<00:03:37.200> getting

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
one you guys know what you're getting

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.630 
one you guys know what you're getting
ready<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.530> see<00:03:38.770> and<00:03:39.010> why<00:03:39.160> it's<00:03:39.340> going<00:03:39.460> to<00:03:39.550> be

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
ready to see and why it's going to be

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.490 
ready to see and why it's going to be
kind<00:03:39.820> of<00:03:39.940> cut<00:03:40.450> up<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:40.900> how<00:03:41.020> many<00:03:41.080> parts

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
kind of cut up and how many parts

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.400 
kind of cut up and how many parts
there's<00:03:41.650> going<00:03:41.770> to<00:03:41.830> be<00:03:41.860> so<00:03:42.840> say<00:03:43.840> Taryn<00:03:44.230> if<00:03:44.320> you

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
watch these amplifiers put out two of

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.080 
watch these amplifiers put out two of
them<00:03:48.340> anyway<00:03:48.610> so<00:03:49.510> much<00:03:49.750> they<00:03:49.900> really<00:03:50.050> put<00:03:50.440> out
