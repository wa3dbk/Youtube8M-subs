immune cells these are called microglia
we're<00:00:30.480> now<00:00:30.630> discovering<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.890> many<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.399> the

we're now discovering that many of the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.910 
we're now discovering that many of the
neurological<00:00:32.940> diseases<00:00:33.690> even<00:00:34.230> multiple

sclerosis strokes head trauma are all

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.430 
sclerosis strokes head trauma are all
related<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.270> activation<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.420> these<00:00:39.660> microglia

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
related to activation of these microglia

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.889 
related to activation of these microglia
so<00:00:40.800> if<00:00:40.890> you're<00:00:41.040> eating<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.520> diet<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.149> contains

so if you're eating a diet that contains

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.150 
so if you're eating a diet that contains
these<00:00:43.469> bad<00:00:43.829> foods<00:00:44.280> you're<00:00:45.270> increasing

with inflammation the brain is obesity

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.180 
with inflammation the brain is obesity
we<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.780> people<00:01:01.260> who<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.440> obese<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
we know that people who are obese have a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.439 
we know that people who are obese have a
much<00:01:02.460> higher<00:01:02.699> risk<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.300> developing

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
much higher risk of developing

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.109 
much higher risk of developing
Alzheimer's<00:01:03.989> disease<00:01:04.890> particularly<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:05.970> they

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
Alzheimer's disease particularly as they

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.510 
Alzheimer's disease particularly as they
get<00:01:06.270> older<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.840> that's<00:01:07.619> because<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.280> fat

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
get older and that's because the fat

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.420 
get older and that's because the fat
cells<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.650> lymphocytes<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
cells and the lymphocytes and the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.300 
cells and the lymphocytes and the
macrophages<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.750> fat<00:01:12.960> cells<00:01:13.350> inside<00:01:14.130> of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
macrophages in the fat cells inside of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.440 
macrophages in the fat cells inside of
our<00:01:14.430> abdomen<00:01:14.850> what's<00:01:15.210> called

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
our abdomen what's called

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.850 
our abdomen what's called
intra-abdominal<00:01:16.080> fat<00:01:17.270> produces<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.560> very<00:01:19.560> high

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
intra-abdominal fat produces a very high

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.700 
intra-abdominal fat produces a very high
level<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.549> pro-inflammatory<00:01:21.710> cytokines

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
level of pro-inflammatory cytokines

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.609 
level of pro-inflammatory cytokines
these<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.549> chemicals<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.090> produce

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
these are chemicals that produce

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.660 
these are chemicals that produce
inflammation<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.110> high

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
inflammation and so when you have a high

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.450 
inflammation and so when you have a high
intra-abdominal<00:01:29.670> fat<00:01:30.180> content<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.979> risk<00:01:32.250> of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
intra-abdominal fat content your risk of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880 
intra-abdominal fat content your risk of
a<00:01:32.549> number<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> neurological<00:01:33.750> diseases<00:01:34.439> goes

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
a number of neurological diseases goes

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.690 
a number of neurological diseases goes
up<00:01:35.130> tremendously<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> reason<00:01:38.490> to

up tremendously this is a reason to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.270 
up tremendously this is a reason to
watch<00:01:39.060> your<00:01:39.299> diet<00:01:39.479> as<00:01:39.750> well<00:01:39.829> so<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.130> you

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
watch your diet as well so that if you

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.080 
watch your diet as well so that if you
reduce<00:01:41.729> your<00:01:41.909> intake<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.720> sugars<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:44.090> high

reduce your intake of sugars and high

reduce your intake of sugars and high
carbohydrate<00:01:45.930> foods<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:47.369> reduce<00:01:47.820> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
carbohydrate foods you reduce this

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.059 
function better and are more fluid what
we<00:02:20.220> call<00:02:20.459> brain<00:02:20.819> cell<00:02:21.150> fluidity

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
we call brain cell fluidity

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.009 
we call brain cell fluidity
so<00:02:23.069> we're<00:02:23.450> accomplishing<00:02:24.450> many<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
so we're accomplishing many of the

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.380 
so we're accomplishing many of the
things<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:26.190> set<00:02:26.430> out<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.610> do<00:02:26.970> including

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
things that we set out to do including

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.440 
things that we set out to do including
reducing<00:02:28.250> excitable<00:02:29.250> toxicity<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.209> brain

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
reducing excitable toxicity in the brain

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.339 
reducing excitable toxicity in the brain
so<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.410> combination<00:02:31.680> by<00:02:32.400> using<00:02:32.730> doses<00:02:33.720> which

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
so in combination by using doses which

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.710 
so in combination by using doses which
enhance<00:02:34.920> each<00:02:35.220> other's<00:02:35.640> strengths<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.690> that

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
enhance each other's strengths so that

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.750 
enhance each other's strengths so that
we<00:02:36.959> don't<00:02:37.080> have<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.440> use<00:02:37.650> very<00:02:37.950> high<00:02:38.190> doses

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
we don't have to use very high doses

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.600 
we don't have to use very high doses
other<00:02:39.420> various<00:02:40.019> components<00:02:40.739> we<00:02:41.430> can

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
other various components we can

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.430 
other various components we can
accomplish<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.330> goals<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:43.019> set<00:02:43.049> out<00:02:43.410> to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
accomplish the goals that we set out to

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.250 
accomplish the goals that we set out to
accomplish<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.340> protect<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.849> brain<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.480> we

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
accomplish and protect the brain and we

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.770 
accomplish and protect the brain and we
feel<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:47.099> based<00:02:47.940> on<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.299> scientific
