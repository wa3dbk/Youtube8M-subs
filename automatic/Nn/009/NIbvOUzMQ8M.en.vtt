that<00:01:19.830> will<00:01:19.920> take<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.369> two<00:01:20.939> seconds<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.630> aim

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
that will take like two seconds to aim

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.560 
that will take like two seconds to aim
but<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.340> got<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.759> quick<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.420> come

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
but you got to be quick and if you come

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.510 
but you got to be quick and if you come
up<00:01:24.689> behind<00:01:24.840> them<00:01:25.229> they<00:01:25.409> won't<00:01:25.560> notice<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.280> so

that's<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.939> best<00:01:27.930> bet<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.380> being<00:01:28.650> able<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009

sneak<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.729> behind<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:33.229> as<00:01:34.229> soon<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.619> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
sneak up behind one and as soon as you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.410 
sneak up behind one and as soon as you
hear<00:01:34.920> firing<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.549> your<00:01:35.670> direction<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.180> just

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
better move because once they see you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.670 
better move because once they see you
you're<00:01:41.310> dead<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.970> snipers<00:01:45.840> seem<00:01:46.049> d<00:01:46.259> be

you're dead and the snipers seem d be
the<00:01:46.909> strongest<00:01:47.909> because<00:01:48.270> they're<00:01:48.540> it's

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the strongest because they're it's

instant lock on with a sniper let's see

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.950 
instant lock on with a sniper let's see
what<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.700> all<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.180> guy's<00:01:54.360> using<00:01:54.540> m14

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
what this all this guy's using m14

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.020 
what this all this guy's using m14
and<00:01:57.620> 14<00:01:58.040> s<00:01:58.159> pretty<00:01:58.310> powerful<00:01:58.670> too<00:02:00.729> I'm<00:02:01.729> trying

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
and 14 s pretty powerful too I'm trying

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.690 
and 14 s pretty powerful too I'm trying
to<00:02:02.119> use<00:02:02.270> cover<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:02.930> think<00:02:03.619> if<00:02:03.710> I'd<00:02:03.830> ninja<00:02:04.490> it

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
to use cover I think if I'd ninja it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.570 
to use cover I think if I'd ninja it
would<00:02:04.880> help<00:02:05.000> in<00:02:05.210> combat<00:02:05.630> mode<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.840> lot<00:02:06.580> because

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
would help in combat mode a lot because

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.130 
would help in combat mode a lot because
they<00:02:07.820> do<00:02:07.880> kind<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.840> here<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:10.750> turn<00:02:11.750> around<00:02:11.870> and

they do kind of here you turn around and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.330 
they do kind of here you turn around and

putting more bullets in them I was
walked<00:06:10.840> into<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.200> fire<00:06:11.440> there<00:06:17.100> here's

priming<00:06:22.420> up<00:06:22.540> semtex<00:06:23.140> I<00:06:23.500> thought<00:06:24.310> he<00:06:24.460> was<00:06:24.550> in

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
priming up semtex I thought he was in

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.510 
priming up semtex I thought he was in
this<00:06:24.790> building<00:06:25.150> to<00:06:25.240> my<00:06:25.330> left<00:06:26.370> I'll<00:06:27.370> go

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
this building to my left I'll go

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.650 
this building to my left I'll go
searching<00:06:27.970> for<00:06:28.000> him<00:06:29.760> they<00:06:30.760> move<00:06:30.970> around<00:06:31.120> a<00:06:31.480> lot

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
searching for him they move around a lot

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.950 
searching for him they move around a lot
so<00:06:32.140> you're<00:06:32.530> not<00:06:32.620> going<00:06:32.800> to<00:06:32.860> find<00:06:33.040> any<00:06:33.960> camping

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
so you're not going to find any camping

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.960 
so you're not going to find any camping
BOTS<00:06:35.200> least<00:06:35.920> I<00:06:36.040> haven't<00:06:36.250> seen<00:06:36.370> any<00:06:36.580> camping

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
BOTS least I haven't seen any camping

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.180 
BOTS least I haven't seen any camping
BOTS<00:06:37.150> you'll<00:06:37.960> see<00:06:38.140> some<00:06:38.350> that<00:06:38.500> are<00:06:38.620> crouched

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
BOTS you'll see some that are crouched

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.790 
BOTS you'll see some that are crouched
down<00:06:39.220> walking<00:06:39.910> real<00:06:40.180> slow<00:06:41.850> but<00:06:42.850> not<00:06:43.150> too<00:06:43.360> many

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
down walking real slow but not too many

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.280 
down walking real slow but not too many
really<00:06:44.800> camping<00:06:45.340> BOTS<00:06:45.580> and<00:06:45.910> I<00:06:46.330> think<00:06:46.570> the<00:06:46.810> they

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
really camping BOTS and I think the they

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.550 
really camping BOTS and I think the they
kind<00:06:47.530> of<00:06:47.620> ease<00:06:47.980> up<00:06:48.400> at<00:06:49.120> the<00:06:49.450> end<00:06:49.690> because

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
kind of ease up at the end because

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.650 
kind of ease up at the end because
they'll<00:06:50.800> start<00:06:51.070> really<00:06:51.700> kicking<00:06:52.180> your<00:06:52.330> ass<00:06:52.450> at

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
they'll start really kicking your ass at

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.910 
they'll start really kicking your ass at
the<00:06:52.720> beginning<00:06:53.520> and<00:06:54.520> if<00:06:54.850> you<00:06:55.660> aren't<00:06:55.920> very

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
the beginning and if you aren't very

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.640 
the beginning and if you aren't very
close<00:06:57.310> then<00:06:57.670> they'll<00:06:57.880> kind<00:06:58.870> of<00:06:59.020> ease<00:06:59.260> up<00:06:59.530> a

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
close then they'll kind of ease up a

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.110 
close then they'll kind of ease up a
little<00:06:59.680> bit<00:07:00.010> and<00:07:00.190> allow<00:07:00.250> you<00:07:00.430> to<00:07:00.670> at<00:07:00.760> least<00:07:00.880> get

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
little bit and allow you to at least get

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.060 
little bit and allow you to at least get
a<00:07:01.330> few<00:07:01.630> kills<00:07:01.930> before<00:07:02.410> they<00:07:02.500> in<00:07:02.620> the<00:07:02.740> game<00:07:02.920> I

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
a few kills before they in the game I

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:12.240 
a few kills before they in the game I
think<00:07:09.870> so<00:07:10.870> this<00:07:10.990> was<00:07:11.170> my<00:07:11.320> best<00:07:11.590> strategy<00:07:12.220> is

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
think so this was my best strategy is

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.580 
think so this was my best strategy is
getting<00:07:12.820> into<00:07:13.000> a<00:07:13.030> building<00:07:13.420> looking<00:07:14.290> out<00:07:14.440> all

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 
getting into a building looking out all

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.810 
getting into a building looking out all
the<00:07:14.710> windows<00:07:14.830> and<00:07:16.740> I<00:07:17.740> could<00:07:17.950> have<00:07:18.100> kept<00:07:18.610> doing

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:18.820 
the windows and I could have kept doing

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.640 
the windows and I could have kept doing
this<00:07:19.120> but<00:07:19.420> I<00:07:19.660> thought<00:07:20.080> that<00:07:20.170> would<00:07:20.260> be<00:07:20.320> kind<00:07:20.380> of

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650 
this but I thought that would be kind of

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.750 
this but I thought that would be kind of
cheap<00:07:20.890> so<00:07:22.080> and<00:07:23.080> they<00:07:23.920> did<00:07:24.160> get<00:07:24.430> me<00:07:24.580> out<00:07:24.730> of

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:24.760 
cheap so and they did get me out of

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.910 
cheap so and they did get me out of
there<00:07:24.940> eventually<00:07:25.060> too<00:07:25.570> I<00:07:27.660> wanted<00:07:28.660> to<00:07:28.720> do<00:07:28.960> try

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:29.920 
there eventually too I wanted to do try

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.400 
there eventually too I wanted to do try
to<00:07:29.950> use<00:07:30.340> the<00:07:30.460> same<00:07:30.700> play<00:07:31.210> style<00:07:31.570> that<00:07:31.840> i<00:07:31.900> use<00:07:32.230> in

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:32.410 
to use the same play style that i use in

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.040 
to use the same play style that i use in
normal<00:07:32.940> multiplayer<00:07:33.940> games<00:07:34.270> just<00:07:34.570> to<00:07:34.630> see<00:07:34.870> how

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.050 
normal multiplayer games just to see how

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.260 
normal multiplayer games just to see how
I<00:07:35.080> do
