nice<00:00:01.380> it's<00:00:01.589> my<00:00:01.709> first<00:00:01.920> flight<00:00:02.159> in<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.340> while<00:00:02.520> the

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
nice it's my first flight in a while the

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.120 
nice it's my first flight in a while the
video<00:00:03.570> looks<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.810> little<00:00:03.929> bit<00:00:04.110> funny<00:00:04.290> I<00:00:04.560> had

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
video looks a little bit funny I had

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.010 
video looks a little bit funny I had
some<00:00:05.400> saturation<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:06.450> lightness<00:00:06.629> in

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
some saturation and lightness in

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.450 
some saturation and lightness in
contrast<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.710> get<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.919> where<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.130> could<00:00:08.220> see

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
contrast to get to where you could see

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.150 
contrast to get to where you could see
it<00:00:09.019> probably<00:00:10.019> should<00:00:10.139> turn<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.469> protune<00:00:10.889> off

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
it probably should turn the protune off

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.770 
it probably should turn the protune off
of<00:00:11.759> my<00:00:12.420> gopro<00:00:13.320> hero3<00:00:13.759> some<00:00:14.759> ahead<00:00:15.059> some<00:00:15.540> up<00:00:15.690> in

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
of my gopro hero3 some ahead some up in

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.330 
of my gopro hero3 some ahead some up in
there<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.170> am<00:00:16.350> using<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.710> housing<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.279> as

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
there and I am using the housing and as

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.340 
there and I am using the housing and as
outdoor<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.119> windy<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:18.779> kind<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
outdoor and it's windy it's kind of a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.920 
outdoor and it's windy it's kind of a
test<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.830> see<00:00:20.039> how<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:22.640> handles<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:24.660> wind

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
test to see how this handles the wind

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.130 
test to see how this handles the wind
and<00:00:25.619> also<00:00:26.400> I've<00:00:26.580> crashed<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.300> few<00:00:27.420> times<00:00:27.810> lately

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
and also I've crashed a few times lately

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.230 
and also I've crashed a few times lately
and<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:28.650> see<00:00:28.769> my<00:00:28.800> videos<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.609> I'm<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
and you can see my videos and I'm a

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.319 
and you can see my videos and I'm a
little<00:00:30.420> gunshot<00:00:31.550> so<00:00:32.550> I've<00:00:32.669> got<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.850> housing

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
little gunshot so I've got the housing

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.110 
little gunshot so I've got the housing
on<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.290> I've<00:00:34.469> cut<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> some<00:00:35.040> video<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.340> what

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
on it and I've cut to some video of what

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.610 
on it and I've cut to some video of what
you're<00:00:36.300> seeing<00:00:36.480> from<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:37.079> drone<00:00:37.350> I've

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
you're seeing from the drone I've

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.380 
you're seeing from the drone I've
modified<00:00:38.100> by<00:00:38.430> camera<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> point<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.090> little<00:00:39.180> bit

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
modified by camera to point a little bit

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.630 
modified by camera to point a little bit
more<00:00:39.540> downward<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.280> don't<00:00:41.280> know<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
more downward I don't know if this is a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.580 
more downward I don't know if this is a
good<00:00:41.670> thing<00:00:41.790> or<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.140> it<00:00:43.140> doesn't<00:00:43.469> look<00:00:43.500> like

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
good thing or not it doesn't look like

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.610 
good thing or not it doesn't look like
I'm<00:00:43.860> very<00:00:44.040> high<00:00:44.250> from<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.210> drone<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:46.440> I'm

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
I'm very high from the drone but I'm

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.029 
I'm very high from the drone but I'm
pretty<00:00:46.980> high<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:48.410> like<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.620> able<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.890> see

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
pretty high I like to be able to see

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.430 
pretty high I like to be able to see
down<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.579> maybe<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.850> different<00:00:51.719> setting<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
down and maybe a different setting you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.959 
down and maybe a different setting you
know<00:00:52.530> some<00:00:52.890> flying<00:00:53.190> somewhere<00:00:53.460> else<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.820> may

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
know some flying somewhere else it may

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.290 
know some flying somewhere else it may
look<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.690> little<00:00:54.719> better<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.350> don't<00:00:55.710> know<00:00:56.300> gives

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
look a little better I don't know gives

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.060 
look a little better I don't know gives
