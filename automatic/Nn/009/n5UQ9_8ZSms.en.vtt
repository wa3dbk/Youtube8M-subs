the<00:00:47.489> tire<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.910> question<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:49.710> tire<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the tire in question this tire is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.100 
the tire in question this tire is
inflated<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.850> we'll<00:00:51.000> assume<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.750> damaged

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
inflated so we'll assume it's a damaged

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.860 
inflated so we'll assume it's a damaged
tire<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:53.190> has<00:00:53.460> some<00:00:53.670> hair<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.629> would

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
tire but has some hair in it so we would

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.330 
tire but has some hair in it so we would
attach<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.850> then<00:00:57.199> unscrew<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.440> valve

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
attach it and then unscrew the valve

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.260 
attach it and then unscrew the valve
stem<00:01:01.309> after<00:01:02.309> its<00:01:02.399> unscrewed<00:01:02.820> would<00:01:03.000> pull<00:01:03.180> it
