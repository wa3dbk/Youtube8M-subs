Thermostat so as you guys know actually
purchased<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.219> new<00:00:11.490> house<00:00:11.700> recently<00:00:12.120> been

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
purchased a new house recently been

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.870 
purchased a new house recently been
moving<00:00:12.599> into<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:13.009> reason<00:00:14.009> why<00:00:14.099> my<00:00:14.280> office<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.759> a

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
moving into it reason why my office is a

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.480 
moving into it reason why my office is a
a<00:00:15.059> freaking<00:00:15.630> mess<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.500> decided<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.279> first

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
a freaking mess but decided the first

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.760 
a freaking mess but decided the first
step<00:00:17.730> was<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.210> kind<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.660> upgrade<00:00:19.350> all<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
step was to kind of upgrade all the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.710 
step was to kind of upgrade all the
different<00:00:20.250> aspects<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.970> home<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
different aspects of the home in the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.320 
different aspects of the home in the
first<00:00:21.930> at<00:00:22.260> least<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> thought<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.490> was<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
first at least that I thought of was the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.609 
first at least that I thought of was the
thermostat<00:00:24.779> system<00:00:25.140> we're<00:00:25.260> not<00:00:25.380> going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> use

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
thermostat system we're not going to use

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.910 
thermostat system we're not going to use
a<00:00:26.039> boring<00:00:26.970> 5-day<00:00:27.570> or<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.750> seven-day<00:00:28.320> thermostat

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
a boring 5-day or a seven-day thermostat

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.009 
a boring 5-day or a seven-day thermostat
we're<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.640> using<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.179> nest<00:00:30.539> learning

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
we're going to be using a nest learning

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.540 
we're going to be using a nest learning
thermostat<00:00:31.230> you're<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.040> wonder<00:00:32.279> what

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
thermostat you're going to wonder what

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.729 
thermostat you're going to wonder what
is<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> learning<00:00:33.059> thermostat<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.350> what<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.559> does

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
is a learning thermostat so what it does

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.740 
is a learning thermostat so what it does
is<00:00:34.980> essentially<00:00:35.399> takes<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.000> all<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
is essentially takes in all the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.209 
is essentially takes in all the
different<00:00:37.079> elements<00:00:37.200> whether<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> be

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
different elements whether it be

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.100 
different elements whether it be
humidity<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:39.000> location<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:39.960> this

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
humidity your location because this

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.569 
humidity your location because this
thing<00:00:40.320> does<00:00:40.530> connect<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.950> Wi-Fi<00:00:41.129> which<00:00:41.460> is

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
thing does connect to Wi-Fi which is

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.900 
thing does connect to Wi-Fi which is
pretty<00:00:41.730> awesome<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.739> what<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.980> input<00:00:44.489> into

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
pretty awesome and what you input into

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.119 
pretty awesome and what you input into
it<00:00:45.059> over<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.809> course<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.379> seven<00:00:46.739> day<00:00:46.890> period

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
it over a course of a seven day period

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.569 
it over a course of a seven day period
and<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:48.059> learns<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:49.100> memorizes<00:00:50.100> all<00:00:50.250> those

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and it learns and memorizes all those

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.490 
and it learns and memorizes all those
different<00:00:50.850> slight<00:00:51.480> changes<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.260> like

thermostat does and and it's after

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.140 
thermostat does and and it's after
reading<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.400> little<00:01:41.520> bit<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.909> pretty

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
reading it for a little bit it's pretty

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.359 
reading it for a little bit it's pretty
simple<00:01:42.420> right<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.229> more<00:01:43.470> changes<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> more

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969

and<00:01:48.240> takes<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.930> into<00:01:49.110> consideration<00:01:49.290> it

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
and takes that into consideration it

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.179

adjustments that you can make to it

so you get this little green leaf that

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.620 
so you get this little green leaf that
pops<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.369> depending<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.149> whether<00:02:06.570> or

because<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.660> smaller<00:03:09.989> faceplate<00:03:10.790> but

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
because this is a smaller faceplate but

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.550 
because this is a smaller faceplate but
I'll<00:03:11.910> dive<00:03:12.090> right<00:03:12.300> into<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.780> they<00:03:13.200> do

I'll dive right into the they do
accommodate<00:03:14.070> larger<00:03:14.459> face<00:03:14.670> plates<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.420> I'll

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
accommodate larger face plates and I'll

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.600 
accommodate larger face plates and I'll
explain<00:03:16.020> that<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.440> little<00:03:16.770> bit<00:03:16.950> later<00:03:17.190> but

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
explain that a little bit later but

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.960 
explain that a little bit later but
those<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.269> four<00:03:18.600> on<00:03:18.840> each<00:03:19.500> side

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
those are the four on each side
