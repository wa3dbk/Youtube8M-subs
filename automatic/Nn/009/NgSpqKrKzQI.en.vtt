in<00:01:16.799> middle<00:01:17.070> school<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.759> feel

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
in middle school just because I feel

Middle School usually people don't have

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.289 
Middle School usually people don't have
that<00:01:25.170> bad<00:01:25.680> skin<00:01:26.189> because<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.640> mean<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.149> you're

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
that bad skin because I mean like you're

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.030 
that bad skin because I mean like you're
not<00:01:27.420> getting<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.960> much<00:01:28.140> acne<00:01:28.380> yet<00:01:28.740> that's

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
not getting that much acne yet that's

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
not getting that much acne yet that's

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
usually starting in high school so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.840 
usually starting in high school so
concealer<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> think<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.399> just<00:01:32.430> enough<00:01:32.729> for

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850

concealer I think it's just enough for
middle<00:01:33.090> school<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.479> mean<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.619> anything<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
Rimmel stay matte powder just because I

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.480

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
great for middle school just because you

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.440
