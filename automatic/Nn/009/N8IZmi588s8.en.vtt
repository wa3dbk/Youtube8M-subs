caves we'll call it and it hasn't

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.699 
caves we'll call it and it hasn't
actually<00:02:40.730> been<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.239> bad<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.660> bike<00:02:41.840> oh<00:02:42.140> it

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
actually been that bad of a bike oh it

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.250 
actually been that bad of a bike oh it
started<00:02:43.220> always<00:02:43.670> ran<00:02:43.940> if<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.720> economy<00:02:45.110> is

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
started always ran if the economy is

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.800 
started always ran if the economy is
amazing<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:46.610> takes<00:02:46.880> 8<00:02:47.090> liters<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.569> fuel<00:02:47.690> I

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
amazing it takes 8 liters of fuel I

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.240 
amazing it takes 8 liters of fuel I
think<00:02:47.930> it's<00:02:48.049> like<00:02:48.170> an<00:02:48.230> 8<00:02:48.440> or<00:02:48.470> 9<00:02:48.799> litre<00:02:49.069> fuel

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
think it's like an 8 or 9 litre fuel

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.270 
think it's like an 8 or 9 litre fuel
tank<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.959> I<00:02:51.530> think<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:51.769> only<00:02:51.859> have<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.070> fill<00:02:52.220> up

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
tank and I think I only have to fill up

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.710 
tank and I think I only have to fill up
once<00:02:52.549> a<00:02:52.640> week<00:02:52.820> which<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.120> roughly<00:02:53.329> what<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.630> have

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
once a week which is roughly what I have

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.289 
once a week which is roughly what I have
to<00:02:53.810> do<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.019> my<00:02:54.049> 650<00:02:54.829> and<00:02:55.370> that's<00:02:55.549> like<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.850> 14

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
to do in my 650 and that's like a 14

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.330 
to do in my 650 and that's like a 14
litre<00:02:56.329> tank<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.560> economy<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:58.160> thing

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
litre tank so the economy on this thing

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.400 
litre tank so the economy on this thing
seems<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.940> be<00:02:59.120> better<00:02:59.299> than<00:02:59.510> my

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
seems to be better than my

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.610 
seems to be better than my
GP<00:03:01.120> enough<00:03:02.120> just<00:03:02.390> my<00:03:02.510> brain<00:03:02.750> playing<00:03:03.110> with<00:03:03.290> me

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
GP enough just my brain playing with me

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.190 
GP enough just my brain playing with me
well<00:03:03.950> maybe<00:03:04.100> it's<00:03:04.280> like<00:03:04.460> a<00:03:04.820> mother<00:03:05.060> GP<00:03:05.870> around

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
well maybe it's like a mother GP around

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.720 
well maybe it's like a mother GP around
a<00:03:06.260> little<00:03:06.410> bit<00:03:06.500> more<00:03:06.710> up<00:03:06.800> up<00:03:07.130> sort<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.340> baby

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730

this thing I rarely ever sort of take it
to<00:03:11.390> any<00:03:11.510> sort<00:03:11.780> of<00:03:11.840> limit<00:03:12.170> mostly<00:03:13.070> because<00:03:13.280> I

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
to any sort of limit mostly because I

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.340 
to any sort of limit mostly because I
prefer<00:03:13.520> active<00:03:13.820> breaking<00:03:14.240> it<00:03:14.330> one<00:03:15.110> thing<00:03:15.260> I
