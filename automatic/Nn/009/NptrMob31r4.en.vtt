00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.720
 1 2 or 3 last chance over you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.870
 if you really stand correctly you see 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.219
 the light is really true 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.990
 we still have to answer that answer 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.969
 wait a bit but our name is 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.680
 The question also asks two three or four 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.170
 So we are not quite so sure 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.910
 to the concept get game show because 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.130
 It is the fight of the cylinders 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.039
 less in the fuel savings were actually 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.330
 more 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.619
 Anyway, fiat comes with only two 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.689
 cylinders under the hood for 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.940
 Comparative test very account is the spar 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.370
 extremist among today's candidates 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.950
 The Italian has just 0.9 liters 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.379
 displacement and gets it powerful 95 ps 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.000
 we talk about the acceleration 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.950
 especially since he is very fast in the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.860
 speed limiter runs but the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.200
 topspeed is fine with 172 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.149
 Unfortunately, it did not work out during consumption 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.789
 with the promised 4 2 liters 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.160
 to get along 58 liters is called the reality 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.030
 not exactly one on the street 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.219
 sensation 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.989
 what comes to mind first when you're in 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.180
 the punto with two cylinders takes place 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.460
 the sound when you step on the gas 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.770
 loud now 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.409
 very rough sounds almost a bit like 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.450
 is not really at the trabi 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.100
 nice in the 4 500 could be this and 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.900
 maybe still sell as a cult here 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.670
 In that point you have to say is annoying 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.080
 actually a bit more and that 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.080
 Consumption advantage is not even 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.520
 so big 0 2 liters less he has 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 swallowed as the vw polo with four 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.930
 Cylinders that means this comfort 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.790
 do not really give up but 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.930
 Of course we have the courage of 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.060
 reward Italians 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.800
 first with this elaborate technique 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.030
 have started and it will be 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.860
 probably others will follow 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.429
 Also try with two cylinders of gasoline 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.130
 to save 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.929
 you could weaken the punto, for example, in the 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.970
 Chassis and steering quite forgive 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.740
 if it were not too expensive 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.320
 the italians can be the elaborate 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.789
 Technology in the base with 15,200 euros 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.130
 pay list price 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.750
 not exactly a bargain for it 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.970
 but you get extras like for example 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.950
 a cd radio as standard on the there's 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.100
 at the vw only for extra money 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.259
 the trunk is 275 liters at the 4 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.420
 2 in the smallest but with folded 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.880
 he moves backbank with 1030 liters on 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.920
 poland over 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.260
 the peugeot plays a league higher 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.209
 namely in terms of the number of cylinders 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.090
 three main actors perform in the 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.160
 Engine room promises its work of 208 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.489
 becomes his 12 liter machine one 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.450
 Consumption of only 4 5 liters 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.660
 of course that works in reality 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.310
 but not with 5 to 5 liters 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.310
 at least the best in this 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.310
 Compare his 82 ps bring in the end 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.350
 175 km / h on the road so is he 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.880
 at about the level of fiat far 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.040
 above that he lies with the 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.320
 Interior design comes with the French 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.670
 really joy in the interior here is 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.290
 all a bit playful than at 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.600
 the German and the Italians this 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.239
 small steering wheel that mediates so 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.859
 A little card feeling comes about that 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.010
 peugeot its occupants with the best 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:00.370
 standard equipment spoils cd radio 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.220
 automatic climate control usb connection and even 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.760
 the tempomat everything in the price already with 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.380
 in it 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.670
 the three-cylinder is also right 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.010
 Neat is definitely the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.959
 most economical in the field only one would like to travel 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.820
 this car is not the place here 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.690
 a bit blocked and behind would 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.209
 no way 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.919
 the peugeot not only has a modern one 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.139
 Interior and a fuel efficient engine 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.799
 but he is also the cheapest in 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.720
 this test only 14 1150 euro 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.650
 the french want for their quite 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.329
 have succeeded 208 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.340
 the vw polo makes in this comparison 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.470
 on thick pants or better said 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.329
 thick engine he is the only one with 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.220
 four cylinders and so on 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.290
 still want to save with 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.910
 Direct injection and turbo when breathing 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.709
 Its similarity to gasoline 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.220
 deal like his Italian and 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.900
 French competitor VW promises 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.870
 5.1 liters and of course that works too 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.430
 not the 1 2 liter tsi almost needs 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.680
 a whole liter more if he has the 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.329
 laboratory test bench leaves this is 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.459
 especially on the highway ride the the 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.500
 Small turbo is not necessarily made 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.489
 6 liters are not bad though 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.010
 do it with the other two 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.380
 Test candidate compares the polo's 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.870
 with 90 ps namely a little stronger and 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.680
 with 182 also a bit faster than 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.049
 the competition 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.570
 to accelerate that over two seconds 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.459
 faster to 110 9 seconds are indeed 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.350
 still no revelation but the 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.930
 four-cylinder runs much silky than 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.550
 if the rough engines of competition 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.680
 one takes in the vw polo place then has 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.910
 that's about the charm of one 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.070
 dentist chair she is all very clean 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.050
 very straight german 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.970
 But the joy comes up while driving 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.470
 The four-cylinder runs much quieter 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.210
 as the three and two cylinders of the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.350
 competition he does not consume 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.060
 more appreciably more 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.770
 and that's where the steering is 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.630
 Direct is still a good one 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.669
 Feedback provides the circuit is 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.050
 crisp with short sides and that 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.320
 Suspension is with distance that 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.250
 most comfortable as well as the seats so 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.250
 you want to travel 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.199
 the weak side of the vbs is the price 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.630
 he is significantly more expensive than that 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:06.039
 competitors and even lean 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.139
 equipped 16,000 685 euro costs one 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.569
 comparable polo and is with it 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.300
 two and a half thousand euros more expensive than that 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.280
 peugeot, for example, for the conclusion 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.780
 I put on safety clothes 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.270
 because we come to the award ceremony 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.669
 space three lands of fiat punto to be 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.800
 motors just too rough and then on 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.630
 Do not end up sparing enough 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.690
 make that the peugeot he lands 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.280
 second place he has a very good 13 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.680
 under the hood also the most economical 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.009
 is and he offers the most car for 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.330
 money 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.880
 He has the most extras as standard 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.669
 and is worthy of the prize winner 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.199
 the winner in the overall comparison is 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.199
 the vw polo 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.199
 yes I know a vw but we 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.479
 stand by 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.460
 he is the best car in this field and 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.020
 if you control the resale 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.729
 Insurance and maintenance with 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.340
 calculated he can even cost 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.169
 chapter yet to catch up with the others 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.940
 polo wins because he is the most mature 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.440
 car is the engine despite the 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.720
 four cylinders only slightly more 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.060
 consumed and he is the only one in the field 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.199
 is and you still comfortably longer 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.199
 stretch can cover
