sir<00:00:22.020> risk<00:00:22.350> going<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:23.430> just

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
sir risk going to it so what I'm just

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.060 
sir risk going to it so what I'm just
gonna<00:00:23.640> go<00:00:23.760> ahead<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.000> do<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.769> branch<00:00:25.769> off<00:00:26.039> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
gonna go ahead and do is branch off of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.630 
gonna go ahead and do is branch off of
that<00:00:26.369> go<00:00:27.300> over<00:00:27.570> here<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.250> since<00:00:29.250> pretty<00:00:29.490> much

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
that go over here and since pretty much

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.970 
that go over here and since pretty much
everything<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.510> right<00:00:30.869> centered<00:00:31.410> around<00:00:31.529> this

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
everything is right centered around this

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.560 
everything is right centered around this
section<00:00:32.309> I'm<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:32.850> gonna<00:00:32.940> go<00:00:33.090> ahead<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.420> put

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
section I'm just gonna go ahead and put

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.389 
section I'm just gonna go ahead and put
that<00:00:33.600> little<00:00:34.050> sub<00:00:34.230> panel<00:00:34.620> right<00:00:35.579> there<00:00:37.399> that

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
that little sub panel right there that

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.010 
that little sub panel right there that
way<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.120> ahead<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.329> she'll

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
way I can just go ahead and she'll

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.160 
way I can just go ahead and she'll
probably<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.379> direct<00:00:41.010> wire<00:00:41.360> my<00:00:42.360> big<00:00:42.600> shaper

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
probably just direct wire my big shaper

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.110 
probably just direct wire my big shaper
here<00:00:44.090> my<00:00:45.090> smaller<00:00:45.660> shaper<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.789> I'll<00:00:48.000> go

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
here my smaller shaper and this I'll go

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.959 
here my smaller shaper and this I'll go
ahead<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.360> put<00:00:48.570> an<00:00:48.629> outlet<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.140> my<00:00:49.289> molder

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
ahead and put an outlet for my molder

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.869 
ahead and put an outlet for my molder
and<00:00:50.969> then<00:00:51.149> I'll<00:00:51.270> probably<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.780> run<00:00:51.989> another

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
and then I'll probably just run another

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.900 
and then I'll probably just run another
over<00:00:53.930> for<00:00:54.930> these<00:00:55.050> two<00:00:55.289> here<00:00:55.530> I'm<00:00:56.340> pretty<00:00:56.640> sure

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
over for these two here I'm pretty sure

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.910 
over for these two here I'm pretty sure
this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.180> where<00:00:57.449> everything's<00:00:57.989> gonna<00:00:58.230> reside

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
this is where everything's gonna reside

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.910 
this is where everything's gonna reside
for<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> little<00:00:59.430> bit<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.989> I'm<00:01:00.989> kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.320> doing<00:01:01.620> it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
for a little bit so I'm kind of doing it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.100 
for a little bit so I'm kind of doing it
with<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> sub<00:01:02.340> panel<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.149> where<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.780> don't

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
with a sub panel like that where I don't

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.760 
with a sub panel like that where I don't
have<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.379> run<00:01:04.820> all<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.180> copper<00:01:06.930> out<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.619> there

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
have to run all that copper out of there

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.969 
have to run all that copper out of there
I<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:08.130> one<00:01:08.790> big<00:01:09.500> extension<00:01:10.500> cord<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
I have one big extension cord that I

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.730 
I have one big extension cord that I
think<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.369> four<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.750> four<00:01:13.020> if<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.409> remember

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
think is four for four if I remember

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.580 
think is four for four if I remember
right<00:01:14.810> which<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.960> think<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.320> should<00:01:16.500> be

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
right which I think that should be

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.149 
right which I think that should be

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
another line 20 amp line over here from

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.490 
another line 20 amp line over here from
my<00:01:57.960> desk<00:01:58.200> collector<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.920> then<00:01:59.430> I<00:02:00.500> think

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
my desk collector and then I think

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.530 
my desk collector and then I think
that's<00:02:01.649> about<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.070> I'm<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.880> gonna<00:02:03.000> run<00:02:03.270> one

that's about it I'm just gonna run one
30<00:02:04.409> amp<00:02:04.649> over<00:02:05.219> here<00:02:05.579> from<00:02:05.909> my<00:02:06.030> table<00:02:06.240> saw<00:02:06.600> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
30 amp over here from my table saw and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.400 
30 amp over here from my table saw and
the<00:02:07.439> bandsaw<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.489> then<00:02:09.149> oh<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.929> guess<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.289> need

sort of my plan here is still to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.850 
sort of my plan here is still to
actually<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> don't<00:02:34.350> think<00:02:34.470> I've<00:02:34.680> mentioned

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
actually I don't think I've mentioned

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.640 
actually I don't think I've mentioned
that<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.190> video<00:02:35.280> here<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.810> tack<00:02:37.050> room<00:02:37.080> here

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
that in a video here the tack room here

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.410 
that in a video here the tack room here
I<00:02:37.770> was<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:38.250> gonna<00:02:38.520> go<00:02:38.730> ahead<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.120> knock<00:02:39.240> this

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
I was just gonna go ahead and knock this

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.170 
I was just gonna go ahead and knock this
wall<00:02:39.630> out<00:02:39.690> because<00:02:40.080> it's<00:02:40.260> not<00:02:40.320> exactly<00:02:41.180> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
wall out because it's not exactly the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.640 
wall out because it's not exactly the
greatest<00:02:43.670> construction<00:02:45.110> but<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.140> might<00:02:46.440> just

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
greatest construction but I might just

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.880 
greatest construction but I might just
go<00:02:46.800> ahead<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.130> leave<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:48.650> kind<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.710> there

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
go ahead and leave it just kind of there

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.710 
go ahead and leave it just kind of there
and<00:02:50.190> then<00:02:50.310> box<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.730> in<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:51.030> here<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.390> use<00:02:51.510> this

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
and then box it in in here and use this

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.250 
and then box it in in here and use this
as<00:02:51.960> my<00:02:52.200> paint<00:02:52.560> room<00:02:52.800> or<00:02:53.340> paint<00:02:53.550> booth

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
as my paint room or paint booth

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.320 
as my paint room or paint booth
I<00:02:55.320> haven't<00:02:56.040> exactly<00:02:56.220> decided<00:02:56.610> yet<00:02:57.060> but<00:02:57.090> I'm

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
I haven't exactly decided yet but I'm

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.550 
I haven't exactly decided yet but I'm
kind<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.540> thinking<00:02:57.690> that's<00:02:57.990> what<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.200> might<00:02:58.440> do

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
kind of thinking that's what I might do

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.760 
kind of thinking that's what I might do
since<00:02:58.800> it's<00:02:58.950> already<00:02:59.220> here<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.770> yeah

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
since it's already here and yeah

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.470 
since it's already here and yeah
something<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.460> don't<00:03:02.610> have<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.850> won't<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.270> to

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
something I don't have to won't have to

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.580 
something I don't have to won't have to
tear<00:03:03.930> out<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.910> kind<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.240> leaves<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:06.630> you

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
tear out and kind of leaves this you

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.620 
tear out and kind of leaves this you
know<00:03:07.680> reasonably<00:03:08.130> close<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> tack<00:03:09.330> room

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
know reasonably close as a tack room

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.480 
know reasonably close as a tack room
here<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.020> case<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.320> ever<00:03:10.470> decide<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:10.860> want<00:03:11.280> an

then all this walnut over here also is

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.470 
then all this walnut over here also is
probably<00:03:32.010> gonna<00:03:32.160> go<00:03:32.370> lease<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.060> stuff<00:03:33.270> that's

have 16 foot on either side of you know
of<00:04:08.310> all<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.610> big<00:04:08.760> tools<00:04:08.970> out<00:04:09.240> here<00:04:09.270> which<00:04:09.870> is

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
of all the big tools out here which is

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.760 
of all the big tools out here which is
kind<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.290> nice<00:04:11.840> so<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:12.870> can<00:04:13.050> run<00:04:13.200> 16<00:04:13.590> foot

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
kind of nice so I can run 16 foot

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.800 
kind of nice so I can run 16 foot
molding<00:04:14.190> cuz<00:04:14.880> that<00:04:15.030> was<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.330> problem<00:04:15.570> my

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
molding cuz that was the problem my

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.449 
molding cuz that was the problem my
other<00:04:15.959> shop<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.410> just<00:04:16.620> did<00:04:16.770> not<00:04:16.799> have<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.100> room

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
other shop I just did not have the room

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.760 
other shop I just did not have the room
for<00:04:17.700> that<00:04:17.790> so<00:04:18.120> I'm<00:04:18.780> pretty<00:04:18.989> stoked<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.500> guess<00:04:19.650> I

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
for that so I'm pretty stoked I guess I

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.289 
for that so I'm pretty stoked I guess I
might<00:04:19.919> need<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.220> move<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:20.520> one<00:04:20.730> over<00:04:20.760> just<00:04:21.180> a

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
might need to move this one over just a

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.930 
might need to move this one over just a
tad<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.810> can<00:04:21.989> have<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.290> full<00:04:22.440> 16

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
tad so I can have the full 16

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.410 
tad so I can have the full 16
foot<00:04:23.090> and<00:04:23.120> then<00:04:23.300> this<00:04:23.480> post<00:04:24.460> here<00:04:25.460> doesn't<00:04:26.360> do

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
foot and then this post here doesn't do

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.910 
foot and then this post here doesn't do
anything<00:04:26.750> that<00:04:26.960> was<00:04:27.080> just<00:04:27.230> in<00:04:27.380> there<00:04:27.560> for

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
anything that was just in there for

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.460 
anything that was just in there for
convenience<00:04:28.550> of<00:04:28.640> gates<00:04:29.050> I'm<00:04:30.050> gonna<00:04:30.230> go<00:04:30.350> ahead

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
convenience of gates I'm gonna go ahead

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.700 
convenience of gates I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:04:30.560> knock<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:31.010> out<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.400> then<00:04:31.550> this<00:04:32.710> slab

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
and knock that out and then this slab

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.340 
and knock that out and then this slab
down<00:04:34.010> here<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.550> raised<00:04:35.360> part<00:04:35.630> of<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.810> slab<00:04:36.050> as

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
down here a raised part of the slab as

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.720 
down here a raised part of the slab as
you<00:04:36.530> can<00:04:36.650> see<00:04:36.800> well<00:04:37.190> you<00:04:37.310> might<00:04:37.460> not<00:04:37.550> know

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
you can see well you might not know

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.840 
you can see well you might not know
there's<00:04:37.970> they<00:04:38.660> had<00:04:38.840> a<00:04:38.870> heated<00:04:39.860> water<00:04:40.100> for<00:04:40.790> the

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
there's they had a heated water for the

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.940 
there's they had a heated water for the
horses<00:04:40.940> in<00:04:41.300> here<00:04:41.540> that<00:04:42.320> none<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.530> this<00:04:42.710> stuff

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
horses in here that none of this stuff

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.530 
horses in here that none of this stuff
works<00:04:43.190> anymore<00:04:43.670> so<00:04:43.910> I'm<00:04:44.000> just<00:04:44.090> gonna<00:04:44.210> go<00:04:44.390> ahead

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
works anymore so I'm just gonna go ahead

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.960 
works anymore so I'm just gonna go ahead
and<00:04:44.690> probably<00:04:45.470> jackhammer<00:04:46.040> that<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.670> then<00:04:46.850> go

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
and probably jackhammer that and then go

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.970 
and probably jackhammer that and then go
ahead<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.300> just<00:04:47.420> concrete<00:04:47.780> it<00:04:47.960> flush<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.590> the

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
ahead and just concrete it flush and the

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.130 
ahead and just concrete it flush and the
same<00:04:49.190> goes<00:04:50.180> for<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.540> one<00:04:50.720> on<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:50.900> other<00:04:51.020> side

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
same goes for the one on the other side

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.770 
same goes for the one on the other side
actually<00:04:51.620> they've<00:04:51.860> already<00:04:52.040> had<00:04:52.400> to<00:04:52.780> looks

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
actually they've already had to looks

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.100 
actually they've already had to looks
like<00:04:53.840> jackhammer<00:04:54.500> a<00:04:55.070> whole<00:04:55.640> lot<00:04:55.880> of<00:04:56.000> that<00:04:56.150> to

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
like jackhammer a whole lot of that to

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.540 
like jackhammer a whole lot of that to
fix<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:57.500> water<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:58.010> they<00:04:58.130> just<00:04:58.280> put<00:04:58.400> in<00:04:58.490> a

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
fix the water and they just put in a

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.490 
fix the water and they just put in a
regular<00:04:58.700> hydrant<00:04:59.270> so<00:04:59.330> this<00:04:59.630> this<00:05:00.140> stuff<00:05:00.350> is

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
regular hydrant so this this stuff is

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.890 
regular hydrant so this this stuff is
gonna<00:05:00.680> go<00:05:00.920> and<00:05:01.340> I'll<00:05:02.180> just<00:05:02.210> go<00:05:02.450> ahead<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.750> you

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
gonna go and I'll just go ahead and you

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.460 
gonna go and I'll just go ahead and you
know<00:05:02.930> concrete<00:05:03.230> it<00:05:03.850> over<00:05:04.990> what<00:05:05.990> I'm<00:05:06.110> thinking

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
know concrete it over what I'm thinking

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.280 
know concrete it over what I'm thinking
here<00:05:06.680> is<00:05:06.950> probably<00:05:07.310> this<00:05:07.880> space<00:05:08.690> will<00:05:08.990> be<00:05:09.110> my

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
here is probably this space will be my

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.610 
here is probably this space will be my
assembly<00:05:09.800> area<00:05:10.930> and<00:05:11.930> then<00:05:12.140> this<00:05:12.470> will

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
assembly area and then this will

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.750 
assembly area and then this will
probably<00:05:12.800> just<00:05:13.040> end<00:05:13.160> up<00:05:13.310> being<00:05:13.490> lumber

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
probably just end up being lumber

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.400 
probably just end up being lumber
storage<00:05:14.030> over<00:05:14.300> here<00:05:14.330> I'm<00:05:14.630> thinking<00:05:14.720> this<00:05:15.170> is

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
storage over here I'm thinking this is

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.160 
storage over here I'm thinking this is
about<00:05:15.910> where<00:05:16.910> my<00:05:17.120> table-saw<00:05:17.510> is<00:05:17.810> gonna<00:05:17.990> go

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
about where my table-saw is gonna go

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.750 
about where my table-saw is gonna go
just<00:05:18.530> maybe<00:05:18.710> scoot<00:05:19.130> it<00:05:19.250> down<00:05:19.280> a<00:05:19.400> little<00:05:19.640> bit

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
just maybe scoot it down a little bit

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.330 
just maybe scoot it down a little bit
that<00:05:20.000> way<00:05:20.440> and<00:05:21.440> this<00:05:21.680> will<00:05:21.830> all<00:05:21.950> end<00:05:22.160> up<00:05:22.280> being

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
that way and this will all end up being

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.270 
that way and this will all end up being
open<00:05:22.820> back<00:05:23.030> here<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.690> I'll<00:05:23.810> go<00:05:23.960> ahead<00:05:24.020> and

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
open back here and I'll go ahead and

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.610 
open back here and I'll go ahead and
attach<00:05:25.280> my<00:05:25.310> Excalibur<00:05:25.940> slider<00:05:26.540> onto<00:05:27.500> this

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
attach my Excalibur slider onto this

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.000 
attach my Excalibur slider onto this
side<00:05:27.970> and<00:05:28.970> that<00:05:29.210> also<00:05:29.450> gives<00:05:29.690> me<00:05:29.840> 16<00:05:30.320> foot<00:05:30.620> on

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
side and that also gives me 16 foot on

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.770 
side and that also gives me 16 foot on
either<00:05:31.040> side<00:05:32.800> too<00:05:33.830> you<00:05:34.100> know<00:05:34.190> to<00:05:34.250> be<00:05:34.370> able<00:05:34.550> to

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
either side too you know to be able to

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.120 
either side too you know to be able to
yeah<00:05:35.780> have<00:05:35.990> everything<00:05:36.350> where<00:05:36.500> I<00:05:36.530> can<00:05:36.650> do<00:05:36.740> 16

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
yeah have everything where I can do 16

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.790 
yeah have everything where I can do 16
foot<00:05:37.340> material<00:05:37.760> so<00:05:38.030> anyway<00:05:38.419> I'm<00:05:39.380> pretty

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
foot material so anyway I'm pretty

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.530 
foot material so anyway I'm pretty
stoked<00:05:40.310> with<00:05:40.669> the<00:05:40.790> way<00:05:40.880> this<00:05:41.060> is<00:05:41.180> coming<00:05:41.450> along

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
stoked with the way this is coming along

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.300 
stoked with the way this is coming along
here<00:05:41.900> I'm<00:05:42.169> hoping<00:05:42.320> another<00:05:42.770> couple<00:05:43.160> hours

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
here I'm hoping another couple hours

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.950 
here I'm hoping another couple hours
I'll<00:05:43.760> actually<00:05:43.940> be<00:05:44.240> able<00:05:44.360> to<00:05:44.480> turn<00:05:44.660> some<00:05:44.930> of

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
I'll actually be able to turn some of

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.600 
I'll actually be able to turn some of
these<00:05:45.110> bad<00:05:45.350> boys<00:05:45.530> on<00:05:45.800> because<00:05:46.100> I<00:05:46.190> haven't<00:05:46.490> had
