imagine<00:00:00.960> that<00:00:01.079> you<00:00:01.199> have<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.469> laser<00:00:01.949> beam

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
imagine that you have a laser beam

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.049 
imagine that you have a laser beam
sticking<00:00:03.179> out<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.419> your<00:00:03.449> navel<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:07.820> this<00:00:08.820> beam

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
sticking out of your navel and this beam

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.530 
sticking out of your navel and this beam
as<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.360> splitter<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.620> splits<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.759> wall

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
as a splitter so that it splits a a wall

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.760 
as a splitter so that it splits a a wall
of<00:00:12.870> laser<00:00:13.110> light<00:00:13.440> if<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.460> don't<00:00:14.639> make<00:00:14.759> thin<00:00:15.770> if

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
of laser light if I don't make thin if

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.349 
of laser light if I don't make thin if
you<00:00:16.890> penetrate<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.490> light<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.940> rigged<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.270> up

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
you penetrate the light we rigged it up

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.620 
you penetrate the light we rigged it up
so<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.660> alarm<00:00:19.080> goes<00:00:19.380> off<00:00:20.090> and<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.080> tell<00:00:22.410> you

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
so that alarm goes off and so I tell you

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.800 
so that alarm goes off and so I tell you
you<00:00:24.630> cannot<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.230> rule<00:00:25.380> as<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.680> cannot<00:00:26.039> move

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
you cannot the rule as you cannot move

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.570 
you cannot the rule as you cannot move
your<00:00:27.810> hand<00:00:28.170> across<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.890> midline<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.340> your

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
your hand across the midline of your

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.220 
your hand across the midline of your
body<00:00:30.769> and<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.510> laser<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.140> our

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
body and so we have this laser and our

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.420 
body and so we have this laser and our
naval<00:00:35.149> it's<00:00:36.149> putting<00:00:36.510> out<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> laser<00:00:37.110> light

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
naval it's putting out a laser light

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.910 
naval it's putting out a laser light
light<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.550> split<00:00:38.910> into<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.649> blackboard<00:00:40.649> like

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
light is split into this blackboard like

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.369 
light is split into this blackboard like
thing<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.460> laser<00:00:42.000> light<00:00:43.100> it's<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> sheet<00:00:45.379> if

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
thing a laser light it's like a sheet if

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
thing a laser light it's like a sheet if
you<00:00:46.500> pass<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.340> bell<00:00:47.520> goes<00:00:47.550> off<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
you pass it the bell goes off now the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.880 
you pass it the bell goes off now the
belt<00:00:48.510> doesn't<00:00:48.690> go<00:00:48.870> off<00:00:49.079> you're<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> rigged<00:00:49.680> so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
belt doesn't go off you're a rigged so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.790 
belt doesn't go off you're a rigged so
that<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.250> 10,000<00:00:50.910> volts<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.800> electricity

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
that you get 10,000 volts of electricity

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.700 
that you get 10,000 volts of electricity
you<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.699> joltin<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> ask<00:00:56.640> you

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you get joltin so I ask you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.030 
you get joltin so I ask you
suppose<00:00:59.710> I<00:00:59.920> have<00:01:00.070> only<00:01:00.250> a<00:01:00.610> wall<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.860> walls

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
suppose I have only a wall and the walls

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.370 
suppose I have only a wall and the walls
against<00:01:03.520> my<00:01:03.640> left<00:01:03.879> leg<00:01:05.130> can<00:01:06.130> I<00:01:07.050> touch<00:01:08.050> my

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
against my left leg can I touch my

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.170 
against my left leg can I touch my
finger<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:08.950> wall<00:01:09.250> without<00:01:09.460> violating

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
finger to the wall without violating

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.320 
finger to the wall without violating
this<00:01:10.420> rule<00:01:12.150> yes<00:01:13.150> how<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:15.040> say<00:01:15.280> but<00:01:16.150> let's

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
this rule yes how you say but let's

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.230 
this rule yes how you say but let's
pretend<00:01:16.420> this<00:01:16.720> is<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:16.960> laser<00:01:17.259> light<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:18.240> do

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
pretend this is the laser light I do

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.320 
pretend this is the laser light I do
this

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.340 

i<00:01:23.390> touched<00:01:24.170> i<00:01:24.440> touch<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.920> wall<00:01:26.110> because<00:01:27.110> i

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
i touched i touch the wall because i

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.830 
i touched i touch the wall because i
have<00:01:27.710> rotated<00:01:28.310> my<00:01:28.340> torso

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.819 

so<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.710> realigned<00:01:32.460> where<00:01:33.090> my<00:01:33.299> setter

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
so I have realigned where my setter

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:44.710 
so I have realigned where my setter
sticks<00:01:34.829> out<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.310> see<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:36.960> i<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.109> this

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:59.030 

I'm<00:01:45.230> never<00:01:45.530> passing<00:01:46.010> my<00:01:46.130> century

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.740 

now<00:02:00.040> that<00:02:00.250> isn't<00:02:00.490> exactly<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:01.000> rule<00:02:01.299> but<00:02:01.570> that

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
now that isn't exactly the rule but that

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.800 
now that isn't exactly the rule but that
is<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.990> idea<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:03.820> you<00:02:03.970> want<00:02:04.180> to<00:02:04.420> have

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
is the idea that if you want to have

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:22.910 
is the idea that if you want to have
movement<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.590> originates<00:02:06.159> here<00:02:07.410> your<00:02:08.410> Center

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.940 

it<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.130> October<00:02:24.730> at<00:02:24.820> 29<00:02:25.500> 2006<00:02:26.500> i<00:02:26.620> made<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.830> video

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
it is October at 29 2006 i made a video

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.620 
it is October at 29 2006 i made a video
yesterday<00:02:27.250> talking<00:02:27.700> about<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:27.970> laser<00:02:28.240> out<00:02:28.540> of

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
yesterday talking about a laser out of

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.830 
yesterday talking about a laser out of
the<00:02:28.720> navel<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.520> i<00:02:30.520> noticed<00:02:30.880> just<00:02:31.090> now<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.360> my

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
the navel and i noticed just now that my

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.510 
the navel and i noticed just now that my
settings<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.410> my<00:02:32.470> camera<00:02:32.740> were<00:02:32.980> wrong<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.430> I'm

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
settings of my camera were wrong so I'm

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.750 
settings of my camera were wrong so I'm
going<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.730> repeat<00:02:33.970> myself<00:02:34.180> quickly<00:02:35.760> pretend

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
going to repeat myself quickly pretend

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.090 
going to repeat myself quickly pretend
like<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.120> have<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.360> laser<00:02:38.290> sticking<00:02:38.860> out<00:02:38.980> of

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
like you have a laser sticking out of

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.160 
like you have a laser sticking out of
your<00:02:39.130> navel<00:02:41.040> now<00:02:42.040> it's<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.370> laser<00:02:42.580> beam<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
your navel now it's a laser beam the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.590 
your navel now it's a laser beam the
beam<00:02:44.350> has<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.620> splitter<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.940> splits<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.360> beam

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
beam has a splitter that splits the beam

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.740 
beam has a splitter that splits the beam
into<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:46.960> chic<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.910> cuts<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.270> midline<00:02:49.720> of

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
into a chic and it cuts the midline of

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.840 
into a chic and it cuts the midline of
your<00:02:49.960> body<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:52.150> have<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.420> wall<00:02:52.900> here<00:02:53.290> and

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
your body and you have a wall here and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.930 
your body and you have a wall here and
you<00:02:54.850> want<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.770> touch<00:02:56.770> your<00:02:57.160> right<00:02:57.220> finger<00:02:57.790> do

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
you want to touch your right finger do

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.190 
you want to touch your right finger do
the<00:02:58.090> wall<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.860> question<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.780> do<00:03:02.020> that

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
the wall the question is can you do that

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.750 
the wall the question is can you do that
if<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.560> have<00:03:02.710> a<00:03:02.740> rule<00:03:03.070> that<00:03:03.100> says<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:03.610> can't

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
if you have a rule that says you can't

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.930 
if you have a rule that says you can't
cross<00:03:04.630> your<00:03:05.080> hand<00:03:05.410> beyond<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.550> midline<00:03:06.910> of

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
cross your hand beyond the midline of

you turn the torso and that's a whole

you turn the torso and that's a whole
