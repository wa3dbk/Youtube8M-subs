00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
want to browse for the three point one

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.020 
want to browse for the three point one
point<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> loophole<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
point to this is a loophole that to the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.729 
point to this is a loophole that to the
dev<00:00:57.180> team<00:00:57.390> figured<00:00:57.899> out<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.289> released<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
dev team figured out and they released a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.740 
dev team figured out and they released a
special<00:00:58.890> version<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.699> redsnow<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> allow<00:01:00.690> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
special version of redsnow to allow you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.500 
special version of redsnow to allow you
to<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:02.160> select<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.910> three<00:01:03.270> point

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to do this you select the three point

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.210 
to do this you select the three point
one<00:01:03.539> point<00:01:03.660> two<00:01:04.080> but<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> works<00:01:04.799> for<00:01:04.890> three

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
one point two but it works for three

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.920 
one point two but it works for three
point<00:01:05.400> one<00:01:05.489> point<00:01:05.610> three<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.750> you're<00:01:06.869> just

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
point one point three so you're just

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.390 
point one point three so you're just
going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> click<00:01:07.350> open<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:10.100> now<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.250> going

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
going to click open and now it's going

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.820 
going to click open and now it's going
to<00:01:11.520> process<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> firmware<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.720> I've<00:01:13.650> only

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
to process the firmware and I've only

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.770 
to process the firmware and I've only
found<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.310> certain<00:01:14.520> firmwares<00:01:15.180> work<00:01:15.479> like

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
found that certain firmwares work like

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.840 
found that certain firmwares work like
certain<00:01:16.110> ones<00:01:16.320> won't<00:01:16.560> work<00:01:16.770> certain<00:01:17.400> copies

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
certain ones won't work certain copies

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.460 
certain ones won't work certain copies
and<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.270> i'll<00:01:18.360> post<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.720> link<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
and so i'll post a link to the one that

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.850 
and so i'll post a link to the one that
i<00:01:19.500> used<00:01:21.470> is<00:01:23.270> this<00:01:24.270> an<00:01:24.420> MC<00:01:24.840> model<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.290> ipod<00:01:25.590> touch

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
i used is this an MC model of ipod touch

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.160 
i used is this an MC model of ipod touch
2g<00:01:26.130> no<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.860> okay<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.490> next

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
2g no it's not okay now we do next

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.960 
2g no it's not okay now we do next
connecting<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> server<00:01:31.470> now<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.979> doing<00:01:32.790> all

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
connecting the server now it's doing all

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.149 
connecting the server now it's doing all
its<00:01:33.710> wonderful<00:01:34.710> stuff<00:01:36.680> now<00:01:37.680> we're<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
its wonderful stuff now we're going to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.530 
its wonderful stuff now we're going to
install<00:01:39.150> cydia<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.579> now<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.180> turn

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
install cydia and now we have to turn

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.380 
install cydia and now we have to turn
the<00:01:42.840> ida<00:01:43.710> bags<00:01:44.070> off<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.790> make<00:01:45.060> sure<00:01:45.270> it's

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the ida bags off and make sure it's

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.940 
the ida bags off and make sure it's
plugged<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.439> plug<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.860> in

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
plugged in but you have to plug it in

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.260 
plugged in but you have to plug it in
before<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.250> turn<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.549> off<00:01:47.640> because<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:48.180> you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
before you turn it off because if you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.730 
before you turn it off because if you
turn<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.540> off<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:48.840> plug<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.470> comes

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
turn it off and then plug it in it comes

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.719 
turn it off and then plug it in it comes
