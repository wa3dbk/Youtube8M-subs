but you're best off just getting to the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.250 
but you're best off just getting to the
top<00:03:33.919> level<00:03:34.129> of<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.430> missiles<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.840> trying<00:03:36.169> to

top level of the missiles and trying to

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.600 
top level of the missiles and trying to
take<00:03:36.439> them<00:03:36.680> out<00:03:36.799> before<00:03:37.010> issues

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
take them out before issues

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.010 
take them out before issues
so<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:39.700> see<00:03:39.880> as<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.209> see<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.690> wasn't<00:03:40.989> that

cycloning thing but all you got to do is

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.130 
cycloning thing but all you got to do is
just<00:03:55.000> walk<00:03:55.120> left<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:55.540> right<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:55.870> then<00:03:55.989> it'll

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
just walk left and right and then it'll

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.500 
just walk left and right and then it'll
probably<00:03:56.349> be<00:03:56.620> off<00:03:56.709> track<00:03:56.920> at<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:57.910> second<00:03:58.300> was

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
probably be off track at the second was

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.320 
probably be off track at the second was
that<00:03:58.690> huge<00:03:58.989> lightning<00:03:59.349> strike<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.800> saw<00:04:00.330> each

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
that huge lightning strike you saw each

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.050 
that huge lightning strike you saw each
time<00:04:01.870> he<00:04:02.080> comes<00:04:02.290> down<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.709> activate<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.400> yeah

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
time he comes down to activate it yeah

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.479 
time he comes down to activate it yeah
either<00:04:04.410> start<00:04:05.410> from<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.620> right<00:04:05.769> or<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.340> left

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
either start from the right or the left

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.970 
either start from the right or the left
and<00:04:06.760> he<00:04:06.819> will<00:04:06.910> do<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.030> alternatively<00:04:07.660> so<00:04:08.440> time

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
and he will do it alternatively so time

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.009 
and he will do it alternatively so time
shots<00:04:09.280> accordingly<00:04:09.730> like<00:04:10.030> Leon<00:04:10.630> you<00:04:10.750> can<00:04:10.900> do

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
shots accordingly like Leon you can do

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.990 
shots accordingly like Leon you can do
extra<00:04:11.380> damage<00:04:11.410> because<00:04:11.920> it's<00:04:11.950> from<00:04:12.580> far<00:04:12.790> away

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
extra damage because it's from far away

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.630 
extra damage because it's from far away
and<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.959> third<00:04:14.170> attack<00:04:14.470> is<00:04:14.739> that<00:04:14.799> little<00:04:15.430> gray

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
and the third attack is that little gray

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.819 
and the third attack is that little gray
caption<00:04:16.060> thing<00:04:16.269> that's<00:04:16.479> following<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:17.079> now

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
caption thing that's following you now

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.530 
caption thing that's following you now
that'll<00:04:18.220> come<00:04:18.340> out<00:04:18.430> at<00:04:18.579> two<00:04:18.790> parts<00:04:19.239> either

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
that'll come out at two parts either

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.840 
that'll come out at two parts either
just<00:04:20.350> before<00:04:20.739> he's<00:04:20.950> gonna<00:04:21.100> do<00:04:21.310> lightning

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
just before he's gonna do lightning

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.390 
just before he's gonna do lightning
which<00:04:22.750> you've<00:04:23.050> got<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:23.560> make<00:04:23.710> sure<00:04:23.919> you

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
which you've got to make sure you

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.300 
which you've got to make sure you
destroy<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:24.880> capsule<00:04:25.300> for<00:04:25.720> them<00:04:26.160> or<00:04:27.160> the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
destroy the capsule for them or the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.640 
destroy the capsule for them or the
second<00:04:27.729> part<00:04:27.940> would<00:04:28.120> be<00:04:28.180> as<00:04:28.570> ease<00:04:29.020> of<00:04:29.380> firing

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
second part would be as ease of firing

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.070 
second part would be as ease of firing
that<00:04:29.950> green<00:04:30.190> cyclone<00:04:30.700> for<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:30.940> first<00:04:31.150> time<00:04:31.450> so

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
that green cyclone for the first time so

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.650 
that green cyclone for the first time so
make<00:04:32.380> sure<00:04:32.590> after<00:04:32.860> every<00:04:33.250> yarding<00:04:33.610> strike<00:04:33.970> you

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
make sure after every yarding strike you

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.180 
make sure after every yarding strike you
go<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.050> left<00:04:35.169> side<00:04:35.410> of<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.650> screen<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.100> if

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
go to the left side of the screen and if

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.370 
go to the left side of the screen and if
you<00:04:36.220> see<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.580> capsule<00:04:36.970> come<00:04:37.180> towards<00:04:37.660> you<00:04:37.780> do

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
you see the capsule come towards you do

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.409 
you see the capsule come towards you do
a<00:04:38.410> jump<00:04:38.710> because<00:04:39.400> then<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:39.940> capture<00:04:40.240> will

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
a jump because then the capture will

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.840 
a jump because then the capture will
take<00:04:40.840> you<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:42.130> green<00:04:42.340> shot<00:04:42.580> would<00:04:42.700> be<00:04:42.729> fired

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
take you the green shot would be fired

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.240 
take you the green shot would be fired
and<00:04:43.419> hopefully<00:04:44.410> you'd<00:04:44.530> have<00:04:44.650> shot<00:04:44.919> enough

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
and hopefully you'd have shot enough

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.159 
and hopefully you'd have shot enough
time<00:04:45.520> so<00:04:45.850> you<00:04:45.910> just<00:04:46.229> watch<00:04:47.229> this

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
time so you just watch this

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.350 
time so you just watch this
well<00:04:48.949> it<00:04:49.370> didn't<00:04:49.580> quite<00:04:49.669> happen<00:04:49.999> the<00:04:50.240> way<00:04:50.330> I

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
well it didn't quite happen the way I

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.300 
well it didn't quite happen the way I
wanted<00:04:50.779> but<00:04:51.080> as<00:04:51.319> you<00:04:51.469> saw<00:04:51.620> a<00:04:51.650> green<00:04:51.919> cyclone

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
wanted but as you saw a green cyclone

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.709 
wanted but as you saw a green cyclone
was<00:04:52.430> taken<00:04:52.699> off<00:04:52.789> check<00:04:53.060> and<00:04:53.270> you<00:04:53.330> just<00:04:53.509> got<00:04:53.689> a

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:53.719 
was taken off check and you just got a

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:55.959 
was taken off check and you just got a
shoot<00:04:53.990> we<00:04:54.080> captured<00:04:54.469> about<00:04:54.650> six<00:04:54.949> sides<00:04:55.219> the

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 
shoot we captured about six sides the

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:57.580 
shoot we captured about six sides the
capsule<00:04:56.300> itself<00:04:56.479> doesn't<00:04:56.719> actually<00:04:56.900> hurt<00:04:57.379> to

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
capsule itself doesn't actually hurt to

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.890 
capsule itself doesn't actually hurt to
you<00:04:57.710> so<00:04:58.009> don't<00:04:58.580> think<00:04:58.939> it's<00:04:59.090> going<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.300> whoops

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
you so don't think it's going to whoops

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.439 
you so don't think it's going to whoops
that's<00:05:00.710> me<00:05:00.979> losing<00:05:01.430> track<00:05:01.819> of<00:05:01.849> the<00:05:02.060> Lightning

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
that's me losing track of the Lightning

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.589 
that's me losing track of the Lightning
again<00:05:03.289> I<00:05:03.499> do<00:05:03.919> say<00:05:04.099> it<00:05:04.249> all<00:05:04.370> tonight<00:05:04.699> so<00:05:05.029> be

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
again I do say it all tonight so be

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.170 
again I do say it all tonight so be
careful<00:05:05.960> there<00:05:06.400> if<00:05:07.400> you<00:05:07.580> was<00:05:07.789> to<00:05:07.819> use<00:05:08.060> this

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
careful there if you was to use this

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.459 
careful there if you was to use this
weakness

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
weakness

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.439 
weakness
it<00:05:09.710> is<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.219> bubble<00:05:10.759> shield<00:05:10.939> I<00:05:11.090> believe<00:05:11.300> it's

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
it is the bubble shield I believe it's

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.719 
it is the bubble shield I believe it's
called<00:05:11.659> I<00:05:12.319> can't<00:05:12.800> remember<00:05:12.919> right<00:05:13.069> now<00:05:13.249> but

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
called I can't remember right now but

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.879 
called I can't remember right now but
when<00:05:14.419> it<00:05:14.539> comes<00:05:14.719> down<00:05:14.900> like<00:05:14.960> that<00:05:15.439> just

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
when it comes down like that just

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.860 
when it comes down like that just
activate<00:05:16.249> the<00:05:16.279> bubble<00:05:16.610> shield<00:05:16.819> jump<00:05:17.479> into<00:05:17.779> his

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
activate the bubble shield jump into his

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.219 
activate the bubble shield jump into his
glass<00:05:18.139> once<00:05:18.740> lightnings<00:05:19.219> dispersed<00:05:19.639> and<00:05:20.199> yeah

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
glass once lightnings dispersed and yeah

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.700 
glass once lightnings dispersed and yeah
you'll<00:05:21.560> just<00:05:21.710> wreck<00:05:22.099> up<00:05:22.279> mini<00:05:22.580> hits<00:05:22.849> on<00:05:23.089> him<00:05:23.710> no

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
you'll just wreck up mini hits on him no

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.769 
you'll just wreck up mini hits on him no
that's<00:05:24.949> really<00:05:25.279> about<00:05:25.669> here<00:05:26.029> the<00:05:26.270> second<00:05:26.629> part

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:26.779 
that's really about here the second part

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.119 
that's really about here the second part
is<00:05:26.839> actually<00:05:26.960> fairly<00:05:27.379> boring<00:05:27.650> if<00:05:27.919> you<00:05:28.009> know

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
is actually fairly boring if you know

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.920 
is actually fairly boring if you know
what<00:05:28.279> you're<00:05:28.400> doing<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:29.560> that's<00:05:30.560> it<00:05:30.949> or<00:05:31.310> is<00:05:31.789> it
