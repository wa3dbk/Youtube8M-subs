00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
my ipad 3rd gens retina so it's hard to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.670 
my ipad 3rd gens retina so it's hard to
go<00:01:36.630> back<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.990> pixilation<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.909> i<00:01:39.680> figured

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
go back to pixilation but i figured

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
go back to pixilation but i figured
before<00:01:41.280> i<00:01:41.310> return<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.640> let<00:01:41.939> me<00:01:42.030> let<00:01:42.600> me<00:01:42.659> give<00:01:42.780> it

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
before i return it let me let me give it

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.010 
before i return it let me let me give it
a<00:01:42.930> chance<00:01:43.369> because<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.180> nice<00:01:45.329> size<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
a chance because it's a nice size and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.200 
a chance because it's a nice size and
it's<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.710> very<00:01:46.909> elegant<00:01:47.909> beautiful

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it's actually very elegant beautiful

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.490 
it's actually very elegant beautiful
device<00:01:48.570> as<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.380> know<00:01:52.470> I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
device as you can see so you know I

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.050 
device as you can see so you know I
didn't<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.189> don't<00:01:53.579> want<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.790> roll<00:01:53.939> it

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
didn't want to I don't want to roll it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.280 
didn't want to I don't want to roll it
out<00:01:54.180> together<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.840> extremely<00:01:55.500> light<00:01:56.030> I

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
out together it's extremely light I

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.240 
out together it's extremely light I
don't<00:01:58.290> even<00:01:58.350> know<00:01:58.560> what<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.799> compare<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.219> I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
don't even know what to compare it to I

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.069 
don't even know what to compare it to I
think<00:01:59.490> they<00:01:59.549> compared<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
think they compared it to like a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.520 
think they compared it to like a
notebook<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.520> notepad<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:04.170> guess<00:02:04.320> that's

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
notebook a notepad and I guess that's

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.609 
notebook a notepad and I guess that's
pretty<00:02:04.740> accurate<00:02:05.840> let's<00:02:06.840> put<00:02:06.990> us<00:02:07.079> off<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.560> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
pretty accurate let's put us off for a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.309 
pretty accurate let's put us off for a
second<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.429> know<00:02:08.580> typical<00:02:09.509> I'll<00:02:09.599> boxing<00:02:10.110> but

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
second you know typical I'll boxing but

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.350 
second you know typical I'll boxing but
you<00:02:11.009> know<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.220> get<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.910> actually<00:02:12.150> get<00:02:12.239> the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
you know you get you actually get the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.480 
you know you get you actually get the
smaller<00:02:12.629> charger<00:02:13.080> with

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
smaller charger with

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.350 
smaller charger with
you<00:02:13.670> don't<00:02:13.850> get<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:15.220> larger<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.550> forget<00:02:17.240> the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
you don't get the larger I forget the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.870 
you don't get the larger I forget the
capacities<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.350> mean<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.740> what<00:02:19.700> is<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
capacities but I mean the what is it the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.700 
capacities but I mean the what is it the
wattage<00:02:20.270> whatever<00:02:20.690> can't<00:02:21.380> think<00:02:21.530> right<00:02:21.560> now

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
wattage whatever can't think right now

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.080 
wattage whatever can't think right now
but<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.040> get<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.190> smaller<00:02:22.490> one<00:02:22.700> like<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:22.940> did

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
but you get the smaller one like you did

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.260 
but you get the smaller one like you did
with<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.300> iphone<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.850> also<00:02:25.970> get<00:02:26.120> your

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
with the iphone and you also get your

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.330 
with the iphone and you also get your
typical<00:02:26.620> decide<00:02:27.620> by<00:02:27.770> apple<00:02:29.590> stuff<00:02:30.590> there's

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
typical decide by apple stuff there's

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.410 
typical decide by apple stuff there's
probably<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.610> couple<00:02:31.700> stickers<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.300> that's

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
probably a couple stickers and that's

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.700 
probably a couple stickers and that's
always<00:02:32.510> going<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.750> ask<00:02:32.870> about<00:02:32.930> stickers<00:02:33.470> cuz

you<00:02:49.460> purchase<00:02:49.760> an<00:02:49.850> ipad<00:02:49.970> mini<00:02:51.010> since<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.100> have

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
you purchase an ipad mini since you have

you purchase an ipad mini since you have
stickers<00:02:52.640> with<00:02:52.820> it<00:02:52.970> now<00:02:53.180> I'm<00:02:53.420> hoping<00:02:53.780> or

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
stickers with it now I'm hoping or

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.980 
stickers with it now I'm hoping or
rather<00:02:54.830> assuming<00:02:55.460> that<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:56.360> retina<00:02:56.630> model<00:02:56.930> is

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
rather assuming that the retina model is

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.430 
rather assuming that the retina model is
going<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.170> come<00:02:57.320> out<00:02:58.270> problem<00:02:59.320> probably<00:03:00.320> not

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
going to come out problem probably not

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.770 
going to come out problem probably not
with<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.830> new<00:03:01.310> iPad<00:03:01.670> if<00:03:02.060> they<00:03:02.180> who<00:03:02.600> knows

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
with the new iPad if they who knows

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.970 
with the new iPad if they who knows
what's<00:03:02.930> going<00:03:03.080> on<00:03:03.230> now<00:03:03.380> because<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.680> 4th<00:03:03.920> gen

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
what's going on now because the 4th gen

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.560 
what's going on now because the 4th gen
came<00:03:04.280> out<00:03:04.430> but<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.760> also<00:03:04.910> get<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.270> Lightning

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
came out but you also get the Lightning

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.660 
came out but you also get the Lightning
connector<00:03:05.690> here<00:03:06.170> who<00:03:07.070> knows<00:03:07.250> what<00:03:07.520> their

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
connector here who knows what their

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.580 
connector here who knows what their
cycle<00:03:08.000> is<00:03:08.120> now<00:03:08.270> because<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.660> just<00:03:08.780> released

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
cycle is now because it just released

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.390 
cycle is now because it just released
the<00:03:09.770> fourth<00:03:10.370> generation<00:03:10.940> regular<00:03:11.480> iPad<00:03:11.870> so

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
the fourth generation regular iPad so

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.250 
the fourth generation regular iPad so
everything's<00:03:13.400> kind<00:03:13.670> of<00:03:13.910> kind<00:03:14.900> of<00:03:15.050> threw<00:03:15.200> us

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
everything's kind of kind of threw us

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.640 
everything's kind of kind of threw us
off<00:03:15.500> there<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.790> I'm<00:03:17.060> assuming<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.690> next<00:03:18.110> iPad

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
off there so I'm assuming the next iPad

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.690 
off there so I'm assuming the next iPad
Mini<00:03:18.860> that<00:03:19.010> was<00:03:19.100> going<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.280> be<00:03:19.340> writing<00:03:19.550> this

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
Mini that was going to be writing this

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.950 
Mini that was going to be writing this
so<00:03:21.940> yeah<00:03:23.410> we'll<00:03:24.410> see<00:03:24.710> and<00:03:25.720> when<00:03:26.720> this<00:03:26.810> is

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
so yeah we'll see and when this is

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.090 
so yeah we'll see and when this is
retina<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.290> think<00:03:27.650> it's<00:03:27.740> going<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:27.890> be<00:03:27.980> perfect

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
retina I think it's going to be perfect

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.950 
retina I think it's going to be perfect
i<00:03:28.490> mean<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.760> 7-inch<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.270> pretty<00:03:29.480> nice<00:03:29.630> i<00:03:29.900> do

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
i mean the 7-inch is pretty nice i do

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.790 
i mean the 7-inch is pretty nice i do
like<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.200> large<00:03:30.530> 9.7<00:03:31.430> but<00:03:31.630> this<00:03:32.630> this<00:03:33.440> is<00:03:33.500> nice

like the large 9.7 but this this is nice

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.260 
like the large 9.7 but this this is nice
and<00:03:33.830> um<00:03:35.410> with<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.440> retina<00:03:36.800> screen<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:38.120> would

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
and um with the retina screen it would

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.940 
and um with the retina screen it would
be<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.480> total<00:03:38.960> package<00:03:39.880> sometimes<00:03:41.950> carrying

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
be the total package sometimes carrying

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.440 
be the total package sometimes carrying

can pick up the pixel density here is

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.270 
can pick up the pixel density here is
163<00:05:27.430> pickles<00:05:27.970> pixels<00:05:28.449> per<00:05:28.630> inch<00:05:28.660> so<00:05:28.960> a<00:05:29.380> little
