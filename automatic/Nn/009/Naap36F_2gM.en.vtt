Froch<00:02:18.030> for<00:02:18.659> fries<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.109> it<00:02:19.200> goes<00:02:19.680> are<00:02:19.829> both<00:02:19.980> be

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
Froch for fries and it goes are both be

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.789 
Froch for fries and it goes are both be
pay-per-view<00:02:20.640> fights<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.780> that's<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
pay-per-view fights and so that's the

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.589 
pay-per-view fights and so that's the
thing<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.129> that<00:02:23.939> fight<00:02:24.209> wouldn't<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.569> a

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
thing it's that fight wouldn't be a

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.030 
thing it's that fight wouldn't be a
pay-per-view<00:02:24.959> fight<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.409> the<00:02:25.439> economics

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
pay-per-view fight so the economics

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.619 
pay-per-view fight so the economics
wouldn't<00:02:26.370> wouldn't<00:02:26.760> work<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.150> them<00:02:27.269> so<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
wouldn't wouldn't work on them so the

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.149 
wouldn't wouldn't work on them so the
only<00:02:27.750> way<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.019> could<00:02:28.140> happen<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.530> if<00:02:28.680> both<00:02:28.890> men

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
only way it could happen is if both men

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.670 
only way it could happen is if both men
take<00:02:29.400> less<00:02:29.670> money<00:02:29.700> which<00:02:30.239> is<00:02:30.420> obviously<00:02:30.810> not

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
take less money which is obviously not

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.550 
take less money which is obviously not
even<00:02:31.980> intelligent<00:02:32.689> we<00:02:33.689> know<00:02:33.810> Andre<00:02:34.349> is<00:02:34.409> not

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
even intelligent we know Andre is not

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.839 
even intelligent we know Andre is not
going<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.739> take<00:02:34.829> this<00:02:34.980> money<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.310> there

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
going to take this money and there

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.129 
going to take this money and there
wouldn't<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.299> wouldn't<00:02:36.510> make<00:02:36.659> sense<00:02:36.720> for<00:02:36.959> good

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.139 
wouldn't it wouldn't make sense for good

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.500 
wouldn't it wouldn't make sense for good
idea<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.409> move<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.769> his<00:02:38.040> weight<00:02:38.670> class<00:02:38.700> to

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
idea to move out of his weight class to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.899 
idea to move out of his weight class to
make<00:02:39.659> that<00:02:39.810> fight<00:02:40.019> so<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.950> can't<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.670> can't
