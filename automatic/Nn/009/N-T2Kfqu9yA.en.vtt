the morning come here from you that's

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.609

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.650 
the race and we can go very far for some
people

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.220 

I<00:00:22.800> think<00:00:23.800> it<00:00:23.980> will<00:00:24.130> not<00:00:24.460> stay<00:00:25.000> as<00:00:25.300> a<00:00:25.330> rare<00:00:25.750> as<00:00:26.169> it

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
I think it will not stay as a rare as it

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.330 
I think it will not stay as a rare as it
is<00:00:26.589> now<00:00:26.949> but<00:00:27.630> most<00:00:28.630> things<00:00:29.050> which<00:00:30.009> people

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
is now but most things which people

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.280 
is now but most things which people
consider<00:00:30.789> one<00:00:31.029> modification<00:00:31.689> a<00:00:31.750> very<00:00:31.930> drastic

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
consider one modification a very drastic

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.470 
consider one modification a very drastic
and<00:00:32.829> very<00:00:33.070> permanent<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:34.260> also<00:00:35.260> most<00:00:35.769> of<00:00:36.040> them

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
and very permanent and also most of them

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.530 
and very permanent and also most of them
combined<00:00:37.480> but<00:00:37.719> pain<00:00:38.230> so<00:00:38.920> not<00:00:39.550> everyone<00:00:40.089> is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
combined but pain so not everyone is

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.439 
combined but pain so not everyone is
willing<00:00:40.809> to<00:00:41.110> go<00:00:41.559> this<00:00:41.769> way<00:00:42.070> so<00:00:42.129> I<00:00:42.610> think<00:00:42.760> it

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
willing to go this way so I think it

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.869 
willing to go this way so I think it
will<00:00:43.659> never<00:00:43.900> become<00:00:44.140> as<00:00:44.589> common<00:00:45.070> as<00:00:45.280> piercings

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
will never become as common as piercings

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.220 
will never become as common as piercings
or<00:00:46.059> tattoos

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.200 

no<00:00:52.270> not<00:00:53.270> at<00:00:53.420> all<00:00:53.600> I<00:00:53.870> think<00:00:54.560> well<00:00:54.890> for<00:00:55.820> me<00:00:55.970> at

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
least there are probably people who like

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.550 
least there are probably people who like
heavy<00:01:01.540> self-destructive<00:01:02.540> ways<00:01:02.660> before<00:01:03.050> and

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
heavy self-destructive ways before and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.290 
heavy self-destructive ways before and
then<00:01:03.980> got<00:01:04.580> into<00:01:05.000> piercing<00:01:05.930> as<00:01:06.170> a<00:01:07.060> followed<00:01:08.060> by

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
this but not for me not at all because I

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.690 
this but not for me not at all because I
don't<00:01:11.210> enjoy<00:01:11.660> paying<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.950> tiniest<00:01:13.340> that<00:01:13.670> I

don't enjoy paying the tiniest that I

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.180 
don't enjoy paying the tiniest that I
really<00:01:14.120> don't<00:01:14.360> like<00:01:14.570> it<00:01:14.810> means<00:01:15.110> all<00:01:15.710> about<00:01:16.040> the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
really don't like it means all about the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.880 
really don't like it means all about the
result

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.330 

yeah<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.270> some<00:01:21.540> kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.050> art<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:23.040> you

paintings or statues or things like that
it's<00:01:31.620> exactly<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> same<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.760> also<00:01:32.910> have

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
they're also tensional artists why I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.730 
they're also tensional artists why I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
think yeah that's that's someone really

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.260 
think yeah that's that's someone really
extraordinary<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.760> think<00:01:41.940> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.620 

if<00:01:49.140> someone<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:50.220> really<00:01:50.970> young<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
if someone is like really young and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.500 
if someone is like really young and
didn't<00:01:52.440> have<00:01:52.619> any<00:01:52.890> piercings<00:01:53.340> yet<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> it

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
didn't have any piercings yet and it

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.899 
didn't have any piercings yet and it
seems<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.200> me<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> bit<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.280> person<00:01:56.729> does

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
seems to me a bit like the person does

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.270 
seems to me a bit like the person does
it<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.330> be<00:01:57.540> special<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.800> get<00:01:58.979> attention

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
it to be special and to get attention

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.390 
it to be special and to get attention
then<00:01:59.760> I<00:01:59.790> would<00:02:00.420> always<00:02:00.770> send<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> people<00:02:02.159> away

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
then I would always send the people away

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.480 
then I would always send the people away
-<00:02:02.940> -<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.600> they<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:04.170> think<00:02:04.650> about<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:05.190> another

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
- - so they can think about it another

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310 
- - so they can think about it another
time<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:06.119> if<00:02:06.479> someone<00:02:06.869> doesn't<00:02:07.140> have<00:02:07.170> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
time like if someone doesn't have a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.199 
time like if someone doesn't have a
single<00:02:07.770> touch<00:02:08.069> who<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.280> single<00:02:08.610> piercing<00:02:09.000> just

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
single touch who a single piercing just

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.910 
single touch who a single piercing just
became<00:02:09.539> 18<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.140> wants<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.380> get<00:02:10.560> his<00:02:10.679> tongue

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
became 18 and wants to get his tongue

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.520 
became 18 and wants to get his tongue
split<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.520> would<00:02:11.970> always<00:02:12.209> have<00:02:12.540> doubts<00:02:12.959> really

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
split I would always have doubts really

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.870 
split I would always have doubts really
providing<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.310> service<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.180> person
