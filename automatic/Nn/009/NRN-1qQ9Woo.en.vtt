00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.520 

so<00:00:00.539> in<00:00:00.599> this<00:00:00.690> chapter<00:00:00.930> we're<00:00:01.199> going<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.350> have<00:00:01.500> a

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
so in this chapter we're going to have a

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.949 
so in this chapter we're going to have a
look<00:00:01.740> at<00:00:01.920> how<00:00:02.100> to<00:00:02.159> bake<00:00:02.490> objects<00:00:03.030> so<00:00:03.419> if<00:00:03.780> we

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
look at how to bake objects so if we

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.320 
look at how to bake objects so if we
look<00:00:04.140> at<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.730> polygon<00:00:05.730> detail<00:00:06.089> on<00:00:06.270> this

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
look at the polygon detail on this

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.839 
look at the polygon detail on this
object<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.899> very<00:00:07.319> dense<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:08.010> if<00:00:08.400> we<00:00:08.639> were<00:00:08.790> to

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
object this very dense and if we were to

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.140 
object this very dense and if we were to
animate<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:10.260> wouldn't<00:00:10.530> be<00:00:10.620> able<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:11.150> get

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
animate this we wouldn't be able to get

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.089 
animate this we wouldn't be able to get
kind<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.389> fast<00:00:12.690> updates<00:00:13.139> because<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.769> mesh<00:00:13.950> is

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
kind of fast updates because the mesh is

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.799 
kind of fast updates because the mesh is
just<00:00:14.309> too<00:00:14.490> dense<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.450> might<00:00:15.599> want<00:00:15.780> to

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
just too dense so you might want to

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.689 
just too dense so you might want to
create<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.139> displacement<00:00:16.710> map<00:00:16.949> from<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
create a displacement map from this and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.300 
create a displacement map from this and
apply<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> kind<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.320> lower<00:00:19.560> polygon

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
apply it to a kind of lower polygon

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.179 
apply it to a kind of lower polygon
geometry<00:00:20.900> maybe<00:00:21.900> something<00:00:22.500> like<00:00:22.650> level<00:00:22.949> two

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
geometry maybe something like level two

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.740 
geometry maybe something like level two
and<00:00:25.789> you<00:00:26.789> might<00:00:26.939> want<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.150> just<00:00:27.330> work<00:00:27.480> from

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and you might want to just work from

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.870 
and you might want to just work from
here<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.230> then<00:00:28.710> using<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.099> displacement<00:00:29.730> map

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
here and then using the displacement map

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.500 
here and then using the displacement map
from<00:00:30.240> level<00:00:30.990> seven<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.219> I'm<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.180> going<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.390> go

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
from level seven so I'm just going to go

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.150 
from level seven so I'm just going to go
back<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:34.130> level<00:00:35.130> six<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.380> the<00:00:37.380> first<00:00:37.590> thing<00:00:37.800> we

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
back to level six and the first thing we

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.940 
back to level six and the first thing we
need<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.820> create<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.210> UV<00:00:39.809> map<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.829> this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
need to do is create a UV map for this

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.160 
need to do is create a UV map for this
model<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:42.090> don't<00:00:42.210> actually<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.780> but

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
model you don't actually have to but

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.840 
model you don't actually have to but
it's<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.440> better<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:44.730> just

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
it's just better if you do so I'm just

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.510 
it's just better if you do so I'm just
going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:45.149> here<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.020> go<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.649> p<00:00:46.860> UV<00:00:47.070> edit

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
going to go here and go to be p UV edit

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.900 
going to go here and go to be p UV edit
like<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.739> I'm<00:00:49.739> gonna<00:00:49.829> choose<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.670> tool

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
like this and I'm gonna choose this tool

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.600 
like this and I'm gonna choose this tool
here<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.660> select<00:00:51.960> all<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> polygons<00:00:52.649> goes

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
here to select all the polygons goes

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.240 
here to select all the polygons goes
back<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> base<00:00:54.239> mesh<00:00:54.480> anyway<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.250> I'm

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
back to the base mesh anyway and I'm

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.779 
back to the base mesh anyway and I'm
gonna<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> optimal<00:00:57.360> mapping<00:00:57.719> angle<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
gonna go to optimal mapping angle and

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.479 
gonna go to optimal mapping angle and
I'm<00:00:59.789> gonna<00:00:59.940> choose<00:01:00.449> stretch<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.289> fit<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.739> hit

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
I'm gonna choose stretch to fit and hit

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759 
I'm gonna choose stretch to fit and hit
apply<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.960> quick<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.320> dirty<00:01:04.439> way<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
apply so that's a quick and dirty way of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.550 
apply so that's a quick and dirty way of
creating<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> quick<00:01:05.670> UV<00:01:06.060> map<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.600> everything's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
creating a quick UV map and everything's

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.310 
creating a quick UV map and everything's
kind<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.799> spread<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.510> but<00:01:09.510> as<00:01:09.810> long<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:09.990> enough

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
kind of spread out but as long as enough

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.010 
kind of spread out but as long as enough
the<00:01:10.500> polygons<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.100> overlapping<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.840> use

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the polygons are overlapping we can use

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.190 
the polygons are overlapping we can use
that<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:15.090> I'm<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.630> go<00:01:15.750> back<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that so I'm just going to go back to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.179 
that so I'm just going to go back to
standard<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:19.259> basically<00:01:19.500> need<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.830> go<00:01:19.920> back

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
standard and I basically need to go back

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.390 
standard and I basically need to go back
to<00:01:20.250> model<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.590> click<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.100> choose

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to model so just click here and choose

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.690 
to model so just click here and choose
model<00:01:23.790> otherwise<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.750> can't<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.080> back<00:01:25.700> so

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
model otherwise you can't get back so

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:37.120 
model otherwise you can't get back so
that's<00:01:26.909> us<00:01:27.210> back<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> model<00:01:35.630> there<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.720> is

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
that's us back to the model there it is

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.910 
that's us back to the model there it is
so<00:01:38.130> now<00:01:38.159> we're<00:01:38.579> ready<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.880> basically<00:01:39.299> bake

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
so now we're ready to basically bake

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.830 
so now we're ready to basically bake
bake<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.070> object<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.630> going<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
bake this object so I'm just going to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.280 
bake this object so I'm just going to
click<00:01:43.049> puppet<00:01:43.909> go<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> sculpt<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.810> bake

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
click puppet go to sculpt and bake

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.590 
click puppet go to sculpt and bake
sculpt<00:01:46.710> objects<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:48.090> opens<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
sculpt objects here that opens up the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.460 
sculpt objects here that opens up the
dialog<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:50.399> we've<00:01:50.579> got<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> few<00:01:50.939> options<00:01:51.299> here

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
dialog so we've got a few options here

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
dialog so we've got a few options here
first<00:01:52.470> I'm<00:01:52.619> going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.829> choose<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> file<00:01:53.250> name

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
first I'm going to choose a file name

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.190 
first I'm going to choose a file name
obviously<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.450> I'm<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.659> going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.840> call<00:01:55.020> this

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
leave the pixel border as is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.930 
leave the pixel border as is
I'm<00:02:14.470> gonna<00:02:14.620> check<00:02:14.920> single<00:02:15.310> file<00:02:15.580> because<00:02:15.880> I

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
I'm gonna check single file because I

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.090 
I'm gonna check single file because I
just<00:02:16.120> want<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.300> displacement<00:02:16.690> map<00:02:16.950> going<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.040> go

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
just want a displacement map going to go

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.480 
just want a displacement map going to go
to<00:02:18.160> options<00:02:18.700> check<00:02:19.210> this<00:02:19.390> placement<00:02:19.870> and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
to options check this placement and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.830 
to options check this placement and
basically<00:02:21.490> if<00:02:21.760> you're<00:02:21.910> very<00:02:22.150> lazy<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.630> you

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
basically if you're very lazy and you

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.240 
basically if you're very lazy and you
don't<00:02:22.990> want<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.140> set<00:02:23.290> up<00:02:23.440> UV<00:02:23.770> maps<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.130> can

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
don't want to set up UV maps you can

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.910 
don't want to set up UV maps you can
come<00:02:24.430> here<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.880> choose<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> cubic<00:02:26.350> or<00:02:26.500> angle

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
come here and choose a cubic or angle

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.310 
come here and choose a cubic or angle
this<00:02:27.880> should<00:02:28.120> create<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.480> kind<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.840> quick<00:02:29.020> and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
this should create a kind of quick and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.040 
this should create a kind of quick and
dirty<00:02:29.350> UV<00:02:29.920> map<00:02:30.100> for<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.550> here<00:02:30.880> but<00:02:31.720> we've

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
dirty UV map for you here but we've

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.540 
dirty UV map for you here but we've
already<00:02:32.230> got<00:02:32.380> our<00:02:32.530> UV<00:02:32.830> map<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.190> I'm<00:02:33.280> just<00:02:33.430> going

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
already got our UV map so I'm just going

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.890 
already got our UV map so I'm just going
to<00:02:33.610> use<00:02:34.510> off<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:36.000> then<00:02:37.000> here<00:02:37.420> we're<00:02:37.630> basically

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
to use off and then here we're basically

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.860 
to use off and then here we're basically
going<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.200> go<00:02:38.380> from<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:39.190> source<00:02:40.030> object<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
going to go from a source object to the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.600 
going to go from a source object to the
target<00:02:41.200> object<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.010> source<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.490> basically

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
target object so the source is basically

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.260 
target object so the source is basically
our<00:02:43.030> highest<00:02:43.450> level<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:43.960> level<00:02:44.230> 6<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.270> then

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
our highest level this level 6 and then

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.980 
our highest level this level 6 and then
the<00:02:47.070> base<00:02:48.070> object<00:02:48.280> sometimes<00:02:48.820> is<00:02:49.210> too<00:02:49.540> low<00:02:49.840> in

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
the base object sometimes is too low in

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.330 
the base object sometimes is too low in
detail<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.620> might<00:02:50.800> want<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.040> go<00:02:51.130> from

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
detail so you might want to go from

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.850 
detail so you might want to go from
level<00:02:51.490> 6<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.940> level<00:02:52.240> 2<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.530> this<00:02:53.650> instance

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
level 6 to level 2 but in this instance

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.590 
level 6 to level 2 but in this instance
just<00:02:54.280> for<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.490> purpose<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.120> demonstration

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
just for the purpose of demonstration

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.000 
just for the purpose of demonstration
I'm<00:02:55.810> going<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.990> go<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.170> my<00:02:56.350> lowest<00:02:56.680> level

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
I'm going to go to my lowest level

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.070 
I'm going to go to my lowest level
basically<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.790> base<00:02:57.970> mesh<00:02:58.590> and<00:03:00.630> then<00:03:01.630> under

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
basically the base mesh and then under

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.450 
basically the base mesh and then under
settings<00:03:02.470> we've<00:03:02.650> got<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.890> displacement

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
settings we've got the displacement

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.650 
settings we've got the displacement
method<00:03:03.580> so<00:03:04.540> if<00:03:04.810> you're<00:03:04.930> gonna<00:03:05.050> animate<00:03:05.440> this

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
method so if you're gonna animate this

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.870 
method so if you're gonna animate this
the<00:03:07.660> tangent<00:03:08.170> option<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.830> pretty<00:03:09.220> good<00:03:09.400> but

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
the tangent option is pretty good but

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.060 
the tangent option is pretty good but
I'm<00:03:10.420> just<00:03:10.630> gonna<00:03:10.720> kind<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.620> use<00:03:11.800> it<00:03:11.920> as<00:03:12.040> a

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
I'm just gonna kind of use it as a

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.010 
I'm just gonna kind of use it as a
static<00:03:13.060> model<00:03:13.210> so<00:03:13.510> I'm<00:03:13.570> just<00:03:13.690> going<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.870> leave

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
static model so I'm just going to leave

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.580 
static model so I'm just going to leave
on<00:03:14.260> XYZ<00:03:14.860> object<00:03:15.520> and<00:03:16.050> if<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.170> want<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:17.500> can

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
on XYZ object and if you want you can

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.470 
on XYZ object and if you want you can
actually<00:03:17.709> do<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:17.980> little<00:03:18.190> mini<00:03:18.790> preview<00:03:19.330> render

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
actually do a little mini preview render

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.380 
actually do a little mini preview render
here<00:03:19.900> by<00:03:20.230> clicking<00:03:20.290> preview<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.280> can<00:03:22.209> see

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
here by clicking preview and you can see

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.790 
here by clicking preview and you can see
what<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.630> displacement<00:03:23.200> maps<00:03:23.380> gonna<00:03:23.650> look

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
what the displacement maps gonna look

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.710 
what the displacement maps gonna look
like<00:03:24.900> but<00:03:25.900> erm<00:03:27.060> I'm<00:03:28.060> happy<00:03:28.420> with<00:03:28.540> those

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
like but erm I'm happy with those

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.330 
like but erm I'm happy with those
settings<00:03:28.989> I'm<00:03:29.350> just<00:03:29.500> going<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.650> go<00:03:29.770> back<00:03:30.040> and

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
settings I'm just going to go back and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.280 
settings I'm just going to go back and
I'm<00:03:30.790> gonna<00:03:30.910> hit<00:03:31.150> bake

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.190 

so<00:03:38.159> create<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.640> result<00:03:38.939> copy<00:03:39.299> was<00:03:39.569> checked<00:03:39.870> so

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
so create a result copy was checked so

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.449 
so create a result copy was checked so
that<00:03:40.230> basically<00:03:40.500> creates<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:42.209> separate<00:03:43.200> copy

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
that basically creates a separate copy

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.970 
that basically creates a separate copy
just<00:03:44.459> going<00:03:44.579> to<00:03:44.640> minimize<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.980> so

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
just going to minimize that and so

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.000 
just going to minimize that and so
that's<00:03:47.159> our<00:03:47.310> sculpting<00:03:47.879> layer<00:03:48.829> just<00:03:49.829> gonna

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
that's our sculpting layer just gonna

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.309 
that's our sculpting layer just gonna
turn<00:03:50.250> these<00:03:50.489> off<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.000> that's<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.930> new<00:03:52.079> baked

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
turn these off and that's a new baked

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:04.660 
turn these off and that's a new baked
object<00:04:00.829> so<00:04:01.829> I'm<00:04:01.920> just<00:04:02.040> gonna<00:04:02.159> render<00:04:02.459> this

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
object so I'm just gonna render this

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.039 
object so I'm just gonna render this
we're<00:04:05.670> just<00:04:05.790> gonna<00:04:05.879> click<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:06.180> I'm<00:04:06.659> just<00:04:06.870> going

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
we're just gonna click on I'm just going

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.259 
we're just gonna click on I'm just going
to<00:04:07.079> turn<00:04:07.230> off<00:04:07.290> displacement<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.310> render<00:04:09.180> this

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
to turn off displacement and render this

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.569 
to turn off displacement and render this
to<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.510> picture<00:04:09.840> viewer<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.980> I'm<00:04:14.220> gonna<00:04:14.370> make

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
to the picture viewer and I'm gonna make

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.990 
to the picture viewer and I'm gonna make
this<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:16.620> now<00:04:16.859> I'm<00:04:17.280> gonna<00:04:17.459> go<00:04:17.639> back<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:17.880> my

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
this a and now I'm gonna go back to my

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.520 
this a and now I'm gonna go back to my
map<00:04:18.539> which<00:04:19.139> has<00:04:19.169> being<00:04:19.440> created<00:04:19.829> for<00:04:20.039> me<00:04:20.250> and

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
map which has being created for me and

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.200 
map which has being created for me and
the<00:04:22.530> displacement<00:04:23.160> maps<00:04:23.310> been<00:04:23.550> inserted<00:04:23.910> in

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
the displacement maps been inserted in

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.180 
the displacement maps been inserted in
there<00:04:24.360> automatically<00:04:25.050> after<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.800> baking

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
there automatically after the baking

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
there automatically after the baking
operation<00:04:27.440> gonna<00:04:28.440> choose<00:04:28.889> round<00:04:29.639> geometry

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
operation gonna choose round geometry

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.629 
operation gonna choose round geometry
see<00:04:30.539> what<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.810> does<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.410> I'm<00:04:32.250> gonna<00:04:32.370> render

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
see what that does and I'm gonna render

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:40.520 
see what that does and I'm gonna render
this<00:04:38.570> so<00:04:39.570> that's<00:04:39.720> looking<00:04:39.840> quite<00:04:40.169> strange

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
this so that's looking quite strange

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.670 
this so that's looking quite strange
she's<00:04:41.280> gonna<00:04:41.370> turn<00:04:41.639> off<00:04:41.900> round<00:04:42.900> geometry<00:04:43.470> and

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
she's gonna turn off round geometry and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.659 
she's gonna turn off round geometry and
render<00:04:43.979> again<00:04:47.120> there<00:04:48.120> we<00:04:48.300> go

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
render again there we go

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.400 
render again there we go
so<00:04:50.669> that's<00:04:50.940> quite<00:04:51.419> impressive<00:04:51.720> considering

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
so that's quite impressive considering

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.000 
so that's quite impressive considering
ahead<00:04:53.099> the<00:04:53.340> base<00:04:53.520> mesh<00:04:53.820> is<00:04:54.090> this<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:54.949> using<00:04:55.949> a

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
ahead the base mesh is this and using a

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.890 
ahead the base mesh is this and using a
displacement<00:04:56.400> map<00:04:56.610> we've<00:04:57.120> managed<00:04:57.449> to<00:04:57.479> end<00:04:57.720> up

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
displacement map we've managed to end up

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.210 
displacement map we've managed to end up
with<00:04:58.169> this<00:04:59.990> so<00:05:00.990> imagine<00:05:01.560> if<00:05:01.650> you<00:05:01.740> bake<00:05:01.949> to

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
with this so imagine if you bake to

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.310 
with this so imagine if you bake to
level<00:05:02.580> one<00:05:02.760> or<00:05:02.910> two<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:03.419> would<00:05:03.570> get<00:05:03.750> some

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
level one or two you would get some

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.969 
level one or two you would get some
pretty<00:05:04.620> impressive<00:05:04.919> detail<00:05:05.310> and<00:05:06.349> then<00:05:07.349> make

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
pretty impressive detail and then make

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.100 
pretty impressive detail and then make
this<00:05:08.070> be<00:05:08.400> and<00:05:08.820> now<00:05:09.120> we<00:05:09.180> can<00:05:09.360> basically<00:05:09.510> do<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:09.810> a

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
this be and now we can basically do a a

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.029 
this be and now we can basically do a a
B<00:05:11.070> comparison<00:05:12.199> so<00:05:13.199> that<00:05:13.349> shows<00:05:13.530> you<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.710> power

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
B comparison so that shows you the power

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.980 
B comparison so that shows you the power
of<00:05:16.340> baking<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.430> displacement<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.750> you<00:05:18.840> could

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
of baking the displacement so you could

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.960 
of baking the displacement so you could
animate<00:05:19.289> on<00:05:19.530> this<00:05:19.740> level<00:05:19.949> get<00:05:20.400> some<00:05:20.610> nice<00:05:20.789> kind

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
animate on this level get some nice kind

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.629 
animate on this level get some nice kind
of<00:05:21.060> quick<00:05:21.300> updates<00:05:21.449> and<00:05:22.099> then<00:05:23.099> when<00:05:23.520> you're

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
of quick updates and then when you're

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.450 
of quick updates and then when you're
ready<00:05:23.669> turn<00:05:24.090> on<00:05:24.270> displacement<00:05:24.630> and<00:05:25.430> output<00:05:26.430> a

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
ready turn on displacement and output a

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.080 
ready turn on displacement and output a
nice<00:05:26.760> kind<00:05:27.000> of<00:05:27.060> high-res<00:05:27.479> animation<00:05:28.849> one<00:05:29.849> last

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
nice kind of high-res animation one last

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.710 
nice kind of high-res animation one last
thing<00:05:30.240> I'm<00:05:30.330> going<00:05:30.449> to<00:05:30.570> show<00:05:30.690> you<00:05:30.720> is<00:05:31.199> basically

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
thing I'm going to show you is basically

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.550 
thing I'm going to show you is basically
when<00:05:33.720> you're<00:05:33.870> sculpting<00:05:34.849> like<00:05:35.849> this<00:05:36.500> say<00:05:37.500> you

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
when you're sculpting like this say you

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.300 
when you're sculpting like this say you
want<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:37.889> create<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:38.520> level<00:05:38.760> two<00:05:39.090> geometry<00:05:40.310> you

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
want to create a level two geometry you

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.909 
want to create a level two geometry you
can<00:05:41.370> go<00:05:41.580> to<00:05:41.639> tools<00:05:42.000> and<00:05:42.330> go<00:05:42.810> to<00:05:42.870> create<00:05:43.229> polygon

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
can go to tools and go to create polygon

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.840 
can go to tools and go to create polygon
copy<00:05:44.270> that<00:05:45.270> creates

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
copy that creates

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.530 
copy that creates
kind<00:05:47.850> of<00:05:47.910> level<00:05:48.270> to<00:05:49.670> model<00:05:50.670> which<00:05:51.360> is<00:05:51.480> very

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
kind of level to model which is very

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:59.330 
kind of level to model which is very
useful<00:05:53.630> or<00:05:54.630> we<00:05:55.170> can<00:05:55.320> go<00:05:55.470> to<00:05:57.890> create<00:05:58.890> polygon

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
useful or we can go to create polygon

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.970 
useful or we can go to create polygon
copy<00:05:59.610> for<00:05:59.910> every<00:06:00.210> level<00:06:00.560> that's<00:06:01.560> pretty<00:06:01.860> cool

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
copy for every level that's pretty cool

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.100 
copy for every level that's pretty cool
even<00:06:02.310> puts<00:06:02.610> them<00:06:02.730> in<00:06:02.850> a<00:06:02.910> line<00:06:03.120> for<00:06:03.150> you<00:06:03.600> as<00:06:03.840> you

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
even puts them in a line for you as you

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.070 
even puts them in a line for you as you
can<00:06:04.230> see<00:06:04.410> here<00:06:04.910> so<00:06:05.910> you<00:06:06.000> can<00:06:06.120> see<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.360> progress

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
can see here so you can see the progress

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:14.240 
can see here so you can see the progress
0<00:06:07.560> 1<00:06:07.740> 2<00:06:07.890> 3<00:06:07.920> 4<00:06:08.780> she's<00:06:09.780> gonna<00:06:09.900> turn<00:06:10.050> these<00:06:10.290> off<00:06:13.250> we

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
0 1 2 3 4 she's gonna turn these off we

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.470 
0 1 2 3 4 she's gonna turn these off we
can<00:06:14.400> see<00:06:14.550> the<00:06:14.640> progress<00:06:14.880> of<00:06:15.300> our<00:06:15.480> work

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.780 

turnaround<00:06:21.480> Gouraud<00:06:21.930> shading<00:06:21.960> and<00:06:22.640> you<00:06:23.640> can

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
turnaround Gouraud shading and you can

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.750 
turnaround Gouraud shading and you can
see<00:06:23.940> how<00:06:24.120> this<00:06:25.040> evolved<00:06:26.040> from<00:06:26.280> a<00:06:26.460> lowly

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
see how this evolved from a lowly

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.200 
see how this evolved from a lowly
polygon<00:06:27.390> base<00:06:27.870> mesh<00:06:28.200> to<00:06:28.610> this<00:06:29.610> final<00:06:29.940> result

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
polygon base mesh to this final result

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.460 
polygon base mesh to this final result
here<00:06:31.490> so<00:06:32.490> that's<00:06:32.700> the<00:06:32.820> last<00:06:33.030> chapter<00:06:33.540> of<00:06:33.660> the

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
here so that's the last chapter of the

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.830 
here so that's the last chapter of the
sculpting<00:06:34.890> series<00:06:35.250> I<00:06:35.490> hope<00:06:36.150> you<00:06:36.300> learnt<00:06:36.540> the

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
sculpting series I hope you learnt the

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.420 
sculpting series I hope you learnt the
basics<00:06:37.290> and<00:06:37.560> you're<00:06:37.890> ready<00:06:38.040> to<00:06:38.190> kind<00:06:38.370> of

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
basics and you're ready to kind of

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.400 
basics and you're ready to kind of
create<00:06:39.300> your<00:06:39.360> own<00:06:39.540> models<00:06:39.990> sculpt<00:06:40.320> your

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
create your own models sculpt your

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.220 
create your own models sculpt your
models<00:06:40.830> and<00:06:41.240> yeah<00:06:42.240> that's<00:06:42.510> it<00:06:42.720> thanks<00:06:43.140> for

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
models and yeah that's it thanks for

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.530 
models and yeah that's it thanks for
watching
