00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.549 
and I'm so happy these cards come out i
mean<00:00:44.280> when<00:00:44.489> i<00:00:44.520> did<00:00:44.760> my<00:00:44.910> deck<00:00:45.870> profile<00:00:46.410> before

with mang mange doll and dairy doll i

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.569 
with mang mange doll and dairy doll i
think<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.039> was<00:00:50.070> called<00:00:50.280> something<00:00:50.430> different

think it was called something different

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.080 
think it was called something different
back<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:52.219> when<00:00:53.219> i<00:00:53.250> did<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.520> dad<00:00:53.699> profile

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
back then but when i did my dad profile

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.630 
back then but when i did my dad profile
then<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.899> knew<00:00:55.410> these<00:00:55.800> cards<00:00:56.190> needed<00:00:56.550> a

then I just knew these cards needed a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.819 
then I just knew these cards needed a
bit<00:00:56.820> more<00:00:56.850> because<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.899> deck<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:58.350> really

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
bit more because the deck was really

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.279 
bit more because the deck was really
funny<00:00:59.070> was<00:00:59.250> really<00:00:59.579> good<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:00.870> these<00:01:01.050> two

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the Theia them so use nightmares effects

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.679 
the Theia them so use nightmares effects
on<00:01:53.009> another<00:01:53.340> nightmare<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.630> go

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
on another nightmare and then you can go

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.340 
on another nightmare and then you can go
into<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.110> heaven<00:01:55.619> strings<00:01:56.280> or<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.170> or<00:01:58.170> just

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
on other gimmick puppet so it's nice to

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.890 
on other gimmick puppet so it's nice to
have<00:02:43.190> these<00:02:43.400> ones<00:02:43.670> here<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:43.910> add<00:02:44.270> that<00:02:44.330> support

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
gimmick puppet XYZ's so then we go on to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.250 
gimmick puppet XYZ's so then we go on to
clockworks<00:02:50.660> semi<00:02:51.410> gamma<00:02:51.800> no<00:02:52.280> sig<00:02:52.790> sig<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.959> gammy

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
clockworks semi gamma no sig sig a gammy

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.130 
clockworks semi gamma no sig sig a gammy
so<00:02:54.800> this<00:02:55.130> card<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.490> very<00:02:55.670> good<00:02:55.880> also<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.959> works

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
so this card is very good also it works

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.930 
so this card is very good also it works
very<00:02:57.230> well<00:02:57.440> for<00:02:57.560> machine<00:02:58.070> types<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.850> can

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
very well for machine types so it can

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.310 
very well for machine types so it can
only<00:02:59.030> be<00:02:59.209> special<00:02:59.480> summoned<00:02:59.510> when<00:02:59.870> on<00:02:59.959> once<00:03:00.170> in

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
only be special summoned when on once in

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.650 
only be special summoned when on once in
the<00:03:00.410> gravy<00:03:00.620> at<00:03:00.770> our<00:03:00.950> machine<00:03:01.430> types<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.450> then

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
the gravy at our machine types and then

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.060 
the gravy at our machine types and then
that<00:03:02.810> also<00:03:02.959> has<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.230> nice<00:03:03.440> little<00:03:03.620> fat<00:03:03.890> ones

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
that also has a nice little fat ones

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.440 
that also has a nice little fat ones
return<00:03:04.370> except<00:03:04.730> one<00:03:04.850> once<00:03:05.000> your<00:03:05.060> opponent

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.340 
controls that targets attack becomes you
into<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.340> end<00:03:07.490> phase<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.900> can<00:03:09.050> go<00:03:09.200> into

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
into the end phase so you can go into

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.840 
into the end phase so you can go into
this<00:03:09.560> at<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:09.860> same<00:03:10.070> time<00:03:10.280> then<00:03:10.550> you<00:03:10.580> could

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
this at the same time then you could

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.460 
this at the same time then you could
summon<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.150> machine<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.510> can<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:11.930> I'll<00:03:12.050> possibly

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
summon a machine a can and I'll possibly

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.110 
summon a machine a can and I'll possibly
use<00:03:12.560> machine<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.920> cannon<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.550> send<00:03:13.790> up<00:03:13.910> one<00:03:14.030> of

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
use machine a cannon to send up one of

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.460 
use machine a cannon to send up one of
these<00:03:14.209> other<00:03:14.390> machines<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:14.959> graveyard

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
these other machines to the graveyard

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.830 
these other machines to the graveyard
then<00:03:16.010> use<00:03:16.160> clockwork<00:03:16.580> skimming<00:03:17.030> skimmer

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
then use clockwork skimming skimmer

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.470 
then use clockwork skimming skimmer
