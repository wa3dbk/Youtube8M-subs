using the m16 as my burst fire weapon up

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.640 
using the m16 as my burst fire weapon up
until<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.369> game<00:00:23.550> before<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.529> then<00:00:25.529> i

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
until the game before this then i

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.290 
until the game before this then i
finally<00:00:25.949> completed<00:00:26.580> all<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.760> challenges<00:00:26.939> for

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
finally completed all the challenges for

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.200 
finally completed all the challenges for
the<00:00:27.359> m16<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.279> i'll<00:00:29.699> give<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:29.910> from<00:00:30.090> us

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the m16 so that I i'll give it from us

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.450 
the m16 so that I i'll give it from us
ago<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:32.160> i'm<00:00:32.279> very<00:00:32.610> happy<00:00:32.820> i<00:00:33.000> did<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:34.460> cannot

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
ago and i'm very happy i did I cannot

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.760 
ago and i'm very happy i did I cannot
give<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> pretty<00:00:36.780> direct<00:00:36.930> comparison<00:00:37.649> between

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
give a pretty direct comparison between

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.410 
give a pretty direct comparison between
them<00:00:38.070> yeah<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.770> for<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.040> weapon<00:00:41.399> by<00:00:41.790> far

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.270 

so<00:00:45.420> usually<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.020> start<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.500> waste<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.129> I'll

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so usually when I start on waste on I'll

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.709 
so usually when I start on waste on I'll
get<00:00:47.550> around<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:47.969> sort<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.360> section

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
get around to this sort of section

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
get around to this sort of section
because<00:00:50.059> at<00:00:51.059> least<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.570> body<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.110> sort<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.500> half

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
because at least I body a sort of half

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.760 
because at least I body a sort of half
hidden<00:00:53.010> from<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.520> little<00:00:53.610> hill<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
hidden from this little hill here I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.350 
hidden from this little hill here I
could<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:56.010> most<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> main<00:00:56.760> spots<00:00:57.149> before

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
could see most of the main spots before

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.740 
could see most of the main spots before
10<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.430> any<00:00:59.430> hard<00:00:59.640> spots<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.329> window<00:01:00.629> of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
10 you on any hard spots in a window of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.240 
10 you on any hard spots in a window of
that<00:01:00.870> building<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.530> since<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.829> can't<00:01:02.039> see

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
that building so since you can't see

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
that building so since you can't see
through<00:01:03.739> if<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.040> too<00:01:05.159> risky<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.820> got<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.780> little

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
through if it's too risky I got a little

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.600 
through if it's too risky I got a little
too<00:01:07.110> risky<00:01:07.530> there<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.770> run<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.250> buy<00:01:08.310> just

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
too risky there to run out and buy just

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.679 
too risky there to run out and buy just
turn<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.240> other<00:01:09.360> way<00:01:09.740> anyway<00:01:10.740> um<00:01:11.390> yeah<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> got

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
turn the other way anyway um yeah I got

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.270 
turn the other way anyway um yeah I got
a<00:01:12.840> few<00:01:13.080> thousand<00:01:13.590> kills<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:13.860> whatever<00:01:14.100> with

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
a few thousand kills or whatever with

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.090 
a few thousand kills or whatever with
the<00:01:14.460> m6<00:01:15.180> day<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.600> directly<00:01:16.140> after<00:01:16.830> using

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the m6 day and then directly after using

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.399 
the m6 day and then directly after using
it<00:01:17.250> all<00:01:17.400> for<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.090> couple<00:01:18.299> hours<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.780> directly

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
it all for a couple hours I directly

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.560 
it all for a couple hours I directly
went<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.920> weapon<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:21.210> weapon

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
went to this weapon and this weapon

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.050 
went to this weapon and this weapon
vlogs<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> m16<00:01:23.009> honestly

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
vlogs the m16 honestly

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.360 
vlogs the m16 honestly
this<00:01:26.060> seems<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:27.140> fire<00:01:27.380> its<00:01:27.710> three<00:01:28.010> bullets

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
this seems to fire its three bullets

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.220 
this seems to fire its three bullets
quicker<00:01:28.850> like<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.390> burst<00:01:29.600> is<00:01:29.780> quicker<00:01:30.020> so

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
quicker like the burst is quicker so

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.350 
quicker like the burst is quicker so
when<00:01:30.410> someone's<00:01:30.770> running<00:01:30.950> in<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:32.030> distance

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
when someone's running in the distance

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.470 
when someone's running in the distance
you<00:01:32.450> can<00:01:32.630> hit<00:01:32.780> him<00:01:32.900> with<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:34.520> all<00:01:34.610> seems

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
you can hit him with it and it all seems

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.940 
you can hit him with it and it all seems
to<00:01:35.630> kill<00:01:35.780> in<00:01:35.930> one<00:01:36.080> verse<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.470> lot<00:01:36.620> more<00:01:36.770> than<00:01:36.830> the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
to kill in one verse a lot more than the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.000 
to kill in one verse a lot more than the
m16<00:01:37.370> even<00:01:37.820> with<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.000> holographic<00:01:38.800> hang<00:01:39.800> on

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
m16 even with the holographic hang on

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.810 
m16 even with the holographic hang on
the<00:01:40.130> m16<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.930> recoil<00:01:45.470> on<00:01:45.680> this<00:01:45.860> seems<00:01:46.310> even

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
the m16 the recoil on this seems even

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.860 
the m16 the recoil on this seems even
lower<00:01:47.030> than<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.660> m16<00:01:48.170> with<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.650> hollow<00:01:49.870> like

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
lower than the m16 with the hollow like

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.160 
lower than the m16 with the hollow like
on<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.290> rail<00:01:51.590> or<00:01:51.860> this<00:01:52.100> move<00:01:52.430> map<00:01:53.020> sometimes<00:01:54.020> I

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
on the rail or this move map sometimes I

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.720 
on the rail or this move map sometimes I
can't<00:01:54.380> even<00:01:54.410> see<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.830> person<00:01:55.010> all<00:01:55.340> I<00:01:55.370> can<00:01:55.580> see

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
can't even see the person all I can see

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.070 
can't even see the person all I can see
us<00:01:55.760> their<00:01:56.000> muzzle<00:01:56.390> flash<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:58.610> I'm<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.720> why

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
us their muzzle flash and I'm and why

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.680 
us their muzzle flash and I'm and why
save<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:00.380> behind<00:02:00.620> a<00:02:01.120> wall<00:02:02.120> or<00:02:02.150> something<00:02:02.330> and

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
save it behind a wall or something and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.420 
save it behind a wall or something and
you<00:02:02.780> can<00:02:02.810> t<00:02:02.990> see<00:02:03.110> their<00:02:03.260> head<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:03.680> I<00:02:04.100> can<00:02:04.250> still

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
you can t see their head and I can still

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.430 
you can t see their head and I can still
kill<00:02:04.580> them<00:02:04.670> in<00:02:04.760> one<00:02:04.940> burst<00:02:05.180> with<00:02:05.510> this<00:02:05.660> so<00:02:06.170> it

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
kill them in one burst with this so it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.920 
kill them in one burst with this so it
means<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.370> hits<00:02:07.550> must<00:02:07.790> acquit<00:02:08.060> in<00:02:08.780> the

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
means to the hits must acquit in the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.930 
means to the hits must acquit in the

almost tropical is useless the only

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.420 
almost tropical is useless the only
reason<00:04:34.380> i<00:04:34.440> turned<00:04:34.710> my<00:04:34.800> killstreaks<00:04:34.980> up<00:04:35.280> for

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
reason i turned my killstreaks up for

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.070 
reason i turned my killstreaks up for
this<00:04:35.520> game<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:35.790> yet<00:04:36.240> she'll<00:04:36.720> forget<00:04:36.900> guys

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
this game and yet she'll forget guys

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.790 
this game and yet she'll forget guys
cooking<00:04:37.710> crazy<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.990> only<00:04:40.200> reason<00:04:40.350> i<00:04:40.530> turned

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
cooking crazy the only reason i turned

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.670 
cooking crazy the only reason i turned
like<00:04:41.070> two<00:04:41.280> strings<00:04:41.610> up<00:04:41.760> for<00:04:41.910> this<00:04:41.970> matter<00:04:42.680> were

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
like two strings up for this matter were

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.159 
like two strings up for this matter were
because<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.550> game<00:04:44.790> before<00:04:44.940> this<00:04:45.300> norm<00:04:46.050> is

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
because the game before this norm is

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.820
