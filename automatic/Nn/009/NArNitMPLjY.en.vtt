00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
and we had this dream to create a trophy

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.520 
and we had this dream to create a trophy
fishery<00:00:47.790> and<00:00:48.060> we<00:00:48.780> really<00:00:49.080> didn't<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.380> how<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
fishery and we really didn't know how to

fishery and we really didn't know how to
do<00:00:49.830> it<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.489> kind<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.030> learn<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.720> you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
do it and it was kind of a learn as you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.470 
do it and it was kind of a learn as you
go<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.620> believe<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.450> practices<00:00:54.450> and

fishing on about a six acre pond here

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
fishing on about a six acre pond here
nothing<00:01:01.170> too<00:01:01.320> big<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.070> all<00:01:02.460> we've<00:01:02.640> simply

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
nothing too big and all we've simply

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.329 
nothing too big and all we've simply
done<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.540> we've<00:01:03.780> had<00:01:04.050> a<00:01:04.410> ball<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.979> come<00:01:05.190> out

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
done is we've had a ball just come out

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.249 
done is we've had a ball just come out
once<00:01:05.640> or<00:01:05.820> twice<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.990> give<00:01:07.110> us

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
once or twice to just give us

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.410 
once or twice to just give us
recommendations<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.910> can<00:01:09.119> tell<00:01:09.300> you

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
recommendations and what I can tell you

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.070 
recommendations and what I can tell you
we<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.979> make<00:01:11.130> sure<00:01:11.340> our<00:01:11.369> pH<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.080> proper

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
we do is we make sure our pH is proper

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.760 
we do is we make sure our pH is proper
in<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> pond

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
in the pond

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.940 
in the pond
we're<00:01:14.100> about<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.640> apply<00:01:14.790> about<00:01:15.600> four<00:01:15.960> tons<00:01:16.560> per

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
we're about to apply about four tons per

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.100 
we're about to apply about four tons per
acre<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.369> lime<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.910> you<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.570> every<00:01:18.630> four

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
acre of lime and you do that every four

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.719 
acre of lime and you do that every four
to<00:01:19.229> six<00:01:19.470> years<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.220> needed

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
to six years or as needed

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.210 
to six years or as needed
so<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.390> fertilizing<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.410> we<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.770> hit

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
so the fertilizing that we do hit

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.880 
so the fertilizing that we do hit
targets<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.450> plankton<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.350> zooplankton

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
targets the plankton and zooplankton

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.160 
targets the plankton and zooplankton
that<00:01:26.399> feeds<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> bluegill<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.720> bluegill

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that feeds the bluegill and the bluegill

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.170 
that feeds the bluegill and the bluegill
and<00:01:28.380> our<00:01:28.560> pond<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> backbone<00:01:29.580> of<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:29.970> food

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and our pond is the backbone of the food

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.030 
and our pond is the backbone of the food
chain<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.050> all<00:01:31.229> these<00:01:31.380> bats<00:01:31.649> that<00:01:31.860> we're

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
chain and all these bats that we're

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.920 
chain and all these bats that we're
catching<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.910> is<00:01:33.119> what<00:01:33.270> they're<00:01:33.420> targeting

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
catching that is what they're targeting

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.630 
catching that is what they're targeting
is<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.229> bluegill<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.220> way<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.610> to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
is the bluegill and the way I like to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.150 
is the bluegill and the way I like to
see<00:01:35.910> it<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.300> get<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> big<00:01:36.810> fat<00:01:37.160> largemouth

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
see it is to get a big fat largemouth

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.070 
see it is to get a big fat largemouth
you<00:01:38.789> want<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.240> food<00:01:39.479> readily<00:01:39.990> available

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080

you want to have a lot of bluegill and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.510 
you want to have a lot of bluegill and
he<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.630> swim<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> few<00:01:43.289> feet<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.920> gobble

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
he can just swim a few feet and gobble

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.200 
he can just swim a few feet and gobble
up<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.729> couple<00:01:44.970> actually<00:01:45.720> I'm<00:01:46.020> fishing<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:47.210> white

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
up a couple actually I'm fishing a white

up a couple actually I'm fishing a white
oak<00:01:48.390> tree<00:01:48.660> here<00:01:48.959> that<00:01:49.140> we've<00:01:49.319> pushed<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
oak tree here that we've pushed in the

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.330 
oak tree here that we've pushed in the
in<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.700> pond<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:52.590> got<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.920> create<00:01:53.100> that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
in the pond and you got to create that

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.639 
in the pond and you got to create that
cover<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.880> give<00:01:54.090> your<00:01:54.300> bait<00:01:54.750> fish<00:01:55.050> some<00:01:55.319> relief

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
cover to give your bait fish some relief

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.279 
cover to give your bait fish some relief
you<00:01:56.130> can't<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.880> much<00:01:57.030> exposure<00:01:57.569> that<00:01:57.929> the

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
you can't have so much exposure that the

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.499 
you can't have so much exposure that the
bass<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:59.130> wear<00:01:59.459> them<00:01:59.580> out<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.970> you're<00:02:00.090> left

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
bass just wear them out and you're left

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.630 
bass just wear them out and you're left
with<00:02:00.720> no<00:02:00.869> bluegill<00:02:01.289> so<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.560> got<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.160> have<00:02:02.310> good

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
with no bluegill so you got to have good

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.630 
with no bluegill so you got to have good
structure<00:02:03.200> in<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.380> back<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:05.459> just

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
structure in the back here and it's just

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.300 
structure in the back here and it's just
a<00:02:05.729> great<00:02:05.850> place<00:02:06.149> for<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:07.170> bass<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.590> ambush<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
a great place for the bass to ambush the

a great place for the bass to ambush the
prey<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.179> prey<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> place<00:02:10.740> to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.430 
prey and for the prey to have a place to
