00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
going to become like an iPad air or like

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.300 
going to become like an iPad air or like
an<00:00:26.670> ipod<00:00:27.000> touch<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.570> terms<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.869> its<00:00:28.019> design<00:00:28.310> way

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
an ipod touch in terms of its design way

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.759 
an ipod touch in terms of its design way
more<00:00:29.580> rounded<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.320> sides<00:00:31.590> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
more rounded on on the sides and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.610 
more rounded on on the sides and
everything<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.579> use<00:00:33.570> way<00:00:33.899> thinner<00:00:34.320> in

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
everything and use way thinner in

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.910 
everything and use way thinner in
general<00:00:35.149> so<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.510> potential<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> right<00:00:37.649> side

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
general so a potential on the right side

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
general so a potential on the right side
so<00:00:38.690> it<00:00:39.690> has<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> 4-inch<00:00:40.370> screen<00:00:41.370> i<00:00:41.610> think<00:00:42.050> yeah

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
so it has a 4-inch screen i think yeah

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.420 
so it has a 4-inch screen i think yeah
it<00:00:43.230> should<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.620> 4-inch<00:00:43.920> p<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> think

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it should have a 4-inch p and I think

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.569 
it should have a 4-inch p and I think
not<00:00:44.879> three<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.329> college<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.250> see<00:00:47.370> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
not three in college so you can see this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.180 
not three in college so you can see this
one<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.940> pretty<00:00:48.270> thin<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:49.440> insanely<00:00:49.860> thin

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190

and this one is four point seven ish i
actually<00:01:31.740> hear<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.040> would<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.200> kind

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
of see also as you see here side by side

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.120 
of see also as you see here side by side
you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.640> little<00:01:38.670> bit<00:01:38.970> bigger<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
you can see it's a little bit bigger and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.270 
you can see it's a little bit bigger and
also<00:01:41.130> when<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.610> put<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.090> one<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.540> top<00:01:43.189> you<00:01:44.189> can

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
also when we put this one on top you can

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.789 
also when we put this one on top you can
also<00:01:44.430> see<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:46.399> there<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.430> different<00:01:48.030> there

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
also see that there is different there

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.460 
also see that there is different there
in<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:51.060> low<00:01:51.299> part<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:54.990> also<00:01:55.170> see

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
in the this low part you can also see

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.149 
in the this low part you can also see
here<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> top<00:01:56.100> area<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.710> that's<00:01:58.710> also<00:01:58.920> pretty

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
here the top area and that's also pretty

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.639 
here the top area and that's also pretty
interesting<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.750> terms<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.110> thickness

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
interesting but in terms of thickness

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.060 
interesting but in terms of thickness
they<00:02:02.040> seem<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.490> very<00:02:02.640> very<00:02:03.090> identical<00:02:03.659> i

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070

mean<00:02:05.070> very<00:02:05.520> very<00:02:05.969> identical<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:08.220> would

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
mean very very identical and that would

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.980 
mean very very identical and that would
be<00:02:08.520> pretty<00:02:09.030> good<00:02:09.539> for<00:02:09.810> apple<00:02:10.110> kissed<00:02:10.440> indeed

super<00:02:43.450> huge<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:44.080> mean<00:02:44.440> Lee<00:02:44.860> would<00:02:45.640> start

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
super huge I mean Lee would start

compare this against Andrew phones which
actually<00:02:47.620> have<00:02:47.950> done<00:02:48.210> it's<00:02:49.210> really<00:02:49.690> not<00:02:49.930> that

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
actually have done it's really not that

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.320 
actually have done it's really not that
a<00:02:50.260> big<00:02:50.350> deal<00:02:50.830> in<00:02:51.040> terms<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.430> size<00:02:51.790> difference

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
a big deal in terms of size difference

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.780 
a big deal in terms of size difference
and<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:53.500> cool<00:02:53.710> things<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.100> I<00:02:54.310> said<00:02:54.550> that

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
and the cool things that I said that

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
thin and I don't really know if they

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.110 
thin and I don't really know if they
could<00:03:04.840> pull<00:03:05.170> off<00:03:05.380> this<00:03:05.950> with<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.850> phone

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
could pull off this with the phone

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.840 
could pull off this with the phone
having<00:03:07.930> all<00:03:08.230> those<00:03:08.440> things<00:03:08.770> and<00:03:09.190> internal

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
having all those things and internal

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.620 
having all those things and internal
phone<00:03:10.630> parts<00:03:11.140> inside<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:12.150> but<00:03:13.150> then<00:03:13.300> again<00:03:13.420> it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
phone parts inside and but then again it

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.690 
phone parts inside and but then again it
kind<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.840> feels<00:03:13.990> like<00:03:14.200> they<00:03:14.350> can<00:03:14.530> do<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.830> that

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
kind of feels like they can do this that

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.240 
kind of feels like they can do this that
they<00:03:15.850> can<00:03:15.970> pull<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:16.300> off<00:03:16.770> when<00:03:17.770> they<00:03:17.890> already

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
they can pull this off when they already

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.030 
they can pull this off when they already
done<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.610> with<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.850> ipod<00:03:19.120> touch<00:03:19.330> and<00:03:19.600> they<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
done it with the ipod touch and they the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.040 
done it with the ipod touch and they the
ipod<00:03:21.310> touch<00:03:21.520> they<00:03:22.390> have<00:03:22.480> been<00:03:22.600> doing<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:22.990> for

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
ipod touch they have been doing that for

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.930 
ipod touch they have been doing that for
like<00:03:23.230> two<00:03:23.440> or<00:03:23.470> three<00:03:23.620> years<00:03:24.070> now<00:03:24.340> this<00:03:24.670> kind<00:03:24.880> of

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
like two or three years now this kind of

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.970 
like two or three years now this kind of
design<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.990> they<00:03:26.110> should<00:03:26.290> probably<00:03:26.680> be<00:03:26.770> able

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
design so they should probably be able

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.290 
design so they should probably be able
to<00:03:27.100> pull<00:03:27.370> off<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:28.080> an<00:03:29.080> iphone<00:03:29.940> which<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.090> very
