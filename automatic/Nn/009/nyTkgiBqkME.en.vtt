00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
edge of my now so it was a little bit

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.780 
edge of my now so it was a little bit
harder<00:05:49.050> to<00:05:49.080> work<00:05:49.320> with<00:05:49.380> of<00:05:49.890> saying<00:05:50.520> that<00:05:50.700> what

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
harder to work with of saying that what

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.790

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
you did get it down flat and you worked
