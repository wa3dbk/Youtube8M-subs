 video description 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:34.250
 and now we start with the preparation we start with 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.250
 the fact that the barbarian is mixed with flour 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.820
 at low speed 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:21.710
 then our shop is frayed with flour in 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.160
 separate capacity mix listen to us 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.160
 our remaining ingredient 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.180
 our 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.399
 two ingredients 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.399
 here he is now mixing them 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.399
 to be bent 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.060
 and mask it we mix 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.500
 until our dough is 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.500
 will become homogeneous 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:10.330
 ready dough we in small portions 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.330
 impose a preheated form 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:03:00.750
 distributed we put on a small fire and 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:03.660
 fry until golden brown our 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:18.720
 semi-finished products have already acquired golden 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:23.790
 shade, we spread their spacing 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:28.080
 cool down after our preparations 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:32.640

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.810
 filling them with condensed milk 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:44.690
 so to fill our nuts 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.690
 we take condensed milk boiled and 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.110
 oil of room temperature and from 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.110
 we mix 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:03.260
 just gently mixed do not whisk 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.680
 otherwise you will get condensed milk cream with 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.680
