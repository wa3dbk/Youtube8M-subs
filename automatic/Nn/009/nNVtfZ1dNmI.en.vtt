00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.000
 let's practice adding and subtracting numbers 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.789
 negative I'll give an example I'll 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.490
 put here the 2 minus 3 then I'm 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:13.889
 subtracting the positive numbers but 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.160
 you can see that I'm subtracting a number 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.500
 greater than another true 13 is greater than 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.509
 on 2 and is on the right side then 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.310
 this but probably not in fact not 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.890
 probably but it will end 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.839
 being a negative number the result and 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.970
 we can think about this for the moment I'm going to 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.820
 draw here a number line we put 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.720
 here the 0 1 and 2 and the minus 1 and the minus 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 2 and we can start from 2 then 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:44.370
 we start from here and we are going to subtract 3 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:49.500
 of that 2 then we move 3 steps 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.040
 to the left 1 2 and 3 and there what 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.810
 we have then this is equal to minus 1 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.650
 and now let's mix it up a little 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:02.190
 things let's imagine that now we're going 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.220
 to subtract minus 2 minus three then 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.720
 first we had a positive 2 minus 3 and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.790
 now we have a negative 2 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.130
 and what I 'm going to do is draw again 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.390
 the number line then here I'm going to 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:23.620
 put to 0 to 1 and here I have at least 1 - 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:26.650
 2 - 3 - 4 minus 5 minus 6 and so I 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.170
 could continue indefinitely then 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.920
 We started at least two and move 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:37.960
 three to the left so we're going to 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.190
 move would be 1 2 and 3 and we end up in 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.490
 at least 5 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.340
 this is equal then to minus 5 and note 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.580
 that in both situations we subtract 3 but 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.100
 here I started with a 2 to the right of the 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.009
 0 while here I start with a 2 to the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.759
 left of 0 let's make another example 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:01.150
 so that this is a little clearer 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:06.570
 I'm going to put here that you think the least 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:09.110
 2 minus 2 + 3 minus two plus 3 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.270
 encourage yourself to pause the video and 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.350
 try it yourself but good let's continue 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:20.910
 I put here the number line here they go 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:25.630
 here I put the minus 2 minus 10 1 and 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:29.590
 2 we start with the minus 2 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:33.520
 and 2 to the left of 0 and add 3 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.450
 then you advance 3 to the right 1 2 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.770
 and 3 and we have 1 positive so the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.240
 answer here is 1 positive now I'm going to 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.480
 make another example 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:51.370
 another example let's say that I have I have 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.280
 2 positive and we subtract a negative 3 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.890
 then there is a video where I explain 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.560
 why this makes sense haha but 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.890
 when you are a negative number what 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.270
 what are you doing this is the same as 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.140
 add the positive 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.050
 lets explain this in another way let's say 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.780
 that this the same as 2 + 3 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.440
 it's the same as two plus 3 these two 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.590
 arguments are equivalent and we have 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.570
 that this is equal to 5 now let's make another 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.350
 example let's mix a little more the 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.350
 things, let's say I have the one 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.380
 it seems if it does 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.650
 2 negative then minus 2 and you 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.960
 we subtract minus 3 and it may be that we see 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.970
 all these negative signs intimidate you 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.940
 a little but you just have to remember 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.280
 you remember that when you subtract a 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.340
 negative number gives you a positive number 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.570
 in this case this is the same thing 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.270
 exactly the same as minus 2 + 3 what 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.730
 which we had already resolved before here 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.720
 is up look we started in the less 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.190
 2 which is to the left of 0 and 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:08.030
 We were advancing 3 steps to the right 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.030
 then 1 2 and 3 we have one positive
