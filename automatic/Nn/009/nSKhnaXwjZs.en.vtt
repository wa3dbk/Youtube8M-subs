00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:09.810
 hello today, another crash test 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.260
 I will spend it on myself on my 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.280
 hide 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.160
 and Stanislav will help me he will 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.119
 assist in what the essence 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.130
 crash test like all the novers know 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.560
 mono is a stretch so I 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.289
 for example when catching fiderom always 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.869
 I recommend to put braided cord when 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.270
 you catch at distances let's say there 50 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.039
 meters and more well, in fact, did even 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.320
 if 40 meters and more anyway 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.480
 it is better to use braided cord for 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.510
 order to demonstrate 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.739
 Now this extensibility that we will do 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.519
 Here we have equipped Fedor mono fishing line 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.100
 measured 50 meters along the shore and on that 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.289
 end of cord 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.399
 more precisely monoleski tied not at all 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.170
 feeder feeder and not even a leash 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.650
 tied here this one terrible wobbler 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.080
 with nine hooks I'll take this wobbler 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.240
 in hand will stay me hook 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.160
 and we'll see if I need to go 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:18.690
 then take the hooks to the emergency room 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:21.950
 or not or on the spot before or here here I am 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.290
 I take it all in my hand without any fools 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.380
 here if suddenly that covers will be at me 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.680
 all in hand for some reason I am sure that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.620
 monophile won't let me down unlike 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.320
 video where I supposedly stuck my finger 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.210
 no hook on my gloves 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.590
 there is nothing here is my most ordinary hand 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:48.230
 Here is this nightmare wobbler, I take it so 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:53.720
 for all the hooks here and now we will 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:59.760
 pull harder 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.520
 very good cutting before comrades I 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.130
 I'll tell you, or I'm knee-deep wooden 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.880
 feel nothing or all the same 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.010
 a mono on 50 meters is not leaking fish 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.530
 let us show you everything now 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.080
 how is she 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.120
 to understand that there are no dirty tricks here 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.100
 no, everything is honest absolutely i'm honest 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.100
 I hold this terrible wobbler here with covers 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:30.750
 drunk on my finger and stas honest 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:34.950
 flogs me twitch twitch of horoshenechko 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.440
 all with a turn over there is cut in 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.270
 my hand is a little bit 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:55.480
 jerks come on can be so cry out come on 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:59.440
 not stronger and will not go me so not 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:05.910
 podsech stronger 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:09.700
 about strength oh oh oh nothing is normal yet 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.670
 I had a hook 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.910
 hook somewhere else I was standing here 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.060
 hook them straight right on the skin and nothing 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.310
 nothing happened here all clean arm 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.680
 we saw no trace on the palm 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.420
 you don't have to go to the emergency room 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.090
 God, on the spot, too, do not bite 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.770
 for stas honestly yanked say tell because 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.240
 that they may not believe what we all did 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.550
 honestly honestly yanked yes with a turn 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.890
 yanked with yanked yanked left 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.840
 only took two steps back to 50 meters 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.150
 to nothing you led it 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.460
 exactly for sure we are still 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.590
 when already filmed 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.840
 decided to check and from what distance 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.330
 it still starts to be felt and 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.980
 no longer under the camera found out that somewhere 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.590
 20-25 meters to something like 15-20 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.310
 it is like that 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.800
 feel that the hooks scream all 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.020
 what next I somehow got used to assume that 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.450
 all what's next where is 35 40 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.730
 these were days but now after that 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.280
 experiment I can safely say for 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.940
 such an ordinary monophile and which is strongly 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.760
 all that goes on 25 meters all 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.270
 just a cord i think we are enough 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.310
 visually 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.360
 showed here on this evil wobblers and 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.930
 my arm that far distance on 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.289
 feeder 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.009
 This braided line all good nor 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.009
 tail scales 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.850
 on 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.240
 Well
