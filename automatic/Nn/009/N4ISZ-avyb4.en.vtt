00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 How do I make people do it? 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.630
 I'm going to change this today. 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:16.049
 here in the trunk of 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:21.090
 and will install these two in a 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.010
 plate floor but they are beings of light 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 position during the day 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:32.489
 I do not know how it is, it 's a problem 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.730
 that I came back here is is dug here not 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.680
 I know if you can see it seems that the focus 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:47.690
 It is not very nice or lighting 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:47.690
 also in the garage and the problem will be 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:57.600
 this from here to paste 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.219
 this part down here to illuminate the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:06.710
 suitcase right to do this I 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:10.650
 I will also use it is a pedals adapter 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.090
 a leftover one of a ceiling led that 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.090
 I bought 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:24.509
 so I'm going to cut this thread here 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:26.990
 I'm going to cut it and adapt it in the family. 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:32.119
 So, how do we start doing? 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:36.800
 this procedure here in gd here 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:40.020
 taking plastic part port 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:44.420
 so in my how it has're 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:51.960
 I already left emails or issue just pulling it 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:55.080
 can make a stool take care 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.700
 with a key and still wrapped in a 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.280
 or with the one who had an advantage 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.060
 plate panel so you can take this 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.790
 here is more complicated piece has three 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:18.350
 here's a screw here and I'm here 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:29.130
 I took it using this measure that 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:35.459
 now you have to take this is a key 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.650
 Allen and now now took all 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.980
 screws 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:48.090
 now it's fitting this whole piece here, huh? 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:51.780
 then pulled here or here for supporting 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.530
 pass the eraser down then I go 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.040
 Start pulling here, here 's my 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.440
 so there's a lock that she gets 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.680
 this way then 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:14.860
 let's see if I went out there leveraged 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:17.150
 almost the whole piece is already gone 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.230
 here is a loop 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:25.010
 here is another president must have more 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.540
 some lock and internally this 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.630
 chair by the two tabs there 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.270
 now that the passenger side is well 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:42.500
 here come here so there's another one 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:46.480
 that a lock a little bit already 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.480
 had taken his hand 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:04:00.400
 but she came out right and took the 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:03.700
 Clamps here today fastens belt 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.250
 if I can not show the man over there 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.290
 is so for big cujubim 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.980
 this screw has not known to 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.540
 take it off then I'll have to turn around without 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.709
 take it out 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:27.250
 the piece here just me and him such a way that 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:31.060
 I needed to move after my 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.780
 adaptation in Europe, I just did the 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.780
 business works 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:46.910
 and it works now to pass the cables to cnaa 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.000
 inside 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.930
 Let's do it in here, I'll leave it. 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.560
 arrested the other will pass through banks 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.830
 following this channel all goes 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.320
 go inside and come down here 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:07.100
 I'm not going to have that one too. 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:11.030
 Stop it, we will not end there. 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:16.940
 now almost finishing you the tail 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:23.120
 through the hole in the cover 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:24.820
 here alone running here passing 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.230
 here then 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:33.760
 surprise with a little reform 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:36.040
 Cat Coalition risk going here 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.890
 not yet right 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:46.330
 and here is the same thing also by 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:48.600
 hole in the cap stuck back here just 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:55.420
 close here now in both eyes 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:57.540
 working just paste now and already show 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:06.640
 how does one detail they want 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:09.670
 necklace with this tape that okay I know 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.090
 She's like banana tape, but she has some other 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.810
 name is double versus ac good result 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.810
 personal final 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.330
 the lighting on both sides 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.330
 OK 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:41.260
 it goes well where it has cap cable 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.260
 here it just does not crush the movie
