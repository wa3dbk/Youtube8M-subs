00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.320
 here is the undisputed star of the brand 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.730
 smart the fortwo a model that has 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.080
 sold over a million and a half 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.550
 of copies since its 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.250
 marketing about 15 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.779
 years here is the third generation then 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.390
 the specifications are pretty much 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.000
 similar to the previous version know 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.650
 a template always very compact 2069 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.570
 do not just move we worked a 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.730
 little bit about livability by offering 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.260
 an upper width of 10 cm smart a 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.850
 basically worked and of course the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.829
 design then that's subjective 1 that 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.660
 really changes at the level of the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.520
 grille fire for the rest the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.290
 telematics the engines are 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.219
 shared with the group renault me ​​this 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.539
 that I propose to you it is of the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.850
 discover hot immediately at 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.379
 inside then the good point is that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.989
 the fortwo retains its aspect rather 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.120
 modern nice enough as with these nozzles 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.829
 aeration way of golf balls 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.050
 instrumentation and digital to 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.760
 the interior overall is very 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.590
 spacious this is the significant gain 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.470
 by a generation season prof 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.600
 what we do not like very much is this 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.400
 multimedia console that arrives a little bit of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.869
 nowhere is a little cheap it moves 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.210
 a bit it's not terrible frankly 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.299
 but overall the balance sheet is rather 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.299
 positive 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.490
 I would say we tried to work 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.260
 on a real bias in terms of 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.520
 exterior design as well 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.470
 than inside also with the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.030
 customization since depending on 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.140
 different configurations we have more than 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.880
 thirty possible variants 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.340
 that was a real challenge in 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.010
 particular for designers to have 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.980
 finally managed to put a whole 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.710
 new car in a rectangle of 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.240
 two meters 69 long 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.530
 now it's hard to talk about 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.360
 road behavior but we know 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.160
 and already that smart as is working 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.840
 basically about agility by offering 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.520
 a much shorter turning circle 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.320
 than before and especially by strengthening 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.090
 the level of comfort and suspensions 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.620
 it will be seen on a next test 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.430
 in the meantime you will find it at 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.540
 World of Paris 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.100
 all for marketing 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.100
 expected nine laws
