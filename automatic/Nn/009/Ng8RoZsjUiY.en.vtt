that depiction in comparison with the
submissiveness<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:52.600> know<00:00:52.720> that<00:00:53.079> the

contrast<00:00:59.590> which<00:00:59.890> Angra<00:01:00.520> depicted<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.120> think<00:01:01.360> so

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
contrast which Angra depicted I think so

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.960 
contrast which Angra depicted I think so
successfully<00:01:02.110> here<00:01:02.440> was<00:01:03.430> considered<00:01:03.820> by<00:01:03.910> many

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
successfully here was considered by many

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.030 
successfully here was considered by many
to<00:01:04.210> be<00:01:04.299> a<00:01:04.629> pictorial<00:01:04.989> representation<00:01:05.950> of

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
to be a pictorial representation of

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
to be a pictorial representation of
patriarchy<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:07.179> idea<00:01:07.569> of<00:01:07.840> male<00:01:08.229> power<00:01:08.530> as

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
patriarchy this idea of male power as

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.929 
patriarchy this idea of male power as
dominant<00:01:10.060> over<00:01:10.179> female<00:01:11.170> subservience<00:01:11.939> but

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
dominant over female subservience but

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.190 
dominant over female subservience but
you<00:01:13.060> can<00:01:13.210> also<00:01:13.359> look<00:01:13.600> at<00:01:13.719> it<00:01:13.929> in<00:01:14.020> a<00:01:14.079> slightly

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
you can also look at it in a slightly

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.770 
you can also look at it in a slightly
different<00:01:14.710> light<00:01:15.179> which<00:01:16.179> i<00:01:16.299> think<00:01:16.359> is<00:01:16.539> maybe<00:01:16.689> a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
different light which i think is maybe a

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.279 
different light which i think is maybe a
little<00:01:16.840> bit<00:01:17.020> less<00:01:18.090> sexist<00:01:19.090> perhaps<00:01:19.450> or<00:01:20.170> maybe

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
little bit less sexist perhaps or maybe

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:21.749 
little bit less sexist perhaps or maybe
not<00:01:20.649> depending<00:01:21.130> on<00:01:21.189> who<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:21.459> ask

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
not depending on who you ask

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.929 
not depending on who you ask
but<00:01:22.209> you<00:01:22.299> can<00:01:22.420> look<00:01:22.509> at<00:01:22.630> it<00:01:22.749> in<00:01:22.840> terms<00:01:22.990> of<00:01:23.259> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
but you can look at it in terms of the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.669 
but you can look at it in terms of the
voluptuousness<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.600> sensuality<00:01:26.139> of<00:01:26.499> the

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
voluptuousness and the sensuality of the

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.349 
voluptuousness and the sensuality of the
female<00:01:27.069> versus<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.030> kind<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.079> authoritative

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
female versus the kind of authoritative

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.019 
female versus the kind of authoritative
austerity<00:01:31.359> or<00:01:31.479> sternness<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.979> male<00:01:33.159> so<00:01:33.909> no

I'm not sure why Angra decided to

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.959
