00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.960
 look what girls took and 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.210
 Listen to what you answered at the casting

 maybe such a way but you have not taken any 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.019
 because you are not beautiful and not because 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.090

 fits the creative concept of this 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.600
 specific project so let's 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.900
