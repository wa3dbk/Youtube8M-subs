00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
anything nothing's going to change we'll

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.180 
anything nothing's going to change we'll
just<00:01:57.480> speed<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.350> gear<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.800> little<00:01:58.980> bit

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
just speed the gear up a little bit

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.730 
just speed the gear up a little bit
we'll<00:01:59.910> do<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.150> same<00:02:00.300> thing<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:01.440> then<00:02:01.620> we'll

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
we'll do the same thing and then we'll

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.830 
we'll do the same thing and then we'll
do<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.010> same<00:02:02.160> thing<00:02:02.400> at<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.550> lope<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.120> can't<00:02:03.690> get

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
do the same thing at a lope I can't get

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.210 
do the same thing at a lope I can't get
too<00:02:03.990> far<00:02:04.020> away<00:02:04.320> from<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.740> characters<00:02:05.130> they

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
too far away from the characters they

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.370 
too far away from the characters they
don't<00:02:05.400> have<00:02:05.550> a<00:02:05.580> PA<00:02:05.970> system<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.750> we're<00:02:07.200> probably

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
don't have a PA system so we're probably

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.750 
don't have a PA system so we're probably
just<00:02:07.590> going<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.890> walk<00:02:08.070> them<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.250> walk<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.700> a
