screw up 8 inches and I'll describe

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:05.880 
screw up 8 inches and I'll describe
another<00:01:51.970> line<00:02:04.440> that's<00:02:05.440> what<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:05.679> call

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
another line that's what you call

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:15.940 
another line that's what you call
progressive<00:02:06.190> training

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.830 

yeah<00:02:16.950> after<00:02:17.549> you<00:02:17.819> draw<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.120> lines<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
yeah after you draw the lines on the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.349 
yeah after you draw the lines on the
board<00:02:19.109> looking<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.939> you<00:02:21.030> cut<00:02:21.239> them

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
board looking like that and you cut them

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.990 
board looking like that and you cut them
out<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.829> get<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.010> couple<00:02:23.250> strips<00:02:23.609> out<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.849> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
out you can get a couple strips out of a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.360 
out you can get a couple strips out of a
board<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:25.349> is<00:02:25.530> what's<00:02:25.709> left<00:02:25.980> over<00:02:26.189> after

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
board and this is what's left over after

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.149 
board and this is what's left over after
a<00:02:26.700> board<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.150> we<00:02:27.239> cut<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.719> strips<00:02:28.049> from<00:02:28.319> we

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
a board that we cut the strips from we

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.440 
a board that we cut the strips from we
then<00:02:29.340> took<00:02:29.609> the<00:02:29.790> strips<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:31.200> attach<00:02:32.450> them

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
then took the strips and attach them

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.110 
then took the strips and attach them
with<00:02:33.480> two<00:02:34.019> by<00:02:34.170> fours<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:35.370> case<00:02:35.609> we<00:02:35.849> took<00:02:36.000> a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
with two by fours in this case we took a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.899 
with two by fours in this case we took a
ninety<00:02:36.480> six<00:02:36.750> inch<00:02:36.989> long<00:02:37.109> stud<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.980> split<00:02:38.790> it

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
ninety six inch long stud and split it

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.940 
ninety six inch long stud and split it
three<00:02:39.180> times<00:02:39.450> minus<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.200> inch<00:02:40.379> for<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.680> half

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
three times minus the inch for the half

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.309 
three times minus the inch for the half
inch<00:02:41.219> here<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:41.730> half<00:02:42.329> inch<00:02:42.569> there<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.049> give<00:02:43.200> us

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
inch here and half inch there to give us

I used the stardrive three inch long
jack<00:02:52.169> screws<00:02:52.530> they<00:02:53.340> they<00:02:53.939> hold<00:02:54.150> up<00:02:54.299> really

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
jack screws they they hold up really

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.599 
jack screws they they hold up really
well<00:02:54.629> and<00:02:54.689> they<00:02:54.989> go<00:02:55.139> in<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.470> out<00:02:55.530> easily<00:02:55.829> we

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
well and they go in and out easily we

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.440 
well and they go in and out easily we
measured<00:02:57.000> our<00:02:57.180> two<00:02:57.659> by<00:02:57.840> fours<00:02:59.000> every<00:03:00.000> eight

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
measured our two by fours every eight

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.990 
measured our two by fours every eight
eight<00:03:01.019> inches<00:03:02.419> and<00:03:03.419> we<00:03:03.629> used<00:03:03.840> one<00:03:04.169> layer<00:03:04.469> of

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
eight inches and we used one layer of

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.270 
eight inches and we used one layer of
half-inch<00:03:06.000> plywood<00:03:06.510> for<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.049> deck<00:03:07.349> you<00:03:08.129> can

half-inch plywood for the deck you can

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.459 
half-inch plywood for the deck you can
see<00:03:08.459> there's<00:03:08.639> two<00:03:08.700> 3-inch<00:03:09.659> screws<00:03:10.079> here<00:03:10.319> on

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
see there's two 3-inch screws here on

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.709

each<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.829> one<00:03:10.919> of<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.129> two<00:03:11.280> by<00:03:11.430> fours<00:03:11.719> and

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
each of one of the two by fours and

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.360 
each of one of the two by fours and
we've<00:03:12.870> got<00:03:13.049> three<00:03:13.379> of<00:03:13.409> the<00:03:13.590> deck<00:03:13.799> screws<00:03:14.129> going

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
we've got three of the deck screws going

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.300 
we've got three of the deck screws going
across<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.969> middle<00:03:15.500> we've<00:03:16.500> got<00:03:16.530> temporary

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
across the middle we've got temporary

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.969 
across the middle we've got temporary
legs<00:03:17.639> in<00:03:17.879> place<00:03:18.030> right<00:03:18.419> now<00:03:18.629> to<00:03:19.440> hold<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.799> one

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:19.979 
legs in place right now to hold this one

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.710 
legs in place right now to hold this one
all<00:03:20.129> together<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.729> this<00:03:20.879> was<00:03:21.060> built<00:03:21.299> from<00:03:21.569> the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
all together and this was built from the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.830 
all together and this was built from the
ten-foot<00:03:22.169> transition<00:03:22.949> it's<00:03:23.940> about<00:03:24.239> five<00:03:24.569> feet

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
ten-foot transition it's about five feet

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.990 
ten-foot transition it's about five feet
high<00:03:25.129> looks<00:03:26.129> like<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.459> could<00:03:26.579> use<00:03:26.609> another

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
high looks like it could use another

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.539 
high looks like it could use another
screw<00:03:27.419> here<00:03:27.750> needs<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.650> get<00:03:28.799> painted<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.459> the

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
screw here needs to get painted in the

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.399 
screw here needs to get painted in the
day<00:03:29.729> after<00:03:29.879> tomorrow<00:03:30.180> without<00:03:30.840> even<00:03:31.079> having<00:03:31.199> a

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
day after tomorrow without even having a

day after tomorrow without even having a
chance<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.739> practice<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.400> much<00:03:32.669> or<00:03:33.329> take<00:03:33.540> it

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
chance to practice on it much or take it

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.110 
chance to practice on it much or take it
out<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:33.930> launch<00:03:34.169> it<00:03:34.439> here's<00:03:35.159> a<00:03:35.310> four<00:03:35.849> foot

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
out and launch it here's a four foot

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.360 
out and launch it here's a four foot
tall<00:03:36.150> out<00:03:36.629> of<00:03:36.750> an<00:03:36.840> 8<00:03:37.019> foot<00:03:37.290> training<00:03:37.769> built

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
tall out of an 8 foot training built

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.610 
tall out of an 8 foot training built
with<00:03:38.579> a<00:03:38.609> little<00:03:38.939> bit<00:03:39.060> wider<00:03:39.329> 2x4<00:03:40.229> so<00:03:40.409> you<00:03:40.500> can

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
with a little bit wider 2x4 so you can

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.530 
with a little bit wider 2x4 so you can
do<00:03:40.709> 360s<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.579> other<00:03:41.669> tricks<00:03:41.970> off<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.209> little

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
do 360s and other tricks off a little

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.780 
do 360s and other tricks off a little
easier<00:03:42.870> just<00:03:43.709> build<00:03:43.919> a<00:03:44.009> couple<00:03:44.189> of<00:03:44.400> braces

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
easier just build a couple of braces

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.939 
easier just build a couple of braces
across<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.299> back<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:46.199> one<00:03:46.409> has<00:03:46.620> long

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
across the back this one has long

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.110 
across the back this one has long
quarter-inch<00:03:47.609> thick<00:03:47.729> and<00:03:48.150> two<00:03:48.659> layers<00:03:48.930> and

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
quarter-inch thick and two layers and

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.849 
quarter-inch thick and two layers and
also<00:03:51.120> our<00:03:51.509> spacing<00:03:51.959> for<00:03:52.079> two<00:03:52.229> by<00:03:52.379> fours<00:03:52.680> is

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
also our spacing for two by fours is

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.520 
also our spacing for two by fours is
eight<00:03:53.040> inches<00:03:53.569> so<00:03:54.569> that<00:03:54.750> gives<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.139> a<00:03:55.169> four

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
eight inches so that gives you a four

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.619 
eight inches so that gives you a four
foot<00:03:55.769> high<00:03:55.979> eight<00:03:56.430> foot<00:03:56.790> radius<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:58.400> we

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
foot high eight foot radius and we

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.119 
foot high eight foot radius and we
elected<00:04:00.629> to<00:04:00.720> use<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.049> entire<00:04:01.349> piece<00:04:01.799> of<00:04:02.009> the

elected to use the entire piece of the

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.819 
elected to use the entire piece of the
plywood<00:04:02.909> for<00:04:03.419> the<00:04:03.509> legs<00:04:03.750> rather<00:04:04.049> than<00:04:04.319> using

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
plywood for the legs rather than using

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.039 
plywood for the legs rather than using
strips<00:04:05.159> on<00:04:05.400> this<00:04:05.579> one<00:04:05.819> if<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:06.329> draw<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.780> line
