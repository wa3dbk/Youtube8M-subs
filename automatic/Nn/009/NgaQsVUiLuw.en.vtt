hand to actually get that tissue to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.369 
hand to actually get that tissue to
respond<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.030> bit<00:00:42.059> better<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.200> this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
putting these straps on you are to some

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300 
putting these straps on you are to some
degree<00:01:09.570> restricting<00:01:10.200> blood<00:01:10.320> flow<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.830> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
degree restricting blood flow so you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.700 
degree restricting blood flow so you
don't<00:01:11.460> want<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.640> put<00:01:12.049> too<00:01:13.049> tight<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> strap

don't want to put too tight of a strap
on<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> idea<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> put<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.420> on

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
on here but the idea is to put it on

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.480 
on here but the idea is to put it on
tight<00:01:15.840> enough<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.040> actually<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.460> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
tight enough so we can actually have it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730 
tight enough so we can actually have it
be<00:01:18.000> effective<00:01:18.140> so<00:01:19.140> we're<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> put<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
be effective so we're going to put that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.999 
be effective so we're going to put that
strap<00:01:20.040> across<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.820> hand<00:01:21.119> first<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.920> we're

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
strap across the hand first and we're

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.440 
strap across the hand first and we're
going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.159> cinch<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.549> down<00:01:23.610> by<00:01:24.000> pulling<00:01:24.390> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
going to cinch this down by pulling a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.539 
going to cinch this down by pulling a
strap<00:01:24.720> against<00:01:25.080> itself<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> bit

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
strap against itself this can be a bit

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.090 
strap against itself this can be a bit
tricky<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.450> yourself<00:01:27.619> because<00:01:28.619> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
tricky to do to yourself because you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.170 
tricky to do to yourself because you
don't<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.310> anyone<00:01:29.579> else<00:01:29.640> holding<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
don't have anyone else holding that

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.730 
don't have anyone else holding that
strap<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> want<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> put<00:01:31.619> that

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
strap for you but you want to put that

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.740 
strap for you but you want to put that
tight<00:01:31.979> enough<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.909> where<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.060> holds<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.390> itself

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
tight enough to where it holds on itself

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.140 
tight enough to where it holds on itself
maybe<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.680> two<00:01:34.920> or<00:01:35.100> three<00:01:35.130> wraps<00:01:35.549> around<00:01:35.790> here

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
maybe get two or three wraps around here

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.630 
maybe get two or three wraps around here
and<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.659> come<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:36.840> across<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.189> back<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
and then come up across the back of the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.440 
and then come up across the back of the
wrist<00:01:38.960> wrap<00:01:39.960> around<00:01:40.790> do<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> couple<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.180> times

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
wrist wrap around do a couple of times

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.880 
wrist wrap around do a couple of times
around<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:43.049> wrist<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.740> back

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
around that wrist and then go back

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.550 
around that wrist and then go back
across<00:01:44.210> here<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.780> go<00:01:45.869> across<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.320> front

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
across here you can go across the front

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.289 
across here you can go across the front
or<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> back<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.189> wrist<00:01:47.310> either<00:01:47.549> one<00:01:47.790> but

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
or the back of the wrist either one but

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.480 
or the back of the wrist either one but
the<00:01:48.390> idea<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.750> wrap<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> couple<00:01:49.290> times<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:50.369> it

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the idea is wrap a couple times get it

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.149 
the idea is wrap a couple times get it
started<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.970> then<00:01:51.060> come<00:01:51.210> back<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.390> across<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
started and then come back up across and

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.770 
started and then come back up across and
a<00:01:53.159> couple<00:01:53.369> times<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.030> now<00:01:54.450> I'm<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.689> go

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
a couple times and now I'm going to go

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
a couple times and now I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.020> tuck<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:56.009> itself

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
ahead and tuck this in on itself

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.600 
ahead and tuck this in on itself
now<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.540> strap<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.990> 80<00:01:58.290> inches<00:01:58.740> long<00:01:59.009> which

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
now this strap is 80 inches long which

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.639 
now this strap is 80 inches long which
might<00:01:59.820> be<00:01:59.969> way<00:02:00.360> too<00:02:00.420> long<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.049> some<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.530> your

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
might be way too long for some of your

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.709 
might be way too long for some of your
arms<00:02:01.979> some<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.090> much<00:02:03.570> smaller

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
arms some of you have a much smaller

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.319 
arms some of you have a much smaller
wrist<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.469> arms<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.100> ideas<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.399> 80<00:02:06.030> inches

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
wrist and arms and ideas so 80 inches

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.059 
wrist and arms and ideas so 80 inches
going<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.600> go<00:02:06.689> around<00:02:06.780> way<00:02:07.140> too<00:02:07.170> many<00:02:07.530> times<00:02:07.829> so

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
going to go around way too many times so

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.589 
going to go around way too many times so
it<00:02:08.610> might<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> good<00:02:08.970> idea<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.300> cut<00:02:09.450> these

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
it might be a good idea to cut these

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.570 
it might be a good idea to cut these
straps<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.989> half<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.950> have<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> smaller

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
straps in half if you have a smaller

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.660 
straps in half if you have a smaller
wrist<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:12.090> hand

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
wrist in hand

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.920 
wrist in hand
but<00:02:12.910> now<00:02:13.030> I'm<00:02:13.120> going<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.300> go<00:02:13.390> through<00:02:13.599> range

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
but now I'm going to go through range

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.449 
but now I'm going to go through range
most<00:02:14.140> I'm<00:02:14.230> gonna<00:02:14.319> make<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.500> fist<00:02:14.800> I'm<00:02:15.280> gonna

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
most I'm gonna make a fist I'm gonna

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.640 
most I'm gonna make a fist I'm gonna
open<00:02:15.700> my<00:02:15.819> fist<00:02:16.090> I'll<00:02:16.720> make<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.930> fist<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.410> open

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
open my fist I'll make a fist and open

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.850 
open my fist I'll make a fist and open
my<00:02:17.739> fist<00:02:18.010> I'll<00:02:18.280> bend<00:02:19.410> pulling<00:02:20.410> my<00:02:20.500> wrist<00:02:20.650> in

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
my fist I'll bend pulling my wrist in

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.820 
my fist I'll bend pulling my wrist in
and<00:02:21.099> out<00:02:21.280> I'll<00:02:22.030> make<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.209> circle<00:02:22.720> do<00:02:23.590> any

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
and out I'll make a circle do any

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.740 
and out I'll make a circle do any
movements<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.340> seem<00:02:24.520> natural<00:02:24.940> with<00:02:25.150> this<00:02:25.450> on

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
movements to seem natural with this on

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.199 
movements to seem natural with this on
even<00:02:26.410> if<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.860> putting<00:02:27.580> pressure<00:02:27.790> there<00:02:28.060> on

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
even if it is putting pressure there on

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.530 
even if it is putting pressure there on
it<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:28.540> way<00:02:28.780> doing<00:02:29.590> push-ups<00:02:29.860> with<00:02:30.100> it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
it this way doing push-ups with it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.270 
it this way doing push-ups with it
whatever<00:02:31.540> seems<00:02:31.959> natural<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:33.069> whether

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
whatever seems natural to you whether

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
when your hand is getting cold it's time

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.809 
when your hand is getting cold it's time
to<00:02:38.560> take<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.800> darn<00:02:38.980> thing<00:02:39.160> off<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.700> don't

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
to take the darn thing off you don't

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.040 
to take the darn thing off you don't
want<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.000> cut<00:02:40.090> off<00:02:40.180> circulation<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.870> point

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
want to cut off circulation to the point

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.380 
want to cut off circulation to the point
where<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.200> do<00:02:41.290> damage<00:02:41.530> these<00:02:41.890> tissues<00:02:42.310> if<00:02:43.180> you

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
where you do damage these tissues if you

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.540 
where you do damage these tissues if you
do<00:02:43.599> have<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.840> sense<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.680> know<00:02:44.769> pain<00:02:45.220> where
