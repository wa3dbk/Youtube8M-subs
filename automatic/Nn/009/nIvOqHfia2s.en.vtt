00:00:07.018 --> 00:00:08.026
Hello!

00:00:11.083 --> 00:00:13.044
Have a Hannah heart attack!

00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:15.015
Yo!

00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:19.050
Well, I'm a cereal killer
I like my ice with vanilla

00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:21.054
and I always take my meats dried

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.068
We need to have a serious taco
Don't touch these chips, they nachos

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.022
I don't even really mind it
(why not?)

00:00:27.034 --> 00:00:29.094
'cause I got a chip on my shoulder
I guess I'm getting older

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.019
Your sweet is turning into a spice

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.030
So let's go and get some curry
nobody's in a hurry

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:37.070
Watch out, I'll put my white on your rice

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:40.061
You know I never stop nommin'
Put spaguetti in my chow mein

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.068
Lock it down with a key lime

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.001
Now this track is straight urban

00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:48.018
We better put some herbs in
you know that it's about thyme

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:50.052
for you to show me where your noms at

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:53.036

show me where your noms at

00:00:53.048 --> 00:00:55.076
where your noms at
show me where your noms at

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:58.011
where your noms at
Baby gotta palm that

00:00:58.048 --> 00:00:59.074
So delicious, yum

00:00:59.086 --> 00:01:03.012
Ice cream cheesecake batter up
fatten up, saddle up

00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:05.036
If you're with me,
can I have a what?

00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:07.052
what!
Watcha do with your favorite food

00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:10.060
I boast the most toast and got that gravy too

00:01:10.072 --> 00:01:13.044
I've got no ice here around my neck
but I've got spice that'll make you sweat

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:15.072
You better play nice 'cuz you better better bet
I'm not quite finished yet

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:18.050
Now let me double this, you could be covetous
of my bread butter being how I come up with this

00:01:18.062 --> 00:01:21.001
But the trouble is, nobody gets
cooking like me, just show me where the oven is

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.068
Loving this drunk in this kitchen best
cutting up some of this chicken breast

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.082
Rubbing it up and then down
shove it in now at 350, press start

00:01:26.094 --> 00:01:28.089
And then we chill until it's done

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.003
Where's my drink? Baby you wait and
just maybe I'll get you another one

00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:34.042
It's such a phenomeNOM,
join us fu'tha nomathon

00:01:34.054 --> 00:01:37.012
Think of it as the opposite of when
you stop nutrition like it's Ramadan

00:01:37.023 --> 00:01:39.078
Gotta get your nomming on while
I'm dropping bombs to the calmest song

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.050
I'm dancing with Hannah,
eating bananas like she's Donkey Kong

00:01:42.062 --> 00:01:45.013
Let's have a food fight!
It's morsel combat

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:47.071
I see your cream pie on a plate
and raise you a straw hat

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:50.061
I'm like a wombat,
just wanna get all fat

00:01:50.073 --> 00:01:52.076
So if you want that,
show me where your noms at

00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:55.040

00:02:00.098 --> 00:02:02.044
Baby gotta palm that

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.086
I've got some fantasies
and they all involve the cheese

00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:12.080
Girl it's you and me
and I wanna please

00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:14.077
with my Gouda Swiss and Harvatis

00:02:15.032 --> 00:02:17.078
Oh baby, just wait and see

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.022
I'll shred Cheddar like it's real money

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:24.096
It'll be so cheesy, just lemon squeezy
when it's you and me

00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:27.048

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.014
Baby gotta palm that

00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:50.022
Eating your feelings
is healthy for you

00:02:50.034 --> 00:02:52.076
Who told you that?
-It says on the back.
