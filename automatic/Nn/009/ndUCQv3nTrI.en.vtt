 the end of the 18th century, which 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.240
 decorative patterns of Greco Roman art 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.880
 and the scientific interest in 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.800
 classical antiquity stimulated by the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.460
 baroque 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.730

 the sculptural ones with correct anatomy 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.370
 accuracy and clarity 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.590
 neoclassical sculpture and architecture 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.510
 also sought inspiration in the past and 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.199
 noble materials were used as 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.469
 stone marble and granite in architecture 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.329
 regular forms were used
