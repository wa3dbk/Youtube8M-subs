00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
think that all those years that I spent

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.040 
think that all those years that I spent
being<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.330> student<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:47.990> paying<00:02:48.740> attention<00:02:49.280> to

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
being a student and paying attention to

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.970 
being a student and paying attention to
trying<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.110> get<00:02:51.320> all<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:51.800> information

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
trying to get all of this information

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.520 
trying to get all of this information
and<00:02:52.610> learn<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.180> sort<00:02:53.480> through<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.050> I

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
and learn and sort through it and I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.650 
and learn and sort through it and I
think<00:02:54.800> what's<00:02:54.950> happening<00:02:55.460> is<00:02:56.060> as<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.420> grow

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
think what's happening is as I grow

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.960 
think what's happening is as I grow
older<00:02:56.690> I'm<00:02:57.380> kind<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.650> mellowing<00:02:58.160> I'm<00:02:58.520> figuring

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
older I'm kind of mellowing I'm figuring

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.580 
older I'm kind of mellowing I'm figuring
this<00:02:59.090> all<00:02:59.240> out<00:02:59.420> how<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.720> internalize<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.260> make

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
this all out how to internalize it make

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.460 
this all out how to internalize it make
it<00:03:00.680> on<00:03:00.740> my<00:03:00.830> own<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:02.360> wouldn't<00:03:03.020> be<00:03:03.200> where<00:03:03.410> I

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
it on my own and I wouldn't be where I

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.490 
it on my own and I wouldn't be where I
am<00:03:03.560> today<00:03:04.160> without<00:03:05.000> great<00:03:05.630> teachers<00:03:06.200> that

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
am today without great teachers that

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.970 
am today without great teachers that
shared<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.460> really<00:03:08.360> brought<00:03:08.810> me<00:03:08.990> to<00:03:09.830> this

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
shared and and really brought me to this

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.890 
shared and and really brought me to this
point<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:10.970> course<00:03:11.210> you<00:03:11.360> know<00:03:11.510> worked<00:03:11.690> hard

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
point and of course you know worked hard

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.620 
point and of course you know worked hard
for<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:12.410> then<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.370> think<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:13.790> my<00:03:14.090> duty

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
for it and then I think it's my duty

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.720 
for it and then I think it's my duty
really<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.830> get<00:03:16.460> back<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:18.200> when<00:03:18.730> the

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
really to get back and so when the

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.030 
really to get back and so when the
students<00:03:20.090> show<00:03:20.270> up<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.960> they<00:03:21.470> just<00:03:21.650> won't<00:03:21.740> go

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
students show up and they just won't go

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.580 
students show up and they just won't go
away<00:03:22.070> you<00:03:23.030> know<00:03:23.150> I'm<00:03:23.300> doing<00:03:23.360> workshops<00:03:23.840> and

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
away you know I'm doing workshops and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.430 
away you know I'm doing workshops and
demos<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.820> you<00:03:26.180> know<00:03:26.330> DVDs<00:03:26.780> we're<00:03:27.170> doing

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
demos and you know DVDs we're doing

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.740 
demos and you know DVDs we're doing
things<00:03:27.650> together<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.450> so<00:03:29.450> we're<00:03:29.600> talking

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
things together and so we're talking

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.380 
things together and so we're talking
about<00:03:29.990> more<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:30.650> like<00:03:31.250> this<00:03:31.520> idea<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:32.060> kind<00:03:32.240> of

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
about more I like this idea of kind of

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.070 
about more I like this idea of kind of
collecting<00:03:33.250> everything<00:03:34.420> together<00:03:35.420> and

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
collecting everything together and

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.440 
collecting everything together and
having<00:03:36.380> it<00:03:36.620> archived<00:03:37.490> more<00:03:37.940> or<00:03:38.030> less<00:03:38.180> so

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
having it archived more or less so

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.180 
having it archived more or less so
that's<00:03:38.630> kind<00:03:39.080> of<00:03:39.110> where<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.320> am<00:03:39.440> right<00:03:39.560> now<00:03:39.890> well

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
that's kind of where I am right now well

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.070 
that's kind of where I am right now well
I'm<00:03:40.280> still<00:03:40.580> really<00:03:40.940> experimenting<00:03:41.870> and

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
I'm still really experimenting and

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.100 
I'm still really experimenting and
pushing<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.010> envelope<00:03:43.100> with<00:03:44.090> my<00:03:44.210> own<00:03:44.360> work<00:03:44.630> I

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
pushing the envelope with my own work I

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.240 
pushing the envelope with my own work I
think<00:03:46.010> now<00:03:46.280> it's<00:03:46.730> broader<00:03:47.510> in<00:03:48.050> terms<00:03:48.350> of<00:03:48.620> the

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
think now it's broader in terms of the

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.370 
think now it's broader in terms of the
teaching<00:03:49.730> and<00:03:50.060> building<00:03:50.870> my<00:03:50.960> body<00:03:51.170> of<00:03:51.320> work

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
teaching and building my body of work

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.610 
teaching and building my body of work
and<00:03:51.620> my<00:03:51.890> portrait<00:03:52.280> commissions<00:03:52.730> which<00:03:53.060> are

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
and my portrait commissions which are

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.700 
and my portrait commissions which are
