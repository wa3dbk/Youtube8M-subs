00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hey today is the second day of the film adaptation of me 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.210
 name is ginger 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.970
 my hand panda is with me and we will tell 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.099
 you about the book after which we do not want 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.719
 sit movies or about the company after 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.160
 which do not want to read books 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.289
 a long time ago in English 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.690
 literature I watched a sleepy movie 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.570
 99 year old dell with johnny depp 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.119
 starring his hero had to 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.490
 investigate the mysterious murder which 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.730
 supposedly mixed headless horseman 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.279
 of course when there is a question of evaluation in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.469
 the end of this lesson you will watch and the horrors 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.600
 and thrillers and anything you will 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.790
 look because it is estimated that it is very 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.770
 it was important at that time was to anyone 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.050
 never admit that after that 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.559
 another week could not sleep well on 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.320
 now when i have a choice i won't 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.640
 read the book washington irving legend 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.610
 about sleepy hollow 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.370
 if only because I don't want to again not 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.710
 sleep a week until I hide the story very much 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.239
 interesting but I got it too 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.190
 dear steven king 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.140
 his works dawn that i'm in 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.979
 I read it with great pleasure 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.650
 but occasionally I read it like this 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.229
 I told about him but watch the movie 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.030
 for this book I will not everything for a reason 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.540
 all sorts of gore 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.610
 and horror I alone they will survive us still 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.000
 one book that I already told in 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.280
 their videos royal battle movie 2000 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.979
 years with mata in this book I look not 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.829
 I will for the simple reason that again 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.049
 too bloody too terrible too 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.409
 predetermined yes and in fact itself 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.590
 the story is a little bit different for us 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.180
 to return to it again and again 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.070
 memories film gauze and i 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.290
 Well, tell me who else went to watch 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.159
 this movie is because there is starring 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.920
 dogs I personally originally got the sea 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.189
 movie pleasure but the fact is that 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.200
 I was surprised the ending was very surprised not 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.240
 because it is not logical and but because 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.630
 she is too vital and because 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.549
 roll their memories of life 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.530
 who wants to hide somewhere 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.690
 away so no further no 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.420
 appeared and and generally it is all very 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.110
 difficult and therefore do not read these books 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.910
 bends on this film I just can not I 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.670
 I don't want to feel these emotions again 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.590
 wet up McCarthy his work 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.140
 which was read within 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.680
 follow read in my group in 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.269
 contact certainly book 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.080
 postapocalyptic drama about if 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.750
 meaning to live if in life and future already 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.040
 the book certainly is not foreseen 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.010
 makes you think about this question 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.319
 but the thing is, it's just not my genre 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.569
 not in my style absolutely because 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.319
 see also the movie money somehow completely 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.080
 do not want 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.630
 collector john fowles book about 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.540
 ordinary bank clerks colleagues 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.180
 which was an unusual collection yes 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.400
 this book has no blood and monsters 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.880
 who climbs out at night from under the bed 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.799
 although in principle it is literally their 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.310
 there is no here but in a figurative one 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.920
 krovischa and solid monsters like me personally 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.239
 it seems in general a book to be sure 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.430
 interesting and dramatic psychological 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.190
 addictive but it seems to me that movies 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.139
 just will not be able to transmit all of these 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.670
 feelings of emotion that arise 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.230
 reading this particular work 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.780
 John Fowles collector 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.480
 flowers for algernon daniela kiza a 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.109
 life of the mentally retarded charlie and about 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.150
 chances of a normal life me this book 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.250
 Loved it just like 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.709
 works of melon bows for the mysterious 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.780
 history billy milligan but here's a look 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.269
 any of the three films shot for this 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.910
 I don't want a book again, because 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.450
 the fact that the book is too such 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.470
 intimate if I may say so and 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.870
 too you just need to feel it and 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.030
 because the film is also possible to author 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.760
 the movie director felt through 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.860
 impossible for sure he felt 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.590
 works but in my own way and it seems to me 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.990
 that any interpretation of this book may 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.880
 spoil the impression of the book itself 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.710
 well, or just a movie can nobody us 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.480
 in general, I won't like the movie anymore 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.150
 or sport me the impression of the book 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.970
 because I do not want to watch these films 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.680
 the film the silence of the lambs '90 I 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.600
 looked from a company that 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.550
 I absolutely refuse to watch 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.940
 anything other than this movie 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.390
 therefore it was necessary and in spite of some 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.210
 not very pleasant personal moments to me 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.430
 I generally liked the movie but I mean all those 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.530
 I don’t want very pleasant moments 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.920
 read a book about a serial killer 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.110
 which helps fbi investigate a case 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.650
 other serial killers where they lead 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.500
 dreams 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.080
 movie of '98 by vincent ward where 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.840
 the main character tries to save his soul 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.030
 wives who committed suicide this 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.490
 will be his biggest adventure in 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.100
 Life itself is rather more testing and 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:07.240
 even more precisely she came to life trials 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.880
 after death it's an interesting story 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.270
 but obviously I looked and and not at that 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.100
 time and in the wrong place and she drove 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.000
 not some not so pleasant 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.490
 impression 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.240
 because reading a book that's just not 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.460
 I want to 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.400
 for the same reason I don't want to watch 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.740
 film based on the book foam days of boris 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.630
 viana is definitely a beautiful story 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.320
 about the eternal about love 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:35.740
 but still surrealism is absolutely not mine 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.140
 and because I wanted so and didn’t 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.090
 watched french film 2013 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:44.250
 release and most likely never see 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.070
 these were our panda movies after 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.780
 which we will not read books and books 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.419
 after which we will not look 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.910
 tell me movies do you have such 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.610
 works after which so to speak 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.949
 twin brothers you don't want anymore 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.810
 perceive not look at listen not 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.940
