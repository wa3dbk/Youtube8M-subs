00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.150
 hello to all and volt but pierrot and 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.220
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.280
 little video a bit special and a 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.619
 little sad 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.410
 yeah we can say that actually I'm doing 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.960
 this video because I have and I 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.000
 I stop the chain then the chain 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.200
 youtube sail tpe does not stop volts 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.430
 he will make us beautiful 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.130
 openings do not worry about that 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.960
 but I'm retiring 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.960
 that it costs me a lot of money I 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.890
 things in life that make me 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.860
 need this money 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.450
 an apartment things like that here 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.460
 so it does not stick with the 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.230
 pokemon card openings anyway 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.030
 down as I say I will stay 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.920
 I'm going to support flying you want to help him 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.060
 for all that is editing will do I 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.340
 will make devices on other videos 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.780
 in any case do not forget that it remains 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.920
 there he will make you a great video what 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.720
 yeah it's still important 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.340
 As I said, I respect absolutely 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.140
 his choices at the base we had made a 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.880
 chain both we are friends we are 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.930
 always friends it's with them that I 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.790
 want it or whatever it is 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.720
 important I think that a lot 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.010
 of you who are going to ask 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.910
 questions I take this opportunity to say right away 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.900
 now only if you have any 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.460
 questions will be answered in the 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.230
 comments but we will try to 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.250
 answer bigger questions right 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.610
 following as it was done in this 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.290
 video 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.850
 so as I said I do not want him 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.010
 it's his choice we started together 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.330
 we were motivated 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.070
 I am always if you want me 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.650
 I fight as I say I have facilities 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.090
 I still live with my parents 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.170
 here I still have no expenses 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.670
 as he can have and I can 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.720
 fully understands that he 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.490
 can no longer afford 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.930
 I'm anyway I have the 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.940
 acute collection I am a 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.190
 collector in the soul father gesture 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.240
 son audrey and salmonella that I 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.540
 I will not tell you since 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.940
 long time 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.350
 this is it really must me so I 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.490
 compare and and pokemon so in fact I 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.620
 would be really very happy if the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.100
 subscribers closest to her I count 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.360
 on sees that to stay to support volts 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.350
 in his approach because he is not going 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.060
 stop the chain will continue to you 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.540
 open stuff the ecc elixir that go 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.190
 arrive 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.540
 he still has big systems that we 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.890
 did not open so feel free to 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.000
 watch there will always be shocks 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.229
 I will certainly do some 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.929
 appearances from time to time in the 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.640
 videos 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.230
 if the task is seen douala turn me 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.670
 video ben I'll invite him and then we'll be 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.810
 in comments both because 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.760
 I know you liked it a lot 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.299
 does it have an interaction that's okay 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.280
 not stop 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.069
 and then here is after sam opens other 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.989
 perspectives here and things that me 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.129
 I really like who was difficult to 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.389
 set up two that I could 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.530
 to do alone I would say the chain 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.670
 now she is going a little diversify 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.030
 and she's going to change that's how things are going 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.400
 switch 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.450
 but what must be said is that it 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.560
 remains the chain sees the said pierrot I 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.569
 will not change the name that's it 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.700
 remains pierrot fingering even if it's less 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.310
 bitter basically who would do the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.359
 openings yet that's near the course at 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.620
 card level maybe it's less 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.450
 however, you often talk about 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.540
 video games there so I might have 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.760
 more time for that when we are 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.329
 a bit we build on the chain but 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.489
 in an other way 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.319
 because I like the cards or is 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.180
 great but I can not do without it 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.260
 to see that video games this is a 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.090
 thing I already have that we can 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.439
 still do me who it is maybe a 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.299
 lucky that I come back on this 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.620
 this is your climb this is it 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.239
 there is every chance that 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.370
 now the chain as she is going 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.840
 diversify in every way that I 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.260
 I will make openings that will 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.169
 hold dear 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.609
 but alone or in the company of pyro even 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.260
 if it's me who opens and then 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.310
 why not help hope we talked 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.169
 from the beginning we never had 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.699
 the opportunity to do it or to do 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.199
 I really have lots of ideas 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.310
 Pierrot I know that there are also some 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.930
 put meaning not that would really 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.060
 world so we will be really happy 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.169
 that you do that so that's why 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.359
 I found interesting and important 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.069
 especially that all who have been 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.500
 faithful so far and where the dream 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.519
 thanks a thousand times because it's thanks to 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.780
 that you arrived until then 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.699
 thank everyone who followed us 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.139
 so far and I hope I'm flying 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.459
 I do not wear my face I think 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.540
 that there will be people who will leave 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.009
 who will unsubscribe but I find that 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.569
 a shame because the chain does not have 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:46.979
 mart the chain will continue me i'm going 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.569
 continue a video by all with my 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:50.069
 ratio sees in any case it was like 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.479
 of a good experience in moosch not in 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.290
 to eat a little bit is a bit bit by bit 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.870
 sad because it was still 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.010
 it's still nice but hey 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.409
 what am I sorry for those who 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.230
 who liked me or who liked the 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.280
 really organic have continued to follow foot 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.959
 to want you they 're doing very well 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.870
 pass when a good chain that goes 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.890
 continue to live here and then ben 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.349
 precisely with respect to the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.140
 diversifications some time ago 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.849
 when leaving the first part 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.470
 of the spectrum I had posted on them 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.329
 social networks a little poll where 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.190
 I asked everyone about the 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.820
 to tell what time he preferred that the 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.320
 video by s 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.220
 and then that's a lot more had 19 voters 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.750
 it's not much, but for them 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.830
 social networks is not bad and good 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.360
 do that I'm going to do more and more 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.740
 often you will see elsewhere in 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.690
 the description of this video the first 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.639
 survey that will concern a future video 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.630
 you will be able to vote 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.490
 for now I do not even know yet 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.510
 exactly the content of this poll which 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.830
 I invite you just to go in the 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.690
 description went to see it takes a 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.030
 second you just applied and then 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.680
 that allow you to participate to be 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.570
 interact with me and decide a 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.590
 little you even what will be on the 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.229
 chain so that can be interesting 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.550
 here and then I think you can 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.780
 maybe say me too in relation to 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.080
 what you plan to do with your collection 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.510
 so for the Iberian I have I am I 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.680
 I created a small ebay account where I 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.300
 will actually sell my entire collection 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.770
 I sell everything I have 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.139
 pieces that are still closed period 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.440
 evoke that dairies not just 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.090
 things like that i have people call 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.280

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.510

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.880
 is everything to leave everything must 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.949
 disappear 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.840
