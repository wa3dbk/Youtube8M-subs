 Kai Hometown Te 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:36.680
 I would like to hear 8 stories before entering the clinic, so thank you 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.540
 After that you ask 8 people on foot , but hope to wait for cancellation 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.329
 It is the wave that is 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:49.309
 8 I will briefly to explain Ripaku our hospital is always entered reservations because it is an appointment 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.570
 And it's but by the iron cell by say was able to urgent business Toka physical condition after that is bad 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:56.850
 Some patients have 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.280
 In the case of the patient who knows that that child line can come first and second at that time 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.010
 Give priority to contact 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.320
 I will register that role 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.650
 I think So would like added to once again point and commentary for now photos Consulting 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.140
 I will 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:21.230
 First of all it seems to be the first Lord, but here we keep open questions in mind 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:27.750
 I want established a state, such as to facilitate a lot of talking patients 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:31.390
 I think that I want to listen to a lot of stories from this 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.270
 Next , why Les chose kerosene 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:40.030
 Then I'm going to continue to complain about my dental clinic and I don't want it 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:47.110
 I am asking the patient about 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:51.380
 First, when as a good sense of the door first, the first alma mater monkey I am entering the direct unit side 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:56.149
 I can not tell anything because I got a doctor or a satellite and I am nervous 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.110
 The patient who is said that is also said to the doctor or such a thing is very disgusting 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.600
 Or that it was 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:08.269
 In the explanation of that it was not there also be difficult to directly say to the doctor and Mr. Hideyo 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.250
 The point is that you can capture the true meaning of the patient by asking for stories in these rooms 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.370
 I think that 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.040
 Among them this time 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:22.470
 The most serious problem is that the patient did not give an explanation. 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:27.350
 The fact that you were being told is quite a description of treatment for this patient from the next 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:33.680
 You can see that there is Do not better to let me in detail 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:36.830
 And patients taking eh X-ray is finished now first visit consulting has returned to the unit 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.930
 I would like to explain from the beginning 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.860
 Data you have a and notes in the first visit consulting while the patient is taking the X-ray in 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.920
 The 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.340
 Keep in mind to read while you are taking during the year and 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.430

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.940

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.900
 From the normal and the phase difference microscope 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:19.260
