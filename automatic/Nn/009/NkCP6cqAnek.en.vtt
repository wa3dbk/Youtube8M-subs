prolotherapy<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.770> an<00:02:11.890> alternative<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.490> a

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
prolotherapy is an alternative is a

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.610 
prolotherapy is an alternative is a

cortisone because cortisone actually
breaks<00:02:14.890> down<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.520> tissue<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.510> over<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.930> long

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
breaks down the tissue so over the long

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.550 
breaks down the tissue so over the long
haul<00:02:17.170> getting<00:02:17.890> cortisone<00:02:18.550> shots<00:02:19.000> is

it's<00:02:30.580> numbing<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.180> area<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.840> think<00:02:32.260> you're

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
it's numbing the area you think you're

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.800 
it's numbing the area you think you're
better<00:02:32.830> but<00:02:33.610> in<00:02:33.730> actual<00:02:33.940> outline<00:02:34.450> you're<00:02:34.630> just

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
better but in actual outline you're just

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.410 
better but in actual outline you're just
numbing<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.350> pain<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.890> then<00:02:36.550> over<00:02:37.180> time

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
numbing the pain and then over time

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.090 
numbing the pain and then over time
that's<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.560> precursor<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.550> joint<00:02:40.330> surgery<00:02:41.200> so

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
that's a precursor to joint surgery so

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.830 
that's a precursor to joint surgery so
when<00:02:42.250> they<00:02:42.340> give<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.730> cortisone<00:02:43.239> it's

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
when they give you the cortisone it's

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.640 
when they give you the cortisone it's
probably<00:02:44.260> going<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:44.860> be<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.070> few<00:02:45.430> years<00:02:46.650> they'll

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
probably going to be a few years they'll

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.710 
probably going to be a few years they'll
be<00:02:47.709> giving<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:48.280> saying<00:02:48.970> hey<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.180> need<00:02:49.420> joint

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
be giving you saying hey you need joint

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.070 
be giving you saying hey you need joint
surgery<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.940> that's<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.269> first<00:02:52.510> level<00:02:52.840> just

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
surgery so that's the first level just

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.650 
surgery so that's the first level just
to<00:02:53.170> sugar-based<00:02:53.650> ups<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.190> it's<00:02:54.459> about<00:02:54.660> 175

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
to sugar-based ups and it's about 175

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.830 
to sugar-based ups and it's about 175
dollars<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:57.160> it's<00:02:57.310> not<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.489> expensive<00:02:58.060> to

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
dollars so it's not that expensive to

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.180 
dollars so it's not that expensive to
really<00:02:59.080> take<00:02:59.260> care<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.560> your<00:02:59.650> body<00:02:59.860> it's<00:03:00.130> a

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
really take care of your body it's a

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.320 
really take care of your body it's a
great<00:03:00.400> alternative<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:01.180> surgery<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:03.330> second

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
great alternative to surgery the second

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.979 
great alternative to surgery the second
is<00:03:04.800> PRP<00:03:06.540> it's<00:03:07.620> platelet-rich<00:03:09.480> therapist<00:03:10.480> PRP

that<00:03:26.320> into<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.799> joint<00:03:27.070> area<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.730> helps

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
that into the joint area and it helps

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.650 
that into the joint area and it helps
stimulate<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:30.670> growth<00:03:30.700> lumber<00:03:31.480> because

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
stimulate the growth lumber because

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.330 
stimulate the growth lumber because
you're<00:03:31.780> taking<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.140> actual<00:03:32.500> blood<00:03:32.890> itself

injecting that into that area and it

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.520 
injecting that into that area and it
helps<00:03:37.750> stimulate<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:39.670> growth<00:03:40.530> cartilage

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
helps stimulate the growth cartilage

helps stimulate the growth cartilage
tendons<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:43.870> is<00:03:44.019> another<00:03:44.320> method<00:03:44.530> that's

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
tendons this is another method that's

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.650 
tendons this is another method that's
that's<00:03:45.310> Method<00:03:45.549> number<00:03:45.670> 2<00:03:46.620> 3rd<00:03:47.620> is<00:03:48.660> bone

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
that's Method number 2 3rd is bone

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.680 
that's Method number 2 3rd is bone
marrow<00:03:50.019> they<00:03:50.290> go<00:03:50.500> into<00:03:50.709> your<00:03:50.799> bone<00:03:51.040> marrow

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
marrow they go into your bone marrow

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.479 
marrow they go into your bone marrow
typically<00:03:52.690> in<00:03:52.810> your<00:03:52.930> hip<00:03:53.140> they<00:03:53.769> take<00:03:54.070> that<00:03:54.280> and

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
typically in your hip they take that and

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.410 
typically in your hip they take that and
get<00:03:54.609> your<00:03:54.640> actual<00:03:55.290> DNA<00:03:56.290> your<00:03:56.709> actual<00:03:57.100> genetic

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
get your actual DNA your actual genetic

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.720 
get your actual DNA your actual genetic
code<00:03:58.420> they<00:03:58.720> take<00:03:58.959> that<00:03:59.230> and<00:04:00.160> they<00:04:00.250> take<00:04:00.489> those

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
code they take that and they take those

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.910 
code they take that and they take those
properties<00:04:01.359> so<00:04:01.540> now<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:01.750> get<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.140> DNA<00:04:02.500> and

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
properties so now you get the DNA and

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.300 
properties so now you get the DNA and
then<00:04:03.340> they<00:04:03.459> inject<00:04:03.940> that<00:04:04.030> into<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.980> joint

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
then they inject that into the joint

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.759 
then they inject that into the joint
area<00:04:06.609> those<00:04:07.600> are<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.810> three<00:04:08.140> levels<00:04:08.530> that's

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
area those are the three levels that's

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.229 
area those are the three levels that's
about<00:04:09.040> three<00:04:09.310> thousand<00:04:09.700> dollars<00:04:10.000> so

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
about three thousand dollars so

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.289 
about three thousand dollars so
prolotherapy<00:04:12.329> first<00:04:13.329> level<00:04:13.739> 175<00:04:14.940> PRP<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.180> can

prolotherapy first level 175 PRP you can

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.430 
prolotherapy first level 175 PRP you can

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
get for under nine hundred and then the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.080 
get for under nine hundred and then the
next<00:04:20.470> level<00:04:20.979> which<00:04:21.099> is<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.310> gene<00:04:21.519> therapy

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
next level which is the gene therapy

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.860 
next level which is the gene therapy
that's

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
that's

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.590 
that's
a<00:04:22.900> couple<00:04:23.620> thousand<00:04:24.070> dollars<00:04:24.389> there's<00:04:25.389> many

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
a couple thousand dollars there's many

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.570 
a couple thousand dollars there's many
people<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.050> do<00:04:26.229> that<00:04:26.260> there's<00:04:27.040> many<00:04:27.250> experts

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
people that do that there's many experts

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.879 
people that do that there's many experts
around<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:27.970> field<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:29.410> this<00:04:29.590> is<00:04:29.740> an

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
around the field so this is an

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.159 
around the field so this is an
alternative<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:31.090> going<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.449> surgery<00:04:31.900> many

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
alternative to going to surgery many

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.129 
alternative to going to surgery many
people<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:32.710> have<00:04:32.919> chronic<00:04:33.220> pain<00:04:33.870> they<00:04:34.870> get

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
people that have chronic pain they get

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.560 
people that have chronic pain they get
the<00:04:35.290> lowest<00:04:35.530> level<00:04:36.010> of<00:04:36.070> therapy<00:04:36.520> done<00:04:36.760> and

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
the lowest level of therapy done and

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.780 
the lowest level of therapy done and
they<00:04:37.810> don't<00:04:37.960> have<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.350> pain<00:04:38.560> anymore

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
they don't have the pain anymore

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.370 
they don't have the pain anymore
typically<00:04:39.790> it<00:04:40.540> will<00:04:40.690> take<00:04:40.930> anywhere<00:04:41.320> from

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
typically it will take anywhere from

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.909 
typically it will take anywhere from
three<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.740> six<00:04:42.010> sessions<00:04:42.280> so<00:04:42.970> 36<00:04:43.419> sessions<00:04:43.919> so

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
three to six sessions so 36 sessions so

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.689
