soft brush you can get quite a shared

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.630 
soft brush you can get quite a shared
coverage<00:03:03.900> covering<00:03:04.900> over<00:03:05.110> your<00:03:05.440> black<00:03:06.310> kohl

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
coverage covering over your black kohl

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.030 
coverage covering over your black kohl
what<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.030> put<00:03:07.209> on<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:08.320> black<00:03:08.500> coal<00:03:08.739> will<00:03:08.890> hang

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
what you put on the black coal will hang

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.610 
what you put on the black coal will hang
on<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.459> it

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.670 

so<00:03:13.190> for<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.459> same<00:03:13.909> blue<00:03:14.269> just<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.349> little<00:03:15.530> bit

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
so for the same blue just a little bit

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.460 
so for the same blue just a little bit
heavier<00:03:16.459> into<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.299> car<00:03:17.540> on<00:03:17.629> the<00:03:17.720> bottom<00:03:18.080> you

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
heavier into the car on the bottom you

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.229 
heavier into the car on the bottom you
can<00:03:18.500> see<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:19.250> gets<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.519> completely<00:03:19.879> different

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
can see it gets a completely different

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.960 
can see it gets a completely different
look<00:03:20.450> just<00:03:21.260> because<00:03:21.409> I've<00:03:21.620> put<00:03:21.799> more<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.849> a

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
look just because I've put more of a

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.820 
look just because I've put more of a
pigment<00:03:23.390> on<00:03:23.569> well<00:03:24.440> then<00:03:24.620> blend<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.069> flat<00:03:25.400> and

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
pigment on well then blend it flat and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.920 
pigment on well then blend it flat and
to<00:03:27.830> finish<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.400> think<00:03:28.700> what<00:03:28.879> we<00:03:29.239> need<00:03:29.269> is<00:03:29.690> just

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
to finish I think what we need is just

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.020 
to finish I think what we need is just
some<00:03:30.260> highlighter<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.489> corner<00:03:31.819> of<00:03:31.879> the

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
some highlighter and the corner of the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.910 
some highlighter and the corner of the
eyes<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:34.090> I'd<00:03:35.090> like<00:03:35.390> to<00:03:35.540> put<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:36.019> little<00:03:36.170> bit<00:03:36.860> of

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
eyes and I'd like to put a little bit of

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.229 
eyes and I'd like to put a little bit of
light<00:03:37.519> here<00:03:38.329> on<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.920> brow<00:03:40.099> bone<00:03:40.159> but<00:03:40.819> nothing

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
too bright so if he's a little bit of

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.770 
too bright so if he's a little bit of
pale<00:03:47.299> gold<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:49.220> then<00:03:49.400> we're<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.970> little<00:03:50.540> bit

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.560 

I<00:04:52.310> tend<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.430> stick<00:04:53.580> stick<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.090> middle<00:04:54.360> bit<00:04:54.480> on

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
I tend to stick stick the middle bit on

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.170 
I tend to stick stick the middle bit on
the<00:04:54.660> first<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:55.170> can<00:04:57.770> yes<00:04:58.770> I<00:04:59.190> think<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.790> do<00:04:59.850> yeah

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
the first you can yes I think I do yeah

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.020 
the first you can yes I think I do yeah
and<00:05:00.510> then<00:05:01.200> you<00:05:01.230> can<00:05:01.590> get<00:05:02.340> it's<00:05:02.490> not<00:05:02.670> quite<00:05:02.940> in

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
and then you can get it's not quite in

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.340 
and then you can get it's not quite in
the<00:05:03.090> right<00:05:03.120> place<00:05:03.480> while<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.840> glue<00:05:03.870> is<00:05:04.080> still

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
the right place while the glue is still

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.520 
the right place while the glue is still
wet<00:05:04.820> you<00:05:05.820> can<00:05:05.850> reposition<00:05:06.420> it<00:05:09.170> if<00:05:10.170> you<00:05:10.290> keep

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
wet you can reposition it if you keep
