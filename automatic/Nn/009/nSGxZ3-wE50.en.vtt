00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.470 
stuff like that if you want to see it on
your<00:00:43.750> big<00:00:43.960> TV<00:00:44.200> but<00:00:45.190> as<00:00:45.309> far<00:00:45.610> as<00:00:45.640> watching

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
your big TV but as far as watching

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.850 
your big TV but as far as watching
movies<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:49.180> was<00:00:49.360> slow<00:00:49.719> that<00:00:50.289> the<00:00:50.469> picture

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
movies it was slow that the picture

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.619 
movies it was slow that the picture
quality<00:00:51.340> was<00:00:51.489> bad<00:00:51.760> I<00:00:51.789> guess<00:00:52.180> because<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.539> the

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
quality was bad I guess because of the

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.560 
quality was bad I guess because of the
wireless<00:00:52.899> connection<00:00:53.410> and<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:55.090> even<00:00:55.329> their

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
wireless connection and and even their

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.930 
wireless connection and and even their
mouths<00:00:55.840> were<00:00:56.170> not<00:00:56.350> in<00:00:56.530> sync<00:00:56.860> because<00:00:57.340> you<00:00:57.820> know

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
mouths were not in sync because you know

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.569 
mouths were not in sync because you know
the<00:00:58.090> delay<00:00:58.420> through<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.170> air<00:00:59.320> so<00:00:59.800> if<00:01:00.399> you're

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
the delay through the air so if you're

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:01.860 
the delay through the air so if you're
going<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.820> purchase<00:01:01.030> one<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.480> these<00:01:01.600> that's

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
going to purchase one of these that's

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.779 
going to purchase one of these that's
fine<00:01:02.260> if<00:01:02.530> you<00:01:02.620> want<00:01:02.800> to<00:01:02.859> look<00:01:02.949> at<00:01:03.100> pictures<00:01:03.280> if
