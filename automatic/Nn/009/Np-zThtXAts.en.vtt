00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.240
 big hello i am glad to welcome you 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.070
 on your channel please don't be scared 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.750
 this my natural look I 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.639
 today without to sing which to 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.750
 test with you two beat 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.580
 cream from garnier 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.529
 specifically bibi cream for mixed and 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.140
 oily skin death cream for normal 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.880
 my skin in these creams are light beige 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.140
 shades 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.210
 when long ago when these two 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.800
 cream or so in the Russian market I 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.119
 used them and say they are 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.340
 left me some very 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.620
 positive impressions watched the video 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.780
 these girls 9 bloggers do not hear very much 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.700
 good reviews for both of these creams and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.950
 more heard that these creams have changed 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.079
 I want to try the formula again and give 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.969
 some of these creams second chance i 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.649
 I put cream on one half of the face 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.170
 normal skin to another cream for 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.390
 mixed and fat look on feelings 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.579
 the junction is more comfortable for me going through with this 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.170
 cream all day and at the end of the day carried 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.239
 your verdict on what let's get started 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.190
 start flashing themes for normal skin 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.960
 will take him with his fingers 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.960
 it has a pretty thick texture 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.020
 I put it pretty 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.670
 a fat texture is more suitable 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.250
 not for normal skin prone to 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.040
 dry shade of water light but slightly 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.590
 gives in red principle from the skin he merged 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.720
 not bad but it feels pretty 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.210
 I covered all this sticky layer 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.910
 redness there are some vascular 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.650
 asterisks have any browning under 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.990
 eyes on this house if you want 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.330
 thicker coating can be applied 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.190
 the second time on the second part of the face I will put 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.190
 Bibi cream for mixed and oily skin 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.880
 not at all like cream more than this 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.670
 same quantities by body not to 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.130
 apply a thicker coating 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.960
 this cream is more matte and visiting 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.510
 the skin is not sticky at all 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.790
 leaves more yellow color on the boot 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.980
 very well blended my skin tone but 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.930
 Feels like repeating that cream for 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.470
 I liked oily and blended skin 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.540
 more 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.400
 beautiful and muesli on all face for that 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.670
 to test it throughout 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.670
 of the day 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.450
 I'll put all the cream on now 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.130
 Makeup probably confuse this cream I 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.900
 I will not in order to see what 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.140
 funk actions without additional 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.870
 fixing well my makeup is finished 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.690
 it's 826 in the morning ahead of me 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.670
 waiting for a day full of chores i will come back to 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.620
 you in the evening to take out your 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.140
 the verdict on this cream glove is what 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.600
 turned up now we have six hours 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.760
 pm it my whole face 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.550
 nine o'clock cream principle is nowhere 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.430
 gone of course glittered me a little bit you 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.650
 okay but other top right 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.990
 on of course let loose a lot faster and 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.450
 for three or four. close to 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.510
 a little cream slid down the wings again itself 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.340
 creased here and a little bit 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.050
 began to beat precisely the turnpike principle 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.760
 nothing else happened to the cream 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.160
 I did not even stressed these here 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.930
 folds I have everything in place 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.090
 cream I stayed in principle pretty 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.530
 all day I did not feel you on his face 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.720
 very comfortable to wear 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.250
 the face did not shine on remember left not 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.830
 I'm powdering so here this one 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.930
 specifically cream girls with the same skin 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.880
 I can advise on this 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.290
 finish your video thank you very much 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.290
