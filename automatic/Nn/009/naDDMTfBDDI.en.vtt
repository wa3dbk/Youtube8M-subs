00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
epic games developed with them game

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.730 
epic games developed with them game
engines<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.300> games<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.960> we<00:00:10.139> build<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> two

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
engines and games and we build the two

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.620 
engines and games and we build the two
together<00:00:10.980> synergistically<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:12.210> we're

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
together synergistically so we're

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.450 
together synergistically so we're
constantly<00:00:13.019> pushing<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.769> state<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> art

NVIDIA<00:00:46.410> Tegra<00:00:46.559> k1<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:48.059> cool<00:00:48.270> thing<00:00:48.300> about

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
NVIDIA Tegra k1 the cool thing about

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.540 
NVIDIA Tegra k1 the cool thing about
that<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.960> Unreal<00:00:49.500> Engine<00:00:49.620> 4<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.309> their

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that is that Unreal Engine 4 is their

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.069 
that is that Unreal Engine 4 is their
next<00:00:50.730> generation<00:00:51.239> game<00:00:51.449> engine<00:00:51.809> which

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
next generation game engine which

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.380 
next generation game engine which
exploits<00:00:52.649> things<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> dx11<00:00:53.969> feature

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
exploits things like the dx11 feature

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.150 
exploits things like the dx11 feature
set<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.930> now<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.440> same<00:00:55.620> technology<00:00:55.829> is

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
set and now that same technology is

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.180 
set and now that same technology is
coming<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> mobile

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
coming to mobile

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.549 
coming to mobile
so<00:00:59.190> Tegra<00:00:59.850> k1<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.359> our<00:01:00.510> latest<00:01:00.690> SOC<00:01:01.410> or

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
so Tegra k1 is our latest SOC or

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.319 
so Tegra k1 is our latest SOC or
system-on-a-chip<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.609> most<00:01:02.879> exciting

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
system-on-a-chip and the most exciting

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.429 
system-on-a-chip and the most exciting
thing<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.320> integrates

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
thing about that is that it integrates

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440 
thing about that is that it integrates
Kepler<00:01:05.129> our<00:01:05.369> latest<00:01:05.759> geforce<00:01:06.210> GPU

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
Kepler our latest geforce GPU

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.840 
Kepler our latest geforce GPU
architecture<00:01:06.690> it's<00:01:07.560> capable<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.040> dx11<00:01:08.430> class

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
architecture it's capable of dx11 class
features<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.509> opengl<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.649> things<00:01:11.100> like

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
features or opengl for for things like

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.920 
features or opengl for for things like
tessellation<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.030> compute<00:01:12.299> shaders<00:01:12.630> the

tessellation and compute shaders the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.990 
tessellation and compute shaders the
great<00:01:13.110> thing<00:01:13.259> about<00:01:13.290> fall<00:01:13.619> open<00:01:14.159> jail<00:01:14.369> on

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
great thing about fall open jail on

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.550 
great thing about fall open jail on
mobile<00:01:15.390> hardware<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.049> we<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.470> take

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
mobile hardware is that we can take

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.529 
mobile hardware is that we can take
absolutely<00:01:17.100> anything<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.580> runs<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.880> pc<00:01:18.240> or

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
absolutely anything that runs on pc or

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.480 
absolutely anything that runs on pc or
high-end<00:01:18.750> console<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.619> run<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> Tegra

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
hardware from here onward I think we're

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.200
