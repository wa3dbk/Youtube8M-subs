kids all laughed at me because it looked
like<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.740> had<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.010> steel<00:00:29.730> bolt<00:00:30.090> sticking<00:00:30.449> through

my<00:00:30.869> head<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.820> more<00:00:33.030> appropriate<00:00:34.190> mode<00:00:35.190> is

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
my head the more appropriate mode is

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.459 
my head the more appropriate mode is
this<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:35.850> which<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.420> actually<00:00:36.660> fairly<00:00:36.899> handy

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
this one which is actually fairly handy

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.500 
this one which is actually fairly handy
because<00:00:38.190> you're<00:00:38.399> not<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.790> even<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
because you're not going to even in the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.970 
because you're not going to even in the
event<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.809> they<00:00:40.020> fall<00:00:40.320> out<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.710> I'm<00:00:40.829> not

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
event that they fall out here I'm not

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.440 
event that they fall out here I'm not
going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> leave<00:00:41.280> your<00:00:41.460> headphones<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.210> it's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
going to leave your headphones and it's

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.819 
going to leave your headphones and it's
relatively<00:00:42.780> easy<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.050> grab<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.649> put

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
relatively easy to grab them and put

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.869 
relatively easy to grab them and put
them<00:00:43.860> back<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.870> on<00:00:46.039> that<00:00:47.039> topic<00:00:47.280> though<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
them back in on that topic though that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.170 
them back in on that topic though that
they<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.350> pretty<00:00:49.350> massive<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.250> there<00:00:50.850> it's

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
they are pretty massive so there it's

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.060 
they are pretty massive so there it's
going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.690> difficult<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.140> them<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> stay

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
going to be difficult for them to stay

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.160 
going to be difficult for them to stay
in<00:00:54.469> they<00:00:55.469> do<00:00:55.530> come<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.129> varying<00:00:57.059> sizes<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
in they do come with varying sizes and

in they do come with varying sizes and
actually<00:00:59.070> end<00:00:59.340> plugs<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
actually end plugs so you have that

medium<00:01:04.799> I'm<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> go<00:01:05.430> much<00:01:05.880> smaller<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
medium I'm going to go much smaller and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.060 
medium I'm going to go much smaller and
larger<00:01:07.290> from<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:11.240> see<00:01:12.590> one<00:01:13.590> thing<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:14.010> we

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
larger from there see one thing that we

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.330 
larger from there see one thing that we
did<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.340> issue<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:14.700> us<00:01:14.880> finding<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:16.340> port

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
did have issue with us finding the port

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.030 
did have issue with us finding the port
to<00:01:17.580> plug<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.240> charge<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:19.040> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to plug it in to charge it the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.440 
to plug it in to charge it the
instructions<00:01:20.520> say<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
instructions say that this is on the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.830 
instructions say that this is on the
right-hand<00:01:21.890> plug<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.580> back<00:01:23.850> actually

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
right-hand plug on the back actually

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.679 
right-hand plug on the back actually
it's<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.500> left<00:01:25.799> hand<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.659> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
it's on the left hand you just have to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.170 
it's on the left hand you just have to
kind<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.020> pry<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.380> little<00:01:29.009> sucker<00:01:29.549> off<00:01:29.820> there

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
kind of pry this little sucker off there

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.230 
kind of pry this little sucker off there
and<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.290> charge<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.460> blends<00:01:33.000> in

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and you can charge it was it blends in

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.240 
and you can charge it was it blends in
rather<00:01:33.420> nicely<00:01:33.689> sounds<00:01:34.110> pretty<00:01:34.290> hard<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> find

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
my iphone it refused to record anything

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.590 
my iphone it refused to record anything
from<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.100> almost<00:02:11.430> as<00:02:11.610> if<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.880> didn't<00:02:12.240> recognize

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
from it almost as if it didn't recognize

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.890 
from it almost as if it didn't recognize
there<00:02:12.810> was<00:02:12.960> an<00:02:13.110> audio<00:02:13.380> input<00:02:13.560> device<00:02:13.980> at<00:02:14.160> all

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
there was an audio input device at all

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.180 
there was an audio input device at all
so<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.380> wasn't<00:02:16.880> great<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:17.910> if<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:18.960> is<00:02:19.190> if

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
so that wasn't great so if this is if

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.890 
so that wasn't great so if this is if
the<00:02:20.370> microphone<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.760> party<00:02:21.090> beer<00:02:21.270> default<00:02:21.660> use

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
the microphone is party beer default use

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.420 
the microphone is party beer default use
case<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.320> wouldn't<00:02:22.500> recommend<00:02:22.800> for<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:25.430> what

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
case I wouldn't recommend for that what

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.010 
case I wouldn't recommend for that what
else<00:02:26.730> could<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.150> tell<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:29.040> does<00:02:29.810> say<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.900> has

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
else could I tell you it does say it has

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.410 
else could I tell you it does say it has
a<00:02:31.050> cell<00:02:31.440> phone<00:02:31.470> function<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:35.180> don't<00:02:36.180> honestly

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
a cell phone function I don't honestly

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.170 
a cell phone function I don't honestly
know<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:39.380> did<00:02:40.380> not<00:02:40.560> try<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.550> given<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
know I did not try that and given the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.940 
know I did not try that and given the
state<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.480> microphone<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.440> wouldn't

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
state of the microphone I wouldn't

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.810 
state of the microphone I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.760> particularly<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:46.830> guess<00:02:47.700> my

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
recommend it particularly I guess my

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.820 
recommend it particularly I guess my
last<00:02:48.030> point<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.750> instructions<00:02:51.350> these<00:02:52.350> are

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
last point is the instructions these are

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.400 
last point is the instructions these are
the<00:02:52.950> instructions<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.490> question<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:55.170> most

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
the instructions in question the most

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.430 
the instructions in question the most
useful<00:02:55.650> thing<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.460> chart<00:02:57.210> that<00:02:57.630> lays<00:02:58.200> out

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
useful thing is this chart that lays out

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.290 
useful thing is this chart that lays out
the<00:02:59.480> various<00:03:00.480> parts<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.730> headphones<00:03:02.730> and

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
the various parts of the headphones and

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.680 
the various parts of the headphones and
the<00:03:04.020> controls<00:03:04.880> as<00:03:05.880> we<00:03:06.180> saw<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.480> with<00:03:06.600> the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
the controls as we saw it with the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.000 
the controls as we saw it with the
charging<00:03:07.080> plate<00:03:07.290> not<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> hundred<00:03:07.890> percent

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
charging plate not a hundred percent

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.270 
charging plate not a hundred percent
accurate<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:10.820> these<00:03:11.820> are<00:03:12.860> kind<00:03:13.860> of

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
accurate but these are kind of

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.820 
accurate but these are kind of
comprehensible<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:16.020> guess<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.530> would<00:03:16.620> close

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
comprehensible so I guess I would close

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.800 
comprehensible so I guess I would close
by<00:03:16.980> saying<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.370> these<00:03:17.580> are<00:03:17.760> by<00:03:17.850> far<00:03:18.240> not<00:03:18.570> the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
by saying that these are by far not the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.250 
by saying that these are by far not the
best<00:03:19.290> headphones<00:03:19.760> I've<00:03:20.760> come<00:03:21.150> across<00:03:21.270> I'd

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
best headphones I've come across I'd

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.920 
best headphones I've come across I'd
recommend<00:03:23.000> looking<00:03:24.000> at<00:03:24.330> something<00:03:24.540> with<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
recommend looking at something with a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.120 
recommend looking at something with a
little<00:03:26.000> little<00:03:27.000> better<00:03:27.590> offering<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:28.770> just

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
little little better offering in just

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.940 
little little better offering in just
about<00:03:29.280> every<00:03:29.640> way<00:03:30.380> their<00:03:31.380> servers<00:03:31.770> won't

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
about every way their servers won't

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.110 
about every way their servers won't
forget<00:03:32.190> him<00:03:32.310> for<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.490> Christmas<00:03:32.850> gift<00:03:32.970> you
