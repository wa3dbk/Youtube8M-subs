00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
to get the switches out so you'll have

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.070 
to get the switches out so you'll have
to<00:02:30.410> get<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.590> tool<00:02:30.970> for<00:02:31.970> this<00:02:32.330> nut<00:02:33.910> right<00:02:34.910> here<00:02:35.330> to

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
to get a tool for this nut right here to

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.290 
to get a tool for this nut right here to
get<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.410> switches<00:02:36.830> out<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.120> can

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
get the switches out so that you can

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.050 
get the switches out so that you can
replace<00:02:38.630> them<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.070> maybe<00:02:40.070> you<00:02:40.310> can<00:02:40.460> adjust<00:02:40.850> it

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
replace them and maybe you can adjust it

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.330 
replace them and maybe you can adjust it
by<00:02:41.870> turning<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.620> nut<00:02:42.770> back
