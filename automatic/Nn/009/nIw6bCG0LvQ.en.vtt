00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
going to be doing a benchmark comparison

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.150 
going to be doing a benchmark comparison
and<00:00:10.930> just<00:00:11.139> an<00:00:11.260> overall<00:00:11.619> performance

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
and the LG g3 cat6 it could be argued

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.550 
and the LG g3 cat6 it could be argued
that<00:00:19.060> these<00:00:19.300> are<00:00:19.449> some<00:00:19.600> of<00:00:19.690> the<00:00:19.780> best<00:00:19.990> Android

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560

now<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:30.100> have<00:00:30.430> reviewed<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.000> original

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
now I have reviewed the original

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.569 
now I have reviewed the original
variants<00:00:31.960> of<00:00:32.079> these<00:00:32.320> two<00:00:32.559> smartphones<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:33.340> by

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
variants of these two smartphones and by

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.400 
variants of these two smartphones and by
no<00:00:33.640> means<00:00:33.820> are<00:00:34.239> they<00:00:34.300> allow<00:00:34.750> in<00:00:35.050> terms<00:00:35.230> of

no means are they allow in terms of

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.229 
no means are they allow in terms of
performance<00:00:35.530> but<00:00:36.310> you<00:00:36.460> have<00:00:36.610> to<00:00:36.730> get<00:00:36.880> over<00:00:37.000> the

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
performance but you have to get over the

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.060 
performance but you have to get over the
fact<00:00:37.420> that<00:00:37.570> TouchWiz<00:00:38.140> is<00:00:38.290> very<00:00:38.500> heavy<00:00:38.800> it's

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
fact that TouchWiz is very heavy it's

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.560 
fact that TouchWiz is very heavy it's
going<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:39.370> bog<00:00:39.550> down<00:00:39.579> the<00:00:39.910> performance<00:00:40.390> of<00:00:40.480> the

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
going to bog down the performance of the

this is going to determine the power of

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.550 
this is going to determine the power of
the<00:01:06.969> adrenal<00:01:07.180> 420<00:01:07.810> even<00:01:08.229> though<00:01:08.319> there's<00:01:08.439> not

those tests as well now this could be

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.680 
those tests as well now this could be
due<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.190> fact<00:02:09.399> that<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.670> s5<00:02:10.060> only<00:02:10.390> has<00:02:10.539> to

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.510 
to open in justice this is another game
that<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:43.050> know<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:43.380> it's<00:04:43.500> heavy<00:04:43.710> on<00:04:43.800> graphics

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520

that I know that it's heavy on graphics
and<00:04:44.700> as<00:04:44.790> you<00:04:44.880> can<00:04:45.000> see<00:04:45.120> right<00:04:45.240> off<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.510> bat<00:04:45.690> the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
and as you can see right off the bat the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.200 
and as you can see right off the bat the
g3<00:04:46.290> cat6<00:04:46.830> is<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.040> little<00:04:47.400> bit<00:04:47.520> ahead<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.970> the

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
g3 cat6 is a little bit ahead of the

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.630 
g3 cat6 is a little bit ahead of the
lte-a<00:04:48.750> but<00:04:49.500> it's<00:04:49.620> about<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.070> change

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
lte-a but it's about to change

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.740 
lte-a but it's about to change
I'm<00:04:50.940> just<00:04:51.150> going<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.330> go<00:04:51.420> ahead<00:04:51.540> and

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
I'm just going to go ahead and

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.970 
I'm just going to go ahead and
fast-forward<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.350> clip<00:04:52.560> because<00:04:52.710> it's<00:04:52.920> a

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
fast-forward the clip because it's a

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.260 
fast-forward the clip because it's a
bunch<00:04:53.160> of<00:04:53.280> information<00:04:53.520> regarding<00:04:54.180> the

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
bunch of information regarding the

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.790 
bunch of information regarding the
matrix<00:04:54.600> of<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.810> game<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.200> just<00:04:55.290> credits<00:04:55.650> and

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
matrix of the game and just credits and

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.440 
matrix of the game and just credits and
things<00:04:55.920> like<00:04:56.130> that<00:04:56.310> but<00:04:56.640> the<00:04:56.760> important<00:04:57.270> part

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
things like that but the important part

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.050 
things like that but the important part
is<00:04:57.660> right<00:04:57.870> here<00:04:58.230> you<00:04:58.530> can<00:04:58.710> see<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.010> s5<00:04:59.460> lte-a

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
is right here you can see the s5 lte-a

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.600 
is right here you can see the s5 lte-a
caught<00:05:00.540> up<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.170> g3<00:05:01.620> cat6<00:05:02.130> and<00:05:02.310> it's

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
caught up to the g3 cat6 and it's

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.400 
caught up to the g3 cat6 and it's
running<00:05:02.850> nearly<00:05:03.270> at<00:05:03.420> the<00:05:03.450> same<00:05:03.840> exact<00:05:04.290> time

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
is a head of the g3 cat6 so we're going

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.690 
is a head of the g3 cat6 so we're going
to<00:05:13.170> go<00:05:13.290> ahead<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.620> go<00:05:13.710> one<00:05:13.950> step<00:05:14.190> further<00:05:14.400> and

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
to go ahead and go one step further and

open one of the app scene and you can

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.820 
open one of the app scene and you can
see<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.340> g3<00:05:17.760> cat6<00:05:18.330> definitely<00:05:19.170> opens<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.680> app

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
see the g3 cat6 definitely opens the app

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.580 
see the g3 cat6 definitely opens the app
a<00:05:20.070> little<00:05:20.280> bit<00:05:20.520> quicker<00:05:20.790> than<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.150> LTE<00:05:21.540> a<00:05:21.690> s5

now<00:05:23.160> we're<00:05:23.340> going<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.490> go<00:05:23.640> even<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:24.000> little<00:05:24.030> bit

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
now we're going to go even a little bit

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.300 
now we're going to go even a little bit
further<00:05:24.630> than<00:05:24.840> that<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:25.500> play<00:05:25.920> the<00:05:26.100> trailer
