once you hold the device it shouldn't
take<00:00:22.769> longer<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.340> appreciate<00:00:23.789> its<00:00:24.000> aesthetics

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
take longer to appreciate its aesthetics

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.259 
take longer to appreciate its aesthetics
and<00:00:24.689> fun<00:00:24.900> factor<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:26.130> not<00:00:26.400> about<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.910> form

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269

about the right combination or the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.370 
about the right combination or the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
balance between them and Sony knows how

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.580

to<00:00:34.440> render<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.950> perfectly<00:00:35.540> well

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
to render it perfectly well

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.720 
to render it perfectly well
single-handed<00:00:37.590> usability<00:00:38.250> should<00:00:38.579> be

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
single-handed usability should be

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.060 
single-handed usability should be
questioned<00:00:39.210> because<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.290> made<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:40.920> that

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
questioned because it's made for that

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.360 
questioned because it's made for that
