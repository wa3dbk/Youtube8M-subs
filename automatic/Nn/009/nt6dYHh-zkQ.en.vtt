section<00:01:12.140> we<00:01:13.140> got<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.299> air

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
section we got going on here is a air

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.990 
section we got going on here is a air
conditioning<00:01:15.869> was<00:01:16.229> right<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:17.640> window

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
conditioning was right here this window

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.710 
conditioning was right here this window
and<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.210> leaked<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.080> rotted<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.890> wood<00:01:20.159> I

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
and it leaked and rotted out the wood I

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.999 
and it leaked and rotted out the wood I
eat<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.600> outside<00:01:24.990> piece<00:01:25.259> so

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
eat this one and the outside piece so

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.649 
eat this one and the outside piece so
probably<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.490> we'll<00:01:26.670> need<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.420> take

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
probably what we'll need to do is take

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.680 
probably what we'll need to do is take
down<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.020> old<00:01:28.170> wall

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.770 

so<00:01:32.320> that's<00:01:33.160> when<00:01:33.280> we<00:01:33.310> project<00:01:33.550> but<00:01:34.540> luckily

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
so that's when we project but luckily

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.280 
so that's when we project but luckily
once<00:01:35.680> again<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:37.210> metal<00:01:37.480> frame<00:01:37.690> pieces<00:01:38.020> right

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
once again the metal frame pieces right

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.460 
once again the metal frame pieces right
here<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:39.160> trailer<00:01:39.490> sits<00:01:39.760> on<00:01:39.940> so<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:41.320> not

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
here that trailer sits on so it's not

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.890 
here that trailer sits on so it's not
like<00:01:41.680> its<00:01:41.920> way<00:01:42.340> far<00:01:42.550> back<00:01:42.670> I'm<00:01:43.480> probably<00:01:43.690> going

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
like its way far back I'm probably going

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.170 
like its way far back I'm probably going
to<00:01:43.990> go<00:01:44.170> ahead<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:45.700> if<00:01:45.820> I<00:01:45.940> can<00:01:46.150> shim<00:01:46.870> knees

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to go ahead and see if I can shim knees

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.880 
to go ahead and see if I can shim knees
put<00:01:49.180> two<00:01:49.330> pieces<00:01:49.510> wheel<00:01:49.810> on<00:01:49.930> each<00:01:50.050> side<00:01:50.350> run

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
put two pieces wheel on each side run

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.370 
put two pieces wheel on each side run
bolts<00:01:51.310> do<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.670> when<00:01:52.150> I<00:01:52.270> want<00:01:52.480> or<00:01:52.630> you<00:01:53.050> know<00:01:53.230> that

bolts do it when I want or you know that

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.410 
bolts do it when I want or you know that
only<00:01:53.470> goes<00:01:53.650> to<00:01:53.800> write<00:01:53.950> about<00:01:54.100> their<00:01:54.420> might

only goes to write about their might
just<00:01:55.630> rip<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:55.870> up<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.230> do<00:01:56.290> that<00:01:57.510> but<00:01:58.510> that's<00:01:58.690> a

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
just rip it up and do that but that's a

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:18.270 
just rip it up and do that but that's a
start<00:01:59.110> right<00:01:59.230> there<00:02:16.050> OOP<00:02:17.050> good<00:02:17.380> life<00:02:17.530> the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
start right there OOP good life the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:51.450 
start right there OOP good life the
light<00:02:18.460> widow

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.520 

got<00:02:52.460> this<00:02:52.610> wall<00:02:52.880> we<00:02:53.600> got<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.780> lot<00:02:53.990> of<00:02:54.020> rock<00:02:54.290> right

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
got this wall we got a lot of rock right

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.730 
got this wall we got a lot of rock right
here<00:02:55.660> hopefully<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.810> two<00:02:56.990> by<00:02:57.110> sixes<00:02:57.470> are<00:02:57.620> not

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
here hopefully the two by sixes are not

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.380 
here hopefully the two by sixes are not
affected<00:02:58.190> too<00:02:58.370> much<00:02:58.610> but<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:58.940> think<00:02:59.150> they<00:02:59.270> all
