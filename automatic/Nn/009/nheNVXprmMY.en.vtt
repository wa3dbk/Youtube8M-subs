I believe the pixel densities 316 PPI
but<00:04:29.770> I<00:04:29.950> also<00:04:30.370> believe<00:04:30.850> it<00:04:30.970> will<00:04:31.180> take<00:04:31.330> a

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
but I also believe it will take a

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.510 
but I also believe it will take a
pentile<00:04:31.990> matrix<00:04:32.160> arrangement<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:33.310> can't

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
pentile matrix arrangement you can't

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.420 
pentile matrix arrangement you can't
really<00:04:33.700> see<00:04:34.090> here<00:04:34.450> but<00:04:35.050> we'll<00:04:35.800> take<00:04:35.950> a<00:04:36.010> look<00:04:36.100> as

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
really see here but we'll take a look as

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.100 
really see here but we'll take a look as
we<00:04:36.610> zoom<00:04:36.880> in<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.240> take<00:04:37.360> some<00:04:37.390> photos<00:04:37.690> and

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
we zoom in and take some photos and

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.170 
we zoom in and take some photos and
check<00:04:38.290> it<00:04:38.380> out<00:04:38.500> but<00:04:38.710> believe<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.460> is<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.610> pentile

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
check it out but believe it is a pentile

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.450 
check it out but believe it is a pentile
matrix<00:04:40.290> arrangement<00:04:41.290> but<00:04:41.650> nonetheless<00:04:42.010> it's
