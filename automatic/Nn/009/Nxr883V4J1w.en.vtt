has<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.380> original<00:02:15.579> 4.3<00:02:16.579> gigabyte<00:02:17.120> hard<00:02:17.390> drive

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.860 

and<00:02:20.720> as<00:02:21.019> you<00:02:21.230> see<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.680> has<00:02:22.150> 128<00:02:23.150> megabytes<00:02:23.390> of

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
and as you see it has 128 megabytes of

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.949 
and as you see it has 128 megabytes of
RAM<00:02:24.320> it<00:02:25.040> originally<00:02:25.820> had<00:02:25.850> 64<00:02:26.720> May<00:02:28.959> and

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
RAM it originally had 64 May and

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.650 
RAM it originally had 64 May and
everything<00:02:30.320> looks<00:02:30.560> pretty<00:02:30.890> nice<00:02:31.100> inside<00:02:31.660> hang

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
everything looks pretty nice inside hang

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.920 
everything looks pretty nice inside hang
on<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.989> second<00:02:33.380> loop<00:02:33.530> put<00:02:34.070> down<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.459> camera<00:02:34.930> so

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
on a second loop put down the camera so

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:48.070 
on a second loop put down the camera so
you<00:02:35.959> can<00:02:36.200> get<00:02:36.500> light

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.410 

now<00:02:49.080> we're<00:02:49.290> on<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.560> inside<00:02:51.739> this<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.920> the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
now we're on the inside this is the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.630 
now we're on the inside this is the
processor<00:02:54.420> fan<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.099> intel<00:02:56.550> chipset

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
processor fan this is the intel chipset

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.320 
processor fan this is the intel chipset
it<00:02:59.640> has<00:02:59.849> all<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.480> hardware's<00:03:01.230> built<00:03:01.590> into<00:03:02.040> it

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.640 

yeah<00:03:06.330> this<00:03:06.599> processor<00:03:07.380> fan<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.920> very<00:03:08.459> noisy

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
yeah this processor fan is very noisy

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.650 
yeah this processor fan is very noisy
absolute<00:03:10.650> submit<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.430> makes<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.819> most<00:03:12.000> noises

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
absolute submit it makes the most noises

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.550 
absolute submit it makes the most noises
you<00:03:13.650> don't<00:03:13.830> need<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.010> clean<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:14.549> computer
