00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.109
 hello we welcome you out there today 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.810
 Let's move a terrace with the multi 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.640
 phone out so you can enjoy it for a long time 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.380
 have them and no mistakes happen 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.550
 show you how to do it 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.949
 Just come with them 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.509
 multi covers of osmo are there in 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.230
 different profiles and 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.180
 surfaces 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.519
 we will show you the following 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.280
 Laying the full professional on a grown 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.870
 ground 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.670
 a good planning of your project 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.090
 guarantees a smooth flow 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.010
 During the execution, pay attention 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.960
 Here also necessarily the general 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.899
 hints on terrace installation and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.899
 further information at www auto de 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.060
 First of all, a sustainable underground must be provided 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.990
 for the terrace construction 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.570
 be created 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.910
 The root will fleece on the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.080
 Grown soil designed around weeds 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.080
 grew to prevent 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.120
 the following underground consists of 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.790
 a gravel or pebble bed 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.540
 on the then still about 5 cm thick 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.010
 splitt is applied 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.840
 everything should be well condensed and 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.790
 then leveled out with a time 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.650
 become 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.120
 when laying the success profile 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.130
 you can if you have enough 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.130
 Water drain on a slope renounce 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.790
 as in stock for the later 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.700
 substructure offer so-called 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.800
 concrete bricks on 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.070
 these will be separated by a maximum of 60 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.020
 cm twist-resistant laid and form 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:57.060
 thus a stable basis for the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:58.700
 construction now to the under 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.800
 Construction walk 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.310
 These must have a pitch of 35 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.170
 up to 40 centimeters 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.759
 the distance of the bars to firm 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.860
 components is at least one 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.480
 centimeters around a long stretch 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.709
 of the material 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.560
 furthermore, this may end up 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.790
 at most 2 cm above the construction 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.220
 stick out 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.959
 the final cut of the dealer 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.550
 but only at the end of the 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.890
 assembly for the fine adjustment of the 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.410
 Bars are worked with underlay 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.840
 These are available in different strengths 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.200
 This makes the construction very accurate 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.549
 be aligned 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.440
 By the way, the cavities between the 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.120
 concrete bricks must not be filled 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.780
 be sufficient 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.340
 to ensure ventilation 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.780
 in the area of floor joints, the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.980
 Substructure be routed twice 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.410
 pay attention to one when planning 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.790
 Offset of the shocks is achieved by this 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.360
 a better stability of the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.360
 total construction 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.590
 the substructure must beam 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.610
 not necessarily with the underground 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.560
 get connected 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.450
 but to move or a 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.700
 prevent slipping of the profiles 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.150
 should put these on some with the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.349
 concrete bricks are connected 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.209
 this applies to the border areas of 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:24.110
 substructure and for all the the 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:28.030
 collisions with head-bumps must always be airy 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.030
 be respected between the profiles 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:38.420
 rub on before drilling and then to 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.230
 Example with so-called screws 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.230
 fix 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.480
 for fixing the first floor 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.370
 let's assemble the city ​​brace these 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.489
 gets in the distance of two centimeters too 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.080
 Fixed components fixed to drill 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.110
 first with a two and a half 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.760
 millimeter thick drill in front and center 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.849
 then fix the bracket with the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.739
 associated bolt as soon as you get the 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.540
 strong chamber on each substructure 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.239
 they can screw the first one 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.500
 Multi covers floor laying 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.540
 Now it is with the standard brace 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.890
 continued to work 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.690
 here again with me on the bar 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.260
 Before drilling and the brace with the 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.340
 fix the screw 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.889
 please note that in the area 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.630
 The head joints have an expansion joint of five 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.630
 up to seven millimeters is to be kept 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.400
 Finally, the planks are in 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.290
 border area of ​​the construction 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.550
 tailored 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.700
 Here, the distance must be fixed 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:47.560
 components 2 cm to be incorporated 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.520
 to allow the overall construction so 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.380
 that 's it 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.420
 We wish you a lot of fun with it 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.420
 their new multi tech terrace from osmo 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.340
 further information on this and too 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.350
 you will find many other products
