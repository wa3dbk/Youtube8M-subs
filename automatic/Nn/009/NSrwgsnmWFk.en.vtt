half<00:02:07.220> was<00:02:07.430> was<00:02:07.820> play<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.539> mismatches<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.380> put

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
half was was play to mismatches and put

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.050 
half was was play to mismatches and put
their<00:02:09.979> head<00:02:10.100> down<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.460> drive<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.820> which<00:02:10.940> was

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
their head down and drive it which was

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.960 
their head down and drive it which was
smart<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:12.010> we<00:02:13.010> didn't<00:02:13.190> do<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.310> good<00:02:13.430> job<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:13.820> wish

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
smart and we didn't do a good job I wish

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.430 
smart and we didn't do a good job I wish
I'd<00:02:14.120> gone<00:02:14.270> zone<00:02:14.570> earlier<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.110> half<00:02:15.260> instead

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
I'd gone zone earlier and a half instead

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.050 
I'd gone zone earlier and a half instead
of<00:02:15.650> waiting<00:02:15.830> till<00:02:16.010> about<00:02:16.130> six<00:02:16.550> minutes<00:02:16.730> left

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
of waiting till about six minutes left

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
of waiting till about six minutes left
but<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:19.000> think<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.150> would<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.390> think<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.690> exposed

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
but I think it would I think it exposed

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.020 
but I think it would I think it exposed
us<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.740> think<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.250> told<00:02:22.520> some<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.880> our

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
us and I think it told some of our

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.410 
us and I think it told some of our
better<00:02:23.600> defenders<00:02:24.170> supposedly<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:26.000> hey<00:02:26.209> we

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
better defenders supposedly that hey we

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.390 
better defenders supposedly that hey we
got<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.660> turn<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.930> up<00:02:27.050> some<00:02:27.290> because<00:02:27.680> some<00:02:28.370> of

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
got to turn it up some because some of

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.240 
got to turn it up some because some of
our<00:02:28.550> better<00:02:28.760> defenders<00:02:29.800> got<00:02:30.800> treated<00:02:31.040> pretty

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
our better defenders got treated pretty

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.330 
our better defenders got treated pretty
poorly<00:02:31.640> there<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.150> second<00:02:32.480> half<00:02:32.800> but<00:02:33.800> you

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
poorly there in the second half but you

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.710 
poorly there in the second half but you
know<00:02:34.430> with<00:02:34.550> all<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.700> being<00:02:35.000> said<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:35.330> got<00:02:35.690> to

know with all that being said you got to

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.330 
know with all that being said you got to
be<00:02:35.840> able<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.990> guard<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.320> ball<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.800> NCAA

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.090 
fans will get out there you know I
haven't<00:02:43.970> really<00:02:44.180> given<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.540> lot<00:02:44.570> of<00:02:44.720> thought

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
haven't really given a lot of thought

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.350 
haven't really given a lot of thought
about<00:02:46.100> our<00:02:46.250> fans<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.820> think<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.120> usually

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
about our fans that I think it usually

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.910 
about our fans that I think it usually
goes<00:02:47.540> without<00:02:47.810> saying<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.320> our<00:02:48.440> fans<00:02:48.650> show

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
goes without saying that our fans show

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.550 
goes without saying that our fans show
up<00:02:48.950> but<00:02:49.510> certainly<00:02:50.510> with<00:02:50.750> Wisconsin<00:02:51.410> being

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
up but certainly with Wisconsin being

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.820 
up but certainly with Wisconsin being
here<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.510> don't<00:02:53.600> know<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:53.930> would<00:02:54.500> think<00:02:54.650> our

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
here and I don't know I would think our

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.500 
here and I don't know I would think our
fans<00:02:55.040> would<00:02:55.340> would<00:02:55.700> have<00:02:55.790> known<00:02:56.030> for<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.420> last

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
fans would would have known for the last

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.170 
fans would would have known for the last
month<00:02:57.470> or<00:02:57.620> two<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.830> there's<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:59.090> know

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
month or two that there's the you know

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.030 
month or two that there's the you know
veteran<00:02:59.480> 50/50<00:03:00.050> chance<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.620> we'd<00:03:00.890> be

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
veteran 50/50 chance that we'd be

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.540 
veteran 50/50 chance that we'd be
playing<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:01.610> Omaha<00:03:02.170> in<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.560> first<00:03:03.800> weekend<00:03:04.280> so

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
playing in Omaha in the first weekend so

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.430 
playing in Omaha in the first weekend so
you<00:03:04.910> know<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.270> hope<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.870> they<00:03:05.989> were<00:03:06.050> able<00:03:06.380> to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
you know I hope that they were able to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.650 
you know I hope that they were able to
secure<00:03:06.950> tickets<00:03:07.400> but<00:03:07.580> if<00:03:08.060> they<00:03:08.180> haven't<00:03:08.510> got

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
secure tickets but if they haven't got

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.020 
secure tickets but if they haven't got
them<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:09.410> would<00:03:10.100> think<00:03:10.250> if<00:03:10.430> they're<00:03:10.580> created

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
them I would think if they're created

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.370 
them I would think if they're created
they<00:03:11.150> can<00:03:11.299> still<00:03:11.510> get<00:03:11.720> them<00:03:11.840> because<00:03:12.019> I<00:03:12.200> know

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
they can still get them because I know

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.590 
they can still get them because I know
Iowa<00:03:12.799> State<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.340> figured<00:03:14.060> out<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.150> way<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.390> get

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
Iowa State I figured out a way to get

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.120 
Iowa State I figured out a way to get
them<00:03:14.690> in<00:03:14.780> Kansas<00:03:15.080> City<00:03:15.320> I<00:03:15.410> think<00:03:15.530> our<00:03:15.890> fans

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
them in Kansas City I think our fans

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.190 
them in Kansas City I think our fans
have<00:03:16.610> always<00:03:16.820> been<00:03:17.090> creative<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.810> have

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
have always been creative and have

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.780 
have always been creative and have
always<00:03:18.350> figured<00:03:18.769> out<00:03:18.860> two<00:03:19.010> ways<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.549> get<00:03:19.700> them

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
always figured out two ways to get them

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.310 
always figured out two ways to get them
wherever<00:03:19.970> we<00:03:20.239> were<00:03:20.360> playing<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.930> hopefully

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
wherever we were playing and hopefully

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.400 
wherever we were playing and hopefully
Omaha<00:03:21.709> will<00:03:21.950> not<00:03:22.190> be<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.459> exception<00:03:22.790> are<00:03:23.269> you
