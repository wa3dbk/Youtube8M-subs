00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.480 
with this with this instrument it could
also<00:01:54.110> be<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.350> trombone<00:01:54.740> or<00:01:54.770> tuba<00:01:55.190> doesn't

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
also be a trombone or tuba doesn't

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.990 
also be a trombone or tuba doesn't
matter<00:01:56.110> but<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.350> lot<00:01:57.680> of<00:01:57.770> times<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.550> instrument

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
matter but a lot of times the instrument

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.730 
matter but a lot of times the instrument
will<00:01:59.120> win<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.840> the<00:01:59.990> reason<00:02:00.320> is<00:02:00.440> because<00:02:00.470> you

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
will win and the reason is because you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.510 
will win and the reason is because you
have<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.040> develop<00:02:01.400> this<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:03.410> just<00:02:04.100> because

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
have and develop this and just because

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.990 
have and develop this and just because
you<00:02:05.110> increase<00:02:06.110> your<00:02:06.380> range<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.190> got<00:02:07.790> all

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
you increase your range and got all

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.580 
you increase your range and got all
these<00:02:08.119> high<00:02:08.329> notes<00:02:08.539> at<00:02:08.689> your<00:02:08.840> disposal<00:02:09.200> does

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
these high notes at your disposal does

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.699 
these high notes at your disposal does
that<00:02:09.799> mean<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.039> got<00:02:10.189> to<00:02:10.310> be<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.429> screaming<00:02:11.030> fool

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
that mean you got to be a screaming fool

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.520

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
notes to your range I'm not going around

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.220 
notes to your range I'm not going around
trying<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.090> beat<00:02:18.360> everybody<00:02:18.810> over<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.050> head

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
better and it's easier just imagine

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
reason it's easy or one of the reasons

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.729 
reason it's easy or one of the reasons
is<00:03:23.880> because<00:03:24.269> your<00:03:24.420> range<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:24.989> far<00:03:25.410> above

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
is because your range is so far above

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.449 
is because your range is so far above

that playing low c e g even middle c is

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.940 
that playing low c e g even middle c is
a<00:03:29.489> piece<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.790> cake<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.299> cakewalk

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
a piece of cake is a cakewalk

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.670 
philosophy of wanting to keep building
range<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.140> power<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:40.260> don't<00:03:40.470> have

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
range and power is that you don't have

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.430 
range and power is that you don't have
to<00:03:40.830> hotdog<00:03:41.190> all<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.459> time<00:03:41.670> if<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.480> if<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:43.049> do

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
to hotdog all the time if you if you do

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.410 
to hotdog all the time if you if you do
want<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.709> hotdog<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:44.280> got<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.670> it's<00:03:44.880> there<00:03:45.150> he

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
want a hotdog you got it it's there he

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.300 
want a hotdog you got it it's there he
can<00:03:45.570> use<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.989> but<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.590> don't<00:03:46.709> have<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.040> do<00:03:47.160> that

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
can use it but you don't have to do that

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.710 
can use it but you don't have to do that
if<00:03:47.430> you're<00:03:47.549> not<00:03:47.579> that<00:03:47.850> type<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.120> personality

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
if you're not that type of personality

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.840 
if you're not that type of personality
what's<00:03:49.650> going<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.829> happen<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.340> if<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:50.610> have

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
what's going to happen is if you have

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.550 
what's going to happen is if you have
the<00:03:51.030> extra<00:03:51.390> range<00:03:51.660> all<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.140> stuff<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.470> you

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
the extra range all the stuff that you

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.160 
the extra range all the stuff that you
plan<00:03:52.769> now<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.130> gets<00:03:53.280> easier<00:03:53.910> your<00:03:54.750> endurance

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
plan now it gets easier your endurance

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.620 
plan now it gets easier your endurance
doubles<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.040> triples<00:03:56.160> your<00:03:56.640> tongue<00:03:57.450> that's

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.140 
mentioned just a couple of minutes ago
that's<00:04:00.660> why<00:04:01.079> you<00:04:01.500> increase<00:04:01.829> your<00:04:02.010> range<00:04:02.220> it's

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150

for my course if people would you know
let<00:05:46.870> me<00:05:47.020> know<00:05:47.290> how<00:05:47.890> many

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
let me know how many

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.219 
let me know how many
for<00:05:48.790> example<00:05:49.150> C's<00:05:49.330> they<00:05:49.510> could<00:05:49.660> let<00:05:49.810> buzz<00:05:50.020> or

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
for example C's they could let buzz or

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.140 
for example C's they could let buzz or
they<00:05:50.320> can<00:05:50.470> do<00:05:50.680> in<00:05:50.800> their<00:05:50.890> mouthpiece<00:05:51.250> I<00:05:51.669> guess

that<00:05:52.270> was<00:05:52.360> too<00:05:52.479> hard<00:05:52.690> for<00:05:52.750> most<00:05:52.930> everybody<00:05:53.260> so

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
that was too hard for most everybody so

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.710 
that was too hard for most everybody so
scratch<00:05:54.010> that<00:05:54.040> one<00:05:54.900> so<00:05:55.900> bottom<00:05:56.200> line<00:05:56.229> is<00:05:56.490> I

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
scratch that one so bottom line is I

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.390 
scratch that one so bottom line is I
basically<00:05:58.720> don't<00:05:59.260> care<00:05:59.470> who's<00:05:59.770> watching<00:06:00.040> this
