at<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> bottom<00:00:21.869> here<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> key

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
at the bottom here but one of the key

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.250 
at the bottom here but one of the key
features<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
features on this really is that the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.689 
features on this really is that the
camera<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.650> only<00:00:25.800> eight<00:00:26.099> point<00:00:26.460> five

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
camera is only eight point five

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.759 
camera is only eight point five
millimeters<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.420> diameter<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.349> really

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
millimeters in diameter so it really

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.560 
millimeters in diameter so it really
does<00:00:28.980> extend<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> visits<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.300> tool

maybe inside engines if you're
mechanically<00:00:38.850> minded<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.570> need<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.809> get

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
mechanically minded and you need to get

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.389 
mechanically minded and you need to get
into<00:00:40.079> those<00:00:40.260> little<00:00:40.379> nooks<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.800> crannies<00:00:41.160> of

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
into those little nooks and crannies of

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.420 
into those little nooks and crannies of
an<00:00:41.879> engine<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.079> has<00:00:43.200> an<00:00:43.290> LCD<00:00:43.559> display<00:00:43.680> here

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
an engine so it has an LCD display here

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.000 
an engine so it has an LCD display here
and<00:00:44.670> if<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.420> switch<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.620> it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and if we switch it on you can see it

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.139 
and if we switch it on you can see it
produces<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> nice<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.270> nice<00:00:48.750> clear<00:00:49.050> picture<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
produces a nice a nice clear picture and

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.549 
produces a nice a nice clear picture and
sometimes<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.270> useful<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.899> which<00:00:52.320> way

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
sometimes it's useful to know which way

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.500 
sometimes it's useful to know which way
is<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.770> when<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> pass<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> camera<00:00:54.149> into<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
is up when you pass a camera into a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.720 
is up when you pass a camera into a
confined<00:00:54.930> space<00:00:55.020> quite<00:00:55.829> often<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.219> rotates

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
confined space quite often it rotates

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.689 
confined space quite often it rotates
and<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.420> don't<00:00:57.660> know<00:00:57.870> which<00:00:58.440> which<00:00:58.829> way<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.489> up

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
and you don't know which which way is up

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.459 
and you don't know which which way is up
so<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.030> speak<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.600> may<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.899> able<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.260> see

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
so to speak so you may be able to see

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.020 
so to speak so you may be able to see
dancing<00:01:02.010> around<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> screen<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
dancing around in the screen here a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.660 
dancing around in the screen here a
little<00:01:03.210> yellow<00:01:04.170> blob<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.400> actually

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
little yellow blob and that actually

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.690 
little yellow blob and that actually
tells<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.320> which<00:01:07.320> way<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> want

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
tells you which way is up so if you want

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.380 
tells you which way is up so if you want
to<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:09.780> orient<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> screen<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.610> show<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
to to then orient the screen to show the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.570 
to to then orient the screen to show the
the<00:01:13.020> picture<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.650> being<00:01:13.830> shown<00:01:14.130> then<00:01:14.490> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the picture as it's being shown then you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.640 
the picture as it's being shown then you
just<00:01:14.760> orient<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.390> product<00:01:15.810> until<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
just orient the product until the the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.800 
just orient the product until the the
little<00:01:16.860> blob<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> top<00:01:17.580> there<00:01:17.820> okay<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
little blob is on the top there okay the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.960 
little blob is on the top there okay the
brightness<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.250> light<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> end

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
brightness of the the light on the end

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.330 
brightness of the the light on the end
of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.420> camera<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.290> adjusted<00:01:23.220> by

pressing<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.820> button<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.479> you've<00:01:25.229> got

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
pressing this button here you've got

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.570 
pressing this button here you've got
twenty-five<00:01:25.770> fifty<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> hundred<00:01:26.310> percent

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
twenty-five fifty and a hundred percent

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.100 
twenty-five fifty and a hundred percent
brightness<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.330> much<00:01:27.570> brighter<00:01:27.930> than

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
brightness it's much brighter than

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.960 
brightness it's much brighter than
previous<00:01:28.619> models<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.430> really

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
previous models so you can really

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.300 
previous models so you can really
illuminate<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.110> inspection<00:01:31.680> zone<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
illuminate the the inspection zone and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.399 
illuminate the the inspection zone and
we<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> zoom<00:01:33.150> function<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.810> well<00:01:33.990> here

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
we have a zoom function as well here

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.090 
we have a zoom function as well here
which<00:01:34.860> gives<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:36.210> point<00:01:36.509> five<00:01:36.840> two<00:01:37.320> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
which gives you one point five two and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.730 
which gives you one point five two and
then<00:01:38.759> back<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.090> sort<00:01:39.270> standard<00:01:39.720> no<00:01:39.869> no<00:01:40.229> zoom<00:01:40.530> on

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
then back to sort standard no no zoom on

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.600 
then back to sort standard no no zoom on
that<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.430> zoom<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:44.340> image

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that so you can zoom in on the the image

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.370 
that so you can zoom in on the the image
that<00:01:44.790> you're<00:01:44.939> looking<00:01:45.210> at<00:01:45.329> here<00:01:45.380> another

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that you're looking at here another

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.840 
that you're looking at here another
interesting<00:01:46.920> feature<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.430> quite<00:01:47.670> unusual

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
interesting feature really quite unusual

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.510 
interesting feature really quite unusual
is<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.659> sometimes<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.560> color<00:01:49.770> picture<00:01:50.280> is

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
