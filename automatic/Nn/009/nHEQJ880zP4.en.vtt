because then as I had did miss me I'm

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.949 
because then as I had did miss me I'm
looking<00:02:45.580> at<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.760> videos<00:02:46.030> on<00:02:46.270> YouTube<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.780> saw

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
looking at the videos on YouTube I saw

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.390 
looking at the videos on YouTube I saw
that<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.290> holds<00:02:47.470> curls<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.010> stuff<00:02:48.190> better

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
that it holds curls and stuff better

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.420 
that it holds curls and stuff better
once<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:49.290> was<00:02:50.290> has<00:02:50.410> been<00:02:50.590> washed<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:51.010> few<00:02:51.190> times

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
once it was has been washed a few times

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.800 
once it was has been washed a few times
you<00:02:51.670> know<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.940> older<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.270> hair<00:02:52.420> gets<00:02:52.660> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
you know the older the hair gets the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.300 
you know the older the hair gets the
better<00:02:52.989> against<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.770> think<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.100> played

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
better against and I think you played

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.020 
better against and I think you played
this<00:02:54.430> have<00:02:54.610> like<00:02:54.850> six<00:02:55.660> months<00:02:56.760> like<00:02:57.760> long

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
this have like six months like long

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.979 
this have like six months like long
periods<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.049> time<00:02:59.260> so<00:02:59.709> this<00:03:00.549> is<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.760> one<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.540> got

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
periods of time so this is the one I got

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.530 
periods of time so this is the one I got
this<00:03:02.170> ship<00:03:02.410> like<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.860> blends<00:03:03.100> pretty<00:03:03.459> good<00:03:04.950> and

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
this ship like it blends pretty good and

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.420 
this ship like it blends pretty good and
the<00:03:07.540> leaves<00:03:07.780> out<00:03:08.019> I<00:03:08.500> don't<00:03:08.769> have<00:03:08.920> much<00:03:09.190> leaves

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
the leaves out I don't have much leaves

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.760 
the leaves out I don't have much leaves
oh<00:03:09.630> it's<00:03:10.630> just

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.720 

like<00:03:16.420> my<00:03:17.420> head<00:03:17.600> it's<00:03:17.750> okay<00:03:18.220> just<00:03:19.220> this<00:03:19.490> right

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
like my head it's okay just this right

here

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.190 

so<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.150> don't<00:03:24.300> have<00:03:24.570> much<00:03:24.840> let's<00:03:25.380> leave<00:03:25.560> out<00:03:25.830> i

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
so I don't have much let's leave out i

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.880 
so I don't have much let's leave out i
curled<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:30.170> curls<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.380> night<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.710> put

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
curled it curls it the night that I put

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.830 
curled it curls it the night that I put
it<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.280> was<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:32.730> pretty<00:03:33.270> so<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.660> only

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
it in it was so pretty so the only

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.600 
it in it was so pretty so the only
reason<00:03:34.020> why<00:03:34.290> because<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:35.130> really<00:03:35.370> don't<00:03:35.520> like

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
reason why because I really don't like

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.340 
reason why because I really don't like
it<00:03:35.790> like<00:03:36.120> blunt<00:03:36.510> straight<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:36.990> like<00:03:37.200> I

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
it like blunt straight like this like I

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.720 
it like blunt straight like this like I
probably<00:03:37.740> won't<00:03:37.920> wear<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.280> like<00:03:38.400> this

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
probably won't wear it like this

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.270 
probably won't wear it like this

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
again so I don't want to have to worry

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.450 
again so I don't want to have to worry
about<00:03:56.880> piecing<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.990> don't<00:03:58.350> know<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.890> guess

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460
