what I found in the early days is that

thing<00:03:19.689> that<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.870> like<00:03:20.109> about<00:03:20.139> this<00:03:20.530> filter<00:03:20.829> in

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
thing that I like about this filter in

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.280 
thing that I like about this filter in
particular<00:03:21.849> is<00:03:22.329> that<00:03:22.359> the<00:03:22.810> bowl<00:03:23.019> is

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
particular is that the bowl is

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.280 
particular is that the bowl is
transparent<00:03:24.189> and<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.430> are<00:03:25.329> able<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.689> see<00:03:26.019> if

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
transparent and you are able to see if

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.159 
transparent and you are able to see if
the<00:03:26.530> filter<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.280> clogged<00:03:28.030> dirty<00:03:28.569> needs

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
the filter is clogged dirty needs

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.890 
the filter is clogged dirty needs
replacing<00:03:29.620> or<00:03:30.010> cleaning<00:03:30.299> so<00:03:31.299> in<00:03:31.569> order<00:03:31.720> to

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
replacing or cleaning so in order to

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.720 
replacing or cleaning so in order to
take<00:03:32.530> care<00:03:32.799> of<00:03:32.859> that<00:03:33.129> maintenance<00:03:33.939> chore

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
take care of that maintenance chore

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.379 
take care of that maintenance chore
unscrew<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.939> bowl<00:03:40.349> and<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.590> filter<00:03:42.090> pops<00:03:43.090> off

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
unscrew the bowl and the filter pops off

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.289 
unscrew the bowl and the filter pops off
right<00:03:44.049> now<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.260> filter<00:03:44.560> is<00:03:44.739> pretty<00:03:45.400> clean<00:03:45.730> but

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
right now the filter is pretty clean but

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.909 
right now the filter is pretty clean but
because<00:03:46.659> of<00:03:46.689> the<00:03:46.870> transparency<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.650> bowl

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
because of the transparency of the bowl

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.110 
because of the transparency of the bowl
were<00:03:48.519> it<00:03:48.780> clogged<00:03:49.780> or<00:03:50.109> dirty<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.919> would<00:03:51.909> be<00:03:52.030> able

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
were it clogged or dirty I would be able

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.939 
were it clogged or dirty I would be able
to<00:03:52.239> see<00:03:52.479> that<00:03:52.659> so<00:03:53.169> in<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.409> case<00:03:53.680> I

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:53.949 
to see that so in that case I

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.909 
to see that so in that case I
disassembled<00:03:54.699> it<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.169> just<00:03:56.169> take<00:03:56.379> whatever

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
disassembled it and just take whatever

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.360 
disassembled it and just take whatever
water<00:03:57.370> remains<00:03:57.760> in<00:03:57.909> the<00:03:58.060> bowl<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:59.190> give<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.310> a

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
water remains in the bowl and give it a

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.409 
water remains in the bowl and give it a
rinse<00:04:00.549> like<00:04:01.299> so<00:04:03.569> clean<00:04:04.569> it<00:04:04.750> off<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.970> bottom<00:04:07.209> of

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
rinse like so clean it off the bottom of

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.430 
rinse like so clean it off the bottom of
the<00:04:07.540> bowl<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:08.019> have<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:09.190> small<00:04:10.060> piece<00:04:10.299> of<00:04:10.440> solid

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
the bowl I have a small piece of solid

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.949 
the bowl I have a small piece of solid
chlorine-chlorine<00:04:12.310> puck<00:04:12.819> citrus<00:04:13.269> is<00:04:13.449> used<00:04:13.690> in

chlorine-chlorine puck citrus is used in

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.250 
chlorine-chlorine puck citrus is used in
swimming<00:04:14.409> pool

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
swimming pool

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.969

and<00:04:15.349> hot<00:04:15.830> tub<00:04:16.150> purification<00:04:17.150> systems<00:04:17.600> so<00:04:18.530> in

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
and hot tub purification systems so in

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.200 
and hot tub purification systems so in
one<00:04:19.910> fell<00:04:19.940> swoop<00:04:20.269> we<00:04:21.139> have<00:04:21.729> mechanical<00:04:22.729> filter

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
one fell swoop we have mechanical filter

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.750 
one fell swoop we have mechanical filter
to<00:04:23.479> filter<00:04:23.630> out<00:04:23.930> fine<00:04:24.260> particles<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.130> we<00:04:25.610> have

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
to filter out fine particles and we have

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.240 
to filter out fine particles and we have
the<00:04:25.880> first<00:04:26.090> stage<00:04:26.419> of<00:04:26.740> purification<00:04:27.740> as<00:04:27.919> the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
the first stage of purification as the

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.900 
the first stage of purification as the
rain<00:04:28.460> water<00:04:28.760> goes<00:04:29.750> into<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:31.340> main<00:04:31.520> storage

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
rain water goes into the main storage

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.140 
rain water goes into the main storage
tank<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:34.250> now<00:04:34.400> we're<00:04:34.580> all<00:04:34.699> set<00:04:34.910> with<00:04:34.970> the

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
tank and so now we're all set with the

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.540 
tank and so now we're all set with the
clean<00:04:35.389> filter<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.199> a<00:04:36.320> chlorine<00:04:36.919> puck<00:04:37.280> in<00:04:37.460> the

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
clean filter and a chlorine puck in the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.100 
clean filter and a chlorine puck in the
bottom<00:04:37.820> of<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.000> filter<00:04:38.150> bowl<00:04:38.449> ready<00:04:38.690> to

bottom of the filter bowl ready to
collect<00:04:39.410> some<00:04:39.800> more<00:04:39.919> rain
