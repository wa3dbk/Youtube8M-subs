day from what do you normally eat maybe
2,000<00:01:08.250> 3,000<00:01:08.970> calories<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.360> day<00:01:09.420> you're

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
2,000 3,000 calories a day you're

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.660 
2,000 3,000 calories a day you're
actually<00:01:10.320> reducing<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.070> down<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.369> 500

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
actually reducing it down to 500

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.870 
actually reducing it down to 500
calories<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.750> day<00:01:12.810> okay<00:01:13.680> now<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.250> reason<00:01:14.490> for

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
calories a day okay now the reason for

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.399 
calories a day okay now the reason for
the<00:01:14.970> fat<00:01:15.180> loading<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.750> getting<00:01:16.049> all<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.320> those

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the fat loading and getting all of those

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.410 
the fat loading and getting all of those
calories<00:01:16.950> into<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> first<00:01:17.939> few<00:01:18.210> days

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
calories into you for the first few days

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.120 
calories into you for the first few days
is<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:19.909> obviously<00:01:20.909> when<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:22.130> start

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.220 
these little bottles right here they
cost<00:02:11.700> about<00:02:11.879> fifty<00:02:12.209> dollars<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:13.020> well

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
cost about fifty dollars but as well

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.080 
cost about fifty dollars but as well
worth<00:02:13.440> it

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
worth it

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.670 
worth it
so<00:02:15.090> far<00:02:15.420> I've<00:02:15.690> lost<00:02:15.990> 19<00:02:16.980> pounds<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.730> 10<00:02:18.450> days<00:02:18.720> so

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
so far I've lost 19 pounds in 10 days so

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.440 
so far I've lost 19 pounds in 10 days so
that's<00:02:20.070> really<00:02:20.220> good<00:02:20.490> it's<00:02:20.640> probably<00:02:20.880> close

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
that's really good it's probably close

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.580 
that's really good it's probably close
to<00:02:21.480> nine<00:02:21.780> kgs<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.660> basically<00:02:25.050> what<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.440> is

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
to nine kgs so basically what that is is

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.070 
to nine kgs so basically what that is is
you<00:02:25.920> just<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.340> put<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.240> little<00:02:27.450> syringe<00:02:27.810> in

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
if you get hungry during the day I

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.380 
if you get hungry during the day I
haven't<00:03:32.010> actually<00:03:32.100> used<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.520> at<00:03:32.670> all<00:03:32.790> this

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
haven't actually used this at all this

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.620 
haven't actually used this at all this
is<00:03:33.540> at<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> time<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:34.260> weight<00:03:34.709> control<00:03:35.630> so

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
is at the time and weight control so

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.190 
is at the time and weight control so
that's<00:03:36.780> part<00:03:37.080> of<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.230> HCG<00:03:38.010> reigned<00:03:38.340> as<00:03:38.520> well

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
that's part of the HCG reigned as well

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.090 
that's part of the HCG reigned as well
apparently<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.440> spray<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:40.800> under<00:03:41.070> your

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
apparently to spray this under your

apparently to spray this under your
tongue<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.030> helps<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:43.200> not<00:03:43.800> be<00:03:43.950> hungry

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
tongue and it helps you to not be hungry

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.030 
tongue and it helps you to not be hungry
if<00:03:44.520> you<00:03:44.640> do<00:03:44.820> get<00:03:44.970> hungry<00:03:45.090> as<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.930> said<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.350> haven't
