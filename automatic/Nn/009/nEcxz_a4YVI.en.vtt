potential to work condition so one of
the<00:00:24.080> things<00:00:24.140> that<00:00:24.680> was<00:00:24.920> very<00:00:25.130> feeling<00:00:25.730> about

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
the things that was very feeling about

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.300 
the things that was very feeling about
wrs<00:00:26.690> was<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.230> great<00:00:27.470> commission<00:00:27.800> structure

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
wrs was the great commission structure

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.109 
wrs was the great commission structure
it's<00:00:29.260> but<00:00:30.260> there's<00:00:30.530> a<00:00:30.620> very<00:00:30.650> good<00:00:31.220> transparent

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
it's but there's a very good transparent

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.420 
it's but there's a very good transparent
uncapped<00:00:33.080> commission<00:00:33.380> structure<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:34.370> it

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
uncapped commission structure and it

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.670 
uncapped commission structure and it
seems<00:00:34.640> a<00:00:34.730> bit<00:00:34.820> better<00:00:35.060> than<00:00:35.360> any<00:00:35.540> of<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:36.500> other

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
seems a bit better than any of the other

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.370 
seems a bit better than any of the other
companies<00:00:37.130> that<00:00:37.160> sad<00:00:37.610> interviewed<00:00:38.600> at<00:00:38.780> so<00:00:39.200> I

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
companies that sad interviewed at so I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.710 
companies that sad interviewed at so I
was<00:00:39.920> very<00:00:40.130> keen<00:00:40.400> on<00:00:40.579> that<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:41.150> once<00:00:41.540> it's

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
was very keen on that and once it's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.690 
was very keen on that and once it's
found<00:00:41.930> out<00:00:42.140> more<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:42.650> ultimately<00:00:43.220> wants<00:00:43.490> to

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
found out more and ultimately wants to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.470 
found out more and ultimately wants to
start<00:00:43.970> a<00:00:44.030> job<00:00:44.240> here<00:00:45.700> one<00:00:46.700> of<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.940> main<00:00:47.090> reasons

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
start a job here one of the main reasons

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.840 
start a job here one of the main reasons
why<00:00:47.630> i<00:00:47.660> joined<00:00:47.930> wrs<00:00:48.650> is<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.340> chance<00:00:49.579> to<00:00:49.670> travel

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
why i joined wrs is the chance to travel

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.700 
why i joined wrs is the chance to travel
internationally<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:51.140> sit<00:00:51.380> down<00:00:51.530> with<00:00:51.650> the

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
internationally and sit down with the

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.440 
internationally and sit down with the
existing<00:00:51.920> clients<00:00:52.550> I<00:00:52.700> think<00:00:53.270> it's<00:00:53.390> very

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
existing clients I think it's very

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.840 
existing clients I think it's very
important<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.230> go<00:00:54.470> and<00:00:54.620> see<00:00:54.770> clients<00:00:55.100> in<00:00:55.550> order

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
important to go and see clients in order

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.880 
important to go and see clients in order
to<00:00:56.000> sustain<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:56.870> build<00:00:56.899> upon<00:00:57.560> existing

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
to sustain and build upon existing

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.030 
to sustain and build upon existing
relationships

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.950 

I<00:01:01.070> would<00:01:01.430> have<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:01.670> say<00:01:01.700> that<00:01:01.850> my<00:01:02.120> proudest

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
I would have to say that my proudest

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.439 
I would have to say that my proudest
moment<00:01:03.380> at<00:01:03.620> WRs<00:01:04.309> was<00:01:04.520> getting<00:01:04.730> my<00:01:04.879> first<00:01:05.150> deal

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.420 
and you have to put a lot of work in by
any<00:01:08.750> means<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.260> I<00:01:09.620> was<00:01:09.830> aware<00:01:10.040> of<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.280> when<00:01:10.310> I

any means and I was aware of that when I

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.340 
any means and I was aware of that when I
started<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:11.660> never<00:01:11.840> really<00:01:11.960> sure<00:01:12.230> about

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
started but you never really sure about

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.680 
started but you never really sure about
how<00:01:12.620> much<00:01:13.010> how<00:01:13.340> hard<00:01:13.580> it's<00:01:13.730> going<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:13.970> be<00:01:14.120> so

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
how much how hard it's going to be so

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.030 
how much how hard it's going to be so
it's<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:14.870> real<00:01:15.020> achievement<00:01:15.140> getting<00:01:15.920> that
