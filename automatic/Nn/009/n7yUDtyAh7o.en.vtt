00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
build a late-game comp you'll find is

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.520

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
say passive because you do try and make

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.310 
say passive because you do try and make
place<00:01:12.240> around<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> parent<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.170> don't

have<00:01:23.580> our<00:01:23.700> wind<00:01:23.909> conditions<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> game<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
have our wind conditions in the game and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.719 
have our wind conditions in the game and
we're<00:01:25.470> always<00:01:25.619> discussing<00:01:26.189> at<00:01:26.430> all<00:01:26.520> points

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
we're always discussing at all points

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
we're always discussing at all points
what's<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.240> most<00:01:27.659> ultimately<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.259> us<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.470> win

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
what's the most ultimately for us to win

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.760 
what's the most ultimately for us to win
the<00:01:28.710> game<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.479> I'm<00:01:30.479> sure<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.320> team<00:01:31.500> had

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the game and I'm sure that the team had

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.859 
the game and I'm sure that the team had
come<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.250> an<00:01:32.430> idea<00:01:32.729> or<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> specific<00:01:33.689> line

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
come up with an idea or a specific line

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.179 
come up with an idea or a specific line
but<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.439> felt<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> most

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
but they felt was going to be the most

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.010 
but they felt was going to be the most
successful<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.240> even<00:01:36.509> though<00:01:36.630> suddenly

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
successful and so even though suddenly

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.050 
successful and so even though suddenly
may<00:01:37.200> appear<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.100> expect<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> be<00:01:38.939> more

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
may appear to expect a to be more

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.179 
may appear to expect a to be more
optimal<00:01:39.479> when<00:01:40.229> we're<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.560> game<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.860> decide<00:01:41.159> on

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
optimal when we're in game we decide on

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.370 
optimal when we're in game we decide on
the<00:01:41.340> line<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.759> take<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> line<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.509> yeah

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the line and we take the line and yeah

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.810 
the line and we take the line and yeah
and<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.040> think<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.549> talked<00:01:44.790> about

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and I think it's what we talked about

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.399 
and I think it's what we talked about
often<00:01:45.119> with<00:01:45.390> shotcalling<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.049> better<00:01:46.229> all

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
often with shotcalling it's better all

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.410 
often with shotcalling it's better all
to<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.740> same<00:01:46.920> page<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:48.180> might<00:01:48.329> not

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
to be in the same page and it might not

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.969 
to be in the same page and it might not
be<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.720> optimal<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.740> long<00:01:49.860> as

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
be the optimal one but as long as

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.980 
be the optimal one but as long as
everyone<00:01:50.250> follows<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.850> exactly<00:01:51.479> works<00:01:51.750> for

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
everyone follows that exactly works for

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
everyone follows that exactly works for
you<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.350> no<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.340> split<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.670> for

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
you and no don't just like split up for

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.670 
and yet you guys could call out what
went<00:02:12.060> wrong<00:02:12.120> we<00:02:12.510> knew<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.660> Lee<00:02:12.989> was<00:02:13.170> going

went wrong we knew that Lee was going
around<00:02:14.099> bot<00:02:14.219> site<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.670> we<00:02:15.269> just<00:02:15.510> didn't<00:02:15.780> place

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
around bot site and we just didn't place

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.839 
around bot site and we just didn't place
the<00:02:16.230> word<00:02:16.379> early<00:02:16.859> enough<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.340> we<00:02:17.549> just<00:02:17.730> got

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
the word early enough so we just got

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.119 
the word early enough so we just got
punished<00:02:18.030> by<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.299> because<00:02:18.569> we<00:02:19.170> already<00:02:19.319> ten

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
punished by it because we already ten

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.380 
punished by it because we already ten
seconds<00:02:20.430> before<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.730> happened<00:02:20.969> we<00:02:21.060> discussed

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
seconds before it happened we discussed

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.849 
seconds before it happened we discussed
that<00:02:21.480> they're<00:02:22.049> one<00:02:22.230> hundred<00:02:22.260> percent<00:02:22.500> gonna

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
that they're one hundred percent gonna

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.410 
that they're one hundred percent gonna
flash<00:02:23.129> any<00:02:23.370> Stannis<00:02:23.879> that's<00:02:24.090> what<00:02:24.329> they

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
flash any Stannis that's what they

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.880 
flash any Stannis that's what they
usually<00:02:24.569> do<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.109> recent<00:02:25.439> games<00:02:25.560> but<00:02:25.769> we

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
usually do in the recent games but we

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.490 
usually do in the recent games but we
just<00:02:26.040> was<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.879> bit<00:02:27.090> lazy<00:02:27.629> on<00:02:27.900> putting<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.349> word

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
just was a bit lazy on putting the word

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.709 
just was a bit lazy on putting the word
earlier<00:02:28.799> I<00:02:29.150> tell<00:02:30.150> me<00:02:30.269> you<00:02:30.389> guys<00:02:30.480> would<00:02:30.659> have

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
earlier I tell me you guys would have

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.660 
earlier I tell me you guys would have
won<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.959> match<00:02:31.109> up<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.349> guess<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.859> a<00:02:32.040> 50-50

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
won the match up I guess it's a 50-50

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.009 
won the match up I guess it's a 50-50
matchup<00:02:32.939> normally<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.359> can<00:02:33.510> have<00:02:33.659> tristana

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
matchup normally you can have tristana

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.379 
matchup normally you can have tristana
shoving<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.620> all<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.099> time<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.549> that's<00:02:36.030> what

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
shoving in all the time and that's what

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.449 
shoving in all the time and that's what
you<00:02:36.569> usually<00:02:36.810> want<00:02:37.139> to<00:02:37.290> do<00:02:37.379> so<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.889> shouldn't<00:02:38.370> be

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
you usually want to do so I shouldn't be

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.520 
you usually want to do so I shouldn't be
behind<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.879> 1020<00:02:39.480> CSS<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.930> was<00:02:40.079> this<00:02:40.230> game<00:02:40.349> but

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
behind the 1020 CSS I was this game but

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.530 
behind the 1020 CSS I was this game but
it's<00:02:40.709> normally<00:02:40.829> you're<00:02:41.340> even<00:02:41.700> on<00:02:41.819> csn<00:02:42.269> in<00:02:42.420> this

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
it's normally you're even on csn in this

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.119 
it's normally you're even on csn in this
matchup<00:02:42.719> and<00:02:42.989> we<00:02:43.200> had<00:02:43.290> discussed<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:43.980> pick

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
matchup and we had discussed in the pick

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.670 
matchup and we had discussed in the pick
and<00:02:44.280> ban<00:02:44.459> phase<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:45.090> we<00:02:46.049> don't<00:02:46.409> win<00:02:46.650> this

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
and ban phase that we don't win this

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.089
