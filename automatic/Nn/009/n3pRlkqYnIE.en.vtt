of music from your library play it and
amplify<00:01:04.699> will<00:01:04.940> actually<00:01:05.239> choose<00:01:05.600> a<00:01:05.630> tone<00:01:06.140> at

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
amplify will actually choose a tone at

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.400 
amplify will actually choose a tone at
specific<00:01:07.210> tone<00:01:08.210> matched<00:01:08.479> specific<00:01:09.260> to<00:01:09.380> that

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
specific tone matched specific to that

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.220 
specific tone matched specific to that
particular<00:01:09.680> song<00:01:10.720> so<00:01:11.720> it's<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.870> regular

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
particular song so it's a regular

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.320 
particular song so it's a regular
amplifier<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.160> obviously<00:01:13.640> plug<00:01:14.150> in<00:01:14.270> your

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
amplifier so you obviously plug in your

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.090 
amplifier so you obviously plug in your
guitar<00:01:14.390> in<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.140> you're<00:01:15.290> using<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.650> dials<00:01:15.980> as

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
guitar in and you're using the dials as

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.520 
guitar in and you're using the dials as
you<00:01:16.190> would<00:01:16.340> do<00:01:16.550> ordinarily<00:01:17.360> on<00:01:17.540> amplifier<00:01:18.020> but

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
you would do ordinarily on amplifier but

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.290 
you would do ordinarily on amplifier but
what<00:01:18.680> really<00:01:19.070> puts<00:01:19.460> this<00:01:19.610> into<00:01:19.910> a<00:01:19.940> different

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
what really puts this into a different

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.540 
what really puts this into a different
bracket<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.320> be<00:01:21.440> able<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.770> use<00:01:21.980> it<00:01:22.130> remotely

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
bracket is to be able to use it remotely

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.390 
bracket is to be able to use it remotely
using<00:01:23.000> an<00:01:23.750> iOS<00:01:24.050> device<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:24.980> let's<00:01:25.160> have<00:01:25.310> a

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
using an iOS device so let's have a

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.480 
using an iOS device so let's have a
quick<00:01:25.580> look<00:01:25.850> at<00:01:25.970> that<00:01:26.980> so<00:01:27.980> we're<00:01:28.130> into<00:01:28.400> the

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
quick look at that so we're into the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.240 
quick look at that so we're into the
editor<00:01:28.970> mode<00:01:29.150> on<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.690> app<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:30.650> allows<00:01:30.860> me<00:01:31.100> to

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
editor mode on the app it allows me to

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.900 
editor mode on the app it allows me to
change<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.510> type<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.410> amp<00:01:33.770> I'm<00:01:34.160> using<00:01:34.430> type<00:01:34.760> of

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
change the type of amp I'm using type of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.820 
change the type of amp I'm using type of
amp<00:01:35.120> and<00:01:35.300> cab<00:01:35.330> I<00:01:35.720> can<00:01:36.200> then<00:01:36.320> change<00:01:36.560> the

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
amp and cab I can then change the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.290 
amp and cab I can then change the
settings<00:01:37.250> that<00:01:37.310> I've<00:01:37.460> got<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.700> drive<00:01:38.000> all<00:01:38.180> the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
some fairly familiar backing tracks just

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.730 
some fairly familiar backing tracks just
a<00:02:36.580> few<00:02:36.910> seconds<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:37.930> each<00:02:38.050> one<00:02:38.290> just<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.620> give

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
a few seconds of each one just to give

a few seconds of each one just to give
you<00:02:38.830> an<00:02:38.950> idea<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.370> different<00:02:39.700> tones<00:02:39.850> so

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
you an idea of the different tones so

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:55.820 
you an idea of the different tones so
let's<00:02:40.750> jump<00:02:40.930> straight<00:02:41.050> into<00:02:41.350> that
