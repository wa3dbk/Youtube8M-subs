00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.179 
what allows you to do is to take a photo
just<00:01:39.600> by<00:01:39.720> touching<00:01:39.990> anywhere<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> screen

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
just by touching anywhere on the screen

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.830 
just by touching anywhere on the screen
not<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.850> cam<00:01:42.119> itself<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.570> i'm<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.659> gonna

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
not just cam itself so i'm just gonna

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.800 
not just cam itself so i'm just gonna
hit<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.430> there<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.490> go<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:44.939> photo<00:01:45.180> and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
hit like there you go this one photo and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.370 
hit like there you go this one photo and
you've<00:01:46.649> also<00:01:46.920> got<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.670> slow<00:01:48.509> bus<00:01:48.750> basically

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
you've also got a slow bus basically

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.289 
you've also got a slow bus basically
taking<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.829> whole<00:01:50.009> bunch<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.280> photos<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.759> long

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
taking a whole bunch of photos as long

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.350 
taking a whole bunch of photos as long
as<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.540> hold<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
as you hold the

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.250 
as you hold the
oh<00:01:54.240> those<00:01:55.240> poor<00:01:55.390> photos<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:56.560> you've<00:01:56.770> got<00:01:56.980> a

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
oh those poor photos and you've got a

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.510 
oh those poor photos and you've got a
fast<00:01:59.260> pass<00:01:59.530> as<00:01:59.740> well<00:01:59.950> it's<00:02:00.190> got<00:02:00.340> lower

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
fast pass as well it's got lower

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.400 
fast pass as well it's got lower
resolution<00:02:01.150> unfortunately<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.200> can<00:02:02.320> go

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
resolution unfortunately so you can go

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.540 
resolution unfortunately so you can go
like<00:02:03.270> yeah<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.690> was<00:02:04.810> really<00:02:05.260> nice<00:02:05.560> you've

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
like yeah that was really nice you've

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.400 
like yeah that was really nice you've
got<00:02:06.760> a<00:02:06.940> timer<00:02:07.300> mode<00:02:07.660> as<00:02:07.780> well<00:02:07.960> so<00:02:08.170> basically

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
got a timer mode as well so basically

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.680 
got a timer mode as well so basically
taking<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.920> photos<00:02:09.250> after<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.300> know<00:02:10.390> count

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
taking the photos after you know count

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.290 
taking the photos after you know count
on<00:02:10.810> timing<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.320> choose<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.860> time<00:02:12.280> itself<00:02:12.670> and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
on timing and choose the time itself and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.270 
on timing and choose the time itself and
this<00:02:13.900> one<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.170> my<00:02:14.350> free<00:02:14.620> but<00:02:14.800> my<00:02:14.920> personal

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
this one is my free but my personal

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.650 
this one is my free but my personal
favorite<00:02:15.580> that's<00:02:15.730> an<00:02:15.820> interval<00:02:16.210> mode<00:02:16.420> and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
favorite that's an interval mode and

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.540 
favorite that's an interval mode and
this<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.930> very<00:02:17.110> good<00:02:17.350> for<00:02:17.560> taking<00:02:18.370> like

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
this is very good for taking like

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.760 
this is very good for taking like
time-lapse<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.270> what<00:02:19.450> happens<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:19.959> every

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
time-lapse so what happens is that every

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.170 
time-lapse so what happens is that every
five<00:02:20.980> seconds<00:02:21.400> it's<00:02:21.580> going<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.790> take<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:21.940> photo

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
five seconds it's going to take a photo

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.880 
five seconds it's going to take a photo
so<00:02:22.420> let<00:02:22.570> me<00:02:22.660> just<00:02:22.810> show<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.050> if<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.560> set<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:23.860> to

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
so let me just show you if I set it to

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.199 
so let me just show you if I set it to
two<00:02:23.980> seconds<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:24.820> click<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.930> one<00:02:26.620> click<00:02:27.340> to

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
two seconds and click to one click to

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.199 
two seconds and click to one click to
one<00:02:28.900> click<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.830> yeah<00:02:30.070> I'm<00:02:30.310> taking<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.730> whole

very nice boat mode for time-lapse you

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.010 
very nice boat mode for time-lapse you
know<00:02:35.890> combine<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.400> with<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.820> glyph<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.900> know

very interesting photo too awesome eyes
but<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.570> kind<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:07.840> just<00:03:08.019> ultimately<00:03:08.410> try

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
but it kind of just ultimately try

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.770 
but it kind of just ultimately try
attempts<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.250> enhance<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.820> you've<00:03:10.420> got<00:03:10.630> the

attempts to enhance it you've got the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.870 
attempts to enhance it you've got the
transform<00:03:11.500> tool<00:03:11.799> basically<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.400> bit<00:03:12.610> of<00:03:12.760> a

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
transform tool basically a bit of a
