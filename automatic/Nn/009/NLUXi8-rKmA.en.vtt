00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.880
 respiratory and that's why the World Health Organization 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.530
 recommend wearing a ffp2 mask 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.230
 to avoid any contamination 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.490
 these filter masks that meets very strict standards and the best 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.220

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.279
 is essential to wash your hands thoroughly before using it why all 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.599
 simply because the flu virus is deposited on your hands 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.430
 after greeting someone touching an object and were contaminated he 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.180
 It is therefore essential to wash your hands as often as possible 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.440
 epidemic period and especially before donning the mask 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.840
 a woman at the same well disinfect you can take your mask and 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.840
 get out of the box 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.490
 and first of all you have to separate the two elastics 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.420
 insults or preformed nasal labaki 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.860
 if you pass two elastics because your head positioning a 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.080
 elastic bar because the ears is silly above the skull 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.960
 you have to readjust the nose bar correctly 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.970
 and ears made of tea bags of the mask you exhale and inspired 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.110
 several times 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.310
 and if you feel of their past it is necessary to reposition the company 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.730
 I start again 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.730
 the elastics sector 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.740
 this reform the nasal covering 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.440
 to his students southpeak games head 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.050
 I rely on the idea at the naval base 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.050
 I will check the tightness 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.300
 and now I'm ready 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.360
 but no doubt understood the perfect efficiency of this master is 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.730
 incompatible with the beard this one prevents mask from being a craft it 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.520

 set up you can keep it to the maximum for a period of eight 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.240
 hours but it is strongly recommended to change this one whenever
