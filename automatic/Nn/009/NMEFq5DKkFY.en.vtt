won't<00:01:53.280> focus<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:53.850> yeah<00:01:54.030> anyway<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.990> start

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
won't focus but yeah anyway so to start

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.120 
won't focus but yeah anyway so to start
off<00:01:55.680> you're<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> take<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:57.710> ball<00:01:58.710> of

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
off you're going to take a ball of

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.420 
off you're going to take a ball of
polymer<00:01:59.909> clay<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:04.040> you're<00:02:05.040> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.250> take

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
polymer clay and you're going to take

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.160 
polymer clay and you're going to take
your<00:02:05.460> rolling<00:02:05.759> tool

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
your rolling tool

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.080 
your rolling tool
and<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.530> always<00:02:08.830> want<00:02:09.160> more<00:02:09.489> than<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:09.849> need

and you always want more than you need

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.130 
and you always want more than you need
so<00:02:10.590> obviously<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:12.489> is<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.730> bit<00:02:13.390> too<00:02:13.599> much<00:02:13.630> but

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
so obviously this is a bit too much but

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.690 
so obviously this is a bit too much but
you're<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:14.709> going<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.950> take<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.340> decent

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
you're just going to take a decent

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.790 
you're just going to take a decent
amount<00:02:16.000> ball<00:02:16.599> and<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.989> depends<00:02:17.380> on<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.650> size

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
amount ball and it depends on the size

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.350 
amount ball and it depends on the size
of<00:02:18.010> your<00:02:18.040> cooking<00:02:18.370> cutter<00:02:18.580> if<00:02:19.090> you're<00:02:19.239> using

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
of your cooking cutter if you're using

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.000 
of your cooking cutter if you're using
like<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.690> giant<00:02:19.959> one<00:02:20.230> then<00:02:20.470> you'll<00:02:20.590> need<00:02:20.770> more

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
like a giant one then you'll need more

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.979 
like a giant one then you'll need more
but<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.580> depends<00:02:21.940> on<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.150> size<00:02:22.330> cookie<00:02:22.810> cutter

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
but it depends on the size cookie cutter

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.530 
but it depends on the size cookie cutter

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
you can just leave this or whatever you

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.620 
you can just leave this or whatever you
want<00:04:56.890> to<00:04:56.980> do<00:04:57.100> with<00:04:57.250> it<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:58.210> don't<00:04:58.360> really<00:04:58.450> need

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
want to do with it you don't really need

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.160 
want to do with it you don't really need
that<00:04:59.310> but<00:05:00.310> now<00:05:00.760> you're<00:05:00.850> just<00:05:01.000> gonna<00:05:01.270> stack

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
that but now you're just gonna stack

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.000 
that but now you're just gonna stack
them<00:05:03.570> so<00:05:04.570> try<00:05:04.900> and<00:05:05.020> line<00:05:05.140> up<00:05:05.170> like<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.770> petals

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
them so try and line up like the petals

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:16.290 
them so try and line up like the petals
together<00:05:06.430> I<00:05:07.200> guess

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.749 

make<00:05:16.900> that<00:05:17.169> make<00:05:17.650> sure<00:05:17.860> it's<00:05:18.009> not<00:05:18.129> overlapping

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
make that make sure it's not overlapping

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:31.629 
make that make sure it's not overlapping
or<00:05:19.030> anything<00:05:19.479> and<00:05:20.349> this<00:05:20.740> is<00:05:20.919> crooked

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.450

toothbrush I like using toothbrushes
better<00:06:38.960> because<00:06:39.410> I<00:06:39.650> think<00:06:40.310> it<00:06:40.400> adds<00:06:40.610> better

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
better because I think it adds better

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:51.879 
better because I think it adds better
texture<00:06:43.060> so<00:06:44.060> just<00:06:47.380> whack<00:06:48.380> it<00:06:48.410> I<00:06:48.919> guess<00:06:50.740> give<00:06:51.740> it

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 
texture so just whack it I guess give it

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:53.950 
texture so just whack it I guess give it
some<00:06:52.130> realistic<00:06:52.490> textures<00:06:53.180> it's<00:06:53.419> not<00:06:53.569> too

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
some realistic textures it's not too
