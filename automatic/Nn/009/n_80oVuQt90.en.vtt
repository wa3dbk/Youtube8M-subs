00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello teeth important part 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.450
 the human body 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.300
 thanks to them we can chew food 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.349
 and of course thanks to the teeth we have 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.349
 beautiful smile 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:20.100
 According to statistics, more than half of people 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.650
 afraid to visit the dentist including 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.170
 and york researchers conducted a survey and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.260
 found out that the most afraid of dental 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.960
 doctors of enterprise managers 67 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.750
 percent as well as housewives 72 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.870
 percent and least of all fear 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.110
 servicemen 72 percent are not afraid 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.239
 visit the dentist tooth enamel this 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.329
 the hardest substance that can 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.090
 produce our body with you first 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.460
 toothbrushes appeared about 500 years 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.430
 back and they were made of horsehair 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.250
 or pork bristle a first toothpaste 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.980
 appeared only about a hundred years ago before 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.280
 this people cleaned their teeth with chalk and ash 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.290
 probably not quite a pleasant process as 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.080
 you think dear friends what kind 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.530
 sport is considered the most dangerous to the teeth 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.080
 I think many guessed it hockey two 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.409
 thirds of all hockey players lost at least 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.390
 one tooth while playing 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.780
 Isaac Newton's tooth was sold for three 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.600
 thousand three hundred dollars in 1816 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.119
 one aristocrat decent money on 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.790
 that time after buying this richer 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.729
 put the scientist's tooth into his ring 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.040
 human saliva 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.409
 is a kind of additional 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.869
 protection for our teeth with age 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.170
 the amount of saliva decreases therefore and 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.850
 teeth problems getting bigger 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.280
 smokers as well as people who often 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.540
 I drink sweet carbonated drinks more 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.549
 are at risk of caries disease in 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.250
 many rodents for example beaver rabbits 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.220
 and rats 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.880
 teeth grow constantly so they need to 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.310
 to download 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.350
 otherwise they will grow to such a length that 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.200
 the poor animal will not be able to eat and 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.570
 many aborigines will die 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.330
 islands did not know how to work with iron and 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.340
 they did not have steel swords axes and so 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.080
 further instead they used 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.690
 sticks with impaled on them 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.970
 shark teeth such a weapon is very 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.170
 well used for melee and 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.209
 left deep and bleeding wounds 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.700
 the term baby teeth led hippocrates 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.920
 he was convinced that he was still growing 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.190
 dependent on breast milk 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.060
 there are cases when children are born already 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.550
 a pair of teeth 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.739
 they are loosely attached and as a rule 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.630
 I delete so that the child does not accidentally 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.940
 swallowed and did not hurt the chest when 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.250
 feeding an interesting fact also 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.390
 It is considered that before such a sign 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.370
 considered a manifestation of unclean forces 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.800
 dried fruit bread and other products can 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.050
 be much more harmful to the teeth than even 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.330
 chocolate like chocolate anyway 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.700
 breaks up and other products can 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.360
 get stuck between your teeth and be very 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.519
 Good breeding ground for bacteria 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.660
 the first organs for transplantation were 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.880
 just teeth 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.430
 This procedure began to be done in 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.950
 ancient egypt doctors removed their teeth from 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.340
 poor people and put them in richer 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.950
 to people 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.620
 but pharaoh such transplants are not 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.730
 specially made for them 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.370
 artificial teeth and ivory 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.680
 17th and 18th centuries, dentists also inserted 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.160
 false teeth true they were not 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.680
 altogether 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.160
 artificial these were the teeth of the dead on 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.079
 battlefield soldier sadly but tooth 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.489
 this is the only part of human 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.799
 the body is not capable of 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.200
 self-healing therefore they need 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.320
 be especially careful 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.930

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.030
