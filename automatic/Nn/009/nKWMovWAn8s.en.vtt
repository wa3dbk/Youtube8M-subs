00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.910
 I like it with people who ask that they are curious and want 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.790
 and they want to know 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.910
 and are not conformed have curiosity about nÃ© 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 change is in a moment also depends on it desai 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.980
 my new leblon 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.240
 where theater is not 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.210
 to fetch other accounts 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.140
 is also to communicate and seem to approach more people exclaimed a 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.100
 place 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.630
 for that too 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.860
 with ethics in the city 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.860
 I'm in a moment of it. 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.700
 beyond himself and is performing 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.090
 a will of him is so she cherishes from 5 years ago right now 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.350
 both the band 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.220
 accomplish 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.220
 through funai awards 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.650
 and nobody clear that in those five years 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.110
 so the vaccination was initially very motivating. 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.390
 how much is his personal matter nobody is she paulo 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.700
 the place where they live 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.700
 despite this initial motivation has been transformed 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.160
 1 as soon as I 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.680
 the imdb with a group with the people was the urge to play because in huge on cdh 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.579
 13 in the host city 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:18.310
 put the city into perspective every space that we chose it 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.580
 had a particularly memory republic process in the first space 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.089
 was a place of much innovation on your twitter 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:29.820
 was in a place that I solved in the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.629
 the challenge is to work with 28 people 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.989
 This one has to look for that place been flirted dear dilma 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.719
 who would want people to work said 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.930
 casey johnson those paid for the immensity of screens 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.320
 28 flags that he has interest abroad that he 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:54.359
 in an exclusive interview with the agency is always fatal and may also close 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.359
 said that people came more than twenty-three cents 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.679
 I thought that 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.909
 no need to work with these people are not wanting 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.140
 working with nobody goes there from the dean 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.319
 all the way to this and I think this place 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.040
 more 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.349
 more so in addition they can work thing which we propose project that 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.869
 this club idea 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:18.969
 no one in this context contests the historically and culturally 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.179
 job 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:21.129
 the post-workout 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.129
 in this place I think I got better editing 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:38.809
 4 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:47.279
 if we find saltiness was another French being much more is a way of 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:48.869
 to understand 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.870
 it was very clear the idea that one wanted to speak 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.339
 the truck for a year if I wanted to talk I want my 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:57.909
 tardelli genesi of irony 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.390
 p no choreography that people do not know right 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.469
 it will be great too see how the girls 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:09.140
 within this to the effect between them were creating other 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.510
 in other spaces that had not seen the choreography was refers to the snow that 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.139
 being repeated 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.609
 people did not go there to watch 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.100
 they were certainly sheltered at 67 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.199
 they are passing by the viaduct 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.969
 hand 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:27.960
 they are 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.960
 on this 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
 measures 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.980
 in the trade association 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.990
 there was something else also because these people were working with 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.409
 six people in the 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.699
 I think we do not get there in that relationship with history. 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.249
 as we manage to negotiate, I think that people with a study sooner will not 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:58.210
 of some capitals all the same 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.460
 sit down the tv is an issue that was 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.990
 the idea of â€‹â€‹entering that place 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.839
 how do you feel when you enter f1? 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:09.679
 What a feeling I felt in that beautiful place. 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.740
 he 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.979
 ae 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.979
 1 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.670
 nuno morna 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.610
 he is one who has a gun actually sits with the national 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.319
 we did a first animal experimentation 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.830
 hehehe and now we're going to start well 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.409
 the changes that we are going to take on the field gave him time 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.409
 to experience that space within 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.850
 this morning in understanding the project 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.850
 we made a first profession there 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.310
 76 million to encourage the fundamental piece for the paranaense I said 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:54.789
 for it that has no parameter 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.520
 I stopped 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.520
 we have an experience of each service 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.949
 this relationship the space they gave up 7 that allows people but not treated 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.749
 when I read a few things past there is an unreasonable thing about the job so much 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:37.509
 he 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:41.119
 which was when he refers to the house as a child shelter 

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:44.110
 place for if it really is 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.550
 the person who has the life has to feel relieved by it 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.550
 and I meanwhile so much so that sheltered by my city 

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:18.680
 it is over 30 days 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.680
 after passing a picture of a boy he spent hours 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.740
 tel 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:30.100
