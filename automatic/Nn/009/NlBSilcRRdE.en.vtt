00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
hidden files that were here before so it

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.270 
hidden files that were here before so it
looks<00:03:05.190> nicer<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.709> right<00:03:07.950> now<00:03:07.980> if<00:03:08.160> you're

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
looks nicer and so right now if you're

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.559 
looks nicer and so right now if you're
right-clicking<00:03:08.609> your<00:03:08.819> C<00:03:08.940> Drive<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.299> still

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
right-clicking your C Drive you still

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.750 
right-clicking your C Drive you still
see<00:03:09.780> open<00:03:10.440> an<00:03:10.560> explorer<00:03:10.920> followed<00:03:11.220> by<00:03:11.310> open

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
see open an explorer followed by open

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.300 
see open an explorer followed by open
and<00:03:11.970> explore<00:03:12.530> but<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.890> doesn't<00:03:14.160> mean<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
and explore but that doesn't mean the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.800 
and explore but that doesn't mean the
virus<00:03:14.609> is<00:03:14.790> there<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:15.180> should<00:03:15.329> do<00:03:15.510> now<00:03:15.660> is

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
virus is there we should do now is

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.690 
virus is there we should do now is
restart<00:03:16.230> your<00:03:16.290> computer<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.919> once<00:03:17.519> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
restart your computer and once the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.670 
restart your computer and once the
computer<00:03:18.060> has<00:03:18.090> restarted<00:03:18.329> it<00:03:18.930> should<00:03:19.109> only<00:03:19.319> be

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
computer has restarted it should only be

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.259 
computer has restarted it should only be
one<00:03:19.919> set<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.430> open<00:03:20.639> and<00:03:21.000> explore<00:03:21.299> options<00:03:21.840> and

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
one set of open and explore options and

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.879 
one set of open and explore options and
so<00:03:24.269> that's<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.750> guess<00:03:25.260> that's<00:03:25.620> it

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
so that's I guess that's it

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:26.930 
so that's I guess that's it
and<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.130> virus<00:03:26.340> should<00:03:26.489> be<00:03:26.579> gone<00:03:26.730> from<00:03:26.849> your

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
and the virus should be gone from your

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.849 
and the virus should be gone from your
computer<00:03:27.419> thank<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:28.290> very<00:03:28.470> much<00:03:28.680> for

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
computer thank you very much for

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.510 
computer thank you very much for
watching<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.370> have<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.150> great<00:03:30.269> day
