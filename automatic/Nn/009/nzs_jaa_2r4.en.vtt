00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
hi there today I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.519 
hi there today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:04.859> draw<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.730> grasshopper<00:00:06.330> so<00:00:07.049> let's<00:00:07.290> get

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
to draw a grasshopper so let's get

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.500 
to draw a grasshopper so let's get
started<00:00:08.069> we're<00:00:08.639> going<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.910> start<00:00:09.240> out<00:00:09.389> with

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
started we're going to start out with

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.049 
started we're going to start out with
the<00:00:09.660> shape<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.290> kind<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.219> reminds<00:00:11.700> me<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.910> a

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
the shape that kind of reminds me of a

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.369 
the shape that kind of reminds me of a
carrot<00:00:12.860> so<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.980> make<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> straight<00:00:14.610> line<00:00:14.849> down

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
carrot so you make a straight line down

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.560 
carrot so you make a straight line down
you<00:00:16.379> curve<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.220> then<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.240> close<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.779> up<00:00:20.570> so

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
you curve up and then you close it up so

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.179 
you curve up and then you close it up so
you<00:00:21.630> could<00:00:21.900> turn<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.199> either<00:00:22.320> into<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> carrot

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
you could turn it either into a carrot

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.480 
you could turn it either into a carrot
or<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> grasshopper<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:24.119> up<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:25.490> attached

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
or a grasshopper it's up to you attached

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.540 
or a grasshopper it's up to you attached
to<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> front<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.510> I'm<00:00:27.810> going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.170> make

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
to the front of this I'm going to make

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.110 
to the front of this I'm going to make
kind<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.730> boxy<00:00:30.359> shape<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.769> his<00:00:31.949> head<00:00:33.800> and

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
kind of a boxy shape for his head and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.049 
kind of a boxy shape for his head and
I'm<00:00:36.120> going<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.450> put<00:00:37.340> antennae<00:00:38.340> at<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.820> top

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
I'm going to put antennae at the top

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.479 
I'm going to put antennae at the top
straight<00:00:39.690> lines<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.680> little<00:00:41.010> dots<00:00:41.190> at<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
straight lines with little dots at the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.779 
straight lines with little dots at the
top<00:00:43.489> wide-set<00:00:44.489> dots<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.480> his<00:00:45.690> eyes<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.789> you

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
top wide-set dots for his eyes and you

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.180 
top wide-set dots for his eyes and you
can<00:00:47.969> either<00:00:48.149> make<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> smile<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> straight

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
can either make a smile or a straight

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.920 
can either make a smile or a straight
line<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.239> make<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> dot<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.719> my

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
line I like to make a dot on my

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.319 
line I like to make a dot on my
grasshoppers<00:00:52.710> kind<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.340> he's<00:00:54.000> kind<00:00:54.239> of

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
grasshoppers kind of he's kind of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.350 
grasshoppers kind of he's kind of
wondering<00:00:54.690> what's<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.940> all<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.000> back

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
wondering what's going on all right back

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360 
wondering what's going on all right back
to<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> back<00:00:57.930> I'd<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.649> put<00:00:58.920> some<00:00:58.949> wings

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
to the back I'd like to put some wings

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.209 
to the back I'd like to put some wings
on<00:00:59.640> him<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.120> probably<00:01:01.109> about<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.559> middle<00:01:01.949> of

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
on him so probably about the middle of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.600 
on him so probably about the middle of
his<00:01:02.699> body<00:01:03.000> I'm<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.899> come<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.339> come

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
his body I'm going to come up and come

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.120 
his body I'm going to come up and come
straight<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.740> then<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.040> to

straight down and then I'm going to

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.250 
straight down and then I'm going to
double<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.640> come<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.510> come<00:01:09.869> straight

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
double that come up and come straight

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.950 
double that come up and come straight
down<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:11.600> like<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.750> fill<00:01:12.990> mine<00:01:13.290> in

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.690 

and<00:01:16.050> then<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> back<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.510> do<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.840> same<00:01:19.700> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
and then for the back we do the same and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.380 
and then for the back we do the same and
let's<00:01:21.000> put<00:01:21.300> some<00:01:21.510> feet<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.940> and<00:01:23.940> double

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
let's put some feet on it and double

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.330 
let's put some feet on it and double
that<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.720> too

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.149 

now<00:01:27.939> for<00:01:28.210> his<00:01:28.360> front<00:01:28.689> legs<00:01:28.960> we<00:01:29.590> come<00:01:29.829> out<00:01:32.159> just

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
now for his front legs we come out just

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.069 
now for his front legs we come out just
like<00:01:33.340> this<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:33.909> we<00:01:33.970> double<00:01:34.329> him<00:01:34.420> up<00:01:34.540> with<00:01:34.840> some
