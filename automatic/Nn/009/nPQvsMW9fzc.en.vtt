00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.109
 hello guys how are you on this occasion 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:09.530
 I want to share with you how a 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:14.820
 same strangers for acrylics first 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:17.160
 that I have nothing here, four rectangles 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.920
 which cuts of some boxes of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.650
 cereal 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.010
 and these two for the faces the cuts 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.080
 from a box of cupcakes 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.210
 trying of course that both 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.210
 faces are white and totally clean 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.920
 very well once the 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:44.649
 rectangles let's paste them 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 trying to use a glue something 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.460
 strong to prevent it from subsequently 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.460
 detach 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.270
 and I recommend that since you hit them 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.670
 leave them a whole dry day 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.580
 so you can start placing your 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.300
 acrylics and that does not exist by the brand 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.790
 takeoff 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.920
 you can even put something on them for 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.400
 that are completely flat 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.820
 very well once it's dry you're going to 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:21.180
 start placing your acrylics 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.090
 Or even order them by colors 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.760
 how do you like to identify them by 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.140
 brillitos by collections by type of 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:34.420
 decoration by neons and so on 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.420
 I here only give you the example 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.980
 many times when we want to show you 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.980
 to our customers all acrylics 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.820
 that we have, we are taking a little boat 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:56.600
 little boat and that apart from that it is uncomfortable 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.770
 it is slow and we are very involved 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.969
 weather 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.460
 very well the idea of â€‹â€‹putting slabs and 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:07.200
 separate orderly 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.720
 it also helps us a little 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.360
 to our client appreciate better 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.810
 the final tone already with a number placed 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.190
 because one thing is what the dust looks like and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.550
 another thing is already combined 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.580
 me to give the finished more more 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.680
 approached how is a fingernail 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.200
 He also put the shine on the gel 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.700
 finish 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.489
 the dark in lamp 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.709
 and when I go adding colors all the 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.709
 colors that I added I do the same process 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.670
 so you'll have all the acrylics together 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.740
 in these tiny tablets 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.480
 which are very easy to load and 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.550
 practices 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.569
 I hope you will be very grateful for your 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.569
 attention until later
