00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
to give the instructions so it's pretty

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
to give the instructions so it's pretty
nice<00:00:40.890> I'm<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.640> read<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.059> well

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570

nice I'm just going to read that well
I'm<00:00:42.750> doing<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.140> look<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.590> yeah<00:00:44.520> I'm<00:00:44.640> just

I'm doing the look and yeah I'm just
going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.239> one<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.660> ice<00:00:45.930> first<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.890> for

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
going to do one of my ice first just for

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.440 
going to do one of my ice first just for
the<00:00:47.100> sake<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.460> video<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.030> wouldn't

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the sake of this video so it wouldn't

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.190 
the sake of this video so it wouldn't
take<00:00:48.600> too<00:00:48.629> long

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
take too long

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.270 
take too long
so<00:00:49.500> yeah<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.039> will<00:00:50.309> be<00:00:50.489> right<00:00:50.789> back<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.829> back

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
but you probably didn't see I was gone

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.670 
but you probably didn't see I was gone
but<00:00:55.829> that's<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.340> magic<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.730> editing<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> this

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
but that's the magic of editing so this

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.849 
but that's the magic of editing so this
is<00:00:58.800> how<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> look<00:00:59.309> end<00:00:59.609> up<00:00:59.850> looking<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.859> it's

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
is how to look end up looking like it's

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.850

kind<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.250> nice<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.850> think<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.680> yeah<00:01:04.680> that's

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
kind of nice I think and yeah that's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.800 
kind of nice I think and yeah that's
just<00:01:04.949> how<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.309> looks<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:05.760> now<00:01:06.390> let's<00:01:06.630> do

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
because you know that's kind of easier I

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.119 
because you know that's kind of easier I
think<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.290> I'm<00:03:05.410> just<00:03:05.650> going<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:05.950> take<00:03:06.099> a

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
think and I'm just going to take a

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.589 
think and I'm just going to take a
little<00:03:06.340> bit<00:03:06.519> more<00:03:06.879> of<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.180> dark<00:03:07.720> shade<00:03:09.599> and

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
little bit more of that dark shade and

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.400 
little bit more of that dark shade and
I'm<00:03:11.230> going<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.650> try<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.340> apply<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.599> my<00:03:13.780> upper

I'm going to try to apply it to my upper

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:23.009 
I'm going to try to apply it to my upper
lash<00:03:14.620> line<00:03:20.610> like<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.420> my<00:03:22.569> lower<00:03:22.750> lash

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019

lash line like that and to my lower lash
line<00:03:31.590> like<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:34.510> for<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.750> last<00:03:34.870> step<00:03:35.200> you

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
line like that so for the last step you

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.259 
line like that so for the last step you
have<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.680> use<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.190> lightest<00:03:36.549> shade<00:03:36.819> to

highlight brow bone and inner eye corner

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.550 
highlight brow bone and inner eye corner

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
use illuminator to add dramatic

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.680 
use illuminator to add dramatic
highlights<00:03:41.980> so<00:03:42.430> I'm<00:03:42.670> not<00:03:42.910> really<00:03:43.209> going<00:03:43.360> to

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
highlights so I'm not really going to

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.780

use<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.200> illuminator<00:03:44.650> just<00:03:45.010> because<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.489> am

look I don't really have to be dramatic
I<00:03:49.420> feel<00:03:49.569> like<00:03:49.780> so<00:03:50.620> I'm<00:03:50.769> just<00:03:50.920> going<00:03:51.099> to<00:03:51.190> take

just like that so that's basically the

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.469 
just like that so that's basically the
entire<00:04:17.680> look<00:04:18.070> you<00:04:18.250> can<00:04:18.430> create<00:04:18.700> with<00:04:19.299> this

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
entire look you can create with this

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.779 
entire look you can create with this
palette<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:20.289> you<00:04:20.950> just<00:04:21.160> have<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.400> follow<00:04:21.549> the

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
palette and you just have to follow the

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.640 
palette and you just have to follow the
instructions<00:04:22.419> on<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.810> back<00:04:22.990> of<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.260> palette

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
instructions on the back of the palette

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.650 
instructions on the back of the palette
and<00:04:23.889> then<00:04:24.430> you<00:04:24.520> will<00:04:24.669> end<00:04:24.880> up<00:04:25.030> with<00:04:25.090> something

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
and then you will end up with something

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.950 
and then you will end up with something
looking<00:04:25.810> like<00:04:26.020> this<00:04:27.090> but<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.120> feel<00:04:28.419> like<00:04:28.660> this

looking like this but I feel like this

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.420 
looking like this but I feel like this
look<00:04:29.200> wouldn't<00:04:29.530> be<00:04:29.620> complete<00:04:30.039> without<00:04:30.250> some

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
lower lashes so that's it for the

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.880 
lower lashes so that's it for the

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.110 
tutorial on this look so then again this
is<00:05:12.950> how<00:05:13.700> it<00:05:13.880> looks<00:05:14.180> like<00:05:14.680> pretty<00:05:15.680> much<00:05:15.740> I<00:05:16.700> think

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
is how it looks like pretty much I think

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.180 
is how it looks like pretty much I think
I<00:05:17.450> should<00:05:17.660> kind<00:05:18.110> of<00:05:18.200> blend<00:05:18.680> this<00:05:18.830> out<00:05:18.950> a<00:05:19.010> little

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
I should kind of blend this out a little

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.950 
I should kind of blend this out a little
bit<00:05:19.340> more<00:05:19.580> but<00:05:19.940> um<00:05:20.120> yeah<00:05:20.450> that's<00:05:20.690> pretty<00:05:20.840> much

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
bit more but um yeah that's pretty much

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.540 
bit more but um yeah that's pretty much
how<00:05:21.110> it<00:05:21.140> looks<00:05:21.380> like<00:05:22.330> yeah<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:23.630> kind<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.080> like<00:05:24.260> it

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
how it looks like yeah I kind of like it

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.670 
how it looks like yeah I kind of like it
yeah<00:05:25.550> I<00:05:25.580> kind<00:05:25.910> of<00:05:25.970> like<00:05:26.030> it<00:05:26.270> actually<00:05:26.360> um<00:05:27.320> it's

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
yeah I kind of like it actually um it's

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.170 
yeah I kind of like it actually um it's
not<00:05:27.860> really<00:05:27.920> something<00:05:28.310> I<00:05:28.490> would<00:05:28.670> wear<00:05:28.910> on<00:05:28.940> an

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
not really something I would wear on an

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.470 
not really something I would wear on an
everyday<00:05:29.240> basis<00:05:29.900> I<00:05:30.050> think<00:05:30.080> but<00:05:30.920> yeah<00:05:31.640> I<00:05:32.030> think

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
everyday basis I think but yeah I think

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.930 
everyday basis I think but yeah I think
it's<00:05:33.410> pretty<00:05:33.890> okay<00:05:35.230> so<00:05:36.230> yeah<00:05:36.830> it's<00:05:37.190> 5<00:05:37.520> euros

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
it's pretty okay so yeah it's 5 euros

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.940 
it's pretty okay so yeah it's 5 euros
