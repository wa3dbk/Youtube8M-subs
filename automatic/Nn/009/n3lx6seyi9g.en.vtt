00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
time currently it looks like this we

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.490 
time currently it looks like this we
started<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.000> create<00:02:47.240> this<00:02:47.420> engine<00:02:47.840> shortly

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
started to create this engine shortly

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.280 
started to create this engine shortly
after<00:02:48.890> we<00:02:48.980> finished<00:02:49.310> up<00:02:49.460> mgs4<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.330> continued

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
after we finished up mgs4 and continued

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.870 
after we finished up mgs4 and continued
to<00:02:51.440> develop<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.920> long<00:02:52.130> side<00:02:52.370> peace<00:02:52.610> walker

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
to develop a long side peace walker

we've<00:02:53.810> made<00:02:54.020> it<00:02:54.170> this<00:02:54.200> far<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.830> now<00:02:55.010> it's<00:02:55.190> time

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
we've made it this far and now it's time

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.550 
we've made it this far and now it's time
to<00:02:55.550> utilize<00:02:55.940> this<00:02:56.120> tool<00:02:56.390> for<00:02:57.260> my<00:02:57.380> upcoming

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
to utilize this tool for my upcoming

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.910 
to utilize this tool for my upcoming
unannounced<00:02:58.490> game<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.270> of<00:03:00.230> course<00:03:00.260> brush<00:03:00.740> it

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
unannounced game and of course brush it

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.310

up<00:03:01.040> while<00:03:01.250> we<00:03:01.370> use<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.870> future<00:03:03.290> I

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
up while we use it and in the future I

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.500 
up while we use it and in the future I
hope<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.710> make<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.160> engine<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:05.030> best<00:03:05.270> in<00:03:05.450> the
