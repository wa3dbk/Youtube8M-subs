00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
at this piece right here right here this

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.690 
at this piece right here right here this
is<00:01:51.990> where<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.290> sort<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> death<00:01:52.799> grip<00:01:53.100> area<00:01:53.490> is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
is where that sort of death grip area is

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.219 
is where that sort of death grip area is
and<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.420> phone<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.750> I'll<00:01:54.899> show<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
and we get the phone on I'll show it to

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.109 
and we get the phone on I'll show it to
you<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.560> they<00:01:55.950> came<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.399> put<00:01:56.579> some<00:01:56.729> special

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
you but they came they put some special

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.730 
you but they came they put some special
material<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:57.960> basically<00:01:58.380> they<00:01:58.469> kind<00:01:58.680> of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
material here so basically they kind of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.249 
material here so basically they kind of
notched<00:01:59.159> out<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.399> section<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.360> frame<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
notched out a section of the frame and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.300 
notched out a section of the frame and
they<00:02:01.380> put<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.829> here<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.040> sort<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
they put this in here it's sort of a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.130 
they put this in here it's sort of a
plasticky<00:02:02.939> material<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.750> don't<00:02:03.930> some

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
plasticky material I don't some

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.899 
plasticky material I don't some
proprietary<00:02:04.380> thing<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.729> supposed

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
proprietary thing and this is supposed

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.520 
proprietary thing and this is supposed
to<00:02:06.000> help<00:02:06.180> with<00:02:06.240> signal<00:02:06.689> loss<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.439> of

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
to help with signal loss that was one of

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.859 
to help with signal loss that was one of
the<00:02:07.590> issues<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.849> vapor<00:02:09.030> four<00:02:09.420> cases

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
the issues with the the vapor four cases

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.839 
the issues with the the vapor four cases
it<00:02:09.959> seemed<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> degrade<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.099> signal<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.580> little

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
it seemed to degrade the signal a little

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.130 
it seemed to degrade the signal a little
bit<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.270> had<00:02:12.390> nothing<00:02:12.660> really<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:13.050> with

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
bit you had nothing really to do with

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.910 
bit you had nothing really to do with
the<00:02:13.230> death<00:02:13.410> grip

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the death grip

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.620 
the death grip
sarily<00:02:14.310> although<00:02:14.610> sometimes<00:02:15.180> if<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.510> did

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
sarily although sometimes if you did

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.089 
sarily although sometimes if you did
make<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.959> connection<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.560> would<00:02:16.740> do<00:02:16.950> that

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
make that connection it would do that

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.010 
make that connection it would do that
it's<00:02:17.310> just<00:02:17.459> sort<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.239> know<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.480> frame

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
it's just sort of a you know the frame

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.839 
it's just sort of a you know the frame
interfered<00:02:19.709> with<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.980> iphone<00:02:20.280> 4s<00:02:20.550> antenna

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
interfered with the iphone 4s antenna

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.640 
interfered with the iphone 4s antenna
and<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.480> seems<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.750> be<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.959> main<00:02:22.170> strive

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
and that seems to be the main strive

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.710 
and that seems to be the main strive
here<00:02:22.890> not<00:02:23.099> on<00:02:23.130> fixing<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.239> one<00:02:24.690> other

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
here not on fixing that and one other

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.330 
here not on fixing that and one other
thing<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.110> want<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.349> know<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.770> right<00:02:26.069> here<00:02:26.220> are

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
thing I want to know is right here are

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.720 
thing I want to know is right here are
some<00:02:26.520> insulation<00:02:27.110> now<00:02:28.110> on<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.380> vapor<00:02:28.770> for<00:02:29.160> it

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
some insulation now on the vapor for it

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.309 
some insulation now on the vapor for it
was<00:02:29.849> sort<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.180> foam<00:02:30.510> kind<00:02:30.989> of<00:02:31.080> foam

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
was sort of this foam kind of foam

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.530 
was sort of this foam kind of foam
padding<00:02:31.800> what<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.370> found<00:02:32.520> with<00:02:32.700> that<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:33.120> when

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
padding what I found with that is when

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.330 
padding what I found with that is when
you<00:02:33.660> tighten<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.170> on<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.470> screws<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.100> kind<00:02:35.310> of

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
you tighten it on the screws it kind of

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.979 
you tighten it on the screws it kind of
compresses<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> little<00:02:36.300> bit<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:36.630> if<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.810> take

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
compresses a little bit so if you take

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.009 
compresses a little bit so if you take
it<00:02:37.170> on<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.500> off<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.920> few<00:02:38.430> times<00:02:39.019> basically

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
it on and off a few times basically

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.020 
it on and off a few times basically
you're<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> foam<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.550> know<00:02:41.610> compress

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
you're the foam is is you know compress

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.670 
you're the foam is is you know compress
down<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.569> kind<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.780> wears<00:02:42.959> out<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> little<00:02:43.440> bit

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
down and kind of wears out a little bit

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.250 
down and kind of wears out a little bit
i<00:02:43.890> think<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.489> led<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.180> some<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> signal

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
i think that led to some of the signal

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.750 
i think that led to some of the signal
loss<00:02:46.440> okay<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.400> now<00:02:47.489> they<00:02:47.580> have<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.730> new

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
loss okay so now they have a new

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.430 
loss okay so now they have a new
material<00:02:48.239> here<00:02:48.360> it's<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.540> little<00:02:49.200> bit<00:02:49.319> of<00:02:49.350> a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
material here it's a little bit of a

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.110 
material here it's a little bit of a
stiffer<00:02:49.769> foam<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.610> not<00:02:50.730> even<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.910> foam

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
stiffer foam it's not even a foam

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.490 
stiffer foam it's not even a foam
akshay's<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:51.569> kind<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.810> rubber<00:02:52.019> pattering

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
akshay's just kind of a rubber pattering

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.710 
akshay's just kind of a rubber pattering
so<00:02:52.620> it's<00:02:52.739> almost<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.100> rubber<00:02:53.340> mat<00:02:53.730> and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
so it's almost like a rubber mat and

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.150 
so it's almost like a rubber mat and
that<00:02:54.870> seems<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.140> be<00:02:55.290> working<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:55.709> quite<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> bit

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
that seems to be working on quite a bit

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.350 
that seems to be working on quite a bit

review<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.790> can<00:03:02.940> see<00:03:03.150> how<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.690> foam<00:03:04.260> kind<00:03:04.530> of

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
review you can see how the foam kind of

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.780 
review you can see how the foam kind of
did<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.100> is<00:03:05.250> really<00:03:05.400> more<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.730> a

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
did that this is really more of a

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.460 
did that this is really more of a
rubbery<00:03:06.180> kind<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.600> matt<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:07.080> probably<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
rubbery kind of matt is probably the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.080 
rubbery kind of matt is probably the
best<00:03:07.650> way<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.860> describe<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:08.640> we'll<00:03:08.760> use<00:03:08.790> our

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
best way to describe it so we'll use our

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.640 
best way to describe it so we'll use our
little<00:03:09.420> screwdriver<00:03:10.110> right<00:03:10.290> here<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.560> it's

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
little screwdriver right here and it's

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:19.490 
little screwdriver right here and it's
pretty<00:03:10.769> easy<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.160> install<00:03:18.260> alright<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:19.380> there

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
pretty easy to install alright so there

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.170 
pretty easy to install alright so there
we<00:03:19.590> go<00:03:19.709> we<00:03:19.829> got<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.130> all<00:03:20.250> installed<00:03:20.790> give<00:03:21.090> you

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
we go we got it all installed give you

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.819 
we go we got it all installed give you
an<00:03:21.239> idea<00:03:21.329> here<00:03:21.750> what<00:03:21.959> this<00:03:22.079> looks<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:22.500> after

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
an idea here what this looks like after

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.890 
an idea here what this looks like after
it's<00:03:22.980> all<00:03:23.190> set<00:03:23.579> looks<00:03:24.060> pretty<00:03:24.299> sharp<00:03:24.480> this<00:03:24.780> is

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
it's all set looks pretty sharp this is

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.020 
it's all set looks pretty sharp this is
a<00:03:24.930> pretty<00:03:25.200> nice<00:03:25.470> looking<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:26.400> know<00:03:26.459> case<00:03:26.760> here

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
a pretty nice looking you know case here

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.849 
a pretty nice looking you know case here
let's<00:03:27.480> jump<00:03:27.690> right<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.079> all<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.560> ports<00:03:28.799> of

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
let's jump right to the all the ports of

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:29.960 
let's jump right to the all the ports of
controls<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.459> will<00:03:29.549> talk<00:03:29.700> about<00:03:29.820> the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
controls and it will talk about the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.490 
controls and it will talk about the
materials<00:03:30.390> here<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.570> little<00:03:30.780> bit<00:03:30.989> slow<00:03:31.320> down

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
materials here a little bit slow down

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.599 
materials here a little bit slow down
here<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.739> bottom<00:03:31.799> we<00:03:32.040> have<00:03:32.070> one<00:03:32.400> large

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
here in the bottom we have one large

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.340 
here in the bottom we have one large
cutout<00:03:33.000> for<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.209> 30<00:03:33.480> pin<00:03:33.690> cable<00:03:33.900> connector

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
cutout for the 30 pin cable connector

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.080 
cutout for the 30 pin cable connector
also<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.799> main<00:03:34.950> microphone<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.730> speaker

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
also the main microphone and speaker

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.150 
also the main microphone and speaker
ports<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.140> one<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.620> improvements

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
ports this is one of the improvements

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.039 
ports this is one of the improvements
this<00:03:38.310> channel<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:38.880> now<00:03:39.030> wider<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.870> case<00:03:39.989> is

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
this channel is now wider so the case is

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.140 
this channel is now wider so the case is
actually<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.500> little<00:03:40.680> bit<00:03:40.920> bigger<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.790> problem

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
actually a little bit bigger the problem

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.880 
actually a little bit bigger the problem
was<00:03:42.329> some<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.870> larger<00:03:43.350> connectors<00:03:43.739> the

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
was some of the larger connectors the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.370 
was some of the larger connectors the
older<00:03:44.310> Apple<00:03:44.609> connectors<00:03:45.209> or<00:03:45.600> on<00:03:45.959> some<00:03:46.170> third

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
older Apple connectors or on some third

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.380 
older Apple connectors or on some third
party<00:03:46.410> accessories<00:03:47.130> we're<00:03:47.370> not<00:03:47.670> able<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.060> fit

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
party accessories we're not able to fit

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.930 
party accessories we're not able to fit
inside<00:03:48.570> there<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.230> was<00:03:49.320> kind<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.590> bummer

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
inside there that was kind of a bummer

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.890 
inside there that was kind of a bummer
basically<00:03:50.940> you'd<00:03:51.060> only<00:03:51.180> use<00:03:51.390> apple's<00:03:51.720> newer

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
basically you'd only use apple's newer

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.930 
basically you'd only use apple's newer
ones<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.799> is<00:03:52.890> now<00:03:52.980> improved<00:03:53.310> basically<00:03:53.820> all

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
ones this is now improved basically all

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.699 
ones this is now improved basically all
the<00:03:54.060> connectors<00:03:54.359> I<00:03:54.510> tried<00:03:54.750> work<00:03:55.049> just<00:03:55.290> fine<00:03:55.470> so

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
the connectors I tried work just fine so

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.289 
the connectors I tried work just fine so
that's<00:03:55.829> pretty<00:03:56.040> cool<00:03:56.250> over<00:03:56.670> on<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.850> side<00:03:57.000> good

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
that's pretty cool over on the side good

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.910 
that's pretty cool over on the side good
access<00:03:57.600> for<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.780> volume<00:03:58.079> up<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.440> down<00:03:58.500> and

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
access for the volume up and down and

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.130 
access for the volume up and down and
also<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.459> silent<00:03:59.880> toggle<00:04:00.180> switch<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.569> i<00:04:00.840> can<00:04:01.049> get

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
also a silent toggle switch to i can get

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.390 
also a silent toggle switch to i can get
my<00:04:01.260> finger<00:04:01.530> there<00:04:01.680> no<00:04:01.799> problem<00:04:02.069> don't<00:04:02.190> have<00:04:02.310> to

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
my finger there no problem don't have to

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.789 
my finger there no problem don't have to
dig<00:04:02.609> or<00:04:02.850> anything<00:04:03.269> up<00:04:03.810> top<00:04:04.049> here<00:04:04.079> is<00:04:04.530> the

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
dig or anything up top here is the

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.949 
dig or anything up top here is the
headset<00:04:05.220> jack<00:04:05.400> also<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:06.060> top<00:04:06.390> microphone

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
headset jack also the top microphone

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.259 
headset jack also the top microphone
this<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.650> another<00:04:07.829> improvement<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.940> headset

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
this is another improvement this headset

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.270 
this is another improvement this headset
jack<00:04:09.480> was<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.720> little<00:04:10.109> small<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.829> basically

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
jack was a little small and basically

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.740 
jack was a little small and basically
you<00:04:11.670> know<00:04:11.730> kind<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.090> same-store<00:04:12.450> if<00:04:12.660> you

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
you know kind of a same-store if you

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.150 
you know kind of a same-store if you
didn't<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.139> weren't<00:04:13.319> using<00:04:13.440> apple's<00:04:13.950> your

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
didn't you weren't using apple's your

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.379 
didn't you weren't using apple's your
buds<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.549> might<00:04:14.700> have<00:04:14.790> had<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:14.970> little<00:04:15.030> problem

buds you might have had a little problem
again<00:04:16.169> i<00:04:16.200> tried<00:04:16.560> some<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.829> larger

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
again i tried some of the larger

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.650 
again i tried some of the larger
connectors<00:04:17.489> i<00:04:17.609> have<00:04:17.760> they<00:04:17.940> all<00:04:18.030> fit<00:04:18.239> fine<00:04:18.450> so

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
connectors i have they all fit fine so

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.330 
connectors i have they all fit fine so
that's<00:04:18.780> pretty<00:04:19.019> good<00:04:19.200> here<00:04:19.500> here's<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.160> top

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
that's pretty good here here's a top

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.039 
that's pretty good here here's a top
power<00:04:20.549> button<00:04:20.669> nice<00:04:21.150> solid<00:04:21.419> click<00:04:21.600> on<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:21.870> ever

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
power button nice solid click on it ever

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.420 
power button nice solid click on it ever
since<00:04:22.109> everything<00:04:22.620> seems<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.890> go<00:04:22.979> pretty<00:04:23.340> well

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
since everything seems to go pretty well

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.480 
since everything seems to go pretty well
there<00:04:23.909> on<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.900> back<00:04:25.050> here<00:04:25.320> this<00:04:25.979> is<00:04:26.099> the<00:04:26.220> bare

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
there on the back here this is the bare

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.710 
there on the back here this is the bare
version<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.180> it<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.479> then

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
version of it and then

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.030 
version of it and then
course<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:27.990> could<00:04:28.140> put<00:04:28.320> on<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.710> back

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
course you could put on the back

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.710 
course you could put on the back
protector<00:04:29.640> if<00:04:29.790> you'd<00:04:29.940> like<00:04:30.150> so<00:04:30.480> here's<00:04:30.660> a

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
protector if you'd like so here's a

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.390 
protector if you'd like so here's a
close-up<00:04:30.930> again<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.770> notch<00:04:32.100> that's

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
close-up again of that notch that's

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.340 
close-up again of that notch that's
taken<00:04:32.760> out<00:04:32.910> again<00:04:33.570> this<00:04:33.660> is<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.870> different

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
taken out again this is a different

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.900 
taken out again this is a different
material<00:04:34.470> it's<00:04:34.920> not<00:04:35.040> made<00:04:35.310> out<00:04:35.490> of<00:04:35.550> metal

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
material it's not made out of metal

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.970 
material it's not made out of metal
seems<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.690> match<00:04:36.840> pretty<00:04:37.110> well<00:04:37.200> here<00:04:37.590> on<00:04:37.770> this

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
seems to match pretty well here on this

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.310 
seems to match pretty well here on this
version<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.180> did<00:04:39.330> some<00:04:39.360> signal<00:04:39.840> testing

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
version and I did some signal testing

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.840 
version and I did some signal testing
you<00:04:40.650> i<00:04:40.680> put<00:04:40.920> in<00:04:41.010> field<00:04:41.250> test<00:04:41.460> motor<00:04:41.700> and

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
you i put in field test motor and

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.700 
you i put in field test motor and
everything<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.450> it<00:04:42.840> seemed<00:04:43.080> to<00:04:43.170> hold<00:04:43.560> the

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
everything and it seemed to hold the

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.680 
everything and it seemed to hold the
signal<00:04:44.010> just<00:04:44.250> fine<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:45.150> know<00:04:45.210> it's<00:04:45.360> just<00:04:45.480> in

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
signal just fine you know it's just in

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.930 
signal just fine you know it's just in
the<00:04:45.840> case<00:04:46.080> in<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.380> vapor<00:04:46.530> for<00:04:47.040> you<00:04:47.670> know<00:04:47.760> drop

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
the case in the vapor for you know drop

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.370 
the case in the vapor for you know drop
little<00:04:48.240> signal<00:04:48.510> just<00:04:48.690> being<00:04:48.870> in<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.080> case

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
little signal just being in the case

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.200 
little signal just being in the case
when<00:04:49.950> i<00:04:49.980> picked<00:04:50.190> it<00:04:50.280> up<00:04:50.370> it<00:04:50.580> did<00:04:50.700> attenuate<00:04:51.180> a

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
when i picked it up it did attenuate a

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.970 
when i picked it up it did attenuate a
little<00:04:51.570> bit<00:04:51.720> but<00:04:51.930> it<00:04:52.080> was<00:04:52.170> pretty<00:04:52.320> consistent

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
little bit but it was pretty consistent

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.070 
little bit but it was pretty consistent
to<00:04:53.130> how<00:04:53.880> it<00:04:54.000> works<00:04:54.180> with<00:04:54.390> all<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.600> iphone<00:04:54.870> 4

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
to how it works with all the iphone 4

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.990 
to how it works with all the iphone 4
works<00:04:55.290> with<00:04:55.470> all<00:04:55.620> cases<00:04:55.920> so<00:04:56.220> overall<00:04:56.490> seems<00:04:56.850> to

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
works with all cases so overall seems to

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.060 
works with all cases so overall seems to
work<00:04:57.180> pretty<00:04:57.480> well<00:04:57.630> on<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.110> signal<00:04:58.470> front<00:04:58.710> so

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
work pretty well on the signal front so

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.680 
work pretty well on the signal front so
on<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.280> actual<00:04:59.550> material<00:05:00.090> here<00:05:00.270> it's<00:05:00.390> pretty

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
on the actual material here it's pretty

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.150 
on the actual material here it's pretty
interesting<00:05:01.110> you<00:05:01.350> know<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.500> almost<00:05:01.650> feels

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
interesting you know it almost feels

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.710 
interesting you know it almost feels
like<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.370> blackboard<00:05:02.880> that's<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.300> best<00:05:03.480> way<00:05:03.690> I

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
like a blackboard that's the best way I

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.180 
like a blackboard that's the best way I
could<00:05:03.840> describe<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.470> has<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.770> very<00:05:05.070> interesting

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
could describe it has a very interesting

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.550 
could describe it has a very interesting
texture<00:05:06.180> at<00:05:06.450> first<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:07.110> was<00:05:07.200> kind<00:05:07.380> of<00:05:07.410> you<00:05:07.530> know

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
texture at first I was kind of you know

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.050 
texture at first I was kind of you know
I'm<00:05:07.650> not<00:05:07.800> too<00:05:07.950> sure<00:05:08.160> if<00:05:08.190> I<00:05:08.340> like<00:05:08.580> it<00:05:08.700> or<00:05:08.760> not<00:05:08.910> and

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
I'm not too sure if I like it or not and

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
I'm not too sure if I like it or not and
it<00:05:09.180> kind<00:05:09.330> of<00:05:09.390> started<00:05:09.720> thinking<00:05:10.020> about

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
it kind of started thinking about

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.470 
it kind of started thinking about
fingernails<00:05:10.680> from<00:05:10.830> blackboard<00:05:11.400> but<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:12.360> got

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
fingernails from blackboard but you got

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.970 
fingernails from blackboard but you got
used<00:05:12.780> to<00:05:12.930> it<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:13.080> little<00:05:13.200> bit<00:05:13.470> it<00:05:13.740> definitely

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
used to it a little bit it definitely

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.470 
used to it a little bit it definitely
gives<00:05:14.160> it<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.340> great<00:05:14.580> grip<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.180> know<00:05:15.240> you<00:05:15.300> can

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
gives it a great grip you know you can

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.210 
gives it a great grip you know you can
really<00:05:15.630> grip<00:05:16.050> it<00:05:16.200> with<00:05:16.230> your<00:05:16.440> finger<00:05:16.740> pads<00:05:16.980> and

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
really grip it with your finger pads and

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.430 
really grip it with your finger pads and
again<00:05:17.850> nothing<00:05:18.210> like<00:05:18.330> I've<00:05:18.480> seen<00:05:18.720> before<00:05:19.110> in

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
again nothing like I've seen before in

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.920 
again nothing like I've seen before in
terms<00:05:19.470> of<00:05:20.010> an<00:05:20.580> iphone<00:05:20.970> case<00:05:21.360> alright<00:05:21.780> so

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
terms of an iphone case alright so

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.060 
terms of an iphone case alright so
here's<00:05:22.140> the<00:05:22.290> bank<00:05:22.500> i'll<00:05:22.650> go<00:05:22.740> ahead<00:05:22.770> put<00:05:22.980> the

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
here's the bank i'll go ahead put the

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.430 
here's the bank i'll go ahead put the
back<00:05:23.250> on<00:05:23.400> right<00:05:23.640> now<00:05:23.669> I<00:05:23.820> remove<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.600> little

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
filming I'm going to keep that because I

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.310

want to put it back on there and it's
actually<00:05:28.590> a<00:05:28.620> little<00:05:28.770> rigid<00:05:29.040> you<00:05:29.250> know<00:05:29.340> this

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
actually a little rigid you know this

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.159 
actually a little rigid you know this
isn't<00:05:29.790> just<00:05:29.970> a<00:05:30.060> just<00:05:30.360> a<00:05:30.480> sticker<00:05:30.780> you<00:05:30.990> know<00:05:31.110> it

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
isn't just a just a sticker you know it

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
should actually use the case itself to

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.540 
should actually use the case itself to
line<00:05:38.940> it<00:05:38.970> up<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.510> there<00:05:40.410> we<00:05:40.530> go<00:05:40.560> so<00:05:40.919> now<00:05:40.950> we're
