global audience I mean it just

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.080 
global audience I mean it just
extraordinary<00:01:20.259> strength<00:01:21.100> involved<00:01:21.789> in<00:01:21.909> that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
extraordinary strength involved in that

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.480 
extraordinary strength involved in that
and<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.600> say<00:01:22.869> it<00:01:23.049> comes<00:01:23.319> presumably<00:01:24.310> that

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
and you say it comes presumably that

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.429 
and you say it comes presumably that
first<00:01:24.819> one<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.179> the<00:01:25.329> strongest<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:26.020> then<00:01:26.200> the

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
first one is the strongest and then the

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.139 
first one is the strongest and then the
ones<00:01:26.649> that<00:01:26.889> follow<00:01:27.189> a<00:01:27.340> weaker<00:01:27.880> is<00:01:27.999> that

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
ones that follow a weaker is that

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.539 
ones that follow a weaker is that
correct<00:01:28.420> no<00:01:28.749> not<00:01:29.109> necessarily<00:01:29.770> if<00:01:30.399> you

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
correct no not necessarily if you

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.999 
correct no not necessarily if you
remember<00:01:30.850> in<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:30.999> abandoned<00:01:31.539> on<00:01:31.659> a<00:01:32.009> tsunami

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
remember in the abandoned on a tsunami

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.699 
remember in the abandoned on a tsunami
the<00:01:33.429> initial<00:01:34.420> one<00:01:34.600> was<00:01:34.810> bad<00:01:35.049> enough<00:01:35.380> but<00:01:35.560> then

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
the initial one was bad enough but then

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.639 
the initial one was bad enough but then
we<00:01:35.859> had<00:01:36.069> to<00:01:36.389> essentially<00:01:37.389> wave<00:01:38.049> three<00:01:38.499> and

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
we had to essentially wave three and

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.919 
we had to essentially wave three and
wave<00:01:38.829> 4<00:01:39.219> which<00:01:39.459> were<00:01:39.609> actually<00:01:39.999> higher<00:01:40.450> and

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
wave 4 which were actually higher and

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.879 
wave 4 which were actually higher and
were<00:01:41.590> so<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.939> damage<00:01:43.389> is<00:01:43.779> ongoing<00:01:44.170> right

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889 
were so the the damage is ongoing right

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.679 
were so the the damage is ongoing right
now<00:01:44.920> but<00:01:45.609> may<00:01:45.729> continue<00:01:46.270> over<00:01:46.569> the<00:01:46.600> next

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
now but may continue over the next

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.769 
now but may continue over the next
several<00:01:47.350> hours<00:01:47.619> because<00:01:48.249> we<00:01:49.179> talked<00:01:49.630> about

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:49.779 
several hours because we talked about

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:51.410 
several hours because we talked about
these<00:01:49.990> waves<00:01:50.319> that<00:01:50.590> come<00:01:50.859> in<00:01:51.069> each

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
these waves that come in each

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.510 
these waves that come in each
successively<00:01:52.420> producing<00:01:53.200> damage<00:01:53.979> here<00:01:54.310> so

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
successively producing damage here so

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.889 
successively producing damage here so
we'll<00:01:54.729> have<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.999> watch<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:55.450> closely<00:01:55.659> it

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
we'll have to watch that closely it

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.739 
we'll have to watch that closely it
again<00:01:56.079> not<00:01:56.649> just<00:01:56.859> Japan<00:01:57.069> but<00:01:57.399> we<00:01:57.520> have<00:01:57.670> a

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:57.749

regional across the Pacific now a

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.419 
regional across the Pacific now a
tsunami<00:02:00.759> watch<00:02:01.359> in<00:02:01.899> effect<00:02:02.289> and<00:02:02.889> as<00:02:03.009> you<00:02:03.159> watch

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
tsunami watch in effect and as you watch

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.760 
tsunami watch in effect and as you watch
these<00:02:03.670> dramatic<00:02:03.880> pictures<00:02:04.599> that<00:02:05.259> is<00:02:05.409> telling

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
these dramatic pictures that is telling

these dramatic pictures that is telling
me<00:02:05.920> that<00:02:06.159> since<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.700> tsunami<00:02:07.149> was<00:02:07.389> generated

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
me that since the tsunami was generated

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.620 
me that since the tsunami was generated
and<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.500> has<00:02:08.709> now<00:02:08.950> hit<00:02:09.220> Japan<00:02:09.700> we<00:02:10.180> were<00:02:10.300> talking

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
and it has now hit Japan we were talking

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.820 
and it has now hit Japan we were talking
about<00:02:10.720> other<00:02:10.930> countries<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.500> are<00:02:11.620> going<00:02:11.770> to

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
about other countries that are going to

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.870 
about other countries that are going to
be<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.220> the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
be in the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.000 
be in the
a path<00:02:13.270> of<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:13.780> of<00:02:14.140> course<00:02:14.170> Japan<00:02:14.770> didn't

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
a path of it and of course Japan didn't

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.250 
a path of it and of course Japan didn't
have<00:02:15.160> much<00:02:15.550> time<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:16.180> warn<00:02:16.420> their<00:02:16.660> folks<00:02:17.020> there

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
have much time to warn their folks there

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.100 
have much time to warn their folks there
along<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.560> seashore<00:02:17.890> because<00:02:18.610> they<00:02:19.270> are<00:02:19.450> 150

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
along the seashore because they are 150

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.410 
along the seashore because they are 150
kilometers<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.160> west<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.820> epicenter

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
kilometers to the west of the epicenter

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.720 
kilometers to the west of the epicenter
and<00:02:22.570> this<00:02:22.930> thing<00:02:23.140> is<00:02:23.290> moving<00:02:23.440> at<00:02:23.740> 800

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
and this thing is moving at 800

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.150 
and this thing is moving at 800
kilometers<00:02:25.300> per<00:02:25.330> hour<00:02:25.540> do<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.440> math<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:27.010> has

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
kilometers per hour do the math it has

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.970 
kilometers per hour do the math it has
certainly<00:02:27.490> arrived<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.480> arrived<00:02:28.780> with<00:02:29.470> quite

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
certainly arrived and arrived with quite

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.930 
certainly arrived and arrived with quite
a<00:02:30.010> fury<00:02:30.370> there<00:02:30.580> on<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.270> coast<00:02:31.480> Japan
