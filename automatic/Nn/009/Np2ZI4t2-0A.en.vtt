00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
know it's tragic sometimes when there's

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.900 
know it's tragic sometimes when there's
true<00:02:37.450> greatness<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:38.799> is<00:02:38.860> derailed<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.790> you

it<00:02:42.040> would<00:02:42.160> have<00:02:42.280> been<00:02:42.400> because<00:02:42.850> Dominick<00:02:43.510> Cruz

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
it would have been because Dominick Cruz

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.830 
it would have been because Dominick Cruz
is<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.590> elite<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.310> elite<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:46.120> he's<00:02:46.540> had

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
is the elite of the elite and he's had

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.090 
is the elite of the elite and he's had
to<00:02:47.019> deal<00:02:47.049> with<00:02:47.230> all<00:02:47.470> these<00:02:47.620> challenges

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
to deal with all these challenges

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.650 
to deal with all these challenges
imagine<00:02:48.880> what<00:02:49.030> he<00:02:49.150> would<00:02:49.299> have<00:02:49.330> been<00:02:49.480> capable

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
imagine what he would have been capable

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.140 
imagine what he would have been capable
of<00:02:50.019> maybe<00:02:50.440> he<00:02:50.830> could<00:02:51.040> be<00:02:51.160> again<00:02:51.400> maybe<00:02:51.940> he

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
of maybe he could be again maybe he

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.570 
of maybe he could be again maybe he
could<00:02:52.299> almost<00:02:52.680> fulfill<00:02:53.680> his<00:02:53.799> potential<00:02:54.220> still

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
could almost fulfill his potential still

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.640 
could almost fulfill his potential still
but<00:02:55.120> he<00:02:55.330> will<00:02:55.510> never<00:02:55.690> really<00:02:56.110> know<00:02:56.410> what<00:02:56.560> he

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
but he will never really know what he

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.870 
but he will never really know what he
could<00:02:56.799> have<00:02:56.890> been<00:02:56.980> like<00:02:57.160> without<00:02:57.340> decision

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
could have been like without decision

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.880 
could have been like without decision
now<00:02:57.940> when<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.209> look<00:02:58.510> when<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.019> assess<00:02:59.470> when

you know TJ Dillashaw is doing his thing

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.710 
you know TJ Dillashaw is doing his thing
but<00:03:14.230> it's<00:03:14.590> not<00:03:14.650> quite<00:03:15.040> what<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.730> do<00:03:15.849> I<00:03:16.330> have<00:03:16.690> a

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
but it's not quite what I do I have a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.660 
but it's not quite what I do I have a
lot<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:16.930> awkward<00:03:17.500> movements<00:03:18.069> whereas<00:03:18.340> TJ

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
lot of awkward movements whereas TJ

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.890 
lot of awkward movements whereas TJ
Dillashaw

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
Dillashaw

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.589 
Dillashaw
it's<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.830> lot<00:03:20.980> of<00:03:21.069> angles<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.700> seems<00:03:21.970> very<00:03:22.269> very

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
it's a lot of angles it seems very very

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.830 
it's a lot of angles it seems very very
intelligent<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.650> based<00:03:24.099> on<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.629> who<00:03:25.629> do<00:03:25.750> you

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
intelligent so based on that who do you

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.860 
intelligent so based on that who do you

Cruz is looking at it going yes but the

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.920 
Cruz is looking at it going yes but the
my<00:04:02.709> interpretation<00:04:03.609> of<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.819> is<00:04:04.120> better<00:04:04.690> and

my interpretation of it is better and

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.720 
my interpretation of it is better and
that<00:04:05.470> may<00:04:05.650> be<00:04:05.680> true<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:06.220> that's<00:04:06.519> why<00:04:06.670> the

that may be true and that's why the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.780 
that may be true and that's why the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
couple of years we saw that one fight

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.690 
couple of years we saw that one fight
with<00:04:43.599> MIT<00:04:43.750> segaki<00:04:44.020> but<00:04:44.770> we<00:04:44.889> haven't<00:04:45.190> actually

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
with MIT segaki but we haven't actually

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.930

you<00:04:51.940> just<00:04:52.270> need<00:04:52.449> a<00:04:52.479> really<00:04:52.660> good<00:04:52.900> dance

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
performance was how short and vital it

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.250 
performance was how short and vital it
was<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:16.210> worst<00:05:16.419> thing<00:05:16.690> about<00:05:16.810> it<00:05:16.930> was<00:05:17.139> how

pocket is the where he's found it what
he's<00:06:06.570> developed<00:06:06.990> is<00:06:07.080> it's<00:06:07.259> so<00:06:07.530> good<00:06:07.800> that<00:06:08.220> he

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
he's developed is it's so good that he

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.589 
he's developed is it's so good that he
doesn't<00:06:08.610> need<00:06:08.759> all<00:06:08.970> the<00:06:09.120> exits<00:06:09.360> well<00:06:09.479> I<00:06:09.539> think

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
doesn't need all the exits well I think

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.659 
doesn't need all the exits well I think

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
we've talked about this a couple of

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.930 
we've talked about this a couple of
times<00:06:13.289> where<00:06:13.889> he<00:06:14.009> says<00:06:14.280> we're<00:06:14.520> not<00:06:14.639> trying<00:06:14.910> to

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
times where he says we're not trying to

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.370 
times where he says we're not trying to
look<00:06:15.090> at<00:06:15.240> trends<00:06:15.599> we're<00:06:15.930> trying<00:06:16.139> to<00:06:16.199> create

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
created his own trend I started seeing

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.640 
created his own trend I started seeing
other<00:06:20.789> people<00:06:21.240> Travis<00:06:21.810> Brown<00:06:22.020> started<00:06:22.500> using

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
other people Travis Brown started using

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.710 
other people Travis Brown started using
it<00:06:22.889> at<00:06:22.979> heavyweight<00:06:23.400> TJ<00:06:23.759> Dillashaw<00:06:23.970> is<00:06:24.300> using

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
it at heavyweight TJ Dillashaw is using

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.860 
it at heavyweight TJ Dillashaw is using
it<00:06:25.370> because<00:06:26.370> he's<00:06:26.820> an<00:06:26.940> innovator<00:06:27.210> I<00:06:27.570> would

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
it because he's an innovator I would

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.360 
it because he's an innovator I would
expect<00:06:28.169> he<00:06:28.349> would<00:06:28.440> be<00:06:28.560> able<00:06:28.650> to<00:06:28.800> ns<00:06:29.070> and<00:06:29.280> it

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
expect he would be able to ns and it

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.700 
expect he would be able to ns and it
innovate<00:06:29.940> further<00:06:30.419> yeah<00:06:30.930> even<00:06:31.349> talking<00:06:31.680> about

further<00:06:36.449> I'm<00:06:36.720> an<00:06:36.960> analyst<00:06:37.349> that's<00:06:37.530> what<00:06:37.680> I<00:06:37.710> do

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
further I'm an analyst that's what I do

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.409 
further I'm an analyst that's what I do
for<00:06:37.889> a<00:06:38.039> living<00:06:38.220> I<00:06:38.340> can<00:06:38.490> tell<00:06:38.639> you<00:06:38.729> that<00:06:38.849> but

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 
for a living I can tell you that but

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.420 
for a living I can tell you that but
that's<00:06:39.599> not<00:06:39.810> necessarily<00:06:40.289> better<00:06:40.590> and<00:06:40.860> how

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
that's not necessarily better and how

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.909 
that's not necessarily better and how

it up in a way that it would work and it

those guys with wires everywhere or do
you<00:07:05.310> have<00:07:05.460> it<00:07:05.580> color<00:07:05.820> coded<00:07:06.270> because<00:07:06.479> TJ's<00:07:07.050> is

everything but it's unique to him and
that<00:07:13.800> makes<00:07:14.039> it<00:07:14.190> very<00:07:14.250> very<00:07:15.000> special<00:07:15.419> when<00:07:15.750> we

that makes it very very special when we

that makes it very very special when we
see<00:07:16.080> people<00:07:16.259> imitated<00:07:17.159> or<00:07:17.250> we<00:07:17.370> think<00:07:17.580> they<00:07:17.699> do

very exciting to think about the
