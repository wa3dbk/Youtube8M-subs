me do some with my bow so you can start

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.250 
me do some with my bow so you can start
to<00:00:20.580> conceptualize<00:00:21.420> how<00:00:21.449> these<00:00:21.869> are<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.140> to

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
to conceptualize how these are going to

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.439 
to conceptualize how these are going to
tie<00:00:22.470> into<00:00:22.800> your<00:00:23.250> progress<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.330> your

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
tie into your progress and your

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.359 
tie into your progress and your
development<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.830> easily<00:00:26.070> use<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
development but you can easily use a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.939 
development but you can easily use a
pencil<00:00:26.699> or<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.660> pen<00:00:28.439> or<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:30.150> marker<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
pencil or a pen or a marker you get the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.389 
pencil or a pen or a marker you get the
drift<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> number<00:00:33.329> one<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:34.530> your<00:00:34.980> best

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399

to<00:00:58.649> work<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.010> some<00:00:59.449> flexibility<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> rest

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
to work on some flexibility in the rest

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.960 
to work on some flexibility in the rest
so<00:01:01.050> number<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:01.590> pull<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> rest<00:01:02.719> going<00:01:03.719> up

we<00:01:17.640> want<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> start<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.180> make<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> circular

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
we want to start to make a circular

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.429 
we want to start to make a circular
shape<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.130> will<00:01:20.250> take<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.700> go<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
shape so we will take and go up to the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.700 
shape so we will take and go up to the
side<00:01:22.939> dumb<00:01:23.939> back<00:01:24.930> around<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> side

side dumb back around up to the side
down<00:01:28.710> back<00:01:29.640> around<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.930> smooth

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
down back around and then you can smooth

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.420 
down back around and then you can smooth
that<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.280> make<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.670> circle<00:01:34.130> now<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> next

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
that out to make a circle now the next

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.340 
that out to make a circle now the next
thing<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.790> can't<00:01:36.150> do<00:01:36.360> with<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> bow<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.110> will

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
wig and to get some flexibility so those

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.170 
wig and to get some flexibility so those
three<00:02:01.259> first<00:02:01.950> three<00:02:02.189> exercises<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:02.969> very

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
three first three exercises are very

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.999 
three first three exercises are very
tight<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.719> was<00:02:04.290> starting<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.680> get<00:02:04.799> more

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
tight in was starting to get more

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.809 
tight in was starting to get more
advanced<00:02:05.460> flexibility<00:02:06.740> next<00:02:07.740> let's<00:02:08.129> go<00:02:08.369> into

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
advanced flexibility next let's go into

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.140 
advanced flexibility next let's go into
some<00:02:09.599> fine<00:02:10.080> motor<00:02:10.470> skills<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:11.400> wiring<00:02:11.790> the
