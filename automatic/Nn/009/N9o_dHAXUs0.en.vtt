that<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.850> might<00:00:21.060> need<00:00:21.300> actually<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> really

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
that you might need actually a really

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.980 
that you might need actually a really
nice<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.340> because<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.779> butter

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
nice one because you have the butter

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.200 
nice one because you have the butter
already<00:00:25.230> you're<00:00:25.949> adding<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> masa<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.910> create

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
already you're adding the masa to create
