00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.410
 [Music] 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.230
 in the car segment 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.630
 premium or luxury within them 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.520
 some very attractive and very special 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.750
 and we speak of course of the 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:22.520
 sports in this case the coupe bmw w s 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:26.300
 16 640 a vehicle that is characterized 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.890
 basically because of its lines and its 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.660
 benefits 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.360
 the first thing that impacts of course is 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.850
 the design of the car is a coupe 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.730
 great tourism and if one sees the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.520
 proportions has a very long field 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.440
 very released and when one is sitting 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.989
 is much closer to the rear axle than 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.750
 the front is a vehicle that is more 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.210
 two plus two because two seats forward 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.550
 and two very small spaces behind that 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.930
 they are very tight is going to travel to 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.510
 someone are rather to put some 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.149
 bags but design is the first thing that 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.090
 amazes this vehicle for a proportion 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.549
 very fluid and with very dynamic lines 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.440
 which of course are not only attractive 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.540
 they also have to do with the 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.930
 of the car some features 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.860
 technical six-cylinder engine 3 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.280
 liters 320 horsepower 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.070
 a torque of 45 kilometers that is very 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.840
 elastic between one thousand 305 4 thousand 800 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.210
 revolutions this means that the 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.760
 engine delivery power a very very way 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.970
 very couple automatic box of 8 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.890
 speeds and rear wheel drive 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.290
 obviously a lot of power a lot 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.270
 speed that's why at the completion of 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.850
 the lid of the trunk is what is called the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.010
 duck tap tail this doing the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.220
 common deflector that when the car goes 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.380
 fast generates more downforce more 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.920
 pressure the trans my rear train to 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.720
 that the car is well supported this guy 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.240
 of vehicles has to gather two 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.340
 essential conditions populated the design 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.550
 that has to be attractive and functional 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.140
 what the car will show in the 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.630
 most important role that is in the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.119
 driving in this case everything has to 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.770
 see with the provision of the car in 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.239
 management terms has all the 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.280
 driving assistance systems 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.990
 who waited in car 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.380
 today one of the best cars in the world 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.720
 abs electronic stability control and 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.590
 Traction control braking in 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.030
 control descent descent curves 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.890
 start and stop system means that 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.350
 when we stop at the traffic light the engine 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.569
 it goes off which with the box of 8 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.270
 marches contributes to spend less 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.780
 fuel and make less polluting 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.300
 is a car that combines the art of 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.400
 design putting the technology on 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.000
 service of the pleasure of driving and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.000
 safety 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.239
 Many times they ask me why a car 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.010
 of very high range costs what it costs and 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.750
 in reality education must be given 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.610
 because there is a lot of money put in 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.550
 research and development and in 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.190
 technology each of the elements of 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.630
 this type of cars in this case of this 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.239
 coupe bmw 640 each is the last thing 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.180
 the industry has developed and the 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.370
 best materials in the world then not 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.590
 only in security interns also in 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.799
 aesthetic terms of materials 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.810
 comfort these cars have the best of 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.330
 the best at the time of good comfort 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.610
 has many elements for example the 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.220
 adaptation system height 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.360
 of the steering wheel and the steering column the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.480
 driver can regulate at ease as is 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.190
 the best position for him to drive in 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.620
 this case is a car with a box 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.769
 eight-speed automatic with options 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.299
 fully automatic or sequential 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.459
 changes we can pass from the 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.220
 lever or also from the cam that 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.930
 they are located in the steering wheel a luxury 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.210
 where you look 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.210
