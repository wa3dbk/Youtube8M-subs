 touches the goal to the fifty-third 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.760
 when bricks used instead of

 white touches for rocket tiles by 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.049
 first the crossbar shakes and the ball 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.969
 bounces on the bitter line in the mouth and 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.189
 eye to comini on the other side that 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:12.930
 he concludes weakly 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.260
 the dangerous however every time 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.120
 that starts again and woe to avail 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.579
 as at the fifty-seventh when 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.620

 ball on a French side 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.260
 on the other hand and the Norman emergence into 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.079
 advantage of costanzo passes immediately to 4 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.510
 4 2 starting at 5 3 2 with the entry of 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.250
 Nocerino for his excellent comini rino 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.890
 puts the chills with this punishment at 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.720

 with the rigor failed by escaping everything 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.409
 to be redone but time passes with a man 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.840
 in less and the other part in 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.579
 counterattack with moracci that saves so 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.340
 at the seventy-seventh on the restart 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.139
 however, there is no sign of Galicia Scappini 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.299
 and deserves the goal two minutes from 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.639
 ninetieth on this endorsement by applause 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.709

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.870
 to do as well as nothing to do for 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.120
 vicedomini that concludes weak one minute 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.730
 another three minutes later and the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.230
 triple whistle of semprini 11 meters e 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.269
 the houses ruled and lost again 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.569
 coincidence for the five o'clock train 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.569
 victories
