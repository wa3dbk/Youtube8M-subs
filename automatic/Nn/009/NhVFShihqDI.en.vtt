hated it apparently so this was brought
out<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.219> those<00:00:44.309> people<00:00:45.110> now<00:00:46.110> when<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.379> comes

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
out for those people now when it comes

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.740 
out for those people now when it comes
to<00:00:46.620> my<00:00:46.649> lashes<00:00:46.920> they<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.430> long<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.570> they

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
to my lashes they are long but they

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.479 
to my lashes they are long but they
point<00:00:49.079> straight<00:00:49.320> even<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:50.370> bit

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
point straight even a little bit

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.000 
point straight even a little bit
downwards<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.539> are<00:00:51.660> not<00:00:51.809> curly<00:00:52.260> at<00:00:52.440> all<00:00:52.680> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
downwards they are not curly at all and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
downwards they are not curly at all and
they<00:00:53.100> cannot<00:00:53.370> hold<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.850> curl<00:00:54.030> by<00:00:54.239> themselves<00:00:54.629> so

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
they cannot hold a curl by themselves so

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.930 
they cannot hold a curl by themselves so
usually<00:00:55.260> when<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.440> apply<00:00:55.710> my<00:00:55.739> mascara<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.460> have

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
usually when I apply my mascara I have

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.430 
usually when I apply my mascara I have
to<00:00:57.090> curl<00:00:57.300> them<00:00:57.510> using<00:00:57.809> eyelash<00:00:58.050> curlers

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
to curl them using eyelash curlers

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.959 
to curl them using eyelash curlers
currently<00:00:58.890> I'm<00:00:59.010> using<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.430> tweezer<00:00:59.789> man's

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.810 
currently I'm using the tweezer man's
and<00:01:00.890> then<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.980> apply<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:02.219> mascara<00:01:02.399> and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and then I apply my mascara and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.130 
and then I apply my mascara and
sometimes<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.600> back<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.960> read

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
sometimes I have to go back and read

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.590 
sometimes I have to go back and read
curl<00:01:04.320> again<00:01:04.619> afterwards<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.299> lot<00:01:06.570> of

people<00:01:06.659> think<00:01:06.900> that's<00:01:06.990> bad<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.590> works<00:01:07.770> for

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
people think that's bad but it works for

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.100 
people think that's bad but it works for
me<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.490> helps<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.820> hold<00:01:08.909> my<00:01:09.119> curl<00:01:09.330> for<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110
