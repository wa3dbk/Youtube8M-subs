running down the center of the glove so

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.680 
running down the center of the glove so
there's<00:00:37.370> gonna<00:00:37.460> be<00:00:37.520> a<00:00:37.610> great<00:00:37.880> combination<00:00:38.210> for

there's gonna be a great combination for
durability<00:00:39.110> breathability<00:00:39.890> as<00:00:40.250> well<00:00:40.820> as<00:00:40.910> a

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
really lightweight fuel to the glove I'm

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.200 
really lightweight fuel to the glove I'm
going<00:00:43.310> on<00:00:43.520> to<00:00:43.730> take<00:00:43.820> a<00:00:43.880> look<00:00:43.970> at<00:00:44.150> the

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
going on to take a look at the

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.000 
going on to take a look at the
protection<00:00:44.540> on<00:00:44.840> this<00:00:45.020> they've<00:00:45.710> really<00:00:45.920> done

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
protection on this they've really done

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.190 
protection on this they've really done
an<00:00:46.160> excellent<00:00:46.460> job<00:00:46.670> ensuring<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.480> pro<00:00:47.720> level<00:00:48.080> or

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
an excellent job ensuring a pro level or

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.170 
an excellent job ensuring a pro level or
advanced<00:00:48.590> level<00:00:48.740> protection<00:00:49.100> they're<00:00:49.880> using

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
advanced level protection they're using

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.910 
advanced level protection they're using
what<00:00:50.300> they<00:00:50.420> call<00:00:50.450> a<00:00:50.690> triple-decker<00:00:51.440> foam

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
what they call a triple-decker foam

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.410 
what they call a triple-decker foam
construction<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:52.760> uses<00:00:53.150> three<00:00:53.390> different

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
construction so uses three different

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.510 
construction so uses three different
densities<00:00:54.080> of<00:00:54.290> foam<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:54.740> then<00:00:55.100> they<00:00:55.190> actually

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
densities of foam and then they actually

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.310 
densities of foam and then they actually
through<00:00:55.820> plastic<00:00:56.300> inserts<00:00:56.630> on<00:00:56.780> top<00:00:57.020> of<00:00:57.230> that

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
through plastic inserts on top of that

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.650 
through plastic inserts on top of that
so<00:00:58.070> that's<00:00:58.160> absolutely<00:00:58.520> definitely<00:00:59.480> going<00:00:59.630> to

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
so that's absolutely definitely going to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.080 
so that's absolutely definitely going to
take<00:00:59.990> away<00:01:00.260> any<00:01:00.530> of<00:01:00.590> that<00:01:00.710> sting<00:01:01.280> from<00:01:01.460> slashes

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
take away any of that sting from slashes

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.179 
take away any of that sting from slashes
so<00:01:02.239> great<00:01:02.570> protection<00:01:03.020> on<00:01:03.290> that<00:01:03.380> so<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.040> thumb

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
so great protection on that so the thumb

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.350 
so great protection on that so the thumb
has<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.339> little<00:01:04.610> bit<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.759> giving<00:01:05.030> it<00:01:05.119> a<00:01:05.180> little

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
has a little bit of giving it a little

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.060 
has a little bit of giving it a little
bit<00:01:05.449> of<00:01:05.540> flex<00:01:05.780> there<00:01:06.079> it's<00:01:06.650> not<00:01:06.740> gonna<00:01:06.890> be<00:01:06.979> the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
bit of flex there it's not gonna be the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.709 
bit of flex there it's not gonna be the
most<00:01:07.100> flexible<00:01:07.880> foam<00:01:08.090> on<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.299> market<00:01:08.569> but<00:01:08.659> I

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719 
most flexible foam on the market but I

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.630 
most flexible foam on the market but I
think<00:01:08.749> it<00:01:08.990> has<00:01:09.079> plenty<00:01:09.319> of<00:01:09.469> fact<00:01:09.799> flex<00:01:10.219> as<00:01:10.399> much

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
think it has plenty of fact flex as much

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.489 
think it has plenty of fact flex as much
as<00:01:10.789> you<00:01:10.909> need<00:01:11.149> out<00:01:11.479> of<00:01:11.509> a<00:01:11.689> thumb<00:01:12.140> when<00:01:12.469> you're

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:12.499 
as you need out of a thumb when you're

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:14.649 
as you need out of a thumb when you're
playing<00:01:12.799> hockey<00:01:13.009> I'm<00:01:13.670> going<00:01:14.149> on<00:01:14.240> from<00:01:14.479> there

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
playing hockey I'm going on from there

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.359 
playing hockey I'm going on from there
take<00:01:15.170> a<00:01:15.200> look<00:01:15.469> at<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.619> palm<00:01:15.859> they're<00:01:16.069> using

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
take a look at the palm they're using

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:17.830 
take a look at the palm they're using
they're<00:01:16.490> using<00:01:16.729> some<00:01:16.969> nice<00:01:17.149> high-grade

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
they're using some nice high-grade

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.660 
they're using some nice high-grade
leathers<00:01:18.229> on<00:01:18.439> here<00:01:18.859> and<00:01:18.950> they're<00:01:19.369> actually

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
leathers on here and they're actually

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.719 
leathers on here and they're actually
calling<00:01:19.909> it<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.240> Remo<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.960> stretch<00:01:21.560> dimple<00:01:22.189> mesh

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
calling it a Remo to stretch dimple mesh

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.149 
calling it a Remo to stretch dimple mesh
gussets<00:01:23.090> on<00:01:23.509> it<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.469> basically<00:01:24.799> what<00:01:25.009> you<00:01:25.130> see

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
gussets on it so basically what you see

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.760 
gussets on it so basically what you see
there<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.639> you<00:01:25.789> have<00:01:25.819> the<00:01:26.210> little<00:01:26.499> dimples<00:01:27.499> or

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
there is you have the little dimples or

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.800 
there is you have the little dimples or
little<00:01:28.100> holds<00:01:28.729> in<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.030> gussets<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.659> allow<00:01:29.780> a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
little holds in the gussets to allow a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.649 
little holds in the gussets to allow a
little<00:01:30.020> bit<00:01:30.139> of<00:01:30.229> airflow<00:01:30.710> as<00:01:31.039> well<00:01:31.639> as<00:01:31.880> they

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
little bit of airflow as well as they

durability to it especially in that high

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.370 
durability to it especially in that high
wear<00:01:49.249> area<00:01:49.639> at<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.819> bottom<00:01:49.969> of<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:50.240> palm<00:01:50.450> and

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
wear area at the bottom of the palm and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.480 
wear area at the bottom of the palm and
then<00:01:51.499> the<00:01:51.619> leather<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.069> up<00:01:52.189> here<00:01:52.369> at<00:01:52.429> about

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
then the leather is up here at about

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.160 
then the leather is up here at about
softer<00:01:53.090> feel<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:53.509> is<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.689> little<00:01:53.840> more<00:01:54.020> of

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
softer feel and this is a little more of

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.760 
softer feel and this is a little more of
a<00:01:54.319> stiffer<00:01:54.889> feel<00:01:55.189> I<00:01:55.939> would<00:01:56.240> say<00:01:56.509> it's<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.929> overly

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
a stiffer feel I would say it's a overly

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.739 
a stiffer feel I would say it's a overly
stiff<00:01:58.039> palm<00:01:58.279> but<00:01:58.909> it's<00:01:59.060> basically<00:01:59.420> just<00:01:59.539> a

00:01:59.739 --> 00:01:59.749 
stiff palm but it's basically just a

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:01.059 
stiff palm but it's basically just a
denser<00:02:00.170> material<00:02:00.319> that<00:02:00.679> you<00:02:00.770> know<00:02:00.859> it's<00:02:00.979> gonna

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
denser material that you know it's gonna

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.589 
denser material that you know it's gonna
offer<00:02:01.310> some<00:02:01.490> great<00:02:01.759> durability

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
offer some great durability

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.599 
offer some great durability
going<00:02:03.560> on<00:02:03.649> from<00:02:03.799> there<00:02:03.979> take<00:02:04.189> a<00:02:04.219> look<00:02:04.310> at<00:02:04.520> the

going on from there take a look at the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.879 
going on from there take a look at the

overall fit of this glove now this club

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:08.949 
overall fit of this glove now this club
is<00:02:07.009> going<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.219> be<00:02:07.490> more<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.209> tapered<00:02:08.450> fitting

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
is going to be more of a tapered fitting

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.140 
is going to be more of a tapered fitting
glove<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:09.950> can<00:02:10.009> see<00:02:10.340> here<00:02:10.610> in<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.759> back<00:02:10.940> roll

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
glove you can see here in the back roll

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.970 
glove you can see here in the back roll
does<00:02:11.330> not<00:02:11.480> use<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.720> four<00:02:12.170> roll<00:02:12.380> design<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:12.860> it's

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
does not use a four roll design so it's

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.559 
does not use a four roll design so it's
going<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.160> oo<00:02:13.190> K<00:02:14.180> term<00:02:14.330> or<00:02:14.540> two<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.930> con

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
going to oo K term or two the con

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.360 
going to oo K term or two the con
tours<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.989> hand<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.950> gonna<00:02:17.069> be<00:02:17.189> a<00:02:17.219> little

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
tours of the hand it's gonna be a little

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.130 
tours of the hand it's gonna be a little
bit<00:02:17.579> tighter<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:17.969> in<00:02:18.239> particular<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.959> think

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
bit tighter and in particular I think

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.110 
bit tighter and in particular I think
these<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:20.099> year's<00:02:20.280> sous-chef<00:02:20.700> gloves<00:02:20.969> are

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
these this year's sous-chef gloves are

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.119 
these this year's sous-chef gloves are
fitting<00:02:21.480> tighter<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:22.200> thumb<00:02:22.499> and<00:02:22.709> index

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
fitting tighter and the thumb and index

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.099 
fitting tighter and the thumb and index
finger<00:02:23.249> so<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.120> makes<00:02:24.329> a<00:02:24.389> lot<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.599> sense<00:02:24.900> when

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
finger so that makes a lot of sense when

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.809 
finger so that makes a lot of sense when
you<00:02:25.200> go<00:02:25.290> ahead<00:02:25.409> and<00:02:25.650> pick<00:02:25.769> up<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.099> stick<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
you go ahead and pick up a stick the

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.640 
you go ahead and pick up a stick the
main<00:02:27.090> points<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:27.900> you're<00:02:28.079> really<00:02:28.409> getting

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
main points that you're really getting

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.050 
main points that you're really getting
the<00:02:28.680> grip<00:02:29.040> on<00:02:29.189> the<00:02:29.280> stick<00:02:29.489> is<00:02:29.639> right<00:02:29.909> in

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
the grip on the stick is right in

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.149 
the grip on the stick is right in
between<00:02:30.090> those<00:02:30.480> areas<00:02:31.409> so<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.680> makes<00:02:31.889> sense

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
between those areas so it makes sense

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.619 
between those areas so it makes sense
that<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.430> don't<00:02:32.639> want<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.879> ton<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.120> negative

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
that you don't want a ton of negative

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.899 
that you don't want a ton of negative
space<00:02:34.109> in<00:02:34.379> there<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:35.129> make<00:02:35.250> sure<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.700> it's

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
space in there to make sure that it's

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.399 
space in there to make sure that it's
really<00:02:36.269> going<00:02:36.389> to<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.569> secure<00:02:37.019> grip<00:02:37.260> on

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
really going to have a secure grip on

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.569 
really going to have a secure grip on
the<00:02:37.530> stick<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.189> what<00:02:38.340> they've<00:02:38.459> done

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
the stick so I like what they've done

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.420 
the stick so I like what they've done
there<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.599> does<00:02:39.810> open<00:02:40.079> up<00:02:40.469> a<00:02:40.620> lot<00:02:41.010> in<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
there but it does open up a lot in the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.190 
there but it does open up a lot in the
wrist<00:02:41.700> area<00:02:41.909> so<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.299> offers<00:02:42.419> some<00:02:42.750> great<00:02:42.900> risk

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
wrist area so it offers some great risk

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.899 
wrist area so it offers some great risk
some<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.409> this<00:02:43.590> has<00:02:43.799> a<00:02:43.829> lower<00:02:44.129> cuff<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.790> as

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
some of this has a lower cuff to it as

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.149 
some of this has a lower cuff to it as
you<00:02:44.939> can<00:02:45.060> see<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.450> doesn't<00:02:45.749> come<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.499> the

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
you can see it doesn't come that the

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.890 
you can see it doesn't come that the
inner<00:02:47.370> cuff<00:02:47.669> doesn't<00:02:48.030> come<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.329> much<00:02:48.540> above

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
inner cuff doesn't come that much above

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.959 
inner cuff doesn't come that much above
the<00:02:48.930> cuff<00:02:49.290> role<00:02:49.560> it's<00:02:50.189> really<00:02:50.400> offers<00:02:50.790> some

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:50.969 
the cuff role it's really offers some

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.479 
the cuff role it's really offers some
great<00:02:51.200> mobility<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.620> also<00:02:52.950> has<00:02:53.129> a<00:02:53.159> little<00:02:53.370> bit

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
great mobility and also has a little bit

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.520 
great mobility and also has a little bit
more<00:02:53.549> excess<00:02:54.269> volume<00:02:54.689> on<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.930> outer<00:02:55.109> side<00:02:55.469> of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
more excess volume on the outer side of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.679 
more excess volume on the outer side of
it<00:02:55.769> so<00:02:56.430> really<00:02:56.549> like<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.790> said<00:02:56.879> great<00:02:57.389> wrist

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
it so really like I said great wrist

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.809

liner<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.840> can<00:03:12.870> obviously<00:03:13.590> see<00:03:13.949> why<00:03:14.129> they<00:03:14.310> got

nice comfortable feel once again in the
fingers<00:03:26.159> area<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.519> not<00:03:26.639> super<00:03:27.449> thick<00:03:27.479> soft

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:28.259

fingers area it's not super thick soft
foams<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:28.799> there<00:03:28.949> it's<00:03:29.639> a<00:03:29.729> very<00:03:29.879> soft

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150

foams in there it's a very soft
comfortable<00:03:30.449> but<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:30.989> not<00:03:31.109> overly<00:03:31.500> thick<00:03:31.769> so

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
it feels like it's a little more

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.059 
it feels like it's a little more
responsive<00:03:33.629> than<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:34.109> glove<00:03:34.379> with<00:03:34.560> some<00:03:34.739> thick

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
responsive than a glove with some thick

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.129 
responsive than a glove with some thick
comfort<00:03:36.060> foams<00:03:36.269> back<00:03:36.509> there<00:03:36.689> so<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.840> really

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
comfort foams back there so I really
