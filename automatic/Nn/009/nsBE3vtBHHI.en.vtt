 What's up YouTube! * The second episode had a problem with the introduction and replaced the other images. 

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.000
 Welcome to KP, the Korea Project! * I do not agree with the sound. 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.000
 We are working with producer Andrew HJ Yoon. 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.000
 I'm Scott. 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.700
 And I am Charles. 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.000
 This is the second episode of Taste of Korea. 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.600

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.200
 Korea Project Official Facebook https://www.facebook.com/ProjectKorea 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.900
 Today we challenge Spicy Squid 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.400
 I can tell you why 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600
 Because there's chili and squid on the wrapping paper. 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.800
 In addition, it is kindly written in English as Hot. 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.500
 If you see that it's a map of Korean food 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.000
 I think it's gonna burn. 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.700
 (Show) 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.100

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.800
 Swag 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.500
 Now, 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.420
 I will untie it here as instructed. 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.260
 (Taken) 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.200
 I really do not want to eat it. 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.480
 However, 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.200
 I'm really excited 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.940
 (Facial expression) 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.440
 Oh My GOD 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.400
 Do you smell it? 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.500
 I smell like ass. 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.640
 It smells of aquatic products. 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.020
 It's aquatic products. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.480
 No fish .. aquatic products .. 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.020
 What is right? Do you know anyone? 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.160
 I do not know, 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.900
 I do not really want to eat this. 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.120
 It's sticky. 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.760
 Oh My GOD (x2) 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.700
 Are you ready? 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.820
 Ah 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.320
 Damn it 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.820
 Unbelievable 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.100
 Cheers 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.600
 Oh My GOD (x3) 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.640
 I hate eating. Scott 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.820
 (촵) 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.600
 It smells so bad. 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.140
 (Hand debt) 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.640
 Uhmufu Juhu 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.280
 delicious? 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.780
 delicious? (x2) 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.480
 Is it spicy? 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.180
 Oh My GOD (x4) 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.780
 Well, 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.820
 (촵) 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.480
 (Both chewing hard) 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.200
 (Bottoming) 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.720
 (Bleeding) x2 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.220
 (Bleeding) x3 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.720
 (Bleeding) x4 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.380
 (켘) 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.400
 (expression) 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.580
 Khajapon (laughing) 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.500
 Is it really spicy? 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.040
 It's really really hot. 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.880
 I got caught in my neck. 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.540
 Oh~ 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.200
 It's like ... 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.280
 uh.... 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.100
 (껔) 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.520
 It tastes like a smell. 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.560
 Hahaha 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.514
 Yes, it is. 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.500
 It's just a seafood taste. 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.800
 The smell is right. 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.600
 Khachahaha 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.060
 This is so spicy. 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.900
 It's like a very hard Gummy Bear. 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100
 It's like a gummy bear that was left in the car for hours. 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.100
 I think I will. 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.040
 It feels good. 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.740
 Not really. 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.160
 (Eat again) 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.880
 I will give up eating. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.700
 (Chewing) 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.200
 (Chewing) x2 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.700
 (Chewing) x3 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.200
 (Chewing) x4 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.700
 (Chewing) x5 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.200
 (Chewing) x6 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.860
 (Impression) 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.320
 (Chewing) x7 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.820
 (Chewing) x8 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.320
 (Chewing) x9 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.840
 (Chewing) x10 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.160
 Too much to chew ... 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.540
 There's something you should know. 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.620
 My appetite is fickle. 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.180
 (Scott is crazy) 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.140
 So to eat something like this ... 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.700
 (Frustration) 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.200
 (despair) 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.880
 (scream) 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.380
 (zenith) 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.100
 It's not easy. 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.500
 It's like chewing a stone. 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.580
 Chewable stones. 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.100
 Besides, 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.200
 Yeah, the smell is bad enough. 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.720
 I was in between. 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.320
 (Bottoming) 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.862
 (Bleeding) x2 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.600
 Stupid 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.320
 Eat my stuff. 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.300
 I'll let you. 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.060
 No, you're buried. 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.560
 It's okay, dude, spicy ... 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.060
 (End of speech) 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.200
 I'm going to eat another leg. 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.100
 I hate what you eat. 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.240
 Eat your head. 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.700
 There's so much in your mouth. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.100
 It's painful, it's too stiff. 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.600
 (Chair sound) 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.800
 This is spicy. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.100
 (Stuttering) 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.900
 At the moment you eat, you can feel the spicy taste. 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.700
 How long have I been chewing on this? 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.480
 (He stuttered) 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.600
 I can not stop. I keep chewing. 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.460
 (Keep chewing) 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.620
 (Deep sigh) 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.620
 I do not like it. 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.120
 On the eve 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.620
 (expression) 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.860
 I like spicy food, and the spicy is not bad. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.100
 (Your parser ..) 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.600
 (Confirm) 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.200
 Because it's squid, it just makes you want to puke. 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.800
 If you did not know it was a squid, 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.880
 If you did not know it was squid x2 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.700
 I think it's just fish. 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.000
 I do not think I will. 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.500
 Because the smell is so awful. 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.200
 That's right, the smell is awful. 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.820
 It's already dead. 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.700
 The dead organisms smell. 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.200
 It would be nice if you chew gum now. 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.300
 Yes, I need gum. 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.440
 I'll show you what we eat. 

00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:12.225
 (Show) 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.400
 It looks like it's grilled on the grill. 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.580
 This is what Charles ate. 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.580
 There's a sucker. 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.440
 (Stuttering) 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.180
 Yeah, I got sucked. 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.040
 Hehe 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.580
 It was clean. 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.280
 (Callok) 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.780
 (Call) x2 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.680
 I did a real map. 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.700
 (Collecting) 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.300
 (Callok) 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.020
 How many points would you give me for a score of 10? 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.000
 On a scale of ten? 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.447
 Ten out of ten and one out of the worst. 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.400
 However, 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.180
 (Nasal aspiration) 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.880
 (Still out of 10) 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.400
 (At last) How many points will you give? 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.120
 5 points 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.620
 Five points? 

00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:41.935
 you are? 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.720
 Well, maybe I should give it five. 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.320
 It was not so bad. 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.720
 Yeah, it was not bad, but ... 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.640
 I have eaten a little bit more than you. 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.640
 I ate one leg. 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.700
 I feel like I want to eat this brain part. 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.980
 It looks really bad 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.080
 I will not eat it. 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.580
 Maybe they taste similar to other parts? 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.480
 Yes, I will. 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.200
 But I just want to eat it. 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.800
 The smell makes me lose interest. 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.500
 It's not a good smell. 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.100
 Not really. 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.400
 And more than half the taste is like smell. 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.200
 If you were with other food 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.400
 Or if it is not too bad 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600
 The spicy was really good. 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.200
