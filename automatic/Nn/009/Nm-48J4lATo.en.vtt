about<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.820> book<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.390> lot<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.990> times<00:01:52.200> before

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
about this book a lot of times before

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.859 
about this book a lot of times before
but<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:53.340> some<00:01:53.520> extent<00:01:53.549> how<00:01:54.210> quickly<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.840> can

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
but to some extent how quickly you can

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.530 
but to some extent how quickly you can
fire<00:01:55.229> your<00:01:55.259> muscles<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.100> based<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.240> your

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
fire your muscles is based just on your

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.230 
fire your muscles is based just on your
muscle<00:01:58.500> type<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.860> your

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
muscle type in your

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.100 
muscle type in your
make<00:01:59.870> up<00:02:00.049> you<00:02:00.530> can<00:02:00.799> change<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.400> but<00:02:01.549> a<00:02:02.110> small

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
make up you can change it but a small

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.289 
make up you can change it but a small
amount<00:02:03.140> relative<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.549> how<00:02:04.909> much<00:02:04.970> you<00:02:05.270> can

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
amount relative to how much you can

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.529 
amount relative to how much you can
increase<00:02:06.110> your<00:02:06.380> strength<00:02:06.710> so<00:02:07.369> if<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:08.119> still

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
increase your strength so if I still

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.520 
increase your strength so if I still
produce<00:02:09.500> my<00:02:10.399> force<00:02:10.729> over<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:11.240> much<00:02:11.510> time<00:02:11.870> but

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
produce my force over this much time but

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.590 
produce my force over this much time but
now<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:12.800> can<00:02:13.340> produce<00:02:13.520> this<00:02:13.940> much<00:02:14.209> force

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
now I can produce this much force

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.020 
now I can produce this much force
whereas<00:02:15.260> before<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.650> was<00:02:15.830> down<00:02:16.069> here<00:02:16.489> I've

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
whereas before I was down here I've

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.000 
whereas before I was down here I've
increased<00:02:17.420> my<00:02:17.870> power<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.650> I'm<00:02:18.709> going<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.890> be

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
increased my power and I'm going to be

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.030 
increased my power and I'm going to be
quicker<00:02:19.280> in<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.730> crease<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:20.890> without<00:02:21.890> doing

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
quicker in the crease so without doing

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.220 
quicker in the crease so without doing
any<00:02:22.400> plyometrics<00:02:23.120> or<00:02:23.239> anything<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.959> number

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
any plyometrics or anything the number

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.440 
any plyometrics or anything the number
one<00:02:24.350> thing<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.560> should<00:02:24.830> be<00:02:24.860> worried<00:02:25.220> about

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
one thing you should be worried about

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.290 
one thing you should be worried about
especially<00:02:26.500> early<00:02:27.500> mid<00:02:28.150> offseason<00:02:29.150> is

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
especially early mid offseason is

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.610 
especially early mid offseason is
building<00:02:30.400> mobility<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:32.360> stability<00:02:32.660> then

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
building mobility and stability then

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.250 
building mobility and stability then
your<00:02:33.830> strength<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.489> then<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.780> know<00:02:35.900> for<00:02:36.170> us

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
your strength and then you know for us

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.410 
your strength and then you know for us
in<00:02:36.500> North<00:02:36.709> America<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.250> know<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:37.670> play<00:02:38.030> in

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
in North America I know so you play in

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.880 
in North America I know so you play in
different<00:02:38.810> leagues<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.260> even<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.560> different

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
different leagues and even in different

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.770 
different leagues and even in different
hemispheres<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.580> your<00:02:40.730> flip-flop<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:41.690> in

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
hemispheres so your flip-flop but in

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.009 
hemispheres so your flip-flop but in
North<00:02:41.959> America<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.680> don't<00:02:42.920> really<00:02:43.250> worry<00:02:43.580> about

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
North America I don't really worry about

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.620 
North America I don't really worry about
power<00:02:45.160> specifically<00:02:46.160> until<00:02:47.030> we're<00:02:47.239> getting

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
power specifically until we're getting

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.770 
power specifically until we're getting
into<00:02:48.459> if<00:02:49.459> they're<00:02:49.730> pro<00:02:50.060> until<00:02:50.450> we're<00:02:50.540> sort<00:02:50.750> of

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
into if they're pro until we're sort of

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.690 
into if they're pro until we're sort of
getting<00:02:50.959> into<00:02:51.170> August<00:02:51.440> if<00:02:52.010> you're<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.400> junior

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
getting into August if you're a junior

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.949 
getting into August if you're a junior
and<00:02:53.000> you're<00:02:53.090> going<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.269> be<00:02:53.390> heading<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:53.720> camp

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
and you're going to be heading to camp

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.690 
and you're going to be heading to camp
at<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.350> end<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.620> August<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.190> don't<00:02:55.550> really

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
at the end of August I don't really

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.840 
at the end of August I don't really
worry<00:02:55.940> about<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.239> until<00:02:56.420> about<00:02:56.630> mid<00:02:57.019> July<00:02:57.319> so

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
worry about it until about mid July so

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
worry about it until about mid July so
again<00:02:58.850> don't<00:02:59.090> put<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.330> cart<00:02:59.540> before<00:02:59.569> the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
horse if you just get into plyometrics

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.310 
horse if you just get into plyometrics
right<00:03:02.060> away<00:03:02.269> you're<00:03:02.720> gonna<00:03:02.810> be<00:03:02.959> in<00:03:03.050> for<00:03:03.230> a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
right away you're gonna be in for a

world of hurt having said that here are

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.229 
world of hurt having said that here are
some<00:03:06.799> power<00:03:06.950> drills<00:03:07.310> that<00:03:07.430> they<00:03:07.579> can<00:03:07.760> do<00:03:07.880> that

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
some power drills that they can do that

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.130 
some power drills that they can do that
will<00:03:08.329> improve<00:03:08.660> your<00:03:08.959> lateral<00:03:09.769> speed<00:03:11.140> box

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
will improve your lateral speed box

first work on pop ups learning your good
landing<00:03:28.760> mechanics<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:29.870> then<00:03:29.989> you<00:03:30.170> just<00:03:30.380> work

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
landing mechanics and then you just work

one<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.050> just<00:04:38.169> a<00:04:38.410> squat<00:04:38.710> jump<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.190> lateral

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
one is just a squat jump to a lateral

one is just a squat jump to a lateral
hop<00:04:39.910> a<00:04:40.320> lot<00:04:41.320> of<00:04:41.410> it<00:04:41.560> is<00:04:41.650> in<00:04:41.680> transition<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.520> lot

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
hop a lot of it is in transition a lot

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.610 
hop a lot of it is in transition a lot
of<00:04:42.849> your<00:04:42.940> position<00:04:43.419> is<00:04:43.510> in<00:04:43.690> transition<00:04:44.169> you're

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
of your position is in transition you're

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.140 
of your position is in transition you're
in<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.800> position<00:04:44.949> to<00:04:45.250> make<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.610> first<00:04:45.849> stop

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
in the position to make the first stop

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.060 
in the position to make the first stop
but<00:04:46.630> then<00:04:46.780> there's<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.110> rebound<00:04:47.620> or<00:04:47.830> there's<00:04:48.009> a

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
but then there's a rebound or there's a

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.100 
but then there's a rebound or there's a
quick<00:04:48.340> second<00:04:48.759> shot<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.389> you<00:04:49.539> need<00:04:49.690> to<00:04:49.840> react

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
quick second shot and you need to react

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.589 
quick second shot and you need to react
and<00:04:50.410> be<00:04:50.830> explosive<00:04:51.520> then<00:04:51.699> so<00:04:52.240> this<00:04:52.360> will<00:04:52.509> just

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
and be explosive then so this will just

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.040 
and be explosive then so this will just
be<00:04:52.750> squat<00:04:53.680> jump<00:04:54.039> final<00:04:54.820> hop<00:04:55.030> start<00:04:55.780> drop

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050

we<00:05:07.960> can<00:05:08.110> add<00:05:08.260> some<00:05:08.500> more<00:05:08.530> specific<00:05:09.250> transition

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
we can add some more specific transition

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.649 
we can add some more specific transition
to<00:05:10.090> that<00:05:10.270> so<00:05:10.840> we<00:05:10.990> can<00:05:11.199> do<00:05:11.380> our<00:05:12.330> half<00:05:13.330> kneeling
