seamlessly<00:00:53.699> which<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.999> really<00:00:54.300> cool<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.749> is

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
seamlessly which is really cool that is

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.139 
seamlessly which is really cool that is
very<00:00:55.530> cool<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> were<00:00:56.100> talking<00:00:56.249> real

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
very cool and you were talking real

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.759 
very cool and you were talking real
briefly<00:00:57.539> about<00:00:57.719> being<00:00:58.079> able<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.350> adjust<00:00:58.589> the

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
briefly about being able to adjust the

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.069 
briefly about being able to adjust the
ventilation<00:00:59.399> yeah<00:00:59.699> very<00:01:00.359> cool<00:01:00.569> feature<00:01:00.839> on

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
ventilation yeah very cool feature on

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.720 
ventilation yeah very cool feature on
this<00:01:01.289> thermostatic<00:01:01.920> control<00:01:02.219> from<00:01:02.399> G<00:01:02.550> R<00:01:02.579> yeah

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
this thermostatic control from G R yeah

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.870 
this thermostatic control from G R yeah
yep<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.390> that's<00:01:03.749> in<00:01:04.439> part<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:05.009> in-mold

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
yep and that's in part with in-mold

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.550 
yep and that's in part with in-mold
technologies<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.689> gives<00:01:06.899> us<00:01:07.079> infinite

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
technologies that gives us infinite

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.260 
technologies that gives us infinite
range<00:01:07.710> how<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.009> channel<00:01:08.670> there<00:01:08.820> through<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
range how we channel there through the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.210 
range how we channel there through the
helmet<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.079> this<00:01:10.259> actually<00:01:10.619> has<00:01:10.680> really<00:01:10.979> three

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
helmet so this actually has really three

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.219 
helmet so this actually has really three
kickers<00:01:11.579> number<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.329> is<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.600> stakman

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
kickers number one is a stakman

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.170 
kickers number one is a stakman
so<00:01:13.649> instead<00:01:14.009> of<00:01:14.070> dropping<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.610> lid<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> pot

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
so instead of dropping a lid on the pot

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
so instead of dropping a lid on the pot
here<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.570> blocking<00:01:16.079> the<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.500> venting<00:01:16.829> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
here and blocking the the venting of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.330 
here and blocking the the venting of
your<00:01:17.070> goggle<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.909> actually<00:01:18.270> helps<00:01:18.860> helps<00:01:19.860> your

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
your goggle it actually helps helps your

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.010 
your goggle it actually helps helps your
goggle<00:01:20.670> draw<00:01:20.880> air<00:01:21.149> away<00:01:21.270> from<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.719> it<00:01:21.810> pulls

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
goggle draw air away from it so it pulls

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.569 
goggle draw air away from it so it pulls
the<00:01:22.229> air<00:01:22.259> through<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:23.070> actually<00:01:23.460> then

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
the air through it actually then

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.219 
the air through it actually then
channel's<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> air<00:01:24.270> through<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> helmet<00:01:24.960> put

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
channel's the air through the helmet put

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.889 
channel's the air through the helmet put
in<00:01:25.290> fresh<00:01:25.500> air<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.890> stale<00:01:26.219> air<00:01:26.399> out<00:01:26.579> and<00:01:26.820> then

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
in fresh air in stale air out and then

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.660 
in fresh air in stale air out and then
on<00:01:27.899> those<00:01:28.140> cold<00:01:28.530> blustery<00:01:28.799> days<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.460> even

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
on those cold blustery days you can even

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340 
on those cold blustery days you can even
lock<00:01:29.820> down<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.299> thermostat<00:01:30.509> control<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
lock down the thermostat control so a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.620 
lock down the thermostat control so a
warm<00:01:31.799> environment<00:01:32.250> internal<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.090> again

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
warm environment internal and again

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.440 
warm environment internal and again
those<00:01:33.840> super<00:01:34.200> cool<00:01:34.380> vents<00:01:34.649> are<00:01:35.450> configured

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
those super cool vents are configured

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.550 
those super cool vents are configured
throughout<00:01:36.719> the<00:01:36.869> helmet<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> best

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
throughout the helmet for the best

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.649 
throughout the helmet for the best
performance<00:01:37.770> they're<00:01:38.340> very<00:01:39.060> cool<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.539> now

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
performance they're very cool and now

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.440 
performance they're very cool and now
