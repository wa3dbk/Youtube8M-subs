having a gore-tex membrane allows extra

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.160 
having a gore-tex membrane allows extra
heat<00:01:02.530> as<00:01:02.739> well<00:01:03.280> as<00:01:03.399> extra<00:01:03.910> sweat<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:05.140> evaporate

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
heat as well as extra sweat to evaporate

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.200

and<00:01:05.770> permeate<00:01:06.310> out<00:01:06.460> through<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.880> membrane

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
and permeate out through the membrane

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.940 
and permeate out through the membrane
out<00:01:07.360> through<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.840> boot<00:01:08.020> so<00:01:08.350> what<00:01:08.500> it<00:01:08.590> does<00:01:08.740> is

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
out through the boot so what it does is

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.649 
out through the boot so what it does is
rather<00:01:09.189> than<00:01:09.399> being<00:01:09.520> cold<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.030> clammy<00:01:10.210> or

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.420 
rather than being cold and clammy or
warm<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:11.110> clammy<00:01:11.320> it<00:01:11.770> keeps<00:01:12.070> you<00:01:12.189> comfortable

bike so that's the big first huge
upgrade<00:01:20.319> I<00:01:20.619> mentioned<00:01:21.399> this<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.579> a<00:01:21.609> touring

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
upgrade I mentioned this is a touring

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.309 
upgrade I mentioned this is a touring
boot<00:01:22.090> it<00:01:22.450> looks<00:01:22.630> like<00:01:22.749> a<00:01:22.780> really<00:01:23.020> rugged

high-top<00:01:23.889> let's<00:01:24.310> talk<00:01:24.490> about<00:01:24.609> the<00:01:24.850> sole<00:01:25.060> it's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
high-top let's talk about the sole it's

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.120 
high-top let's talk about the sole it's
a<00:01:25.270> touring<00:01:25.569> sole<00:01:25.810> it's<00:01:26.049> very<00:01:26.229> functional<00:01:26.530> it's

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
a touring sole it's very functional it's

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.160 
a touring sole it's very functional it's
a<00:01:27.189> high<00:01:27.369> grip<00:01:27.579> sole<00:01:27.819> oil<00:01:28.240> resistant<00:01:28.780> but<00:01:29.109> the

a high grip sole oil resistant but the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.779 
a high grip sole oil resistant but the
difference<00:01:29.469> between<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:30.189> sole<00:01:30.399> on<00:01:30.520> this<00:01:30.670> guy

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
difference between the sole on this guy

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.550 
difference between the sole on this guy
and<00:01:30.819> something<00:01:31.299> like<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.049> more<00:01:32.259> Sport

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
and something like the the more Sport

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.249 
and something like the the more Sport
and<00:01:32.770> oriented<00:01:33.340> X<00:01:33.549> cube<00:01:33.880> or<00:01:33.999> X<00:01:34.149> square<00:01:34.420> is<00:01:34.630> that

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
and oriented X cube or X square is that

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.379 
and oriented X cube or X square is that
this<00:01:35.380> is<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.590> much<00:01:35.979> much<00:01:36.249> stiffer<00:01:36.639> sole<00:01:37.030> think

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:37.389 
this is a much much stiffer sole think

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:38.879 
this is a much much stiffer sole think
about<00:01:37.539> a<00:01:37.569> hiking<00:01:38.020> solar<00:01:38.259> think<00:01:38.530> about<00:01:38.679> it<00:01:38.799> a

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:38.889 
about a hiking solar think about it a

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:40.590 
about a hiking solar think about it a

economics and protection at the ankle

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.060 
economics and protection at the ankle
because<00:03:40.600> they<00:03:40.840> know<00:03:40.959> that's<00:03:41.079> a<00:03:41.230> crush<00:03:41.530> area<00:03:41.890> in

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
because they know that's a crush area in

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.850 
because they know that's a crush area in
a<00:03:42.250> lot<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.430> crash<00:03:42.790> situations<00:03:43.540> they<00:03:43.989> have<00:03:44.019> TCX

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
a lot of crash situations they have TCX

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.830 
a lot of crash situations they have TCX
also<00:03:45.190> has<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.370> principle<00:03:46.239> that<00:03:46.480> they<00:03:46.600> apply<00:03:46.810> to

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
also has a principle that they apply to

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.330 
also has a principle that they apply to
all<00:03:47.079> their<00:03:47.230> boots<00:03:47.380> boots<00:03:47.829> called<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.130> comfort

all their boots boots called the comfort
fit<00:03:48.579> system<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.209> what<00:03:49.329> that<00:03:49.360> does<00:03:49.630> is<00:03:49.840> it

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
fit system and what that does is it

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.660 
fit system and what that does is it
starts<00:03:50.230> with<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:50.380> very<00:03:50.530> ergonomic<00:03:51.220> mold<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.610> a

starts with a very ergonomic mold of a
foot<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.209> they<00:03:52.269> built<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.600> root<00:03:52.750> boot<00:03:53.140> around

foot and they built a root boot around

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.020 
foot and they built a root boot around
it<00:03:53.650> rather<00:03:53.829> than<00:03:54.010> starting<00:03:54.370> with<00:03:54.519> materials

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
it rather than starting with materials

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.520 
it rather than starting with materials
and<00:03:55.120> trying<00:03:55.570> to<00:03:55.630> make<00:03:55.780> them<00:03:55.930> fit<00:03:56.049> a<00:03:56.109> foot<00:03:56.350> after

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
and trying to make them fit a foot after

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.229 
and trying to make them fit a foot after
the<00:03:56.739> fact<00:03:57.010> it's<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:57.549> totally<00:03:57.880> different<00:03:58.150> level

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
the fact it's a totally different level

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.210 
the fact it's a totally different level
of<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.510> design<00:03:58.810> it's<00:03:59.290> why<00:03:59.500> you<00:03:59.560> see<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.160> many

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
of a design it's why you see so many

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.039 
of a design it's why you see so many
