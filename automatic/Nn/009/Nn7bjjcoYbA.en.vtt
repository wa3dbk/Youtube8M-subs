it and i'm not sure if it works at one

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.190 
it and i'm not sure if it works at one
point<00:02:32.650> Oh<00:02:32.860> yet<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.400> still<00:02:33.550> have<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.090> kind<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.840> go

point Oh yet I still have to kind of go

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680 
point Oh yet I still have to kind of go
and<00:02:35.320> find<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:35.920> see<00:02:36.100> if<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.280> will<00:02:36.340> work<00:02:36.690> but

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
and find it and see if it will work but

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.970 
and find it and see if it will work but
it's<00:02:37.840> really<00:02:38.110> helpful<00:02:38.380> for<00:02:38.530> getting<00:02:38.860> your

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
it's really helpful for getting your

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.510 
it's really helpful for getting your
videos<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:40.360> right<00:02:40.630> frame<00:02:41.050> size<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.740> then

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
videos in the right frame size and then

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.980 
videos in the right frame size and then
we<00:02:42.670> record<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.150> by<00:02:43.300> fraps<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.990> we<00:02:44.290> edit<00:02:44.770> in

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
we record it by fraps and we edit in

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.510 
we record it by fraps and we edit in
Adobe<00:02:46.990> Premiere<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.830> reason<00:02:48.130> we<00:02:48.220> had<00:02:48.370> it

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
Adobe Premiere and the reason we had it

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.520 
Adobe Premiere and the reason we had it
in<00:02:48.610> Adobe<00:02:48.910> Premiere<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.600> because<00:02:49.990> it<00:02:50.140> supports

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
in Adobe Premiere is because it supports

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.500 
in Adobe Premiere is because it supports
the<00:02:51.040> file<00:02:51.970> size<00:02:52.270> of<00:02:52.570> frats<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:54.120> stupidly<00:02:55.120> in

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
the file size of frats and I stupidly in

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.100 
the file size of frats and I stupidly in
our<00:02:55.810> old<00:02:56.020> videos<00:02:56.880> converted<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.450> footage<00:02:58.870> and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
our old videos converted the footage and

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.060 
our old videos converted the footage and
this<00:02:59.710> made<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:01.150> dark<00:03:01.420> colors<00:03:02.080> black

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
this made the the dark colors black

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.220 
this made the the dark colors black
which<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.850> why<00:03:04.030> some<00:03:04.270> of<00:03:04.390> our<00:03:04.510> footage<00:03:04.930> in<00:03:05.080> our

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
which is why some of our footage in our

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.410 
which is why some of our footage in our
previous<00:03:05.740> videos<00:03:06.280> are<00:03:06.520> really<00:03:06.700> old<00:03:06.940> videos

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
previous videos are really old videos

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.440 
previous videos are really old videos
was<00:03:08.230> really<00:03:08.920> dark<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.490> was<00:03:09.700> because<00:03:10.060> when<00:03:10.330> we

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
was really dark it was because when we

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.650 
was really dark it was because when we
converted<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.320> made<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.500> even<00:03:11.710> darker<00:03:12.400> and

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
converted it and made it even darker and

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.970 
converted it and made it even darker and
that<00:03:13.660> was<00:03:13.810> one<00:03:13.990> of<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:14.140> problems<00:03:14.470> we<00:03:14.590> had<00:03:14.740> so

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
that was one of the problems we had so

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.890 
that was one of the problems we had so
but<00:03:15.520> if<00:03:15.670> you're<00:03:15.850> making<00:03:16.180> minecraft<00:03:16.360> videos

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
but if you're making minecraft videos

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.470 
but if you're making minecraft videos
try<00:03:17.260> not<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.470> convert<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.070> footage<00:03:18.730> because

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
try not to convert the footage because

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.140 
try not to convert the footage because
it<00:03:19.870> will<00:03:20.260> reduce<00:03:20.710> the<00:03:21.010> quality<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.910> may

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
it will reduce the quality and it may

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.080 
it will reduce the quality and it may
make<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.750> dark<00:03:23.020> colors<00:03:23.560> black<00:03:24.250> making<00:03:24.940> your

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
make the dark colors black making your

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.850 
make the dark colors black making your
footage<00:03:25.450> darker<00:03:25.990> than<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.230> actually<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.620> on

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
footage darker than it actually is on

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.900
