00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
close individual applications we can

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.839 
close individual applications we can
close<00:00:09.870> all<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.769> applications<00:00:11.400> at<00:00:11.639> once

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849

well as the built-in Internet
application<00:01:00.359> now<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> bit<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
application now this is a bit of a

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.930 
application now this is a bit of a
contention<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:01.829> us<00:01:02.039> because<00:01:02.280> as<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.789> we

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
contention with us because as you see we

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.850 
contention with us because as you see we
open<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.750> complete<00:01:04.260> asks<00:01:04.710> us<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
open it up and it complete asks us to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.039 
open it up and it complete asks us to
use<00:01:05.250> which<00:01:05.489> application<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.330> want<00:01:06.479> because<00:01:06.930> we

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
use which application we want because we

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.530 
use which application we want because we
had<00:01:07.229> Firefox<00:01:07.830> set<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> default<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:09.240> asks

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
had Firefox set as the default it asks

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.539 
had Firefox set as the default it asks
us<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> second<00:01:10.170> time<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.530> well<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:11.100> when<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.400> go

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
us a second time as well then when we go

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.789 
us a second time as well then when we go
to<00:01:11.610> search<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.659> will<00:01:12.810> actually<00:01:13.049> open<00:01:13.710> up

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to search it will actually open up

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.010 
to search it will actually open up
Firefox<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.790> complete<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> search<00:01:15.540> instead

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
Firefox to complete the search instead

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.289
