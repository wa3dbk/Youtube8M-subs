00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
2560 x 1440 bit larger now so it should

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.130 
2560 x 1440 bit larger now so it should
fit<00:00:25.680> pretty<00:00:25.859> much<00:00:26.099> every<00:00:26.340> monitor<00:00:27.140> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
fit pretty much every monitor the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.200 
fit pretty much every monitor the
drawing<00:00:28.410> was<00:00:28.560> streamed<00:00:28.859> last<00:00:29.070> night<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
drawing was streamed last night the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.700 
drawing was streamed last night the
whole<00:00:30.420> process<00:00:30.660> took<00:00:31.019> about<00:00:31.080> four<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.679> half

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.920
