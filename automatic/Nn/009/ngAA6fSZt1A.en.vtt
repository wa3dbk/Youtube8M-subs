00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
spread shot went down to a twin shot now

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.040 
spread shot went down to a twin shot now
because<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> actually<00:01:41.760> took<00:01:42.210> fire<00:01:42.510> from<00:01:42.540> that

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050

super shield but lost my awesome spread
shot<00:01:48.600> however<00:01:49.410> I<00:01:49.650> still<00:01:49.980> have<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.250> shield

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490

which<00:01:51.150> which<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.720> good<00:01:51.930> doesn't<00:01:52.530> help<00:01:52.650> when

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
which which is good doesn't help when

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.590 
which which is good doesn't help when
you<00:01:52.830> run<00:01:52.980> into<00:01:53.220> things<00:01:53.370> though<00:01:53.640> okay<00:01:54.420> we're

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you run into things though okay we're

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.320 
you run into things though okay we're
going<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.870> attack<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.310> star<00:01:56.310> brain<00:01:56.730> and<00:01:57.090> if

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
going to attack the star brain and if

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.880 
going to attack the star brain and if
you<00:01:57.450> don't<00:01:57.660> blow<00:01:57.840> him<00:01:58.020> up<00:01:58.050> in<00:01:58.320> time<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.710> game

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
you don't blow him up in time the game

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.850 
you don't blow him up in time the game
rewinds<00:01:59.580> you<00:01:59.880> back<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.690> middle<00:02:01.650> of<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
rewinds you back to the middle of the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.740 
rewinds you back to the middle of the
previous<00:02:02.310> level<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.790> makes<00:02:02.940> you<00:02:03.150> do<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.510> again

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
previous level and makes you do it again

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.630 
previous level and makes you do it again
so<00:02:04.470> it's<00:02:04.590> actually<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:04.980> a<00:02:05.040> bad<00:02:05.130> way<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.460> get

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
so it's actually not a bad way to get

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.520 
so it's actually not a bad way to get
some<00:02:05.790> more<00:02:05.910> points<00:02:06.300> but<00:02:06.870> ideally<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.320> just

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
some more points but ideally you just

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:22.440 
some more points but ideally you just
want<00:02:07.650> to<00:02:07.710> blow<00:02:07.860> away<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.250> stupid<00:02:08.580> star<00:02:08.850> brain

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.120 

the<00:02:23.450> way<00:02:23.600> that<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:23.810> like<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.140> play<00:02:24.410> Star<00:02:24.710> Soldier

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.430 
the way that I like to play Star Soldier
is<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.520> get<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.820> spread<00:02:26.180> shot<00:02:26.480> hang<00:02:27.170> out<00:02:27.320> in

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
is to get the spread shot hang out in

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.780 
is to get the spread shot hang out in
the<00:02:27.500> middle<00:02:27.710> of<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.890> screen<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:28.370> not<00:02:28.520> move

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
the middle of the screen and not move

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.550 
the middle of the screen and not move
much<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.510> way<00:02:29.630> there's<00:02:29.870> less<00:02:29.930> chance<00:02:30.410> of

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
much that way there's less chance of

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.310 
much that way there's less chance of
crashing<00:02:30.980> into<00:02:31.190> things<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:32.090> let's<00:02:32.900> get<00:02:33.050> both

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
crashing into things and let's get both

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.480 
crashing into things and let's get both
of<00:02:33.350> them<00:02:33.650> at<00:02:33.800> once<00:02:33.830> for<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.580> bonus<00:02:35.330> thank<00:02:35.780> you

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
of them at once for the bonus thank you

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.700 
of them at once for the bonus thank you
that's<00:02:37.490> not<00:02:37.730> easy<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.150> do<00:02:38.330> because<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:39.020> usually

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
that's not easy to do because I usually

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.350 
that's not easy to do because I usually
lose<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.250> spread<00:02:40.520> shot<00:02:40.730> at<00:02:40.880> some<00:02:41.120> point

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
lose the spread shot at some point

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.960 
lose the spread shot at some point
during<00:02:41.570> that<00:02:41.720> level<00:02:42.320> all<00:02:43.160> right<00:02:43.460> back<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.880> the

during that level all right back to the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.420 
during that level all right back to the
star<00:02:44.300> brain<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.960> a<00:02:45.290> sloppy<00:02:45.860> mistake
