more meadows and there's a strange block

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.050 
more meadows and there's a strange block

over there but before I go over there I

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.750 
over there but before I go over there I
will<00:03:05.450> get<00:03:05.630> this<00:03:05.810> last<00:03:06.310> marbled<00:03:07.900> be<00:03:08.900> home<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.760> I

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
will get this last marbled be home and I

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:18.009 
will get this last marbled be home and I
will<00:03:11.300> try<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.080> see<00:03:13.450> what<00:03:14.450> that<00:03:14.660> is<00:03:14.870> oh<00:03:16.510> yes<00:03:17.510> it

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
will try and see what that is oh yes it

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.560 
will try and see what that is oh yes it
is<00:03:18.170> as<00:03:18.410> well<00:03:18.440> it's<00:03:19.070> why<00:03:19.489> i<00:03:19.519> thought<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.090> was<00:03:20.239> it

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
is as well it's why i thought it was it

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.979 
is as well it's why i thought it was it
was<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.870> water<00:03:21.320> beehive<00:03:21.950> now<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:23.239> wood<00:03:23.510> beehive

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
was a water beehive now the wood beehive

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.590 
was a water beehive now the wood beehive
I<00:03:24.230> think<00:03:25.040> they're<00:03:25.280> reasonably<00:03:25.910> rare<00:03:26.269> just

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
I think they're reasonably rare just

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.130 
I think they're reasonably rare just
because<00:03:26.930> I've<00:03:27.290> never<00:03:27.650> found<00:03:27.950> them<00:03:28.190> before<00:03:28.579> but

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
because I've never found them before but

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.110 
because I've never found them before but
they<00:03:30.140> have<00:03:30.470> different<00:03:30.640> factors<00:03:31.640> about

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
they have different factors about

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.750 
they have different factors about
themselves<00:03:32.840> like<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.709> bees<00:03:33.890> inside<00:03:34.220> have

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
themselves like the bees inside have

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.670 
themselves like the bees inside have
different<00:03:35.209> factors<00:03:35.630> about<00:03:35.750> themselves<00:03:36.350> to

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
different factors about themselves to

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.100 
different factors about themselves to
other<00:03:36.980> ones<00:03:37.280> so<00:03:37.549> they<00:03:38.120> need<00:03:38.329> special<00:03:38.840> things

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
other ones so they need special things

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.310 
other ones so they need special things
around<00:03:39.500> them<00:03:39.880> again<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:41.239> pollinate<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.049> trees

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
around them again to pollinate the trees

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.199 
around them again to pollinate the trees
and<00:03:43.209> so<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.420> shall<00:03:44.480> just<00:03:44.989> wait<00:03:45.709> till<00:03:46.130> this<00:03:46.370> scoop

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
and so I shall just wait till this scoop

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.360 
and so I shall just wait till this scoop
dies<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.470> i<00:03:48.739> shall<00:03:49.160> head<00:03:49.400> back<00:03:49.609> home<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:51.799> so<00:03:52.070> I

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
dies and i shall head back home and so I

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.390 
dies and i shall head back home and so I
I<00:03:53.239> try<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:53.840> I'm<00:03:54.140> trying<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:54.470> find<00:03:54.769> more<00:03:55.100> than

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.510 
get beaten it's not too happy so I'll
just<00:04:44.360> change<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:45.169> daytime<00:04:45.379> and<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:46.310> will

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
just change it to daytime and I will

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.909 
just change it to daytime and I will
show<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:47.169> what<00:04:48.169> to<00:04:48.470> do<00:04:48.680> next<00:04:50.379> so<00:04:51.379> now<00:04:51.710> it's

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
show you what to do next so now it's

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.200 
show you what to do next so now it's
daytime<00:04:52.370> I<00:04:52.669> will<00:04:53.629> take<00:04:53.900> just<00:04:54.139> one<00:04:54.409> example<00:04:55.210> for

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
daytime I will take just one example for

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.080 
daytime I will take just one example for
you<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.629> then<00:04:57.319> next<00:04:57.560> episode<00:04:58.310> I<00:04:58.580> will<00:04:58.729> have

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
you and then next episode I will have

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.870 
you and then next episode I will have
all<00:04:59.360> of<00:04:59.389> them<00:04:59.720> done<00:05:00.009> so<00:05:01.009> you<00:05:01.069> don't<00:05:01.490> have<00:05:01.699> to

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
all of them done so you don't have to

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.270 
all of them done so you don't have to
watch<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.270> same<00:05:02.509> process<00:05:03.080> over<00:05:03.259> and<00:05:03.770> over<00:05:03.889> and

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
watch the same process over and over and

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.570 
watch the same process over and over and
over<00:05:04.430> again<00:05:04.930> so<00:05:05.930> I<00:05:06.199> will<00:05:06.409> take<00:05:06.590> one<00:05:06.949> drone<00:05:07.310> a

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
over again so I will take one drone a

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.270 
over again so I will take one drone a
Meadows<00:05:08.030> drone<00:05:08.330> and<00:05:08.569> one<00:05:09.310> marbled<00:05:10.310> Queen<00:05:10.880> and

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
Meadows drone and one marbled Queen and

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.350 
Meadows drone and one marbled Queen and
hopefully<00:05:13.419> this<00:05:14.419> will<00:05:14.659> work<00:05:14.720> first<00:05:15.620> time<00:05:15.889> man

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
hopefully this will work first time man

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.300 
hopefully this will work first time man
because<00:05:17.360> there<00:05:17.900> are<00:05:18.110> certain<00:05:18.590> factors<00:05:18.830> that

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
because there are certain factors that

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.129 
because there are certain factors that
you<00:05:19.370> need<00:05:19.520> for<00:05:20.509> the<00:05:20.780> bees<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:21.789> so<00:05:23.020> what<00:05:24.020> I'm

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
you need for the bees and so what I'm

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.110 
you need for the bees and so what I'm
going<00:05:24.319> to<00:05:24.440> do<00:05:24.710> is<00:05:24.949> I'm<00:05:25.430> going<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.699> put<00:05:25.940> the

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
going to do is I'm going to put the

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.540 
going to do is I'm going to put the
marble<00:05:26.690> princess<00:05:27.139> in<00:05:27.289> the<00:05:27.409> top<00:05:27.650> and<00:05:27.860> the

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
marble princess in the top and the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.270 
marble princess in the top and the
meadows<00:05:29.000> drone<00:05:29.300> in<00:05:29.569> the<00:05:29.960> bottom<00:05:30.500> of<00:05:30.680> these<00:05:30.949> two

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
meadows drone in the bottom of these two

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.430 
meadows drone in the bottom of these two
separate<00:05:31.969> squares<00:05:32.270> and<00:05:32.509> a<00:05:32.690> bar<00:05:32.900> will<00:05:33.110> go<00:05:33.259> up

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
separate squares and a bar will go up

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.770 
separate squares and a bar will go up
once<00:05:33.919> a<00:05:34.130> bar<00:05:34.310> has<00:05:34.490> finished<00:05:34.789> it<00:05:35.240> will<00:05:35.419> create<00:05:35.630> a

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
once a bar has finished it will create a

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.610 
once a bar has finished it will create a
marble<00:05:36.380> queen<00:05:36.680> but<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:37.819> sky<00:05:38.150> is<00:05:38.620> obstructed

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
marble queen but the sky is obstructed

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.559 
marble queen but the sky is obstructed
so<00:05:39.889> that's<00:05:40.130> why<00:05:40.310> it's<00:05:40.490> not<00:05:40.550> working<00:05:40.669> so<00:05:41.270> i<00:05:41.300> get

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:41.569 
so that's why it's not working so i get

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:44.170 
so that's why it's not working so i get
rid<00:05:41.719> of<00:05:41.779> those<00:05:42.020> two<00:05:42.319> blocks<00:05:42.729> directly<00:05:43.729> above

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
rid of those two blocks directly above

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.080 
rid of those two blocks directly above
the<00:05:44.419> apiary<00:05:44.960> and<00:05:45.289> there<00:05:46.190> you<00:05:46.310> go<00:05:46.490> all<00:05:46.759> the<00:05:46.940> bit

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
the apiary and there you go all the bit

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:55.390 
the apiary and there you go all the bit
get<00:05:47.599> away<00:05:48.699> attack<00:05:49.699> bees<00:05:49.940> um<00:05:51.940> so<00:05:53.949> now<00:05:54.949> that<00:05:55.219> the

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
get away attack bees um so now that the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.279 
get away attack bees um so now that the
bees<00:05:55.759> are<00:05:55.789> all<00:05:56.210> flying<00:05:56.479> out<00:05:56.750> you<00:05:56.930> can<00:05:57.110> see

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
bees are all flying out you can see

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.769 
bees are all flying out you can see
they're<00:05:57.500> going<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:57.919> each<00:05:58.190> tree<00:05:58.759> and<00:05:59.029> hopefully

00:05:59.769 --> 00:05:59.779 
they're going to each tree and hopefully

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.170 
they're going to each tree and hopefully
they<00:05:59.960> will<00:06:00.139> pollinate<00:06:00.500> and<00:06:00.889> this<00:06:01.669> will<00:06:01.880> take<00:06:02.120> a

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
they will pollinate and this will take a

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.260 
they will pollinate and this will take a
little<00:06:02.389> while<00:06:02.569> to<00:06:03.080> get<00:06:03.279> new<00:06:04.279> leaves<00:06:04.639> on<00:06:05.029> the

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
little while to get new leaves on the

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.170 
little while to get new leaves on the
trees<00:06:05.569> but<00:06:05.889> when<00:06:06.889> it<00:06:07.039> does<00:06:07.219> you<00:06:07.699> will<00:06:07.909> get<00:06:08.120> a

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
trees but when it does you will get a

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.230 
trees but when it does you will get a
good<00:06:08.449> selection<00:06:08.810> of<00:06:09.199> them<00:06:10.150> so<00:06:11.889> now<00:06:12.909> now<00:06:13.909> they

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
good selection of them so now now they

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.659 
good selection of them so now now they
have<00:06:14.449> stopped<00:06:14.900> so<00:06:15.590> this<00:06:15.919> is<00:06:16.099> a<00:06:16.130> perfect

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
have stopped so this is a perfect

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.209 
have stopped so this is a perfect
example<00:06:16.819> for<00:06:17.569> you<00:06:17.870> and<00:06:18.139> as<00:06:18.740> you<00:06:18.979> can<00:06:19.190> see

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:19.219 
example for you and as you can see

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:24.129 
example for you and as you can see
there's<00:06:19.729> no<00:06:20.000> flowers<00:06:21.310> nearby<00:06:22.310> now<00:06:22.940> the<00:06:23.479> apiary

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
there's no flowers nearby now the apiary

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.469 
there's no flowers nearby now the apiary
needs<00:06:24.650> flowers<00:06:25.099> nearby<00:06:25.460> so<00:06:25.729> I<00:06:25.759> shall<00:06:26.180> go<00:06:26.389> and

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
needs flowers nearby so I shall go and

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.999 
needs flowers nearby so I shall go and
get<00:06:26.630> on<00:06:26.870> now<00:06:27.650> that<00:06:27.710> i've<00:06:28.009> been<00:06:28.219> i've<00:06:28.580> got<00:06:29.449> some

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
get on now that i've been i've got some

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.189 
get on now that i've been i've got some
yellow<00:06:31.009> ones<00:06:31.310> just<00:06:31.819> directly<00:06:32.630> across<00:06:32.960> the

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 
yellow ones just directly across the

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.129 
yellow ones just directly across the
lake<00:06:33.409> by<00:06:33.830> my<00:06:34.070> house<00:06:34.279> so<00:06:35.029> i<00:06:35.360> will<00:06:35.630> need<00:06:35.779> to<00:06:35.899> find

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
lake by my house so i will need to find

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.690 
lake by my house so i will need to find
other<00:06:36.380> one<00:06:36.620> so<00:06:36.919> i<00:06:37.219> can't

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
other one so i can't

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.990 
other one so i can't
have<00:06:37.880> one<00:06:38.210> separate<00:06:39.080> plant<00:06:39.350> so<00:06:39.980> perfect<00:06:40.790> is

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
have one separate plant so perfect is

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
purple ones and then in a second I will

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.650 
purple ones and then in a second I will
go<00:06:45.830> find<00:06:46.250> some<00:06:46.520> red<00:06:46.760> ones<00:06:49.030> so<00:06:50.030> I<00:06:50.060> found<00:06:50.480> some

go find some red ones so I found some

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.880 
go find some red ones so I found some
red<00:06:50.840> ones<00:06:51.280> go<00:06:52.280> mad<00:06:52.670> on<00:06:52.940> them<00:06:53.540> and<00:06:54.110> I<00:06:54.680> found

red ones go mad on them and I found

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.740 
red ones go mad on them and I found
another<00:06:55.130> bee<00:06:55.460> hive<00:06:55.730> which<00:06:56.000> is<00:06:56.150> reasonably

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
another bee hive which is reasonably

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.980 
another bee hive which is reasonably
close<00:06:57.020> to<00:06:57.230> the<00:06:57.350> house<00:06:57.530> but<00:06:57.890> oh<00:06:58.390> I<00:06:59.390> don't<00:06:59.540> have<00:06:59.960> a

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
close to the house but oh I don't have a
