them around which is really cool um one
of<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> bugs<00:01:02.190> though<00:01:02.399> right<00:01:02.609> now<00:01:02.760> is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
of the bugs though right now is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.899 
of the bugs though right now is
obviously<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.930> one's<00:01:04.229> 1.7<00:01:05.070> point<00:01:05.339> 8<00:01:05.610> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
obviously this one's 1.7 point 8 and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.929 
obviously this one's 1.7 point 8 and
this<00:01:06.270> one's<00:01:06.479> also<00:01:06.659> 1.7<00:01:07.380> point<00:01:07.560> eight<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:08.490> this

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
this one's also 1.7 point eight but this

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.480 
this one's also 1.7 point eight but this
one<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.479> registering<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.369> isn't

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
one is registering and this one isn't

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.609 
one is registering and this one isn't
and<00:01:11.790> my<00:01:12.540> servers<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:12.960> even<00:01:13.110> registering<00:01:13.470> at

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and my servers not even registering at

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.370 
and my servers not even registering at
all<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.570> multiplayer<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:15.990> screwed<00:01:16.259> up

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
all so multiplayer is really screwed up

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.289 
all so multiplayer is really screwed up
but<00:01:16.770> that's<00:01:17.100> expected<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.030> only<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
but that's expected this is only a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.200 
but that's expected this is only a
snapshot<00:01:18.630> they're<00:01:19.290> gonna<00:01:19.470> fix<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.970> let's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
snapshot they're gonna fix it so let's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.390 
snapshot they're gonna fix it so let's
