00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I never heard a mess her hair is very

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.940 
I never heard a mess her hair is very
straight<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.899> would<00:02:04.079> not<00:02:04.259> recommend<00:02:04.320> doing

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
straight so I would not recommend doing

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.580 
straight so I would not recommend doing
like<00:02:05.610> braids<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.540> or<00:02:06.659> anything<00:02:06.869> because<00:02:07.409> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
like braids on it or anything because it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.639 
like braids on it or anything because it
could<00:02:07.770> be<00:02:07.950> evarin<00:02:08.729> tried<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:09.989> most

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
could be evarin tried it but it's most

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.610 
could be evarin tried it but it's most
likely<00:02:10.739> gonna<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.280> very<00:02:11.610> sensitive<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.540> braids

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
likely gonna be very sensitive to braids

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.470 
likely gonna be very sensitive to braids
meaning<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.250> if<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.550> leave<00:02:14.879> it<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.450> a
