actually discus launching ever and when
he<00:01:35.830> had<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.040> Leo<00:01:36.190> juice<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.700> did<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.880> pudding

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
he had the Leo juice and did a pudding

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.859 
he had the Leo juice and did a pudding
with<00:01:37.570> it

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
with it

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.170 
with it
I<00:01:37.899> had<00:01:38.590> launched<00:01:38.830> ok<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.340> whole<00:01:39.490> body<00:01:39.729> because

I had launched ok the whole body because
I<00:01:40.210> need<00:01:40.540> we<00:01:40.690> broke<00:01:40.899> it<00:01:41.080> over<00:01:41.350> here

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
I need we broke it over here

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.340 
I need we broke it over here
yeah<00:01:42.149> then<00:01:43.149> I<00:01:43.270> redesigned<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.899> body<00:01:44.110> so<00:01:44.320> that

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
yeah then I redesigned the body so that

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.480 
yeah then I redesigned the body so that
two<00:01:45.960> tabs<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.170> just<00:01:47.350> clipping<00:01:47.649> yeah<00:01:48.009> there's

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
two tabs it just clipping yeah there's

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.830 
two tabs it just clipping yeah there's
another<00:01:48.700> tab<00:01:48.940> on<00:01:49.149> anything

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
another tab on anything

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.330 
another tab on anything
the<00:01:50.050> only<00:01:50.170> net<00:01:50.409> one<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:50.770> that's<00:01:50.920> how<00:01:51.070> it<00:01:51.130> views

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
the only net one and that's how it views

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.279 
the only net one and that's how it views
on<00:01:51.580> with<00:01:51.729> saina<00:01:51.970> over<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.450> yep

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
on with saina over the yep

to discus yeah if you can't discuss with

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.969 
to discus yeah if you can't discuss with
this<00:01:58.030> tablet<00:01:58.270> just<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.720> me<00:01:58.840> Turkey<00:01:59.110> s<00:01:59.800> you

this tablet just a me Turkey s you

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.130 
this tablet just a me Turkey s you
release<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.310> does<00:02:00.850> that<00:02:01.090> yeah<00:02:01.270> yeah<00:02:01.810> straight

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
release it does that yeah yeah straight

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.270 
release it does that yeah yeah straight
down<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.470> other<00:02:02.619> ground

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
down the other ground

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.330 
down the other ground
so<00:02:03.970> normal<00:02:04.450> tail<00:02:04.660> straight<00:02:05.259> up<00:02:05.440> but<00:02:06.009> I<00:02:06.100> found

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
so normal tail straight up but I found

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.509 
so normal tail straight up but I found
in<00:02:06.550> them<00:02:06.960> five<00:02:07.960> complete<00:02:08.320> singers<00:02:08.679> flat

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.520

because the contrary minor yeah I
suppose<00:02:14.739> again<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.220> see<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.430> with<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.790> do<00:02:16.000> GE

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
suppose again you see it with the do GE

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.150 
suppose again you see it with the do GE
inertia<00:02:16.840> thing<00:02:17.260> again<00:02:17.530> isn't<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:17.950> can't

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
inertia thing again isn't it you can't

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.059 
inertia thing again isn't it you can't
get<00:02:18.280> enough<00:02:18.489> energy<00:02:18.970> into<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.440> get<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.920> out

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
get enough energy into it to get it out

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:31.880 
get enough energy into it to get it out
there<00:02:21.930> yeah<00:02:22.930> yeah

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.770 

this<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.010> finicky<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.700> get<00:02:33.939> these<00:02:34.060> all<00:02:34.599> these

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
this is finicky to get these all these

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.720 
this is finicky to get these all these
little<00:02:34.870> cuts<00:02:35.200> just<00:02:35.500> right<00:02:35.709> yeah<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:36.459> right

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
little cuts just right yeah this right

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.459 
little cuts just right yeah this right
then<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.329> all<00:02:37.450> goes<00:02:37.629> together<00:02:37.840> beautiful

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:38.469 
then it all goes together beautiful

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.470 
then it all goes together beautiful
that's<00:02:38.950> why<00:02:39.069> my<00:02:39.219> first<00:02:39.489> attempt<00:02:39.819> wasn't<00:02:40.209> great

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
that's why my first attempt wasn't great

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.910 
that's why my first attempt wasn't great
my<00:02:40.689> next<00:02:40.959> attempt<00:02:41.200> was<00:02:41.349> better<00:02:41.560> because<00:02:41.859> the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
my next attempt was better because the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.699 
my next attempt was better because the
first<00:02:42.129> one<00:02:42.280> ozone<00:02:42.629> into<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.959> first<00:02:44.230> one<00:02:44.409> yeah

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
first one ozone into the first one yeah

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.190 
first one ozone into the first one yeah
you<00:02:44.950> could<00:02:45.129> use<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.370> few<00:02:45.639> CC<00:02:46.060> beaters<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:47.049> can

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
you could use a few CC beaters you can

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.869 
you could use a few CC beaters you can
get<00:02:47.319> all<00:02:47.469> the<00:02:47.590> tracks<00:02:47.859> so<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.370> can<00:02:48.489> shorten
