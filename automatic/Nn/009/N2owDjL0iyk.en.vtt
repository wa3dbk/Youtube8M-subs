today kids as always go after proper

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.240 
today kids as always go after proper
programming<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.570> wasn't<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.530> smartest<00:01:16.830> idea

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
programming so wasn't the smartest idea

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.789 
programming so wasn't the smartest idea
my<00:01:17.520> part<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.090> basically<00:01:18.750> thought<00:01:19.290> about<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.740> in

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
have thought about the consequences that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.380 
have thought about the consequences that
what<00:01:26.189> would<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.490> happened<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> my<00:01:27.000> overhead

today<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> lower<00:01:39.930> volume<00:01:40.259> day<00:01:40.710> I'm<00:01:40.950> keeping

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
