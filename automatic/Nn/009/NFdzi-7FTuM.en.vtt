00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.910
 in this video I will show you 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.450
 how can you save yourself in a 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.970
 evening 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.910
 when you meet 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.470
 driver and who has two guitars in the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.440
 evening that tells you not well we play a 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.910
 piece and there you do not know what to play 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.250
 so I'll show you 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.160
 the concatenation of three agreements that goes 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:37.470
 able to allow you to pull yourself out of 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.470
 this impasse then the minor 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.899
 but minor 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.800
 E major 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.970
 and the minor 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.130
 we will have some subtleties in the 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:58.020
 turn we will add to the 7th and friends 7th 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.520
 they are really not complicated to do 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.410
 you're going to see we're not going to take the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.860
 head with the sevenths explain to you 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.810
 all this I put the diagrams on your side 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.850
 of the video show you how one 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.740
 place your fingers but you will see 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.540
 it's really really pretty 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.560
 instinctive 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.900
 for people who are not comfortable with 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.720
 the bars and I will show you too 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.590
 how we did it with the agreements 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.270
 just down the neck so I'm getting 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.310
 to turn to show you well 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.310
 how it works 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.360
 at 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.580
 e 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.590
 e 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.940
 1 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.440
 that's where you got two turns 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:45.090
 I showed you at the moment actually on 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.959
 the screen as we went to 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.580
 seventh there is just one finger moving and 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.250
 you 're going to do your corsept so 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.290
 that's wonderful 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.410
 at the level of people who are uncomfortable 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.730
 with chords bar you go 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.750
 redo these agreements simply here 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.750
 so that's it 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.980
 with this piece your compatriot 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.320
 guitarist can do solos 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.970
 beautiful above and more is a 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.470
 melody that pleases people enough 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.470
 that's all for this video
