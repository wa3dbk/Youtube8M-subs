00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.730
 hi this is the tutorial to make the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.790
 your personal harry wand 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:13.759
 potter the material you need 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:17.550
 will be normal a4 sheets of the printer 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:23.100
 hot glue vinyl glue with 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.960
 refill tempera watercolors brushes for 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.300
 you will need the decoration 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.099
 pebbles to put on top of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.809
 nozzle and then various things like beads 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:38.480
 glitter shells colored ribbons 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.480
 wire and everything you want 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.210
 then to make the phase of ours 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.360
 wand or the body of the 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.210
 wand we have to explain the sheet in 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.350
 this way not just a sheet corner 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.629
 and begin to roll a lot with 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.239
 calm is a difficult job was 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.630
 complicated even if it doesn't seem there 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.020
 will take away the soul and the wand must 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.540
 remain a must have a finer tip 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.190
 and on this side it will have to be a little 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.899
 more or less wider than the size 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.899
 of the stone that we will then put on top 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.930
 ok then you will come to this point in 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.270
 which your package will have to be more 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.180
 or less so and you have to be careful that 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:37.929
 be tight at this point we must 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:47.860
 take the vinyl glue maybe 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:53.990
 open it first and put it here ok 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:02:04.570
 and we always paste carefully 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:07.869
 because it unrolls I recommend ok 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.630
 you have to keep a little because it sticks 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:16.300
 do not worry if they are formed 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.300
 wrinkles because of the effect of wood 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.230
 ok you will get to have this wand 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.030
 made so that it is quite rigid if 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.500
 it was not easy because in the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.150
 second time I only do it now 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.750
 it was good for me 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.850
 inside it is made this way if it were to 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.830
 be too soft you can take 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.010
 pieces of paper slip them in inside 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.010
 so as to strengthen it within this 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.170
 point let's take the scissors we stretch 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.140
 the last piece 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.200
 in this way so as to have the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.570
 our wand made this way 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.580
 point take the glue gun a 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.320
 warm and charge it so that 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.150
 you are fine and then we'll see what to do 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.670
 Once you have your wand 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.040
 done in this way, take the gun 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.690
 hot glue without burning them for that 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.070
 it is hot and you have to fill it with glue 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.050
 the inside of the wand up more or 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.440
 less at this height or 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:24.230
 the handle of the wand the glue a 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:27.290
 warm serves to reinforce if you don't have 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.900
 hot glue to reinforce 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:36.110
 you can still use cardboard that 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:40.730
 it will work as a reinforcer and a paste 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.489
 warm also serves to secure the la 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.500
 stone so always if you don't have the 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:50.120
 with cada you will have to use a linen circle 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.340
 of cardboard to fix well in order to 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.510
 can fix then think about it with the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.510
 vinyl glue the skin 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.330
 ok you will come to have this then 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.320
 very gently because you burn yourself 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.120
 put the stone on top and keep a little 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.800
 meanwhile take with the hot glue 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.210
 more or less the size of your hand 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:17.410
 up to here and make a linen circle 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:22.090
 around the stick more or less straight 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:27.200
 so that it will then mark the point where 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:29.150
 you will go the handle you can do also 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.830
 more than a linen circle as well as me 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.080
 I'll show you how I did it on the other 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.300
 stick in order to also mark the 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.620
 fingers then took your fancy with the 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.880
 in the case you can do all the 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:44.030
 decorations you want and even spirals e 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.070
 various things without letting it spin too much 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.410
 ok at this point we have the structure 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.720
 of our wand it should 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.610
 be well reinforced here with the glue a 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.920
 hot indeed you see beautiful hard not you 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.690
 crush if you want you can also put 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.490
 a little hot glue in the tip like that 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.750
 to stay to make it stay a little longer 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.030
 rigid 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.460
 so now we can color it and us 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.260
 we will make it a beautiful rose because 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.840
 we have all the rof beads so today 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.820
 we like it pink so take some 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.320
 tempera of the color you want you can 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.889
 mix all the colors you want 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.409
 you can do whatever you want 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:21.610
 the water and we begin to paint the 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:24.330
 our wand that duly gives it to him 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.330
 launched 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.880
 at this point we have ours 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.610
 fully colored package with the 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.700
 temper more layers several times more 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.040
 better layers you will stay and yes 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.900
 they will see some kind of veins like 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.820
 if they were the grain of the wood 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.570
 especially if you leave a lot 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:56.180
 dry while the tempera dries you 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.800
 you can decide how to decorate it 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.650
 different ways 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.610
 you can indulge your imagination 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.500
 we will put glitter into powder 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.060
 then we will spread the wand with the 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.800
 vinyl glue therefore we will attack i 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.930
 glitter that as you see is a lot 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:18.740
 fine like janis points out dust of 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.540
 Fairy you can put we have done 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.880
 also this thread made with the thread of 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.180
 iron on which we put beads 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.980
 obviously pink if not there are a lot 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.960
 of things you can put like these 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.910
 fantastic feathers or of the 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.460
 shells to always stick with the 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.490
 various vinyl glue beads also ad 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.390
 stick on the wand's body 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.790
 but the part that will have to be 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.160
 the handle will be mainly decorated 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.820
 on the handle you can also put gods 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.530
 colored ribbons always attached with the 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.500
 vinyl glue as it was made 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.410
 on this wand that will stay close to you 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.690
 merciless so we see it from afar e 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.700
 also on this stick you can see 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:02.960
 how there are the glue marks a 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:05.060
 warm for the finger grip la 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.220
 our wand is now covered with 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.830
 fairy dust and is beautiful full of 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.270
 glitter as you can see attached 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.440
 with vinyl glue that soon 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.650
 will become transparent 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.450
 so now we will proceed to decorate the 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.020
 handle hoping not to do too much damage 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:23.500
 was of glitter with this fantastic 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.500
 beaded thread 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.100
 this is our completed wand 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.830
 we hope you enjoyed the tutorial 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.540
 and that breathing is understandable is a 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.340
 work quite easy to do there 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.100
 it wants relatively little about one 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.290
 around twenty 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.860
 in last born to the drying of the di 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:42.810
 all things and do it try to do the 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.060
 your wand send us the photo that 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:47.210
 we will then publish on the page bye 

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.210
 Hello
