00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.030 

we're<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.650> have<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.800> look<00:00:01.920> at

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
we're going to have a look at

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.450 
we're going to have a look at
diffraction<00:00:02.909> here<00:00:03.770> the<00:00:04.770> fraction<00:00:05.160> hopefully

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
diffraction here the fraction hopefully

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.820 
diffraction here the fraction hopefully
you<00:00:05.549> learned<00:00:05.990> and<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.230> hope<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.560> looked<00:00:07.740> at

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
you learned and you hope you looked at

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.500 
you learned and you hope you looked at
video<00:00:08.069> we've<00:00:08.250> talked<00:00:08.490> about<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.760> whole<00:00:08.910> point

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
video we've talked about the whole point

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.570 
video we've talked about the whole point
of<00:00:09.630> view<00:00:09.780> with<00:00:09.990> wavelengths<00:00:10.769> relating<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.400> gap

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
of view with wavelengths relating to gap

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.940 
of view with wavelengths relating to gap
size<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.780> normally<00:00:13.259> you've<00:00:13.349> got<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> gap<00:00:13.769> of

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
size so normally you've got a gap of

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.550 
size so normally you've got a gap of
some<00:00:14.160> sort<00:00:14.450> sometimes<00:00:15.450> two<00:00:15.630> gaps<00:00:15.900> sometimes

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
some sort sometimes two gaps sometimes

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.490 
some sort sometimes two gaps sometimes
heaps<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.920> gaps<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:18.779> waves<00:00:19.020> coming

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
heaps of gaps and you have waves coming

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.679 
heaps of gaps and you have waves coming
through<00:00:19.770> whether<00:00:20.550> they<00:00:20.730> be<00:00:20.880> light<00:00:21.060> waves<00:00:21.330> or

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
through whether they be light waves or

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.450 
through whether they be light waves or
water<00:00:22.410> waves<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:24.140> if<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.410> gap<00:00:25.740> size<00:00:26.039> is

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
water waves and if the gap size is

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.460 
water waves and if the gap size is
comparable<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.240> wavelength<00:00:27.330> sighs<00:00:27.990> we're

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
comparable to the wavelength sighs we're

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.959 
comparable to the wavelength sighs we're
gonna<00:00:28.619> get<00:00:28.830> diffraction<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:31.669> we<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
gonna get diffraction and we have to

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.380 
gonna get diffraction and we have to
treat<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.600> gaps<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:35.489> they<00:00:35.880> are<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.090> source

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
treat the gaps as if they are a source

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.569 
treat the gaps as if they are a source
for<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> wave<00:00:37.290> which<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.829> what<00:00:38.129> happens<00:00:38.430> at

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
for the wave which is what happens at

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.760 
for the wave which is what happens at
any<00:00:38.670> point<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.329> time<00:00:39.360> anywhere<00:00:40.260> along<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> wave

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
any point in time anywhere along a wave

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.459 
any point in time anywhere along a wave
each<00:00:41.489> particle<00:00:42.270> nutria<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.989> acting<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.440> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
each particle nutria is acting as a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.299 
each particle nutria is acting as a
source<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.010> new<00:00:44.219> source<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.760> wave<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
source and new source for the wave and

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.979 
source and new source for the wave and
generating<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.430> wave<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
generating that wave so with the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.250 
generating that wave so with the
fraction<00:00:49.469> what<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.739> are<00:00:49.829> seeing<00:00:50.070> is

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
fraction what we are seeing is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.529 
fraction what we are seeing is
interference<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.670> want<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.149> so

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
interference and what we want to see so

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.360 
interference and what we want to see so
with<00:00:54.780> two<00:00:55.020> sources<00:00:56.090> here<00:00:57.140> over<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.410> we're

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
with two sources here over here we're

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.880 
with two sources here over here we're
gonna<00:00:59.520> get<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:01.140> two<00:01:01.320> ways<00:01:01.530> will<00:01:01.800> have

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
gonna get the two ways will have

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.520 
gonna get the two ways will have
traveled<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.280> same<00:01:02.460> distance<00:01:03.049> same<00:01:04.049> distance

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
traveled the same distance same distance

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.990 
traveled the same distance same distance
if<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.920> phase<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.460> traveled<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
if they are in phase here traveled the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.550 
if they are in phase here traveled the
same<00:01:06.150> distance<00:01:06.630> they're<00:01:06.810> still<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.140> phase<00:01:07.350> so

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
same distance they're still in phase so

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.490 
same distance they're still in phase so
you're<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.979> maximum<00:01:08.780> all<00:01:09.780> right<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
you're gonna get a maximum all right the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.410 
you're gonna get a maximum all right the
central<00:01:10.860> maximum<00:01:11.280> sometimes<00:01:12.150> these<00:01:12.270> are

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
central maximum sometimes these are

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.240 
central maximum sometimes these are
called<00:01:12.570> fringes<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.680> light<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.130> that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
called fringes and if it's light in that

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.950 
called fringes and if it's light in that
that<00:01:14.340> would<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> bright<00:01:14.790> fringe<00:01:15.060> whereas<00:01:15.840> up

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that would be a bright fringe whereas up

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.539 
that would be a bright fringe whereas up
here<00:01:16.640> okay<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.689> travels<00:01:19.680> further<00:01:20.009> than

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
here okay this one travels further than

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.390 
here okay this one travels further than
this<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:22.200> they<00:01:22.320> started<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> face<00:01:23.159> but

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
this one so they started in the face but

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.160 
this one so they started in the face but
the<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:23.580> that's<00:01:23.670> traveled<00:01:24.060> further<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.080> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the one that's traveled further is in a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.260 
the one that's traveled further is in a
different<00:01:25.500> face<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.520> they<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.790> half<00:01:27.119> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
different face and when they get half a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.630 
different face and when they get half a
wavelength<00:01:27.509> difference<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.860> distance<00:01:29.490> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
wavelength difference and distance that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.969 
wavelength difference and distance that
they've<00:01:29.790> traveled<00:01:30.229> they're<00:01:31.229> half<00:01:31.439> wavelength

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
they've traveled they're half wavelength

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.819 
they've traveled they're half wavelength
out<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.250> phase<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:34.470> they're<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.770> to

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
out of phase and so they're going to

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.890 
out of phase and so they're going to
destructively<00:01:35.490> interfere<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.659> get<00:01:36.810> them

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
destructively interfere and you get them

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.929 
destructively interfere and you get them
getting<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.290> minimum<00:01:37.680> there<00:01:37.890> same<00:01:38.520> over<00:01:38.759> here

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
getting a minimum there same over here

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.690 
getting a minimum there same over here
because<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> same<00:01:39.420> situation<00:01:39.900> applies<00:01:40.700> so

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
because the same situation applies so

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.370 
because the same situation applies so
this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.000> interference<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.990> would<00:01:43.229> create

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
this is interference this would create

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.219 
this is interference this would create
the<00:01:43.619> young<00:01:43.829> slits<00:01:44.750> pattern<00:01:45.750> when<00:01:45.899> you've<00:01:46.049> got

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the young slits pattern when you've got

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.149 
the young slits pattern when you've got
a<00:01:46.259> bright<00:01:46.530> maximum<00:01:47.220> dark<00:01:47.939> bands<00:01:48.450> right<00:01:49.159> that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
a bright maximum dark bands right that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.039 
a bright maximum dark bands right that
sort<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.490> thing<00:01:50.670> now<00:01:51.240> one<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> issues<00:01:51.810> that

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
sort of thing now one of the issues that

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.080 
sort of thing now one of the issues that
happens<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.680> all<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.189> when<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
happens with all this is when you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.399 
happens with all this is when you
actually<00:01:54.210> get<00:01:55.130> light<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.520> white<00:01:57.270> light<00:01:57.600> right

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
actually get light or white light right

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.410 
actually get light or white light right
so<00:01:59.399> you've<00:01:59.549> got<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:03.030> you've<00:02:03.240> got

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
so you've got you and you've got

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.130 
so you've got you and you've got
your<00:02:04.250> thing<00:02:05.250> over<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:05.689> you<00:02:06.689> know<00:02:06.810> with<00:02:06.930> white

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
your thing over here you know with white

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.540 
your thing over here you know with white
light<00:02:07.350> you're<00:02:07.950> still<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.310> get<00:02:08.429> their

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
light you're still going to get their

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.880 
light you're still going to get their
central<00:02:08.879> bright<00:02:09.000> maximum<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.649> talked

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
central bright maximum but we talked

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.950 
central bright maximum but we talked
about<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.190> fact<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:12.150> distance<00:02:12.629> for

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
about the fact that the distance for

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.650 
about the fact that the distance for
one<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.140> them<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.350> travel<00:02:13.760> might<00:02:14.760> be<00:02:14.940> half<00:02:15.510> a

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
one of them to travel might be half a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.330 
one of them to travel might be half a
wavelength<00:02:15.890> difference<00:02:17.240> but<00:02:18.240> blue<00:02:19.220> has<00:02:20.220> a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
wavelength difference but blue has a

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.810 
wavelength difference but blue has a
wavelength<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.970> about<00:02:21.060> 400<00:02:21.750> nanometers<00:02:22.260> and

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
wavelength of about 400 nanometers and

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.180 
wavelength of about 400 nanometers and
Ridge<00:02:23.820> has<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.660> wavelength<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.200> about<00:02:25.470> 600

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
Ridge has a wavelength of about 600

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.170 
Ridge has a wavelength of about 600
enemies<00:02:26.630> right<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:28.680> half<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.070> wavelength<00:02:29.340> for

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
enemies right so half a wavelength for

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.390 
enemies right so half a wavelength for
blue<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.960> smaller<00:02:31.350> distance<00:02:31.710> than<00:02:32.010> half<00:02:32.310> a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
blue is a smaller distance than half a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.060 
blue is a smaller distance than half a
wavelength<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:33.000> red<00:02:33.380> so<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.500> blue<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:34.740> gonna

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
wavelength for red so the blue is gonna

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.260 
wavelength for red so the blue is gonna
get<00:02:35.280> it's<00:02:37.370> it's<00:02:38.370> gonna<00:02:38.550> be<00:02:38.760> half<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.090> wavelength

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
get it's it's gonna be half a wavelength

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.970 
get it's it's gonna be half a wavelength
different<00:02:39.840> before<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.290> other<00:02:40.440> one<00:02:40.590> well

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
different before the other one well

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.140 
different before the other one well
you're<00:02:41.070> not<00:02:41.130> really<00:02:41.250> caring<00:02:41.670> about<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:42.000> but

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
you're not really caring about that but

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.610 
you're not really caring about that but
what<00:02:42.330> about<00:02:42.390> really<00:02:42.900> one<00:02:43.290> wavelength

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
what about really one wavelength

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.460 
what about really one wavelength
difference<00:02:44.310> where<00:02:44.430> they<00:02:44.520> combine<00:02:44.730> again<00:02:45.470> okay

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
difference where they combine again okay

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.930 
difference where they combine again okay
where<00:02:46.680> they<00:02:46.770> combine<00:02:46.950> again<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.700> we're<00:02:47.850> there

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
where they combine again so we're there

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.400 
where they combine again so we're there
one<00:02:48.090> wavelength<00:02:48.540> difference<00:02:48.720> they're<00:02:49.140> in

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
one wavelength difference they're in

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.010 
one wavelength difference they're in
phase<00:02:50.010> again<00:02:50.250> now<00:02:51.090> they're<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.420> phase<00:02:51.720> again

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
phase again now they're in phase again

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.800 
phase again now they're in phase again
one<00:02:52.980> wavelength<00:02:53.250> different<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.480> there<00:02:54.660> would

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
one wavelength different so there would

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.480 
one wavelength different so there would
have<00:02:54.870> been<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.230> half<00:02:55.530> wavelength<00:02:56.040> you

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
have been the half wavelength you

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.680 
have been the half wavelength you
wouldn't<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:56.760> seen<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.180> one<00:02:57.420> wavelength

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
wouldn't have seen it but one wavelength

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.130 
wouldn't have seen it but one wavelength
difference<00:02:58.820> for<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.940> blue<00:03:00.120> will<00:03:00.780> happen

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
difference for the blue will happen

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.860 
difference for the blue will happen
before<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:02.070> will<00:03:02.220> happen<00:03:02.370> for<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.730> red<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.810> it

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
before it will happen for the red so it

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.970 
before it will happen for the red so it
could<00:03:04.080> have<00:03:04.230> red<00:03:04.650> there<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.630> blue<00:03:06.630> there<00:03:07.020> and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
could have red there and blue there and

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.710 
could have red there and blue there and
obviously<00:03:08.310> green<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.850> middle<00:03:09.090> so

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
obviously green in the middle so

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.690 
obviously green in the middle so
diffraction<00:03:10.290> grating<00:03:10.650> will<00:03:10.920> split<00:03:11.220> up<00:03:11.370> white

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
diffraction grating will split up white

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.370 
diffraction grating will split up white
light<00:03:11.970> into<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.480> three<00:03:12.660> colors<00:03:12.990> just<00:03:13.200> like<00:03:13.350> a

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
light into the three colors just like a

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.100 
light into the three colors just like a
prism<00:03:13.860> one<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.450> you'll<00:03:15.450> get<00:03:15.600> this<00:03:15.780> little

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
prism one and you'll get this little

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.070 
prism one and you'll get this little
patch<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.740> first-order<00:03:17.580> colors<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.960> then

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
patch of first-order colors and then

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.390 
patch of first-order colors and then
you'll<00:03:19.200> get<00:03:19.320> another<00:03:19.590> little<00:03:19.890> patch<00:03:20.070> here

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
you'll get another little patch here

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.000 
you'll get another little patch here
again<00:03:20.760> we've<00:03:21.540> got<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.410> blue<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.800> now<00:03:22.950> two

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
again we've got the blue is now two

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.770 
again we've got the blue is now two
wavelength<00:03:23.730> differences<00:03:24.270> and<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.630> read

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
wavelength differences and the read

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.360 
wavelength differences and the read
would<00:03:24.990> be<00:03:25.110> two<00:03:25.290> wavelengths<00:03:25.530> differences<00:03:26.220> up

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
would be two wavelengths differences up

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.640 
would be two wavelengths differences up
there<00:03:26.520> so<00:03:27.450> this<00:03:27.570> what<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.810> diffraction<00:03:28.170> grating

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
there so this what a diffraction grating

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.280 
there so this what a diffraction grating
can<00:03:29.040> do<00:03:29.420> now<00:03:31.520> the<00:03:32.520> thing<00:03:32.670> about<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:33.000> fraction

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
can do now the thing about the fraction

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.230 
can do now the thing about the fraction
is<00:03:35.450> well<00:03:36.450> look<00:03:36.660> at<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.840> formula<00:03:37.290> for<00:03:39.650> two<00:03:40.650> gaps

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
is well look at a formula for two gaps

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.120 
is well look at a formula for two gaps
and<00:03:42.240> will<00:03:42.750> come<00:03:42.900> up<00:03:43.020> with<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.200> formula<00:03:43.320> that's

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
and will come up with a formula that's

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.180 
and will come up with a formula that's
young<00:03:45.410> look<00:03:46.410> at<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.620> little<00:03:46.830> video<00:03:47.010> on

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
young look at the little video on

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.160 
young look at the little video on
it<00:03:47.370> you've<00:03:47.670> got<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:47.970> understand<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.540> formula

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
it you've got to understand that formula

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.280 
it you've got to understand that formula
that<00:03:49.440> formula<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:50.100> an<00:03:50.250> approximation<00:03:51.290> where

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
that formula is an approximation where

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.980 
that formula is an approximation where
you've<00:03:52.500> got<00:03:52.740> a<00:03:52.950> grating<00:03:53.490> that<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.720> it's<00:03:54.900> not

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
you've got a grating that so it's not

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.950 
you've got a grating that so it's not
like<00:03:55.140> we've<00:03:55.560> got<00:03:55.830> a<00:03:55.860> grating<00:03:56.400> with<00:03:56.910> lots<00:03:57.660> and

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
like we've got a grating with lots and

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.710 
like we've got a grating with lots and
lots<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.320> equally<00:03:58.680> spaced<00:03:59.010> slits<00:03:59.490> it's<00:04:00.450> called

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
lots of equally spaced slits it's called

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.770 
lots of equally spaced slits it's called
a<00:04:00.810> diffraction<00:04:01.170> grating<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.480> I'll<00:04:03.480> show<00:04:03.720> it

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
a diffraction grating and I'll show it

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.000 
a diffraction grating and I'll show it
to<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.960> in<00:04:04.050> class<00:04:04.230> with<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.530> ladies<00:04:04.770> are<00:04:04.920> and

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
to you in class with the ladies are and

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.930 
to you in class with the ladies are and
things<00:04:05.190> like<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.400> with<00:04:06.330> that<00:04:07.730> again<00:04:08.730> you've

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
things like that with that again you've

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.820 
things like that with that again you've
got<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.180> same<00:04:09.360> principle<00:04:09.930> at<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:10.380> certain

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
got the same principle at a certain

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.070 
got the same principle at a certain
angle<00:04:10.980> if<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:12.000> shine<00:04:12.240> light<00:04:12.300> light<00:04:12.840> there

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
angle if you shine light light there

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.800 
angle if you shine light light there
you're<00:04:13.710> gonna<00:04:13.860> get<00:04:14.540> one<00:04:15.540> wavelength

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
you're gonna get one wavelength

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.870 
you're gonna get one wavelength
difference<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.650> that's<00:04:17.160> going<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.489> give<00:04:17.640> you

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
difference and that's going to give you

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.849 
difference and that's going to give you
a<00:04:18.090> bright<00:04:18.900> construct<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.560> course<00:04:19.770> you're

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
a bright construct of course you're

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:20.900 
a bright construct of course you're
gonna<00:04:19.950> get<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.190> bright<00:04:20.370> one<00:04:20.520> in<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.700> middle

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
gonna get the bright one in the middle

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.909 
gonna get the bright one in the middle
but<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.660> would<00:04:21.780> get<00:04:21.960> so<00:04:22.350> if<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:22.560> was<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.710> red

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
but you would get so if this was a red

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.830 
but you would get so if this was a red
laser<00:04:23.100> one<00:04:23.700> wavelength<00:04:24.000> difference<00:04:24.360> then<00:04:24.780> you

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
laser one wavelength difference then you

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.250 
laser one wavelength difference then you
get<00:04:24.960> another<00:04:25.050> light<00:04:25.380> over<00:04:25.590> there<00:04:25.710> too

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
get another light over there too

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.780 
get another light over there too
link's<00:04:26.500> differences<00:04:27.010> would<00:04:27.460> we<00:04:27.580> hit<00:04:27.670> them

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
link's differences would we hit them

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.270 
link's differences would we hit them
down<00:04:27.970> here<00:04:28.210> too<00:04:28.420> and<00:04:28.920> we'll<00:04:29.920> work<00:04:30.070> out<00:04:30.250> a

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
down here too and we'll work out a

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.950 
down here too and we'll work out a
formula<00:04:30.580> for<00:04:30.790> that<00:04:30.850> if<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.480> then<00:04:31.630> shine<00:04:31.930> a

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
formula for that if you then shine a

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.740 
formula for that if you then shine a
blue<00:04:32.290> laser<00:04:32.530> for<00:04:32.950> if<00:04:33.010> these<00:04:33.190> were<00:04:33.340> red<00:04:33.750> ones

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
blue laser for if these were red ones

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.690 
blue laser for if these were red ones
with<00:04:35.320> in<00:04:35.440> big<00:04:35.680> bigger<00:04:36.040> wavelength<00:04:36.490> so<00:04:36.580> if<00:04:36.640> I

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
with in big bigger wavelength so if I

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.850 
with in big bigger wavelength so if I
now<00:04:36.850> shown<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:37.150> blue<00:04:37.390> laser<00:04:37.600> through<00:04:37.900> I'd<00:04:38.500> get<00:04:38.830> a

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
now shown a blue laser through I'd get a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.490 
now shown a blue laser through I'd get a
blue<00:04:39.190> about<00:04:39.730> their<00:04:39.970> blue<00:04:40.510> about<00:04:40.900> there<00:04:41.200> then

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
blue about their blue about there then

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.000 
blue about their blue about there then
there'll<00:04:41.650> be<00:04:41.680> another<00:04:42.040> blue<00:04:42.310> about<00:04:42.670> here<00:04:43.000> and

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
there'll be another blue about here and

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.950 
there'll be another blue about here and
these<00:04:45.010> guys<00:04:45.070> would<00:04:45.520> people<00:04:45.820> oh<00:04:45.880> that's<00:04:46.780> the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
these guys would people oh that's the

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.480 
these guys would people oh that's the
second<00:04:47.260> order<00:04:47.470> blue<00:04:47.620> just<00:04:47.830> coming<00:04:48.130> after<00:04:48.250> the

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
second order blue just coming after the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.760 
second order blue just coming after the
first<00:04:48.670> order<00:04:49.000> red<00:04:49.150> so<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.080> friction<00:04:50.440> grading

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
first order red so the friction grading

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.060 
first order red so the friction grading
will<00:04:50.890> split<00:04:51.190> up<00:04:51.540> light<00:04:52.540> and<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.470> distance<00:04:53.890> to

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
will split up light and the distance to

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.250 
will split up light and the distance to
these<00:04:54.480> maximums<00:04:55.480> one<00:04:55.780> way<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.110> links

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
these maximums one way the links

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.780 
these maximums one way the links
difference<00:04:56.590> depends<00:04:56.980> on<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.190> wavelength<00:04:57.340> and

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
difference depends on the wavelength and

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.820 
difference depends on the wavelength and
we'll<00:04:58.060> see<00:04:58.210> that<00:04:58.240> with<00:04:58.480> our<00:04:58.600> formula<00:04:58.990> so

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
we'll see that with our formula so

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.350 
we'll see that with our formula so
understanding<00:05:00.670> diffraction<00:05:01.180> and

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
understanding diffraction and

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.850 
understanding diffraction and
understanding<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.170> formula<00:05:02.620> quite

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
understanding the formula quite

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.500 
understanding the formula quite
important<00:05:03.340> but<00:05:03.580> these<00:05:03.760> are<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.000> principles

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
important but these are the principles

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.260 
important but these are the principles
upon<00:05:04.630> which<00:05:04.810> are<00:05:05.020> placed
