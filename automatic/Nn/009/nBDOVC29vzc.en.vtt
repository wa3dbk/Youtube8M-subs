00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.240
 I rested I heard you say you wanted 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.580
 beat the neighboring champion myself upon hearing that 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.260
 I got up and nodded with a big smile 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.350

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.930
 pokemon adventure 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.450

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.670
 professor serral would give you the pokédex and you 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.670
 I would teach the basic things when 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.280
 we went into the 202 contactor and there it was 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.350
 lion explained how to capture pokémons and you 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.810
 you challenged him to a fight that 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.090
 He shrugged and nodded. 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.370
 hard fight although I had the advantage the 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.650
 only attack that I knew was erect but 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.930
 yet you believed in me when I was 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.880
 point to weaken me my coach me 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.950
 He said he will apply other razor me 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.900
 I got to use that attack I had 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.030
 learned thanks to the encouragement of my 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.750
 coach with that alone is enough for me 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.670
 weaken vi clone lion I congratulate you and 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.590

 hug me and congratulate me with my new 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.320
 achievement 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.420
 after that battle we follow our 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.120
 trip and we arrived at jubilee city you 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.549
 team already had 2 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.799
 me using salt that you put him in the bush 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.870
 max wright I was kind of jealous because 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.209
 now you also paid attention to 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.220
 him but it happened to me soon a man you 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.290
 he said a kind of promotion of something 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.060
 called because watch you accept it and 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.340
 now you had a little clock when 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.799
 we left the center pokemon stopped us a 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.900
 boy named marcos asked us for a fight 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.000
 since he told us that he wanted to become 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.380
 the best coach you accepted 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.470
 You took me out first but he had 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.810
 a chinchar the price easily you took 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.520
 to max king thanks to him you won me 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.860
 I felt inferior while you 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.200
 congratulated but you saw me and you told me 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.450
 that had improved a lot that encouraged me 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.610
 after that battle we headed to town 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.290
 pyrite where we would have our first 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.220
 battle against an invasion attempt 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.220
 now it was 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.160
 heron a weird mote when we arrived 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.410
 Tuesday was waiting for us there to 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.900
 have another pokemon battle this time you 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.150
 you denied something strange in you and you get in 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.610
 the gym you were electro leader and what 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.070
 challenge sta 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.230
 as I expected the leader accept me 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.690
 You took the first one because it had the advantage 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.790
 about his rock-like pokémons still 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.740
 It cost me a lot to win but you encouraged me 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.900
 if that gave me strength when finally 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.240
 win you told me I had learned a 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.549
 new attack called energy ball I set myself 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.310
 to jump like crazy when we go out frames 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.350
 he challenged us again this time you accepted me 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.140
 I thought that now with energy ball I would have 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.300
 more opportunities to win but not this 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.310
 it could not be his chinchar now it was a 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.560
 modern I used in the turn the 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.230
 against him but it barely hurt him 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.320
 monter did not use embers that left me very 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.930
 wrong but when I thought it would weaken me 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.330
 I covered myself with a white light and evolved 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.640
 thanks to that evolution I learned slammed 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.740
 thanks to that since with luck I got 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.960
 dodge all your attacks win not me 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.640
 I could believe I was now a big one of my 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.440
 comrades congratulated me and my 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.540
 coach was the one who proudest 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.639
 he was hugging me and he took me to the center 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.529
 pokemon there my coach told me 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.299
 congratulations now you are an oak you are 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:03.549
 much stronger than when I met you 

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:06.039

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:08.139

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.460
 When I heard that, I missed 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.680
 tears because every coach that I 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.330
 I chose to change for another 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.370
 and that's why I just trusted the 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.349
 serbian teacher but now I had you 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.569
 towards my best and only friend when I 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:28.090
 recover we went to the village aroma 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:30.009
 good flower you can imagine how is my 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.530
 story so let's go to what really 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.840
 important gym after gym 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.780
 we got eight medals your team 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.500
 it was already formed by jon max king letter 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.500
 quiet 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.380
 that's where everything changes where it stops 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.540
 trust in humans an older man 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.610
 which offered a high-tech artecinema 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.430
 level in exchange for any pokemon 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.620
 I was surprised who would do that and I thought 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.480
 it was a trap but when he pulled it out 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.190
 He knew what ball he stared at me with 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.320
 a look of contempt 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.390
 I returned the look you accepted the 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.550
 offer and you saw a magical man 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.950
 she accepted there magic and went down the street 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.290
 victory I missed me since we were six 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.790
 what would you do with that charizar in that 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.250
 moment you stayed looking at me 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.470
 incorporating I thought it would be a mom 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.840
 because he was going to change me to his best 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.360
 friend 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.669
 with everything we had gone through because 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.980
 I was going to change because he had the advantage 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:25.780
 about me what nonsense then took out the 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.360
 char and ordered him to fight against 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.000
 me I was surprised seriously I was going to 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.560
 change can not believe it's amazing you will 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.810
 You ordered me to use flamethrower 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.970
 about me I dodged it and decided 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.370
 counterattack to show you that I was 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.500
 stronger than that impostor launch my web 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.400
 of leaves without having time to think 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.199
 he did nothing 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.870
 I use envite and neo and it left me fatal 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:49.060
 almost dead when from inside the forest 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.550
 appeared many initial pokémons of 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.450

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.400
 precocious vital boy even let be 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.470

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.510
 defend myself fiercely among all 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.639
 they managed to beat him after that my 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.220
 coach started yelling at me the pib 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:08.350
 you are weak without your friends you are not more 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.600
 that a weak pokemon to me was broken 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.370
 my heart to hear that so much that 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.289
 I got up and I got in front of him and I called 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.180
 my classmates they went out to 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:18.430
 defend him I told them I did not want to 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.620
 fight and they joined me they do not 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.260
 they heard I was forced to flee the most 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.900
 far possible 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.820
 since that day I am the protector of this 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.740

 coach I abandon them cruelly from 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.740
 so I do not have a better friend because of that 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:41.440

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.390
