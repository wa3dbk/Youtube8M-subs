00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:15.610
 the perspective is the way in how 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.480
 we arrange our objects in a 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.310
 space respecting those lines 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.480
 imaginary that are created 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.130
 on the horizon from a vanishing point 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:33.870
 clear always respecting 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.780
 to the observer that you are you is the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.190
 illustration is the drawing in general for 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.620
 understand the perspective let's see a 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.579
 small example of how we could draw 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.590
 an object with a vanishing point ok but 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.990
 what I'm going to explain right now is this 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.780
 we have 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.440
 the number one point that is this the point 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.480
 number one there is our first 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.140
 vanishing point where they will play many 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.630
 lines we have the number two and the number 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.640
 three we are going to support the number two and 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.600
 the number three which are other points of 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.290
 flight but so while we're not going to 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.620
 call vanishing point two vanishing points 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.159
 we are not going to do that 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.409
 ok let's start with an example 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.579
 we will draw a rectangle in any 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.520
 place after point number 1 that would be 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:34.149
 our main vanishing point we are going to 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.270
 take a few lines towards the corners of 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.630
 that rectangle that simple starts 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.469
 the perspective 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.440
 these are four perfect corners 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:50.530
 then I can create a random line 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.500
 there it is and from there to spend it 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.220
 horizontally until you intersect and 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.460
 we have now if an object in 3-d is worth 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.320
 all right 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.159
 but if we wanted to do 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.159
 culture 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.760
 how would we make a cube taking into account 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.290
 that we draw it randomly 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.540
 how would we make a cube like we would do to 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.010
 know where exactly that line goes 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:27.560
 perspective let's create a picture 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:32.370
 perfect clear then we will take the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.760
 lines from the vanishing point number one 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.480
 to the corners of that box 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.780
 there are the four corners 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.790
 then we will rely on one of the 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.379
 vanishing points in this case of the number 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.659
 two to simply draw a guide 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:55.310
 it's just a guide there is in this 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.310
 point intersect 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.070
 and there I can create a line 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.890
 horizontally another vertically 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.950
 other 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.430
 horizontal and vertical and horizontal there 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:19.270
 is this way we can have now 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.600
 yes 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:26.110
 a cube totally perfect in 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.980
 perspective this is how a cube is created 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.750
 relying on vanishing point number 2 on 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.340
 this case and you can also do it with 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.540
 the number 3 how to divide an object into 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.300
 two equal parts 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.500
 it's very easy we just create a 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.570
 X 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.390
 we draw line from corner to corner and in 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.390
 where the center intersection 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.560
 where they intersect better said there 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:59.930
 we created the excellent half not well but 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.140
 and as we would do it in three parts I would 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.790
 I ask to do it in three parts to 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.790
 these intersections just 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.629
 do we add from half to one 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.269
 corner from the middle to the other corner and 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.160
 an arrow is created in which 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:20.630
 intersect a few points 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.240
 here we have one and here we have another and 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.630
 from those points we are going to take our 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.630
 lines 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.610
 up and down 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:37.499
 and ready 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:40.590
 and we have an object divided into three 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:42.540
 equal parts 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.610
 it's not very easy, we can draw 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.610
 any object between 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.460
 we created the intersections we created the 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.460
 vanishing points 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:00.870
 only with those here 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.870
 half as we do with the X 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.410
 we only want this point of 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.700
 reference here is and in the middle we're going 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.409
 to trace to the perfect vanishing point 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.569
 we delete these 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:20.219
 that do not serve us for now 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:20.219
 and a way to create 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.729
 we take a random point 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:35.520
 there it is then I can trace the X 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:40.099
 First 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.099
 there is half 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.110
 then 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.370
 the arrow to create 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:03.920
 the three equal parts we delete the 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.920
 lines that we have left 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.340
 we draw 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.910
 where intersections are created 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.740
 we erase 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:39.729
 and there it is in three equal parts 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:47.020
 another way is to create a random point 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:51.590
 creates a random point in perspective 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:57.260
 I take from this point from this point it took 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:07:01.490
 a line that passes through this intersection 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:04.280
 and it arrives here now we upload it 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.960
 we create the line exactly we do what 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.770
 same 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.770
 we created the intersection 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.650
 we climb 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.650
 ready and so could more
