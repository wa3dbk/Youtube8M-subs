actually a spinner head for ghosts
threat<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> ghost<00:00:34.890> post<00:00:35.190> AVI<00:00:35.760> what's<00:00:36.030> really

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
threat to a ghost post AVI what's really

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.240 
threat to a ghost post AVI what's really
cool<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.899> girl<00:00:37.140> eight<00:00:37.290> eight<00:00:37.530> eggs<00:00:37.920> which

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
cool is this girl eight eight eggs which

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.130 
cool is this girl eight eight eggs which
means<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.640> could<00:00:38.940> actually<00:00:39.149> prove<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.839> ghost

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
means I could actually prove a ghost

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
spinner Mojave which I think could be a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.569 
spinner Mojave which I think could be a
pretty<00:00:43.050> awesome<00:00:43.290> animal<00:00:44.040> all<00:00:44.190> right<00:00:44.339> another

pretty awesome animal all right another
question<00:00:44.670> I'm<00:00:45.120> super<00:00:45.570> excited<00:00:46.050> about<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.470> this

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
question I'm super excited about is this

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.200 
question I'm super excited about is this
chocolate<00:00:47.010> lemon<00:00:47.339> blast<00:00:47.699> bread<00:00:48.030> -<00:00:48.180> a

chocolate lemon blast bread - a
chocolate<00:00:48.780> spinner<00:00:49.110> now<00:00:49.589> my<00:00:49.860> odds<00:00:50.100> hit<00:00:50.519> right

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
chocolate spinner now my odds hit right

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.310 
chocolate spinner now my odds hit right
and<00:00:50.909> there's<00:00:51.030> only<00:00:51.239> six<00:00:51.629> eggs<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
and there's only six eggs so it's a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.380 
and there's only six eggs so it's a
stretch<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.010> could<00:00:53.309> actually<00:00:53.460> get<00:00:53.729> a<00:00:53.790> super

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
going to be five and even six bang genes

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.700 
going to be five and even six bang genes
but<00:01:08.700> anything<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:09.479> over<00:01:09.840> four<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.259> always

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
but anything that's over four is always

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.490 
but anything that's over four is always
super<00:01:11.070> exciting<00:01:11.570> another<00:01:12.570> five<00:01:12.869> bang<00:01:13.110> animal

butter<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.300> no<00:01:18.600> idea<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.289> the<00:01:19.409> babies

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
butter I have no idea what the babies

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.320 
butter I have no idea what the babies
could<00:01:19.890> come<00:01:20.100> out<00:01:20.130> looking<00:01:20.550> but<00:01:20.670> if<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.880> hit<00:01:21.060> all

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
could come out looking but if I hit all

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.710 
could come out looking but if I hit all
five<00:01:21.659> genes<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.500> gonna<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:22.920> ridiculous<00:01:23.720> this

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
five genes it's gonna be ridiculous this

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840 
five genes it's gonna be ridiculous this
is<00:01:24.899> a<00:01:24.929> female<00:01:25.259> blue-eyed<00:01:25.950> leucistic<00:01:26.369> which<00:01:26.700> is

is a female blue-eyed leucistic which is

is a female blue-eyed leucistic which is
a<00:01:26.880> lesser<00:01:27.330> lesser<00:01:27.570> combo<00:01:28.229> i<00:01:28.470> bred<00:01:28.829> her<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
a lesser lesser combo i bred her to a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.370 
a lesser lesser combo i bred her to a
sin<00:01:29.430> ENT<00:01:29.939> male<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.659> only<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.930> three<00:01:31.200> bang

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
sin ENT male and it's only a three bang

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.469 
sin ENT male and it's only a three bang
animal<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:31.979> because<00:01:32.310> she's<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> super<00:01:33.060> lesser

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
animal but because she's a super lesser

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.749 
animal but because she's a super lesser
my<00:01:33.840> odds<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.350> producing<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.860> 3<00:01:35.100> bang<00:01:35.310> animal

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
my odds of producing that 3 bang animal

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.760 
my odds of producing that 3 bang animal
increased<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.450> lot<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.229> seven<00:01:37.649> eggs

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
increased a lot I have seven eggs

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.319 
increased a lot I have seven eggs
cooking<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.340> I've<00:01:38.640> got<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:39.090> good

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
cooking I think I've got a really good

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.060 
cooking I think I've got a really good
chance<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.750> hitting<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.140> animal<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.740> know

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
chance of hitting that animal I know

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.100 
chance of hitting that animal I know
this<00:01:41.399> looks<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.880> normal<00:01:42.210> hog<00:01:42.630> nose<00:01:42.869> but

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
this looks like a normal hog nose but

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.959 
this looks like a normal hog nose but
the<00:01:43.229> fact<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.619> matter<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.310> double<00:01:44.790> head
