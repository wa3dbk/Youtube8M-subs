00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:04.920
 see sequence number of his attack in the heart of the subject 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.590
 to begin 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.999
 the base plate this Serbian 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:13.099
 when I go to our galaxy it's a metal plate 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:19.560
 the plastic circle for 100 euros which for me is in poor condition but 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.730
 I'll explain why I'm doing this demonstration 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.730
 % the back of our galaxy 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.759
 more 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.599
 what I previously called the motherboard 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.789
 e she if the binding tape that contains 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.230
 recovery 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.800
 for 100 euros 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.820
 the proximity detector 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.880
 more than 100 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.360
 the lot by their% 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.490
 the term 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.130
 of galaxy obviously we had a small tripoli of integrated circuits that 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.960
 find the most splendid place there 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.760
 the cord between the dunes cord the binding cords 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.230
 with the motherboard 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.550
 right here 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.689
 the little button 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:06.680
 the power plant 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.680
 dudu galaxy and the only button that is not touch 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.190
 a small cap that serves as a cache 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.690
 m at the microphone and that serves as a microphone damper it's just a little girl 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.560
 a small rubber reinforcement 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.990
 which avoids migrations 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.940
 but who for her embarrassed for hearing this little microphone 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.720
 we'll talk about it later 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.990
 that too is a question since simon 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.650
 you remember% in May 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.990
 previous events 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.159
 by removing the 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.670
 from the bed screen to the ccit replacing so 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.390
 I had also broken 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.420
 not to mention that one of the tactile touch that is here 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.610
 so this is a track that I just received unfortunately art morfler 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.360
 during transport in may for this launch that behaves 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.840
 we will still see how I show you how the world
