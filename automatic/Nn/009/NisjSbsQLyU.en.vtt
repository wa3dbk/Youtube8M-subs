00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.799 
battlefield 4 weapon review I thought it
was<00:00:11.400> worthwhile<00:00:11.639> taking<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.389> look<00:00:12.509> at<00:00:12.660> one<00:00:12.780> of

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
was worthwhile taking a look at one of

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.299 
was worthwhile taking a look at one of
those<00:00:12.960> new<00:00:13.230> weapons<00:00:13.620> has<00:00:13.799> been<00:00:13.830> added

those new weapons has been added

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.589 
those new weapons has been added
recently<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.940> game<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.389> though<00:00:15.480> I've

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
recently to the game so though I've

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.130 
recently to the game so though I've
picked<00:00:15.870> out<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.520> ar160<00:00:17.600> as<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.869> name<00:00:19.020> of

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
picked out is the ar160 as the name of

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.840 
picked out is the ar160 as the name of
this<00:00:19.260> weapon<00:00:19.439> kinda<00:00:19.890> suggest<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.490> based

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
this weapon kinda suggest this is based

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.929 
this weapon kinda suggest this is based
on<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> real-life<00:00:21.359> beretta<00:00:22.070> arx-160<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.760> I

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
on the real-life beretta arx-160 and I

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.730 
on the real-life beretta arx-160 and I
actually<00:00:24.029> heard<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.420> rumor<00:00:24.720> recently<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
actually heard a rumor recently that the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.349 
actually heard a rumor recently that the
reason<00:00:25.980> why<00:00:26.099> these<00:00:26.160> names<00:00:26.730> don't<00:00:27.029> exactly

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
reason why these names don't exactly

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.990 
reason why these names don't exactly
match<00:00:27.689> up<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> real-life<00:00:28.590> weapons<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
match up to the real-life weapons is the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.089 
match up to the real-life weapons is the
EA<00:00:30.330> decided<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.109> no<00:00:31.380> longer<00:00:31.560> wanted<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.859> pay

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
EA decided that no longer wanted to pay

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.340 
EA decided that no longer wanted to pay
royalties<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.730> each<00:00:33.149> firearms<00:00:33.719> brand<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
royalties to each firearms brand for the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.410 
royalties to each firearms brand for the
use<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.620> their<00:00:34.770> products<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.000> theory<00:00:36.180> this

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
use of their products so in theory this

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.060 
use of their products so in theory this
means<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.809> battlefield<00:00:37.170> wouldn't<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.829> based

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
means that battlefield wouldn't be based

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.220 
means that battlefield wouldn't be based
on<00:00:38.370> real-life<00:00:38.610> weapons<00:00:39.210> Bob<00:00:39.809> said<00:00:39.960> that's<00:00:40.110> not

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
on real-life weapons Bob said that's not

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.240 
on real-life weapons Bob said that's not
the<00:00:40.350> case<00:00:40.559> they're<00:00:40.920> still<00:00:41.070> gonna<00:00:41.160> use

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the case they're still gonna use

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.430 
the case they're still gonna use
realistic<00:00:42.000> weapon<00:00:42.329> models<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.320> leave

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
realistic weapon models but just leave

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.020 
realistic weapon models but just leave
out<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.649> letter<00:00:43.980> from<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.340> name<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.730> not<00:00:44.850> pay

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
out one letter from the name and not pay

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.369 
out one letter from the name and not pay
anything<00:00:45.239> at<00:00:45.480> all<00:00:45.600> which<00:00:45.870> sounds<00:00:46.260> like

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
anything at all which sounds like

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.250 
anything at all which sounds like
typical<00:00:46.829> EA<00:00:47.039> policy<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.570> started<00:00:49.110> with

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
typical EA policy but they started with

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.600 
typical EA policy but they started with
this<00:00:49.350> guide<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.739> take<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> look<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> stats

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
this guide and take a look at the stats

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.520 
this guide and take a look at the stats
and<00:00:50.789> figures<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.449> ar160

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and figures of the ar160

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.229 
and figures of the ar160
and<00:00:52.890> figure<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.579> new<00:00:53.760> weapon<00:00:53.940> in

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and figure out if this new weapon in

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.869 
and figure out if this new weapon in
battlefield<00:00:54.510> 4<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:54.960> any<00:00:55.289> good<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.610> as<00:00:56.670> always

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
battlefield 4 is any good so as always

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.130 
battlefield 4 is any good so as always
we'll<00:00:57.120> start<00:00:57.329> off<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.570> damage<00:00:57.809> figures

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
we'll start off with the damage figures

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
we'll start off with the damage figures
and<00:00:58.320> being<00:00:58.469> an<00:00:58.620> assault<00:00:58.859> rifle<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.399> weapon

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
and being an assault rifle this weapon

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.880 
and being an assault rifle this weapon
comes<00:00:59.969> out<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> typical<00:01:00.840> ratings<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.469> 25

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
comes out with the typical ratings of 25

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.579 
comes out with the typical ratings of 25
dropping<00:01:02.340> up<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.579> 18<00:01:03.059> we'll<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.110> elsewhere<00:01:04.379> as

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
dropping up to 18 we'll see elsewhere as

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.980 
dropping up to 18 we'll see elsewhere as
part<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:04.949> guide<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.820> ar160<00:01:06.720> is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
part of this guide that the ar160 is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.750 
part of this guide that the ar160 is
very<00:01:07.200> similar<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> sky<00:01:08.070> 8<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.580> some

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
very similar to the sky 8 in some

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.340 
very similar to the sky 8 in some
respects<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.390> thought<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.810> weapon<00:01:10.200> might

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
respects so I thought this weapon might

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
respects so I thought this weapon might
have<00:01:10.470> had<00:01:10.590> higher<00:01:10.830> damage<00:01:11.100> stats<00:01:11.520> despite<00:01:12.299> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
have had higher damage stats despite it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.710 
have had higher damage stats despite it
only<00:01:12.600> firing<00:01:13.020> out<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> typical<00:01:13.700> 5.56<00:01:14.700> by<00:01:14.880> 45mm

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
only firing out the typical 5.56 by 45mm

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.200 
only firing out the typical 5.56 by 45mm
NATO<00:01:15.930> around<00:01:16.400> I've<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.610> discovered<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.060> it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
NATO around I've just discovered that it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
NATO around I've just discovered that it
was<00:01:18.299> actually<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.659> prototype<00:01:19.140> heavy<00:01:19.770> version

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
was actually a prototype heavy version

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.060 
was actually a prototype heavy version
which<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.490> chambered<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.299> 7.62<00:01:22.170> by<00:01:22.560> 51

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
which is chambered in the 7.62 by 51

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.130 
which is chambered in the 7.62 by 51
millimeter<00:01:23.490> round<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.330> same<00:01:24.509> round<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.900> used

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
millimeter round the same round is used

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.170 
millimeter round the same round is used
in<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.439> sky<00:01:25.680> rage<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.759> shame<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.030> it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
in the sky rage so it's a shame that it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.149 
in the sky rage so it's a shame that it
didn't<00:01:27.360> include<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.960> prototype<00:01:28.439> version<00:01:29.070> as

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
didn't include this prototype version as

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.859 
didn't include this prototype version as
opposed<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> standard<00:01:30.000> breath<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.689> just

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
opposed to the standard breath so just

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.600 
opposed to the standard breath so just
to<00:01:30.960> give<00:01:31.049> us<00:01:31.110> an<00:01:31.229> alternative<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.130> sky<00:01:32.400> H

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
to give us an alternative to the sky H

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.780 
to give us an alternative to the sky H
in<00:01:32.850> battlefield<00:01:33.270> 4<00:01:33.470> but<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> usual<00:01:34.710> 25<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.460> 18

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
in battlefield 4 but the usual 25 to 18

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.520 
in battlefield 4 but the usual 25 to 18
damage<00:01:35.970> profile<00:01:36.540> results<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> need<00:01:37.380> in

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
been based on that heavier prototype

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.360 
been based on that heavier prototype
which<00:03:11.290> would<00:03:11.470> have<00:03:11.560> made<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.889> a<00:03:11.950> direct

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
which would have made it a direct

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.909 
which would have made it a direct
competitor<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.239> sky<00:03:13.599> beige<00:03:13.919> currently

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
competitor to the sky beige currently

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.140 
competitor to the sky beige currently
that's<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.220> only<00:03:15.370> weapon<00:03:15.669> in<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.879> assault

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
that's the only weapon in the assault

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.699 
that's the only weapon in the assault
rifles<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.659> really<00:03:16.900> stands<00:03:17.199> out<00:03:17.409> from<00:03:17.590> the

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
rifles that really stands out from the

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.460 
rifles that really stands out from the
pack<00:03:17.919> with<00:03:18.129> its<00:03:18.250> 34<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.970> 25<00:03:19.449> damage<00:03:19.870> profile<00:03:20.290> as

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
pack with its 34 to 25 damage profile as

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.129 
pack with its 34 to 25 damage profile as
opposed<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.949> the<00:03:21.040> typical<00:03:21.340> 25<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.180> 18<00:03:22.569> and

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
opposed to the typical 25 to 18 and

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.500 
opposed to the typical 25 to 18 and
ar160<00:03:23.859> with<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.220> same<00:03:24.489> high<00:03:24.699> damage<00:03:24.970> profile

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
ar160 with the same high damage profile

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.509 
ar160 with the same high damage profile
plus<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.930> faster<00:03:26.260> fire<00:03:26.470> in<00:03:26.769> a<00:03:26.829> larger<00:03:27.129> magazine

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
plus a faster fire in a larger magazine

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.520 
plus a faster fire in a larger magazine
would<00:03:27.699> have<00:03:27.819> been<00:03:27.970> really<00:03:28.239> interesting<00:03:28.780> but

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
would have been really interesting but

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.140 
would have been really interesting but
instead<00:03:29.889> we've<00:03:30.069> got<00:03:30.220> yet<00:03:30.400> another<00:03:30.430> cocky<00:03:31.000> good

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
instead we've got yet another cocky good

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.030 
instead we've got yet another cocky good
too<00:03:31.269> weapon<00:03:31.569> in<00:03:31.720> battlefield<00:03:31.989> 4<00:03:32.229> which<00:03:32.919> is

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
too weapon in battlefield 4 which is

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.710 
too weapon in battlefield 4 which is
almost<00:03:33.190> identical<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.180> majority<00:03:34.479> of

almost identical to the majority of
assault<00:03:35.049> rifles<00:03:35.169> but<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.650> doesn't<00:03:35.859> really

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:35.979 
assault rifles but it doesn't really

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.309 
assault rifles but it doesn't really
hold<00:03:36.159> up<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.729> likes<00:03:36.879> of<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.180> m416<00:03:37.659> or<00:03:38.109> ace

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.250 
hold up to the likes of the m416 or ace
23<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:40.060> fairly<00:03:40.269> balanced<00:03:40.750> in<00:03:40.840> its<00:03:40.989> stats

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
23 it's fairly balanced in its stats

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.719 
23 it's fairly balanced in its stats
though<00:03:41.500> although<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.889> does<00:03:42.010> have<00:03:42.040> quite<00:03:42.489> heavy

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.339 
though although it does have quite heavy
recoil<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.389> does<00:03:43.540> come<00:03:43.690> along<00:03:43.780> with<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.109> fast

reload time which I find is one of the

reload time which I find is one of the
most<00:03:46.120> crucial<00:03:46.419> steps<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:47.049> look<00:03:47.199> at<00:03:47.319> when

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
most crucial steps to look at when

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.229 
most crucial steps to look at when
