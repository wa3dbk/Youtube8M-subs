which<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.930> why<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.140> separated<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> items

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
which is why you separated the items

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.160 
which is why you separated the items
into<00:00:29.340> separate<00:00:29.730> slots<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.570> shoulder<00:00:30.960> pads

into separate slots the shoulder pads

into separate slots the shoulder pads
for<00:00:31.380> example<00:00:31.830> come<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.130> three<00:00:32.340> different

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
for example come in three different

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.330 
for example come in three different
forms<00:00:33.030> left<00:00:33.600> only<00:00:33.809> right<00:00:34.410> only<00:00:34.829> around<00:00:35.160> both

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
forms left only right only around both

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.910 
forms left only right only around both
shoulders<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.719> pouches<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> same<00:00:37.559> you

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
shoulders the pouches are the same you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.100 
shoulders the pouches are the same you
can<00:00:37.950> either<00:00:38.190> carry<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.760> both<00:00:39.210> or<00:00:39.540> neither

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
can either carry one both or neither

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.780 
can either carry one both or neither
however<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> back<00:00:41.010> pouch<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.430> largely

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
however the back pouch is largely

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.700 
however the back pouch is largely
increases<00:00:42.300> your<00:00:42.420> carrying<00:00:42.750> capacity<00:00:43.170> by<00:00:43.290> 50

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
increases your carrying capacity by 50

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.080 
increases your carrying capacity by 50
and<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.219> front<00:00:44.430> pouch<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.760> smaller

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
and the front pouch is smaller

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.569 
and the front pouch is smaller
increasingly<00:00:45.750> by<00:00:45.930> 25<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.100> there<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> good

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
increasingly by 25 so there is a good

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.850 
increasingly by 25 so there is a good
reason<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.030> carry<00:00:48.239> both<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> lot

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
reason to carry both and we know a lot

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.500 
reason to carry both and we know a lot
of<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.100> aren't<00:00:50.250> big<00:00:50.399> fans<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.789> female<00:00:51.149> armors

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
but this one's a little more polished
