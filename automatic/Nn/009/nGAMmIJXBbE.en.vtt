00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.849
 the dictatorship always so many writers we are going to give us a return in 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.849
 this kind of matches accompanied please 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.400
 ain 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:51.670
 jun we tried the first meeting is ranked it is not true is that the 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.950
 first meters almost always say quite dangerous to do 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.720
 in the electric electrical system and choirs 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.220
 what consumes is zero for sabina and this one emits percent and 0 grams of this 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.640
 Oscar Acosta we started 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.720
 move those first meters will hold 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.860
 percent in electric mode 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.420
 and as well aware that we are speed or that we win will be 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.229
 I believe that we make a power to the eighth finals after being stronger 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.450
 because the central combustion engine right now I will enter and as you can 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.700
 see in the graph put vegas is like the combustion engine oea now 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.359
 not because I'm waiting 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.780
 the state feeding the battery now I know I'm happy where you are 

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:36.860
 feeding this battery and s 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.040
 electric motor well as you can see four meters and 46 centimeters of 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.550
 eta is worse the reference pn in the subject divided in terms of the market 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.840
 international 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.520
 has already shown the lexus rx that more or less have the same technology in 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.530
 this case some then we are before compact pita half up in 4 meters with 10 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.340
 centimeters tires of 15 ko vs more seen in that one little lap that 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.869
 we have given on the outside the motor was good engine the wheels were 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.649
 pretty fairings this barrier are the wheels of 15 may well seem 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.930
 narrow but good are they are the one of are she 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.500
 that's why in the villas where they are prepared and that are designed for 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.440
 that the producer also he consumption and good as this the toyota prius be 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.580
 the only one to the only reason for being is that try to consume the least 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.110
 possible and try to contaminate as little as possible and for that it uses an engine 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.420
 electric that are added to the hormadi combustion engine between the two sum 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.040
 136 horses 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.640
 to put themselves behind the operation powerful city theaters in little more than 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.150
 ten seconds we're talking about a pretty decent generation and what 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.800
 best of all is that the good of 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.150
 the toyota confirmed around 4 liters of consumption at 100 we are 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.460
 doing four with eight 4 with 7 4 with nine the azores one is a data to people 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.450
 real and above all is a pretty tight consumption for a car what is to say 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.039
 For the day to day 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.239
 in the best of all since you 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.389
 e in what is a prius toyota from 24 thousand 200 euros according to the community 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:11.579
 you have some kind of fiscal exemption galo good to be the hero vélez the 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.760
 parking that reduces taxes and so on but in any case is not 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.100
 a very usable car per cent is valid for day to day 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.250
 and well we are specifically there with the most equipped version 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.370
 executive there are three versions shares always same motor but as times the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.590
 good equipment 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.030
 percent is fine automatic change the cam also back 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.470
 automatic start also appears by button 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.470
 percent and has camera 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.040
 by the way when it comes to routing the parameters of the audio system 2010 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.150
 he is now quite recovered the bread and wine francisco and that could only 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.959
 see and observe on the glass thanks to the speed and charging system 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.879
 racing percent the difference is about 10 thousand euros between the basic version and 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.659
 this version that is the most severe safety the most severe in 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:21.409
 equipped and colors has power to the sunroof and the best part is that 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.939
 it also has the part that is not seen in the back because it has a panel 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:28.110
 solar, which also serves to recharge systems such as 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.509
 example in the system 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.879
 in the air towards liberalism as you can see the back legs the bars 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:38.169
 that this matter in adult projects and chile a problem also 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.990
 it is striking that despite the legal 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.710
 lara to the space occupied by the batteries the trunk to the roof occupies when 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.639
 it holds 446 liters of capacity which is fine otherwise something is already the 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.360
 aesthetics is quite controversial and especially good from the rear window 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.250
 heading that the truth I do not know anyone that he likes but good of say that 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.139
 the toyota will have his reasons for this as you can see that deficit and such notice 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.830
 from anywhere the seats are quite finite 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.040
 that have analyzed all possible poles is all studied to the maximum 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.039
 voice to try that to try to reduce the consumption and the 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:13.860
 forecasts 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.129
 by the way there is a lot to tell from toyota prius but as always I knew that 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.600
 I lived in the client 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.570
 We advance the basics here in spokespersons against the website and 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.490
 refreshing engine you will find the exhaustive and complete analysis of how 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.190
 that toyota prius works and if it's worth it or not, that's the way 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.600
 emplaza que balears and that demand osc de stupiñán after expressing the portal 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.819
 kotaku put pagenaud of engine repression see you next 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:37.549
