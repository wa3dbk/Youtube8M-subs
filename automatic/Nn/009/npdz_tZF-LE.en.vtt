going<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.330> deny<00:00:18.660> mining<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.800> long<00:00:20.070> time<00:00:20.340> in

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
going to deny mining for a long time in

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.279 
going to deny mining for a long time in
the<00:00:20.640> main<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.390> Washington<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.900> still<00:00:22.109> getting

a lot of economic damage here he has his

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.820 
a lot of economic damage here he has his
STV<00:00:25.350> there<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.710> repair<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.550> vulture<00:00:27.830> while

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
STV there to repair the vulture while

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.070 
STV there to repair the vulture while
he's<00:00:29.070> positioning<00:00:29.820> all<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.510> his<00:00:30.660> buildings

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
he's positioning all of his buildings

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.620 
he's positioning all of his buildings
going<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.500> try<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.710> wall<00:00:32.009> off<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:33.270> switch

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
going to try to wall off and I switch

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.380 
going to try to wall off and I switch
into<00:00:33.989> another<00:00:34.020> strategy<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:35.120> it's<00:00:36.120> one

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
into another strategy here it's one

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.330 
into another strategy here it's one
vulture<00:00:36.809> coming<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.200> here<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.890> now<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.309> are

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
vulture coming in here but now there are

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.340 
vulture coming in here but now there are
hydrolysed<00:00:38.910> out<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.329> hiva<00:00:39.570> will<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:40.050> able<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
hydrolysed out so hiva will be able to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.350 
hydrolysed out so hiva will be able to
get<00:00:40.559> rid<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.309> remaining<00:00:41.670> vultures<00:00:42.149> but

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
get rid of the remaining vultures but

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.209 
get rid of the remaining vultures but
he's<00:00:42.450> still<00:00:42.719> not<00:00:43.079> mining<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> main<00:00:43.860> at<00:00:44.070> all

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
he's still not mining at the main at all

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.959 
he's still not mining at the main at all
so<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.270> really<00:00:45.570> putting<00:00:45.870> hi<00:00:46.050> Bo<00:00:46.230> behind

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
so this is really putting hi Bo behind

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.760 
so this is really putting hi Bo behind
and<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.420> pretty<00:00:48.629> smart<00:00:48.960> attack<00:00:49.289> from

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
and this is a pretty smart attack from

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.180 
and this is a pretty smart attack from
wasson<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.399> far<00:00:51.500> Watson<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.649> still<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.039> here

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
wasson so far Watson is still in here

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.250 
wasson so far Watson is still in here
being<00:00:53.489> annoying<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.570> vulture<00:00:54.899> will

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
being annoying that vulture will

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.750 
being annoying that vulture will
eventually<00:00:55.770> go<00:00:55.890> down<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.520> looks<00:00:56.699> like

eventually go down here it looks like

drone<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.549> still<00:01:15.060> can't<00:01:15.780> quite<00:01:16.140> uh<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:17.250> was

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
drone we still can't quite uh I was

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.649 
drone we still can't quite uh I was
going<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> say<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.119> would<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.299> been<00:01:18.360> clutch

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
going to say that would have been clutch

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.749 
going to say that would have been clutch
but<00:01:19.170> he<00:01:19.290> did<00:01:19.500> not<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> final<00:01:20.250> drone<00:01:20.549> kill

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
but he did not get a final drone kill

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.690 
but he did not get a final drone kill
their<00:01:20.939> looks<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.990> lair<00:01:22.200> coming<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.700> for

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
their looks like the lair coming up for

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.469 
their looks like the lair coming up for
hiva<00:01:24.170> well<00:01:25.170> Boston<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.280> transitioning<00:01:27.150> into<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
hiva well Boston is transitioning into a

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.990 
hiva well Boston is transitioning into a
medical<00:01:28.049> marine<00:01:28.290> build<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:29.009> don't<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:29.909> he

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
medical marine build I don't think he

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.090 
medical marine build I don't think he
built<00:01:30.329> anything<00:01:30.689> else<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.290> factory<00:01:31.829> he

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
built anything else with that factory he

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.249 
built anything else with that factory he
might<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.400> built<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.909> more<00:01:33.270> vulture<00:01:34.110> with

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
might have built one more vulture with

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.660 
might have built one more vulture with
that<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.619> now<00:01:34.710> he's<00:01:34.829> floating<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> factory

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that but now he's floating the factory

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.069 
that but now he's floating the factory
off<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.090> he's<00:01:36.210> not<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.900> use<00:01:37.049> that

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
off so he's not going to use that

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.100 
off so he's not going to use that
factory<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.829> anything<00:01:37.979> else<00:01:38.840> he's<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
factory for anything else he's going to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.440 
factory for anything else he's going to
push<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> small<00:01:41.280> medica<00:01:41.880> Marine<00:01:42.119> Force

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
push in with a small medica Marine Force

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.590 
push in with a small medica Marine Force
I<00:01:42.740> actually<00:01:43.740> think<00:01:44.100> things<00:01:44.610> are<00:01:44.759> kind<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.210> tied

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
I actually think things are kind of tied

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.870 
I actually think things are kind of tied
up<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:46.020> now<00:01:46.200> since<00:01:46.259> wasin<00:01:46.950> doesn't<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.700> any

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
up here now since wasin doesn't have any

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.969 
up here now since wasin doesn't have any
real<00:01:48.149> way<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.360> utilizing<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.259> factory<00:01:49.740> right

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
real way of utilizing that factory right

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.410 
real way of utilizing that factory right
now<00:01:50.159> he's<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.520> he's<00:01:50.670> gonna<00:01:50.880> try<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.119> float

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
now he's I think he's gonna try to float

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.810 
now he's I think he's gonna try to float
it<00:01:51.600> over<00:01:51.979> he's<00:01:52.979> being<00:01:53.220> chased<00:01:53.490> by<00:01:53.700> this

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it over he's being chased by this

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.639 
it over he's being chased by this
overlord<00:01:54.299> though<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.140> he's<00:01:55.259> not<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.590> be

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
overlord though so he's not going to be

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.819 
overlord though so he's not going to be
able<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.950> do<00:01:56.070> anything<00:01:56.280> too<00:01:56.640> sneaky<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
able to do anything too sneaky with it

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.580 
able to do anything too sneaky with it
but<00:01:58.829> yeah<00:01:59.009> he<00:01:59.130> can't<00:01:59.369> build<00:01:59.579> tanks<00:01:59.850> right<00:02:00.149> now

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
but yeah he can't build tanks right now

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.709 
but yeah he can't build tanks right now
so<00:02:01.590> Wow<00:02:02.009> hiva<00:02:02.490> actually<00:02:03.000> trying<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.420> go<00:02:03.540> in

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
so Wow hiva actually trying to go in

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.450 
so Wow hiva actually trying to go in
with<00:02:03.899> his<00:02:04.170> hydrolysed<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:05.100> could<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:05.430> been

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
with his hydrolysed this could have been

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.940 
with his hydrolysed this could have been
suicidal<00:02:06.240> from<00:02:06.899> hiva<00:02:07.110> losing<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.799> those

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
suicidal from hiva losing all those

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.380 
suicidal from hiva losing all those
hydrolyse<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.580> he<00:02:08.640> could<00:02:08.879> have<00:02:08.970> morphed

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
hydrolyse that he could have morphed

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.480 
hydrolyse that he could have morphed
into<00:02:09.569> lurkers<00:02:10.349> right<00:02:10.560> now

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
into lurkers right now

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.250 
into lurkers right now
so<00:02:12.490> hi<00:02:13.000> velu<00:02:13.330> zhing<00:02:13.510> all<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.720> his<00:02:13.840> troops<00:02:14.020> and

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
so hi velu zhing all of his troops and

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.780 
so hi velu zhing all of his troops and
now<00:02:14.320> he's<00:02:14.470> throwing<00:02:14.650> down<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> ton<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.280> sunken

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
now he's throwing down a ton of sunken

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.460 
now he's throwing down a ton of sunken
but<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.480> might<00:02:16.600> be<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> little<00:02:16.930> bit<00:02:17.080> too<00:02:17.230> late

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
but it might be a little bit too late

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.040 
but it might be a little bit too late
the<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.700> sunken<00:02:19.180> well<00:02:19.660> those<00:02:19.810> creeks

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
the the sunken well those creeks

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.350 
the the sunken well those creeks
colonies<00:02:20.470> they're<00:02:21.160> not<00:02:21.340> even<00:02:21.790> morphing<00:02:22.240> in

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
colonies they're not even morphing in

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.060 
colonies they're not even morphing in
the<00:02:22.450> sunken<00:02:22.600> yet<00:02:22.960> they're<00:02:23.200> just<00:02:23.560> well<00:02:23.740> now

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
the sunken yet they're just well now

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.770 
the sunken yet they're just well now
morphing<00:02:24.520> into<00:02:24.610> creep<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.210> now<00:02:25.600> they're

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
morphing into creep and now they're

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.910 
morphing into creep and now they're
morphing<00:02:25.960> into<00:02:26.110> some<00:02:26.380> kids<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:26.710> looks<00:02:26.890> like

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
morphing into some kids but looks like

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.580 
morphing into some kids but looks like
wasin<00:02:27.400> won't<00:02:27.610> be<00:02:27.760> able<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.090> break<00:02:28.270> this

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
wasin won't be able to break this

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.690 
wasin won't be able to break this
Watson's<00:02:29.590> going<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.190> pull<00:02:30.370> up<00:02:30.520> more

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
Watson's going to have to pull up more

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.800 
Watson's going to have to pull up more
troops<00:02:30.970> if<00:02:31.150> he<00:02:31.240> wants<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.510> think<00:02:31.660> about

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
troops if he wants to think about

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.200 
troops if he wants to think about
breaking<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.490> but<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.580> looks<00:02:33.700> like<00:02:33.760> hive<00:02:34.000> is

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
breaking this but it looks like hive is

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.630 
breaking this but it looks like hive is
actually<00:02:34.650> gotten<00:02:35.650> away<00:02:35.710> from<00:02:35.830> gas<00:02:36.220> right<00:02:36.490> now

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
actually gotten away from gas right now

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.310 
actually gotten away from gas right now
I<00:02:36.670> guess<00:02:36.940> he's<00:02:37.090> building<00:02:37.390> up<00:02:37.510> his<00:02:37.690> drone<00:02:38.020> count

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
I guess he's building up his drone count

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.430 
I guess he's building up his drone count
again<00:02:38.980> maybe<00:02:39.580> trying<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:39.880> expand<00:02:40.540> somewhere

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
again maybe trying to expand somewhere

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.080 
again maybe trying to expand somewhere
else<00:02:41.560> again<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:41.950> looks<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.280> oh<00:02:42.490> I<00:02:42.730> think

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
else again it looks like oh I think

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.520 
else again it looks like oh I think
Watson's<00:02:43.510> going<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.810> try<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.050> trick<00:02:44.290> his

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
Watson's going to try a trick his

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.410 
Watson's going to try a trick his
vulture<00:02:44.950> through<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.250> minerals<00:02:45.610> using<00:02:46.300> his

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
vulture through the minerals using his

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
vulture through the minerals using his
factor<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:46.990> he<00:02:47.170> actually<00:02:47.350> does<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.190> uh<00:02:49.440> well

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
factor and he actually does it uh well

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.760 
factor and he actually does it uh well
uh<00:02:50.620> he<00:02:51.400> didn't<00:02:51.790> do<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.330> mean<00:02:52.480> he<00:02:53.350> should<00:02:53.680> have

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
uh he didn't do it I mean he should have

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.040 
uh he didn't do it I mean he should have
done<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.100> i<00:02:54.190> thought<00:02:54.400> i<00:02:54.460> saw<00:02:54.730> his<00:02:54.940> vulture<00:02:55.720> pop

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
done it i thought i saw his vulture pop

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.240 
done it i thought i saw his vulture pop
out<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.350> other<00:02:56.470> side<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.070> guess<00:02:57.220> he

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
out the other side but I guess he

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.610 
out the other side but I guess he
glitched<00:02:58.030> its<00:02:58.270> way<00:02:58.450> back<00:02:59.110> through<00:02:59.140> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
glitched its way back through the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.040 
glitched its way back through the
minerals<00:02:59.920> okay<00:03:00.700> haha<00:03:01.210> looks<00:03:01.510> like<00:03:01.630> quazon

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
minerals okay haha looks like quazon

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.080 
minerals okay haha looks like quazon
finally<00:03:02.800> managed<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.250> sneak<00:03:03.550> through<00:03:03.610> here<00:03:04.000> he

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
finally managed to sneak through here he

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.940 
finally managed to sneak through here he
was<00:03:04.240> spotted<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.840> whole<00:03:04.960> time<00:03:05.200> by<00:03:05.770> that

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
was spotted the whole time by that

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.250 
was spotted the whole time by that
Overlord<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:07.150> he's<00:03:07.450> probably<00:03:07.720> not<00:03:07.960> going<00:03:08.170> to

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
Overlord so he's probably not going to

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.990 
Overlord so he's probably not going to
get<00:03:08.440> anything<00:03:08.650> done<00:03:08.890> with<00:03:09.070> this<00:03:09.190> vulture<00:03:09.430> it

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
get anything done with this vulture it

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.550 
get anything done with this vulture it
was<00:03:10.120> pretty<00:03:10.300> neat<00:03:10.570> trick<00:03:10.810> anyway<00:03:11.200> I'm

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
was pretty neat trick anyway I'm

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.290 
was pretty neat trick anyway I'm
surprised<00:03:12.100> he<00:03:12.250> went<00:03:12.430> for<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.760> knowing<00:03:13.120> the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
surprised he went for that knowing the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.699 
surprised he went for that knowing the
Overlord<00:03:14.110> was<00:03:14.350> above<00:03:15.160> him<00:03:15.989> hi<00:03:16.989> was<00:03:17.230> sunken

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
Overlord was above him hi was sunken

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.560 
Overlord was above him hi was sunken
hang<00:03:17.860> up<00:03:17.980> like<00:03:18.190> crazy<00:03:18.459> here<00:03:18.820> he<00:03:19.270> definitely

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
hang up like crazy here he definitely

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.270 
hang up like crazy here he definitely
does<00:03:19.810> not<00:03:19.840> want<00:03:20.020> to<00:03:20.230> be<00:03:20.290> broken<00:03:20.530> here<00:03:20.890> but<00:03:21.160> he

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
does not want to be broken here but he

think Weston's going to commit all a

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.719 
think Weston's going to commit all a
drop<00:05:07.930> here<00:05:08.169> and<00:05:08.289> just<00:05:08.439> drop<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.860> main<00:05:09.009> until

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
drop here and just drop the main until

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.629 
drop here and just drop the main until
that<00:05:09.909> layer<00:05:10.150> is<00:05:10.300> gone<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.800> I<00:05:12.069> wasn't<00:05:12.520> actually

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
that layer is gone and I wasn't actually

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.899 
that layer is gone and I wasn't actually
pumping<00:05:13.270> more<00:05:13.810> voltar's<00:05:14.740> right<00:05:15.009> now<00:05:15.189> from

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
pumping more voltar's right now from

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.779 
pumping more voltar's right now from
that<00:05:16.620> factory<00:05:17.620> that<00:05:17.860> floated<00:05:18.219> over<00:05:18.339> here<00:05:18.669> is

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
that factory that floated over here is

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.510 
that factory that floated over here is
it<00:05:19.000> doesn't<00:05:19.330> even<00:05:19.419> care<00:05:19.719> about<00:05:19.979> the<00:05:20.979> muta<00:05:21.370> list

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
it doesn't even care about the muta list

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.740 
it doesn't even care about the muta list
that<00:05:21.669> are<00:05:21.699> picking<00:05:22.060> at<00:05:22.180> it<00:05:22.210> he's<00:05:22.449> going<00:05:22.659> to

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
that are picking at it he's going to

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.980 
that are picking at it he's going to
pump<00:05:23.099> the<00:05:24.099> vultures<00:05:24.490> anyway<00:05:24.939> to<00:05:25.629> get<00:05:25.749> some

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
pump the vultures anyway to get some

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.290 
pump the vultures anyway to get some
harassment<00:05:26.199> there<00:05:26.770> and<00:05:27.009> he's<00:05:27.460> basically<00:05:27.819> just

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
harassment there and he's basically just

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.629 
harassment there and he's basically just
drawing<00:05:29.139> the<00:05:29.589> mutinous<00:05:29.949> attention<00:05:30.460> right<00:05:30.580> now

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
drawing the mutinous attention right now

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.820 
drawing the mutinous attention right now
so<00:05:31.000> he<00:05:31.120> can<00:05:31.150> wreak<00:05:31.659> havoc<00:05:32.050> on<00:05:32.169> the<00:05:32.650> main<00:05:32.800> I

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
so he can wreak havoc on the main I

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.320 
so he can wreak havoc on the main I
think<00:05:33.219> he's<00:05:33.339> pretty<00:05:33.550> much<00:05:33.639> destroyed<00:05:34.120> the

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
think he's pretty much destroyed the

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.820 
think he's pretty much destroyed the
main<00:05:34.509> right<00:05:34.719> now<00:05:34.870> I<00:05:35.110> don't<00:05:35.409> think<00:05:35.560> there<00:05:35.770> was

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
main right now I don't think there was

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.499 
main right now I don't think there was
anything<00:05:36.129> high<00:05:36.460> we<00:05:36.610> could<00:05:36.759> do<00:05:36.849> about<00:05:37.000> it<00:05:37.120> that

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
anything high we could do about it that

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:43.110 
anything high we could do about it that
attack<00:05:38.759> and<00:05:39.759> now<00:05:39.879> hiva<00:05:40.120> is<00:05:40.419> uh<00:05:41.939> what<00:05:42.939> looks

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
attack and now hiva is uh what looks

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.360 
attack and now hiva is uh what looks
like<00:05:43.180> wasin<00:05:43.689> is<00:05:43.870> being<00:05:44.560> more<00:05:44.800> defensive<00:05:45.250> now

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
like wasin is being more defensive now

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.339 
like wasin is being more defensive now
he's<00:05:45.610> putting<00:05:45.759> down<00:05:46.060> a<00:05:46.089> bunker<00:05:46.810> just<00:05:47.050> in<00:05:47.169> case

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
he's putting down a bunker just in case

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.920 
he's putting down a bunker just in case
there<00:05:47.889> is<00:05:48.009> a<00:05:48.039> counter<00:05:48.430> attack<00:05:48.550> at<00:05:49.029> his<00:05:49.060> natural

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
there is a counter attack at his natural

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.439 
there is a counter attack at his natural
which<00:05:50.110> I<00:05:50.259> think<00:05:50.580> yeah<00:05:51.580> hiva<00:05:51.849> is<00:05:52.089> thinking

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
which I think yeah hiva is thinking

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:53.760 
which I think yeah hiva is thinking
about<00:05:52.539> doing<00:05:52.779> a<00:05:52.960> counter-attack<00:05:53.439> right<00:05:53.649> now

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
about doing a counter-attack right now

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.700 
about doing a counter-attack right now

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
he's coming in to the main but looks
