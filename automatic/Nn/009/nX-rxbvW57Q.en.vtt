on all right so let's check in the
system<00:02:04.140> checking<00:02:04.649> right<00:02:04.799> now<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.579> going

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
system checking right now so it's going

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.690 
system checking right now so it's going
to<00:02:05.790> do<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.829> cycle<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:07.979> all<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.280> light<00:02:08.459> bulbs

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.630 
to do a cycle and all the light bulbs
and<00:02:09.149> it's<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.629> start<00:02:09.869> filling<00:02:10.649> it's

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and it's going to start filling it's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.050 
and it's going to start filling it's
going<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.879> give<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.209> normal<00:02:12.629> water

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
going to give you a normal water

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.580 
going to give you a normal water
so<00:02:13.750> it's<00:02:13.870> going<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.080> start<00:02:14.319> working<00:02:14.560> again<00:02:15.090> if

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
so it's going to start working again if
