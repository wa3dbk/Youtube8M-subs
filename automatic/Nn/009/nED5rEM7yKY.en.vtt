00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
want to try and minimize her own burn

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.820 
want to try and minimize her own burn
against<00:01:09.600> ourselves<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.260> run<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> 10

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
against ourselves so we just run the 10

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.800 
against ourselves so we just run the 10
10<00:01:11.549> basic<00:01:11.820> Reds<00:01:13.729> moving<00:01:14.729> into<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> monster

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
10 basic Reds moving into the monster

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
10 basic Reds moving into the monster
lineup<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:18.150> poor<00:01:18.390> black<00:01:18.600> go<00:01:18.830> unless

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
lineup it is the poor black go unless

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.140 
lineup it is the poor black go unless
you<00:01:19.890> put<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.220> early<00:01:20.369> grain<00:01:20.700> kind<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.000> early

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
you put on early grain kind of early

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.090 
you put on early grain kind of early
beats<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.780> well<00:01:21.960> as<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.680> opponent<00:01:22.979> does

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
beats as well as your opponent does

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
beats as well as your opponent does
pocket<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.729> turns<00:01:24.000> into<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.330> burn<00:01:24.630> source<00:01:24.990> later

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
pocket it turns into a burn source later

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.499 
pocket it turns into a burn source later
on<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.549> fits<00:01:26.790> really<00:01:26.970> well<00:01:27.090> into<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
on so that fits really well into the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.969 
on so that fits really well into the
whole<00:01:27.659> idea<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.960> changing<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> tempo<00:01:28.770> based

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
whole idea of changing the tempo based

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.969 
whole idea of changing the tempo based
on<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:29.220> your<00:01:29.310> matchup<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:30.409> then<00:01:31.409> there's<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
on what your matchup is then there's the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.340 
on what your matchup is then there's the
cognate<00:01:32.790> engine<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:33.900> apostle

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
cognate engine which is just for apostle

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.260 
cognate engine which is just for apostle
of<00:01:34.380> cane<00:01:34.650> which<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.340> swiftness<00:01:35.700> when<00:01:36.180> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
of cane which can get swiftness when it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.780 
of cane which can get swiftness when it
enters<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.960> you're<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.680> jade<00:01:38.310> ruler<00:01:38.430> attack

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.630 
the deck it's a it was pretty fun to
play<00:06:22.300> against<00:06:22.720> the<00:06:23.650> the<00:06:23.950> fact<00:06:24.160> that<00:06:24.250> it<00:06:24.430> can

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
play against the the fact that it can

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.170 
play against the the fact that it can
switch<00:06:25.120> gears<00:06:25.630> really<00:06:25.900> fast<00:06:26.169> from<00:06:26.590> being<00:06:26.849> AG

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
switch gears really fast from being AG

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.890 
switch gears really fast from being AG
Oh to<00:06:28.300> burn<00:06:28.710> I<00:06:29.710> think<00:06:30.190> is<00:06:30.280> really<00:06:30.550> clever<00:06:31.509> and

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
Oh to burn I think is really clever and

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.200 
Oh to burn I think is really clever and
I<00:06:32.590> think<00:06:32.860> works<00:06:33.039> really<00:06:33.220> well<00:06:33.520> for<00:06:33.669> the<00:06:33.970> stack

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
I think works really well for the stack

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.580 
I think works really well for the stack
especially<00:06:34.690> with<00:06:34.810> Kane<00:06:35.020> being<00:06:35.320> able<00:06:35.530> to

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
especially with Kane being able to

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.310 
especially with Kane being able to
auto-generate<00:06:35.889> stones<00:06:36.600> it<00:06:37.600> gives<00:06:37.780> you<00:06:37.870> a<00:06:37.900> huge

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
auto-generate stones it gives you a huge

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.260 
auto-generate stones it gives you a huge
stone<00:06:38.650> base<00:06:38.919> to<00:06:39.130> be<00:06:39.250> able<00:06:39.370> to<00:06:39.610> utilize<00:06:40.030> all

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
stone base to be able to utilize all

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.060
