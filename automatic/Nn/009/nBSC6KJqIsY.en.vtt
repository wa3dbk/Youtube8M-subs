00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.410 
because it doesn't actually fire whereas
the<00:02:22.320> new<00:02:22.440> lego<00:02:22.710> sets<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.310> half<00:02:23.520> cannons<00:02:24.060> that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
the new lego sets that half cannons that

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.140 
the new lego sets that half cannons that
do<00:02:24.600> fire<00:02:24.900> they<00:02:25.890> only<00:02:26.070> give<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.610> one<00:02:27.240> two<00:02:27.480> three

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
do fire they only give you one two three

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.000 
do fire they only give you one two three
so<00:02:30.150> that's<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:31.140> little<00:02:31.290> interesting

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
so that's a little interesting

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.270 
so that's a little interesting
the<00:02:32.700> cannons<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.210> this<00:02:33.390> really<00:02:33.810> cool<00:02:34.280> decal

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
the cannons have this really cool decal

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.750 
the cannons have this really cool decal
on<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.850> back<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.630> Imperial<00:02:37.760> Navy

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
on the back it's the Imperial Navy

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.830 
on the back it's the Imperial Navy
symbol<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:41.220> can<00:02:41.340> also<00:02:41.490> see<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.970> on<00:02:42.120> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
symbol as you can also see it on the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.920 
symbol as you can also see it on the
actual<00:02:43.410> sales<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.950> ship<00:02:44.130> now<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:45.690> ship

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
actual sales of the ship now the ship

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.420 
actual sales of the ship now the ship
itself<00:02:46.290> isn't<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.950> big

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
itself isn't that big

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.790 
itself isn't that big
I'd<00:02:48.150> say<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.570> mid<00:02:48.840> size<00:02:49.110> for<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.500> pirate

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
I'd say it's mid size for the pirate

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.070 
I'd say it's mid size for the pirate
theme<00:02:49.980> if<00:02:50.250> not<00:02:50.550> on<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.940> smaller<00:02:51.240> side<00:02:53.030> but

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
theme if not on the smaller side but

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.450 
theme if not on the smaller side but
that's<00:02:55.080> not<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.440> say<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.680> there's<00:02:56.250> anything

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
that's not to say that there's anything

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.170 
that's not to say that there's anything
wrong<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
wrong with it

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.960 
wrong with it
in<00:02:57.300> fact<00:02:57.840> many<00:02:58.800> collectors<00:02:59.250> consider<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.760> one

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
in fact many collectors consider it one

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.510 
in fact many collectors consider it one
of<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.240> coolest<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.140> most<00:03:01.230> collectible<00:03:02.040> Lego

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
little more spectacular the actual ship

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.470 
little more spectacular the actual ship
has<00:03:26.310> some<00:03:26.460> pretty<00:03:26.610> interesting<00:03:26.880> features

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
little ship and I definitely think you

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.340 
little ship and I definitely think you
should<00:04:20.850> have<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.270> in<00:04:21.390> your<00:04:21.570> collection<00:04:21.720> if<00:04:22.200> you

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
another interesting thing is you do have

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.670 
another interesting thing is you do have
room<00:04:28.669> for<00:04:29.000> minifigures<00:04:29.750> on<00:04:30.139> the<00:04:30.229> front<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.560> the

Pirates sets wits which don't have any
room<00:04:37.039> at<00:04:37.160> all<00:04:37.310> in<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.520> front<00:04:37.729> such<00:04:38.360> as<00:04:38.509> the

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
room at all in the front such as the

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.040 
room at all in the front such as the
Imperial<00:04:38.930> flagship<00:04:39.850> so<00:04:40.850> overall<00:04:41.449> this<00:04:41.750> sets<00:04:41.990> a

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
Imperial flagship so overall this sets a

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.290 
Imperial flagship so overall this sets a
bit<00:04:42.199> cozier<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:42.889> I<00:04:43.130> think<00:04:43.340> it<00:04:43.639> it's<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.180> little

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
bit cozier and I think it it's a little

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.249 
bit cozier and I think it it's a little
better<00:04:44.600> for<00:04:44.810> stop-motion<00:04:45.470> movies<00:04:47.110> all<00:04:48.110> right

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
better for stop-motion movies all right

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.590 
better for stop-motion movies all right
