00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.610
 Hello after our last video of the series Blue Screen has arrived so well 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.439
 Although it is also one of the most meaningless at the same time so loud then 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.179
 still loose on it and that about a bit blues war 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.140
 that makes strict standard from the Blue Stream no blue stream but he does that 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.179
 is the computer synonymous terribly no matter 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.249
 when he's just dumping 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:32.590
 if they have to 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.080
 then at least let him die colorfully the tool itself comes 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.490
 brought by Microsoft intensive house so who dominated c ++ 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.350
 who can share Intel with other features and who share 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.909
 because of the gentle 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:46.900
 dealing 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.260
 Dr applications with our windows 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.469
 The whole thing is always just a meal to come 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.370
 Process Blue Stream then complete and after the reboot is done 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.210
 however, the default setting wants to be active although the blue burst 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.980
 So I would have to restart the application again and again after each computer 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.100
 Start to get a lasting effect well as I said 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.450
 it already makes sense 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.200
 also about the comments why so what ever from Microsoft 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.210
 It has been implemented probably already if you are with the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.700
 normal blues meets have to beat because you want to annually still intentionally 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.960
 just raise the question is relatively easy to answer, of course, never 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.630
 The WAK function There are several software vendors due to 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.670
 This bluescreen will offer time any software for example repair 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.370
 software vendor or similar is supposed to and of course they have to test if that 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.580
 whole country works included of course Microsoft because so industry 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.160
 is usually an image of the memory stored on the computer or if 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.110
 you also test if it works and not so long at vomiting 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.690
 screw hardware error until the then hopefully occur 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.220
 why very briefly downloaded their programmatic the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.280
 Description with Sion is supposed to link to Defensine Description Â«Not My 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.360
 fault means the whole AXA recorded Sara Lee's directory works well 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.770
 under 32 we or 64-bit again full texts just click on it all over 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.400
 Just pick out the whole bug here that the men like to have 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.919
 I just want it 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:17.899

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.639
 if you take anything, Mr. Roth 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.739
 Eyes Cancer Green is of course always gladly taken but I believe now 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.499
 just at red 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.949
 at the end click on play 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.200
 then simply wait here 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.290

 Craig m reaches once 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.769
 who mistakes should come now he had to be talked about it 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.279
 in this case under 4 o'clock that means now the situation will appear 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:49.639
 the store so packed in the background 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.079
 it can take a minute until it overflows. " 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.759
 can surely choose something else

 there are plenty of faster so scores waiting 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.720
 but at some point he rested and shows us our modified blue screen 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.339
 our irritated him in this case 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.149
 As I said, they do not really make sense afterwards 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:16.149
 nor her monitor the professional colleague
