00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
seconds I'm going to release a curl but

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.190 
seconds I'm going to release a curl but
I'm<00:00:47.670> gonna<00:00:47.820> hold<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.079> this

I'm gonna hold on to it like so and this

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.630 
I'm gonna hold on to it like so and this
helps<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.620> curl<00:00:49.860> stay<00:00:50.190> longer

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
helps a curl stay longer

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.090 
helps a curl stay longer
it<00:00:50.789> works<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.449> roller<00:00:51.750> okay<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.949> is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
it works like a roller okay so this is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.500 
it works like a roller okay so this is
that<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.430> take<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> bottom<00:00:53.969> section<00:00:54.180> knife

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
that if I take the bottom section knife

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.110 
that if I take the bottom section knife
and<00:00:54.870> again<00:00:55.469> curling<00:00:55.890> away<00:00:56.100> from<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> face<00:00:56.640> for

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and again curling away from the face for

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.619 
and again curling away from the face for
about<00:00:57.180> 10<00:00:57.449> seconds<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:59.539> release<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.840> hold

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
about 10 seconds and release and hold

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.230 
about 10 seconds and release and hold
I'm<00:01:03.629> how<00:01:04.350> long<00:01:04.559> should<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.949> hold<00:01:05.220> maybe<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.030> few

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
I'm how long should you hold maybe a few

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.179 
I'm how long should you hold maybe a few
moments<00:01:06.630> maybe<00:01:06.810> use<00:01:07.049> six<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.470> seven<00:01:07.740> seconds

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
moments maybe use six or seven seconds

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.620 
moments maybe use six or seven seconds
they're<00:01:08.700> gonna<00:01:08.880> work<00:01:09.060> with<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.390> next

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
they're gonna work with the next

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.750 
they're gonna work with the next
vertical<00:01:10.049> section<00:01:10.890> again<00:01:11.220> starting<00:01:11.580> at<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
vertical section again starting at the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.510 
vertical section again starting at the
top<00:01:11.939> holding<00:01:12.720> ten<00:01:12.960> seconds<00:01:13.560> releasing<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
top holding ten seconds releasing and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.760 
top holding ten seconds releasing and
hold<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:17.540> find<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.630> technique<00:01:19.020> pretty<00:01:19.320> handy

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
hold I find this technique pretty handy

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.200 
hold I find this technique pretty handy
because<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.250> other<00:01:20.520> methods<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.119> can

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
because with other methods I can

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300 
because with other methods I can
struggle<00:01:21.840> even<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.530> divide<00:01:22.890> my<00:01:22.920> hair<00:01:23.220> in

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
struggle even if I divide my hair in

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
struggle even if I divide my hair in
sections<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:24.000> clips<00:01:24.240> or<00:01:24.390> whatsoever<00:01:24.750> there's

sections of clips or whatsoever there's
always<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.770> few<00:01:25.920> straight<00:01:26.220> pieces<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.119> this

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
always a few straight pieces so this

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.090 
always a few straight pieces so this
little<00:01:27.570> trick<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.810> handy<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:28.920> see

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.550 
little trick is handy and you can see
even<00:01:29.250> though<00:01:29.640> I'm<00:01:29.990> releasing<00:01:30.990> my<00:01:31.110> curl<00:01:31.380> I'm

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
even though I'm releasing my curl I'm

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.230 
even though I'm releasing my curl I'm
just<00:01:31.890> leaving<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.310> don't<00:01:32.640> try<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> move<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
just leaving it don't try to move it I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.330 
just leaving it don't try to move it I
leave<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.439> continuing<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
leave it for now so continuing in the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
leave it for now so continuing in the
vertical<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.000> section<00:01:36.420> you're<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> keep

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
vertical in section you're going to keep

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.789 
vertical in section you're going to keep
working<00:01:37.170> until<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.979> reach<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> back

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
working until you reach the back

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.219 
working until you reach the back
this<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:40.490> kind<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.729> reason<00:01:41.359> why<00:01:41.539> I<00:01:41.840> don't

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
this is kind of reason why I don't

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.169 
this is kind of reason why I don't
really<00:01:42.409> do<00:01:42.590> curling<00:01:43.100> hair<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.399> trophy<00:01:43.969> face

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
around this side this is actually my

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.050 
around this side this is actually my
favorite<00:02:24.290> part<00:02:24.500> on<00:02:24.829> it<00:02:25.069> is<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.489> take<00:02:25.730> some

sections and we're going to divide them
into<00:02:28.959> two<00:02:29.959> so<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.650> separates<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.849> makes

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
into two so it separates and this makes

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.910 
into two so it separates and this makes
a<00:02:32.150> hair<00:02:32.420> like<00:02:32.630> so<00:02:32.840> much<00:02:33.019> more<00:02:33.230> volume<00:02:33.410> eyes<00:02:33.709> the
