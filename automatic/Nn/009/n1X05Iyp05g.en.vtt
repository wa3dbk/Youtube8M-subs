00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.240
 We need a story with 8 guajillo chiles

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.270
 touch of oil and 500 grams of leg 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.610
 of pork we start first in a pan 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.829
 at medium heat what we are going to do is 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.499
 add an oil dish 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.120
 there is good that comes and I know 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:57.649
 It is because my oil I do it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.649
 tinged with rosemary remains 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.940
 nothing more so that they begin little to 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.530
 soften and release their aromas and 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.110
 he started doing his job the oil with 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.729
 the garlic already released their essences now what 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.810
 what we are going to do is add the chiles 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:16.820
 dry because it is the juanillo the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.490
 Castilla peppers and the tree 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.650
 what are we going to do with a lot 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.870
 very careful here what we are going to do is 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.120
 nothing more what is that say they start to 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.479
 umar a little bit because that is going to be a 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.369
 characteristic flavor of our logo 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.950
 we can know when to stop 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.770
 it's cooking as soon as they start to drop 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.420
 its aromas nothing else we do not want it to 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.330
 burn us since they are dry chiles are 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.400
 very susceptible about that 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.350
 we like 30 seconds range without that 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.780
 start us your aromas and ready 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.520
 approximately about 30 seconds later 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.369
 what we are going to do is add the juice 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.759
 of orange and water already released all 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.759
 its aromas 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.890
 we're going to add it in cold guys a lot 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.409
 care and together with our juice 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.960
 orange 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.239
 german from scratch so nothing else after 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.430
 to let him read well between 5 and 8 minutes 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.470
 we already have discs already concentrated 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.209
 the flavors now you have to let it 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.190
 lukewarm because we can not liquefy it 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.780
 being hot what we are going to do is 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.209
 see what we have in our pan 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.430
 in our blender we are going to add 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.120
 our cloves 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.100
 there are the cumin and the touch of 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.520
 coriander 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:41.010
 let's put our factory there is 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:43.380
 and let's liquefy now what we're going to 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.500
 do is pour our sauce to our 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.440
 marinade in pork with the help of 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.800
 a strainer this so that what is the 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.930
 Chili skin does not stay and be a 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.200
 unpleasant taste 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.969

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.030

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:04.810

 the flavors 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.890
 and I'm living 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.700

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.700
 let's put a little more 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.840

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.159
 very good and preferable guys marinate what 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.860
 an entire night and if possible everything nor to 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.769
