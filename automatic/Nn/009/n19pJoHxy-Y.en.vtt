Photoshop go down and create a levels
adjustment<00:00:56.460> layer<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:58.579> using<00:00:59.579> this

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
adjustment layer and using this

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.209 
adjustment layer and using this
eyedropper<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> one<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> middle

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
eyedropper here the one in the middle

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.500 
eyedropper here the one in the middle
which<00:01:02.670> will<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> middle<00:01:03.930> gray<00:01:04.170> value

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.899 
and then I'll just save it as white
balance<00:01:51.149> I've<00:01:51.240> already<00:01:51.450> got<00:01:51.570> one<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:51.960> so

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
balance I've already got one there so

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.800 
balance I've already got one there so
say<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.470> yes<00:01:55.470> replace<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:57.360> has<00:01:57.540> saved

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
say that yes replace and that has saved

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.770 
say that yes replace and that has saved
your<00:01:58.500> levels<00:01:59.460> adjustment<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.090> then<00:02:00.540> what<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
your levels adjustment and then what you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.240 
your levels adjustment and then what you
can<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.110> later<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.860> bring<00:02:02.040> another

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
can do later on when you bring another

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.999 
can do later on when you bring another
image<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:03.530> let's<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.860> an<00:02:04.950> example

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
image in is let's just do an example

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.830 
image in is let's just do an example
here<00:02:05.369> orders<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.850> leave<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.210> levels

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
here orders to leave this levels

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.510 
here orders to leave this levels
adjustment<00:02:08.000> so<00:02:09.410> we'll<00:02:10.410> go<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.039> create<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.370> new

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
adjustment so we'll go and create a new

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.580 
adjustment so we'll go and create a new
levels<00:02:11.970> adjustment<00:02:12.390> here<00:02:12.569> you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
levels adjustment here you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.020 
levels adjustment here you
see<00:02:13.739> my<00:02:13.890> image<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.250> now<00:02:14.400> warm<00:02:15.000> again<00:02:16.819> now<00:02:17.819> what

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
see my image is now warm again now what

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.420 
see my image is now warm again now what
we'll<00:02:18.180> do<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.540> we'll<00:02:18.660> go<00:02:18.810> up<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.959> here<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.500> go

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
we'll do is we'll go up to here and go

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.770 
we'll do is we'll go up to here and go
to<00:02:20.489> load<00:02:21.000> levels<00:02:21.510> preset<00:02:22.550> we'll<00:02:23.550> find<00:02:23.910> white

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
to load levels preset we'll find white

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.869 
to load levels preset we'll find white
balance<00:02:25.200> preset<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.709> we<00:02:25.860> saved<00:02:26.160> there<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.730> is

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
balance preset that we saved there it is

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.869 
balance preset that we saved there it is
so<00:02:27.480> I'm<00:02:27.540> going<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.720> open<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.200> and

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
so I'm going to open that and

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.130 
so I'm going to open that and
automatically<00:02:29.879> you<00:02:30.120> see<00:02:30.299> it's<00:02:30.480> applied<00:02:30.870> that

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
automatically you see it's applied that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.559 
automatically you see it's applied that
saved<00:02:31.500> levels<00:02:32.280> preset<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.879> this<00:02:33.000> image<00:02:33.360> and

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
saved levels preset to this image and

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.600 
saved levels preset to this image and
now<00:02:34.110> my<00:02:34.290> white<00:02:34.470> balance<00:02:34.769> is<00:02:34.920> corrected<00:02:35.370> so

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
now my white balance is corrected so

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.039 
now my white balance is corrected so
that's<00:02:35.910> what<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.239> do<00:02:36.420> for<00:02:36.720> further

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
that's what you can do for further

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.309 
that's what you can do for further
images<00:02:37.610> let<00:02:38.610> me<00:02:38.700> show<00:02:38.879> you<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.269> quicker<00:02:39.540> way<00:02:39.660> for

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
images let me show you a quicker way for

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.580 
images let me show you a quicker way for
Lightroom<00:02:40.830> users<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:42.200> want<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.290> do<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.500> in

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
Lightroom users if you want to do it in

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.180 
Lightroom users if you want to do it in

so in Lightroom you just go to your

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.740 
so in Lightroom you just go to your
develop<00:02:47.010> module<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.579> under<00:02:48.209> your<00:02:48.329> basic

settings you will find this eyedropper

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.370 
settings you will find this eyedropper
tool<00:02:50.790> here<00:02:51.060> which<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.870> white<00:02:52.019> balance

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
tool here which is the white balance

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.680 
tool here which is the white balance
tool<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.190> can<00:02:53.519> just<00:02:53.640> select<00:02:53.819> that<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.450> do
