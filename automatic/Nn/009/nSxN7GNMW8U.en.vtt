 then how to make guides for 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.920
 sliding doors wardrobe 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.740

 you can look there and now for that 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:40.680
 to set us guides us 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.710
 need we need

 in lining 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.769
 guides will be mounted 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.700
 Drill a hole for screwdrivers 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.229
 slightly produce screws 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.580
 we apply the top guide and 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:20.170
 pushing down

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:29.140
 directing remove the bar here with us 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:33.219
 attachment points appeared on the marked 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:37.210
 places we drill a hole in which 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:43.000
 will be mounted in 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:48.670
 dowel hole hole like this 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.450
 way into one into one hole 2 so 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:57.670

 planoch in its place like this 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:15.370
 we will top lining headscarf 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.920
 attached similarly fasten lower

 the bar that will be attached lower 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.600
 door guide 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:28.799
 we also marked her drilled 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.799
 hole and fasten 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.319
 measure the distance inside it 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.310
 the distance we need to cut off 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.510
 and need long upper guides they 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.359
 we have the same top and bottom 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.870
 measure the length of the upper and lower 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.870
 guide rail 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:03:00.109
 mark up make a mark make a line 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:02.959
 reza same we do it here 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.510
 was the top guide and this is ours 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.780
 lower guides which will be 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.840
 ride the wheels on it will just 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.909
 stand the door 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:23.659
 mark the length of the slice of this guide 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:25.819
 make a mark and mark the place of cut by 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:29.409
 our marks cut length 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.409
 top rail first 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:52.510
 the same cut off the bottom guide 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:55.030
 it is necessary to cut with the reverse 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.299
 hand is not a side duck 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.939
 and walk the wheels because you can 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.840
 scratch the front surface and will 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.840
 unsightly look 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.099
 here we have a guide now 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.400
 mark on the mounting rail 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:19.680
 the first hole on them is not guides 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.680
 drill a hole for screwdrivers 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.530
 similar fix we drill fixing 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:32.050
 mounting hole top 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.880
 directing it is desirable to do this with 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:41.500
 uniform step to be symmetrical 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:44.520
 beautifully fasten the lower guide to 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.520
 lower support bar 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:58.350
 and fasten the top guide to 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:05:02.810
 upper support bar here we secured 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:05.640
