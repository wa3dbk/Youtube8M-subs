in<00:00:04.370> this<00:00:05.370> video<00:00:05.640> I'm<00:00:05.760> going<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.940> show<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.180> how

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:06.630 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.250 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:06.690> divide<00:00:07.440> mixed<00:00:08.280> numbers<00:00:08.540> when<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
to divide mixed numbers when one of the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.200 
to divide mixed numbers when one of the
numbers<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> whole<00:00:11.250> number<00:00:11.730> either<00:00:11.850> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
numbers is a whole number either the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.150 
numbers is a whole number either the
number<00:00:12.510> in<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.660> front<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.200> being<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.920> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
number in the front is being is the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.620 
number in the front is being is the
whole<00:00:14.310> number<00:00:14.640> or<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.000> number<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> back

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
whole number or the number in the back

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.859 
whole number or the number in the back
is<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.439> whole<00:00:16.590> number<00:00:17.300> so<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> first<00:00:18.630> step

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
is the whole number so the first step

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.720 
is the whole number so the first step
when<00:00:19.050> dividing<00:00:19.740> mixed<00:00:19.890> numbers<00:00:20.040> is<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.640> have

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
when dividing mixed numbers is you have

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.390 
when dividing mixed numbers is you have
to<00:00:20.849> change<00:00:21.119> everything<00:00:21.570> into<00:00:21.750> fractions<00:00:22.400> so

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
to change everything into fractions so

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.970 
to change everything into fractions so
to<00:00:23.610> turn<00:00:23.849> a<00:00:23.880> 12<00:00:24.300> into<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> fraction<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.529> just

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
to turn a 12 into a fraction you just

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.150 
to turn a 12 into a fraction you just
put<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.640> right<00:00:26.669> on<00:00:26.790> top<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.270> a<00:00:27.360> 1<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.919> then<00:00:28.919> to

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
put it right on top of a 1 and then to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.429 
put it right on top of a 1 and then to
turn<00:00:29.369> three<00:00:29.790> and<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.939> third<00:00:30.180> into<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> fraction

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
turn three and a third into a fraction

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.020 
turn three and a third into a fraction
this<00:00:31.829> is<00:00:32.040> going<00:00:32.220> to<00:00:32.279> be<00:00:32.369> an<00:00:32.460> improper<00:00:32.820> fraction

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
this is going to be an improper fraction

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.139 
this is going to be an improper fraction
3<00:00:33.750> times<00:00:33.989> 3<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.260> 9<00:00:34.350> plus<00:00:34.829> 1<00:00:35.220> is<00:00:35.280> 10<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:36.000> you've

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
3 times 3 is 9 plus 1 is 10 so you've

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.709 
3 times 3 is 9 plus 1 is 10 so you've
got<00:00:36.329> 10<00:00:36.920> thirds<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.910> division<00:00:39.300> symbol

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
got 10 thirds and that division symbol

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.509 
got 10 thirds and that division symbol
stays<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.739> division<00:00:41.730> right<00:00:41.940> now<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:43.519> you

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
stays as division right now and then you

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.840 
stays as division right now and then you
multiply<00:00:44.789> by<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.660> reciprocal<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> second

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
multiply by the reciprocal of the second

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.930 
multiply by the reciprocal of the second
fraction<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.510> 12<00:00:48.870> stays<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.589> a<00:00:49.620> 12<00:00:50.010> over<00:00:50.309> 1<00:00:50.339> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
fraction so 12 stays is a 12 over 1 the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.869 
fraction so 12 stays is a 12 over 1 the
division<00:00:51.449> turns<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.989> multiplication<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
division turns to multiplication and the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.479 
division turns to multiplication and the
10<00:00:54.359> over<00:00:54.629> 3<00:00:54.980> becomes<00:00:55.980> 3<00:00:56.579> over<00:00:57.359> 10<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:59.039> we

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
10 over 3 becomes 3 over 10 and then we

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.419 
10 over 3 becomes 3 over 10 and then we
multiply<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.839> I<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.769> cross<00:01:01.949> cancel

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
multiply but I like to cross cancel

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.210 
multiply but I like to cross cancel
first<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.050> 12<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.949> 10

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
first and I see that the 12 and the 10

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.590 
first and I see that the 12 and the 10
are<00:01:05.460> both<00:01:05.519> divisible<00:01:06.450> by<00:01:06.930> 2<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.970> 12<00:01:08.970> divided<00:01:09.450> by

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
are both divisible by 2 so 12 divided by

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.900 
are both divisible by 2 so 12 divided by
2<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:10.260> 6<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.070> 10<00:01:12.060> divided<00:01:12.570> by<00:01:12.690> 2<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.350> 5<00:01:13.800> and<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
2 is 6 and 10 divided by 2 is 5 and that

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.110 
2 is 6 and 10 divided by 2 is 5 and that
way<00:01:15.120> we<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.510> multiply<00:01:15.870> and<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.890> get<00:01:17.070> 6<00:01:17.430> times<00:01:17.730> 3

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
way we can multiply and we get 6 times 3

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.560 
way we can multiply and we get 6 times 3
is<00:01:18.450> 18<00:01:19.260> over<00:01:21.050> and<00:01:22.050> then<00:01:22.560> 1<00:01:22.770> times<00:01:23.070> 5<00:01:23.370> is<00:01:23.400> 5<00:01:23.730> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
is 18 over and then 1 times 5 is 5 and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.100 
is 18 over and then 1 times 5 is 5 and
that's<00:01:25.500> an<00:01:25.740> improper<00:01:26.400> fraction<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.270> 18<00:01:27.660> over<00:01:27.900> 5

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that's an improper fraction so 18 over 5

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.890 
that's an improper fraction so 18 over 5
is<00:01:28.380> improper<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.010> 5<00:01:29.250> goes<00:01:29.280> into<00:01:29.520> 18<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.780> I'll

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
is improper so 5 goes into 18 and I'll

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.620 
is improper so 5 goes into 18 and I'll
write<00:01:31.080> it<00:01:31.200> right<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.440> 5<00:01:32.370> goes<00:01:32.610> into<00:01:32.640> 18<00:01:33.240> 3

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
write it right here 5 goes into 18 3

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.760 
write it right here 5 goes into 18 3
times<00:01:34.340> with<00:01:35.340> 3<00:01:35.790> left<00:01:36.270> over<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.110> our<00:01:37.380> final

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
times with 3 left over so our final

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.730 
times with 3 left over so our final
answer<00:01:37.980> there<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.670> 3<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.920> 3/5<00:01:42.530> let's<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:43.650> it

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
answer there is 3 and 3/5 let's do it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.370 
answer there is 3 and 3/5 let's do it
again<00:01:43.830> down<00:01:44.160> here<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.120> time<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.170> whole

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
again down here this time it's the whole

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.950 
again down here this time it's the whole
numbers<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.980> back<00:01:47.190> same<00:01:48.060> process<00:01:48.690> though

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
numbers in the back same process though

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.050 
numbers in the back same process though
we<00:01:49.200> first<00:01:49.560> begin<00:01:50.010> by<00:01:50.040> turning<00:01:50.250> both<00:01:50.730> of<00:01:50.940> these

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
we first begin by turning both of these

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.600 
we first begin by turning both of these
numbers<00:01:51.270> into<00:01:51.810> an<00:01:51.900> improper<00:01:52.440> fraction<00:01:52.610> 5

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
numbers into an improper fraction 5

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.760 
numbers into an improper fraction 5
times<00:01:53.970> 4<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.300> 20<00:01:54.420> plus<00:01:55.020> 1<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.260> 21<00:01:55.430> over<00:01:56.600> 4

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
times 4 is 20 plus 1 is 21 over 4

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.380 
times 4 is 20 plus 1 is 21 over 4
divided<00:01:58.770> by<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:58.980> stays<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.880> divided<00:02:00.300> by

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
divided by this stays is divided by

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.120 
divided by this stays is divided by
right<00:02:00.630> now<00:02:00.660> and<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.680> 7<00:02:02.040> becomes<00:02:02.400> 7<00:02:02.880> over<00:02:03.270> 1<00:02:03.480> and

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
right now and the 7 becomes 7 over 1 and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.029 
right now and the 7 becomes 7 over 1 and
then<00:02:05.130> next<00:02:05.700> step<00:02:05.940> first<00:02:06.720> fraction<00:02:07.410> stays<00:02:07.440> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
then next step first fraction stays the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.680 
then next step first fraction stays the
same<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:10.709> taught<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.220> division<00:02:11.760> symbol<00:02:12.030> turns

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
same the taught a division symbol turns

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.440 
same the taught a division symbol turns
into<00:02:12.990> multiplication<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:14.040> then<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.970> 7<00:02:15.330> over

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
into multiplication and then the 7 over

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.770 
into multiplication and then the 7 over
1<00:02:15.600> becomes<00:02:16.260> 1<00:02:16.620> over<00:02:16.860> 7

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
1 becomes 1 over 7

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.350 
1 becomes 1 over 7
and<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:18.740> like<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.190> cross-cancel<00:02:19.760> it's<00:02:20.240> an

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
and I like to cross-cancel it's an

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.240 
and I like to cross-cancel it's an
optional<00:02:20.810> step<00:02:21.080> but<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.380> like<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.950> do<00:02:22.100> it

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
optional step but I like to do it

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.510 
optional step but I like to do it
because<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.730> saves<00:02:23.000> time<00:02:23.300> later<00:02:23.740> 21<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:24.950> 7<00:02:25.340> are

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
because it saves time later 21 and 7 are

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.620 
because it saves time later 21 and 7 are
both<00:02:25.850> divisible<00:02:26.600> by<00:02:27.020> 7<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.490> 21<00:02:28.970> divided<00:02:29.510> by<00:02:29.540> 7

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
both divisible by 7 so 21 divided by 7

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.380 
both divisible by 7 so 21 divided by 7
is<00:02:30.290> 3<00:02:30.790> 7<00:02:31.790> divided<00:02:32.210> by<00:02:32.240> 7<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.960> 1<00:02:33.580> so<00:02:34.580> now<00:02:34.790> we've

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
is 3 7 divided by 7 is 1 so now we've

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.949 
is 3 7 divided by 7 is 1 so now we've
got<00:02:35.660> 3<00:02:36.380> times<00:02:36.740> 1<00:02:37.160> in<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.700> numerator<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:38.510> 3

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
got 3 times 1 in the numerator is 3

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.040 
got 3 times 1 in the numerator is 3
we've<00:02:39.890> got<00:02:40.040> 4<00:02:40.370> times<00:02:40.700> 1<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.450> denominator

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
we've got 4 times 1 and the denominator

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.790 
we've got 4 times 1 and the denominator
is<00:02:42.140> 4<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.030> 3/4<00:02:44.030> cannot<00:02:44.510> be<00:02:44.780> simplified<00:02:45.500> in<00:02:45.650> any

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
is 4 and 3/4 cannot be simplified in any

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.780 
is 4 and 3/4 cannot be simplified in any
way<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.520> that<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:47.000> our<00:02:47.209> final<00:02:47.600> answer
