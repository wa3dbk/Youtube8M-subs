albums I sometimes I feel like they

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.170 
albums I sometimes I feel like they
don't<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.079> much<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> song<00:01:01.859> or<00:01:02.250> they<00:01:02.940> make

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
don't do much for the song or they make

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.359 
don't do much for the song or they make
yeah<00:01:03.960> they<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.229> change<00:01:04.680> up<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> song<00:01:05.159> too

much<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.760> don't<00:01:05.939> know<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.689> remixes<00:01:07.350> on

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
much I don't know but the remixes on

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.130 
much I don't know but the remixes on
this<00:01:07.710> album<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.250> loved<00:01:08.790> each<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.479> every<00:01:09.900> single

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
this album I loved each and every single

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.550 
this album I loved each and every single
one<00:01:10.439> because<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.790> definitely<00:01:12.390> adds<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
one because it definitely adds to the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.679 
one because it definitely adds to the
original<00:01:14.430> song<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.970> doesn't<00:01:15.360> try<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.509> take

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
original song it doesn't try to take

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.280 
original song it doesn't try to take
away<00:01:16.140> anything<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:17.970> adds<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.630> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
away anything but it just adds like a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.230 
away anything but it just adds like a
more<00:01:19.970> more<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.270> don't<00:01:21.540> know<00:01:21.810> more<00:01:22.820> it's<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.939> remix

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
more more I don't know more it's a remix

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.660 
more more I don't know more it's a remix
it<00:01:24.479> adds<00:01:24.689> more<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.409> song<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.070> obviously

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it adds more to the song and obviously

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.359 
it adds more to the song and obviously
the<00:01:26.850> original<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.360> original<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:29.009> great

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the original is original and it's great

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.690 
the original is original and it's great
but<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.180> definitely<00:01:30.630> do<00:01:31.020> love<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.829> remixes<00:01:32.430> and

here's<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.220> photo<00:02:27.460> book<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.070> like<00:02:30.430> a

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
here's the photo book so it is like a

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.530 
here's the photo book so it is like a
bug<00:02:30.820> I<00:02:32.460> think<00:02:33.460> some<00:02:33.670> people<00:02:33.790> might<00:02:34.120> not<00:02:34.330> like

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
bug I think some people might not like

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.020 
bug I think some people might not like
the<00:02:34.840> fact<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.230> it's<00:02:35.700> simple<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:37.000> doesn't

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
the fact that it's simple and it doesn't

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.320 
the fact that it's simple and it doesn't
have<00:02:37.570> much<00:02:38.230> detail<00:02:38.800> like<00:02:39.100> there's<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.700> lot<00:02:40.150> of

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
have much detail like there's a lot of

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.070 
have much detail like there's a lot of
white<00:02:40.840> space<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.670> do<00:02:43.090> think<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.780> it

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
white space but I do think that it

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.710 
white space but I do think that it
sticks<00:02:44.380> true<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:47.440> cover<00:02:47.740> as<00:02:48.070> well

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
sticks true to the the cover as well

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.460 
sticks true to the the cover as well
with<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:50.530> know<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:51.670> not<00:02:51.940> having<00:02:52.300> much<00:02:52.570> it's<00:02:53.320> a

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
with you know it not having much it's a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.470 
with you know it not having much it's a
the<00:02:53.830> font<00:02:54.670> right<00:02:55.000> here

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
the font right here

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.290 
the font right here
but<00:02:56.140> yes<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:58.650> but<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.710> do<00:02:59.830> like<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.760> what

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
but yes so but I do like the what

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.420

they're<00:03:01.480> wearing<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:02.170> think<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.620> does<00:03:03.220> have

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
they're wearing I think it does have

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.250 
they're wearing I think it does have
that<00:03:03.640> beachy<00:03:04.210> summer<00:03:06.570> type<00:03:07.570> of<00:03:07.810> look<00:03:08.230> for<00:03:08.530> them

simple<00:05:02.210> but<00:05:03.199> it<00:05:03.469> doesn't<00:05:03.919> try<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.810> hide<00:05:05.810> that<00:05:06.169> I

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
simple but it doesn't try to hide that I

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.570 
simple but it doesn't try to hide that I
think<00:05:07.930> if<00:05:08.930> I<00:05:09.110> was<00:05:09.379> looking<00:05:09.740> at<00:05:09.860> this<00:05:10.069> I<00:05:10.310> would

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
think if I was looking at this I would

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.059 
think if I was looking at this I would
definitely<00:05:11.389> think<00:05:11.419> that<00:05:11.810> you<00:05:12.770> know<00:05:12.919> the

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:13.069 
definitely think that you know the

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.580 
definitely think that you know the
pictures<00:05:13.490> would<00:05:13.639> be<00:05:13.819> simple<00:05:14.330> but<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.050> like<00:05:15.319> that

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
pictures would be simple but I like that

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.589 
pictures would be simple but I like that
I<00:05:15.889> think<00:05:15.949> it<00:05:16.310> just<00:05:16.550> stick<00:05:16.849> truth<00:05:17.150> to<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:17.569> whole

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
I think it just stick truth to the whole

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:22.930 
I think it just stick truth to the whole
summer<00:05:18.460> approach<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:19.940> yes<00:05:21.430> so<00:05:22.430> that's<00:05:22.580> all

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
summer approach and yes so that's all

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.629 
summer approach and yes so that's all
