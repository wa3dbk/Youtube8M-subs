of<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:52.900> has<00:04:53.020> 135<00:04:53.680> in<00:04:54.069> the<00:04:54.879> laminar<00:04:55.840> motor

of it has 135 in the laminar motor

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.730 
of it has 135 in the laminar motor
that's<00:04:56.259> 100<00:04:56.680> right<00:04:57.159> so<00:04:58.020> when<00:04:59.020> they<00:04:59.139> know<00:04:59.319> that

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
that's 100 right so when they know that

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.580 
that's 100 right so when they know that
they<00:05:00.490> can<00:05:00.669> do<00:05:00.819> what<00:05:01.180> a<00:05:01.569> do<00:05:02.020> surgery<00:05:02.440> on<00:05:02.469> a

they can do what a do surgery on a

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.619 
they can do what a do surgery on a
patient<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:03.280> have<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:04.000> less<00:05:04.240> chance<00:05:04.419> of

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:04.629

infection<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:07.300> better<00:05:07.690> outcome<00:05:07.960> that's

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
infection and a better outcome that's

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.260 
infection and a better outcome that's
what<00:05:08.590> their<00:05:09.120> temperature<00:05:10.120> humidity

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
what their temperature humidity

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.930 
what their temperature humidity
stability<00:05:11.229> is<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:11.830> lot<00:05:11.979> better<00:05:12.190> because<00:05:12.520> of<00:05:12.849> the

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
stability is a lot better because of the

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.540 
stability is a lot better because of the
newer<00:05:13.349> controls<00:05:14.349> compared<00:05:14.979> to<00:05:15.099> the<00:05:15.219> older

big difference before we have the

horizontal laminar airflow and then then

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.160 
horizontal laminar airflow and then then
we<00:06:20.430> have<00:06:20.550> the<00:06:20.670> vertical<00:06:21.120> with<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.420> horizontal

than<00:06:27.300> it<00:06:27.570> used<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.960> be<00:06:28.080> correct<00:06:28.710> yes<00:06:29.070> it's<00:06:29.430> a

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
than it used to be correct yes it's a

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
lot brighter and a better life okay so

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.100 
lot brighter and a better life okay so
easier<00:06:32.040> to<00:06:32.160> see<00:06:32.340> uh-huh<00:06:32.790> I<00:06:32.970> came<00:06:33.270> in<00:06:33.420> at<00:06:33.840> the

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
easier to see uh-huh I came in at the

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.540 
end of the project but just other
facilities<00:06:35.910> I've<00:06:36.060> worked<00:06:36.270> in<00:06:36.480> I<00:06:37.230> think<00:06:37.890> the

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
facilities I've worked in I think the

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.840 
facilities I've worked in I think the
design<00:06:39.530> for<00:06:40.530> me<00:06:40.680> it's<00:06:40.830> been<00:06:40.980> much<00:06:41.160> you<00:06:41.730> know

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
design for me it's been much you know

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.400 
design for me it's been much you know
easier<00:06:42.150> to<00:06:42.240> work<00:06:42.390> with<00:06:42.450> it's<00:06:43.050> a<00:06:43.140> lot<00:06:43.260> better

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
easier to work with it's a lot better

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.750 
easier to work with it's a lot better
like<00:06:43.590> I<00:06:43.620> like<00:06:43.920> the<00:06:44.010> coloring<00:06:44.310> room<00:06:44.520> is<00:06:44.610> a<00:06:44.700> lot

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
like I like the coloring room is a lot

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.760 
like I like the coloring room is a lot
brighter<00:06:45.030> the<00:06:45.630> noise<00:06:45.840> level<00:06:46.440> I<00:06:46.500> think<00:06:46.680> is

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
brighter the noise level I think is

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.900 
brighter the noise level I think is
quite<00:06:46.980> a<00:06:47.100> bit<00:06:47.250> different<00:06:47.550> than<00:06:47.580> what<00:06:47.760> I've

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
quite a bit different than what I've

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.180 
quite a bit different than what I've
been<00:06:48.090> used<00:06:48.420> to<00:06:48.570> in<00:06:48.660> the<00:06:48.720> past<00:06:48.960> you<00:06:49.890> know<00:06:49.920> with

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
been used to in the past you know with

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.130 
been used to in the past you know with
with<00:06:50.490> the<00:06:50.700> air<00:06:50.850> club<00:06:51.090> knowing<00:06:51.510> that<00:06:51.840> it's<00:06:52.020> a

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.140 
with the air club knowing that it's a

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.770 
with the air club knowing that it's a
lot<00:06:52.320> higher<00:06:52.650> more<00:06:53.430> air<00:06:53.880> exchanges<00:06:54.420> with<00:06:54.600> this

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
lot higher more air exchanges with this

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.600 
lot higher more air exchanges with this
system<00:06:54.990> we<00:06:55.890> thought<00:06:56.100> it<00:06:56.220> was<00:06:56.280> going<00:06:56.460> to<00:06:56.520> be

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
system we thought it was going to be

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.490 
system we thought it was going to be
really<00:06:56.910> loud<00:06:57.090> and<00:06:57.450> it's<00:06:57.630> not<00:06:57.870> what<00:06:58.260> the<00:06:58.350> other

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
really loud and it's not what the other

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.550 
really loud and it's not what the other
system<00:06:59.070> it<00:06:59.280> was<00:06:59.460> kind<00:06:59.790> of<00:06:59.850> loud<00:07:00.000> and<00:07:00.560> constant

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
system it was kind of loud and constant

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.680 
system it was kind of loud and constant
buzzing<00:07:02.280> noise<00:07:02.520> and<00:07:02.910> stuff<00:07:03.120> with<00:07:03.330> this<00:07:03.480> one

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
buzzing noise and stuff with this one

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.600 
buzzing noise and stuff with this one
it's<00:07:03.840> it's<00:07:04.170> pretty<00:07:04.470> good<00:07:04.740> okay<00:07:05.340> and<00:07:05.370> we're

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 
it's it's pretty good okay and we're

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.570 
it's it's pretty good okay and we're
actually<00:07:05.850> right<00:07:06.480> now<00:07:06.660> it's<00:07:06.690> operating<00:07:07.590> at<00:07:07.890> how

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 
actually right now it's operating at how

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.630 
actually right now it's operating at how
many<00:07:08.730> air<00:07:08.910> changes<00:07:09.270> 30<00:07:09.660> 35<00:07:10.320> 35<00:07:10.860> air<00:07:11.070> changes<00:07:11.430> so

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:11.640 
many air changes 30 35 35 air changes so

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.880 
many air changes 30 35 35 air changes so
you're<00:07:11.850> operating<00:07:12.330> at<00:07:13.110> what's<00:07:13.410> higher<00:07:13.620> than

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:13.890 
you're operating at what's higher than

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.490 
you're operating at what's higher than
what<00:07:14.010> a<00:07:14.040> lot<00:07:14.400> of<00:07:14.430> hospitals<00:07:15.000> do<00:07:15.180> and<00:07:16.050> here

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 
what a lot of hospitals do and here

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.990 
what a lot of hospitals do and here
we're<00:07:16.650> having<00:07:16.740> a<00:07:16.920> conversation<00:07:17.100> and<00:07:17.700> we<00:07:17.850> can

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
we're having a conversation and we can

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.340 
we're having a conversation and we can
talk<00:07:18.210> to<00:07:18.480> spine<00:07:18.690> without<00:07:18.930> having<00:07:19.140> to<00:07:19.200> raise

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350 
talk to spine without having to raise

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.140 
talk to spine without having to raise
our<00:07:19.500> voices<00:07:19.680> too<00:07:19.980> much<00:07:20.130> right<00:07:20.550> okay<00:07:20.970> that's

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150 
our voices too much right okay that's

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.190 
our voices too much right okay that's
kind<00:07:21.420> of<00:07:21.450> nice<00:07:22.430> we<00:07:23.430> wanted<00:07:23.850> these<00:07:24.200> plenums

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
kind of nice we wanted these plenums

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.600 
kind of nice we wanted these plenums
built<00:07:25.590> by<00:07:26.160> it<00:07:26.220> on<00:07:26.430> there<00:07:26.670> at<00:07:26.790> the<00:07:26.910> factory<00:07:27.450> so

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.610 
built by it on there at the factory so

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.860 
built by it on there at the factory so
actually<00:07:29.610> everything<00:07:29.820> was<00:07:30.090> manufactured

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:30.870 
actually everything was manufactured

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.470 
actually everything was manufactured
demo<00:07:31.080> sixteenth<00:07:31.740> of<00:07:31.920> an<00:07:32.070> inch<00:07:32.220> in<00:07:33.060> order<00:07:33.330> for

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.480 
demo sixteenth of an inch in order for

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.780 
demo sixteenth of an inch in order for
these<00:07:33.570> bolt<00:07:34.320> holes<00:07:34.470> to<00:07:35.010> match<00:07:35.160> up<00:07:35.490> for<00:07:35.520> the

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:35.790 
these bolt holes to match up for the

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.940 
these bolt holes to match up for the
patterns<00:07:36.240> and<00:07:36.480> then<00:07:37.110> getting<00:07:37.350> the<00:07:37.560> air<00:07:37.740> to

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:37.950 
patterns and then getting the air to

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.790 
patterns and then getting the air to
come<00:07:38.160> through<00:07:38.430> the

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 
come through the

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.999 
come through the
around<00:07:39.490> these<00:07:39.669> bloom<00:07:39.970> supports<00:07:40.599> so<00:07:40.840> that<00:07:41.800> was

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:42.009 
around these bloom supports so that was

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:46.320 
around these bloom supports so that was
that<00:07:42.370> was<00:07:42.810> hugely<00:07:44.699> we<00:07:45.699> had<00:07:45.819> a<00:07:45.849> very<00:07:46.150> low

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:46.330 
that was hugely we had a very low

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.070 
that was hugely we had a very low
infection<00:07:46.840> rate<00:07:47.020> going<00:07:47.560> into<00:07:47.889> this<00:07:48.039> but<00:07:49.080> my

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 
infection rate going into this but my

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.760 
infection rate going into this but my
understanding<00:07:50.280> the<00:07:51.280> rates<00:07:51.490> have<00:07:51.669> dropped<00:07:51.819> so

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:52.770 
understanding the rates have dropped so

00:07:52.770 --> 00:08:02.170 
understanding the rates have dropped so
that's<00:07:53.770> good<00:07:53.979> to<00:07:54.069> know

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:02.180 

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.240
