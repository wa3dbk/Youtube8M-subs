from<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.689> craft

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
from a craft

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.000 
from a craft
or<00:02:15.360> any<00:02:15.780> sort<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.110> trimmer<00:02:16.410> embellishments

that<00:02:17.040> they<00:02:17.220> have<00:02:17.400> there<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.910> think<00:02:18.330> it'd<00:02:18.570> be

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
that they have there I think it'd be

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.230 
that they have there I think it'd be
easier<00:02:18.720> because<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.680> fabric<00:02:20.190> will<00:02:20.760> be<00:02:20.790> easier

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
easier because the fabric will be easier

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.270 
easier because the fabric will be easier
to<00:02:21.270> use<00:02:21.570> hair<00:02:21.780> pins<00:02:21.930> with<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:22.800> we're<00:02:22.950> gonna<00:02:23.070> go

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
to use hair pins with but we're gonna go

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.680

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
we're gonna start at the top because

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.940 
we're gonna start at the top because
hers<00:02:32.910> kind<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.420> goes<00:02:33.600> around<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.500> bun<00:02:34.680> and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
hers kind of goes around the bun and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.130 
hers kind of goes around the bun and
then<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.730> kind<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:35.970> crosses<00:02:36.180> through<00:02:36.840> so

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140
