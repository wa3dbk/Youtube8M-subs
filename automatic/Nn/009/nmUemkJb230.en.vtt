in this video I will show you how to

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.850 
in this video I will show you how to
practice<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.549> pipe<00:00:08.879> role<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.990> pipe<00:00:10.289> role<00:00:10.590> is

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
practice the pipe role the pipe role is

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.829 
practice the pipe role the pipe role is
the<00:00:11.040> one<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.400> great<00:00:11.670> way<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:11.969> learn<00:00:12.360> how<00:00:12.690> to

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:12.839 
the one of the great way to learn how to

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.530 
the one of the great way to learn how to
use<00:00:13.259> your<00:00:13.290> momentum<00:00:13.879> but<00:00:14.879> since<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> pipe

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
use your momentum but since the pipe

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.780 
use your momentum but since the pipe
role<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:16.049> not<00:00:16.230> quite<00:00:16.470> easy<00:00:16.890> role<00:00:17.250> for<00:00:17.580> some

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
role is not quite easy role for some

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.400 
role is not quite easy role for some
people<00:00:18.240> let's<00:00:18.960> practice<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.649> straddle<00:00:20.160> first

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
people let's practice the straddle first

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.350 
people let's practice the straddle first
okay<00:00:22.410> from<00:00:22.619> your<00:00:22.680> sitting<00:00:23.130> position<00:00:23.360> after

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
okay from your sitting position after

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.510 
okay from your sitting position after
you<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.599> enough<00:00:24.840> stretching<00:00:25.590> side<00:00:26.040> to<00:00:26.279> side

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
you do enough stretching side to side

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.060 
you do enough stretching side to side
and<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.419> middle<00:00:27.840> now<00:00:28.439> put<00:00:28.739> your<00:00:28.890> both

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
and in the middle now put your both

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.490 
and in the middle now put your both
hands<00:00:29.489> between<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:30.239> legs<00:00:30.450> and<00:00:30.809> bring<00:00:31.349> your

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
hands between your legs and bring your

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.410 
hands between your legs and bring your
provided<00:00:31.919> all<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.160> way<00:00:32.640> down<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> floor

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
provided all the way down to the floor

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.750 
provided all the way down to the floor
the<00:00:34.320> same<00:00:34.559> time<00:00:34.920> push<00:00:35.519> the<00:00:35.789> floor<00:00:36.089> to<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.780> up

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
the same time push the floor to get up

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.209 
the same time push the floor to get up
but<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.789> say<00:00:39.149> you're<00:00:39.359> not<00:00:39.539> very<00:00:39.809> flexible<00:00:40.219> even

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
but I say you're not very flexible even

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.549 
but I say you're not very flexible even
though<00:00:41.339> you<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.820> right<00:00:42.030> way<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.359> do<00:00:42.749> it<00:00:42.989> if

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
though you do the right way to do it if

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.669 
though you do the right way to do it if
you<00:00:43.890> still<00:00:44.339> can<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:44.969> out<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.749> is<00:00:45.929> time<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.440> use

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:46.679 
you still can get out it is time to use

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:54.080 
you still can get out it is time to use
your<00:00:46.710> momentum

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.690 

okay<00:00:54.780> now<00:00:54.900> let's<00:00:55.110> practice<00:00:55.290> pipe<00:00:55.800> role<00:00:56.100> type

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
okay now let's practice pipe role type

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.910 
okay now let's practice pipe role type
role<00:00:57.030> apply<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.480> same<00:00:57.810> principle<00:00:58.470> just<00:00:58.740> like

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
role apply the same principle just like

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.490 
role apply the same principle just like
we<00:00:59.070> did<00:00:59.220> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.490> straddle<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.810> a<00:01:00.840> push<00:01:01.260> it

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
we did on the straddle is that a push it

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.620 
we did on the straddle is that a push it
between<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:02.100> leg<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.820> time<00:01:03.120> we'll<00:01:03.360> push

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
between your leg this time we'll push

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.380 
between your leg this time we'll push
the<00:01:03.810> floor<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.500> our<00:01:04.830> start<00:01:05.370> of<00:01:05.489> your<00:01:05.610> leg<00:01:05.820> with

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the floor in our start of your leg with

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.170 
the floor in our start of your leg with
your<00:01:06.420> leg<00:01:06.720> completely<00:01:06.930> together<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.790> success

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
your leg completely together the success

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.630 
your leg completely together the success
of<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.570> goal<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.140> how<00:01:10.560> well<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.190> use<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of this goal is how well you use the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.120 
of this goal is how well you use the
momentum<00:01:11.910> by<00:01:12.600> bringing<00:01:12.930> upper<00:01:13.350> body<00:01:13.530> all<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
momentum by bringing upper body all the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:02:17.320 
momentum by bringing upper body all the
way<00:01:14.160> down<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.700> your<00:01:14.790> Dean
