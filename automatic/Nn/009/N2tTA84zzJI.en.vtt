have this many goldfish in a smaller
tank<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.219> they're<00:00:38.219> small<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:39.270> each<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
tank and they're small but each one of

tank and they're small but each one of
these<00:00:39.809> goldfish<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.010> about<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.280> foot

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
these goldfish get to be about a foot

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.580 
these goldfish get to be about a foot
long<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.450> plan<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.140> growth

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
long and I have to plan on that growth

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.420 
long and I have to plan on that growth
and<00:00:44.930> realistically<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.250> was

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and realistically for it if I was

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.479 
and realistically for it if I was
planning<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.969> future<00:00:49.250> one<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.370> these

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
planning for the future one of these

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.299 
planning for the future one of these
common<00:00:50.879> goldfish<00:00:51.329> will<00:00:51.660> grow<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> foot<00:00:53.010> long

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
common goldfish will grow to a foot long

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.150 
common goldfish will grow to a foot long
and<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.510> average<00:00:54.899> goldfish<00:00:55.739> all<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
and the average goldfish all the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.639 
and the average goldfish all the
different<00:00:56.430> species<00:00:56.670> will<00:00:57.120> will<00:00:58.109> get<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.469> about

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
different species will will get to about

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.569 
different species will will get to about
a<00:00:58.710> foot<00:00:59.010> long<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.120> say<00:01:00.300> more<00:01:00.539> or<00:01:00.660> less<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
a foot long we can say more or less and

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.060 
a foot long we can say more or less and
the<00:01:02.579> take<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.090> size<00:01:03.300> minimum<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.260> advise<00:01:05.040> for

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the take the size minimum I advise for

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.340 
the take the size minimum I advise for
having<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.939> regular<00:01:06.150> goldfish<00:01:06.810> would<00:01:06.960> probably

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
having a regular goldfish would probably

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.800 
having a regular goldfish would probably
be<00:01:07.409> about<00:01:07.619> 20<00:01:08.100> gallons<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> 20<00:01:09.689> gallon

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
be about 20 gallons this is a 20 gallon

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.679 
be about 20 gallons this is a 20 gallon
tank<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:11.340> lot<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.000> people<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.420> start

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
tank and a lot of people like to start

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.090 
tank and a lot of people like to start
with<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> 10<00:01:13.140> gallon<00:01:13.320> tank<00:01:13.530> because<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
with the 10 gallon tank because it's a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
with the 10 gallon tank because it's a
lot<00:01:14.220> cheaper<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.720> not<00:01:15.900> enough

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
lot cheaper but it just it's not enough

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.130 
lot cheaper but it just it's not enough
room<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:18.030> 10<00:01:18.270> gallon<00:01:18.420> aquarium<00:01:18.810> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
room and it's the 10 gallon aquarium is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.830 
room and it's the 10 gallon aquarium is
probably<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.650> worst<00:01:19.830> aquarium<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:20.909> fish

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
probably the worst aquarium for fish

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.780 
probably the worst aquarium for fish
owners<00:01:22.200> ever<00:01:22.380> because<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:22.890> too<00:01:23.009> small<00:01:23.310> so

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
owners ever because it's too small so

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.370 
owners ever because it's too small so
while<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.110> know<00:01:25.200> this

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
while this is it just so you know this

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.280 
while this is it just so you know this
is<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> 20<00:01:26.009> gallon<00:01:26.250> tank<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
is a 20 gallon tank and it's a it's a

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.710 
is a 20 gallon tank and it's a it's a
high<00:01:28.590> series<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.759> 20<00:01:30.030> gallon<00:01:30.150> high<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
high series so it's a 20 gallon high and

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.120 
high series so it's a 20 gallon high and
some<00:01:33.720> ways<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.650> away<00:01:34.770> with

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
some ways that you can get away with

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.390 
some ways that you can get away with
having<00:01:35.490> more<00:01:35.700> goldfish<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.600> smaller<00:01:37.400> set

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
having more goldfish in a smaller set

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.850 
having more goldfish in a smaller set
space<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> lot<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.750> aeration<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
space is to get a lot of aeration and a

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.550 
space is to get a lot of aeration and a
lot<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.100> water<00:01:41.549> movement<00:01:41.990> as<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.380> see<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
lot of water movement as you can see I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.200 
lot of water movement as you can see I
have<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> powerhead<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.759> there<00:01:44.909> which<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
have a powerhead in there which is a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.800 
have a powerhead in there which is a
pump<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.720> moves<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.159> water<00:01:47.369> constantly<00:01:48.240> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
pump that moves the water constantly and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.330 
pump that moves the water constantly and
I<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:50.040> actually<00:01:50.610> enter<00:01:51.860> oxygen<00:01:52.860> into<00:01:53.250> this

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
I can actually enter oxygen into this

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.139 
I can actually enter oxygen into this
pump<00:01:53.640> too<00:01:53.939> as<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.759> it<00:01:56.759> makes<00:01:57.000> for

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
pump too as you can see and it makes for

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.410 
pump too as you can see and it makes for
an<00:01:57.360> absolutely<00:01:58.100> great<00:01:59.100> scenario<00:01:59.790> for<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> lot

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
an absolutely great scenario for a lot

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.600 
an absolutely great scenario for a lot
of<00:02:00.540> goldfish<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.350> kind<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.979> together<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
of goldfish to kind of be together and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.459 
of goldfish to kind of be together and
if<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.119> go<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> pet<00:02:03.630> stores<00:02:04.020> you'll

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
if you go to the pet stores you'll

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.070 
if you go to the pet stores you'll
realize<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.040> they<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> same

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
realize that they have the same

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.710 
realize that they have the same
up<00:02:06.230> they'll<00:02:06.770> have<00:02:07.010> 200<00:02:07.910> gold<00:02:08.119> fish<00:02:08.450> in<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.690> small

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
up they'll have 200 gold fish in a small

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.140 
up they'll have 200 gold fish in a small
aquarium<00:02:09.470> but<00:02:09.920> they'll<00:02:10.070> have<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.340> huge<00:02:10.790> pump

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
aquarium but they'll have a huge pump

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.860 
aquarium but they'll have a huge pump
just<00:02:11.390> toss<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.620> current<00:02:13.040> don't<00:02:13.220> like<00:02:13.370> crazy

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
just toss and current don't like crazy

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.610 
just toss and current don't like crazy
so<00:02:15.490> as<00:02:16.490> far<00:02:16.760> as<00:02:16.910> how<00:02:17.060> many<00:02:17.120> goldfish<00:02:17.960> you<00:02:18.470> can

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
so as far as how many goldfish you can

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.770 
so as far as how many goldfish you can
have<00:02:18.830> in<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.280> certain<00:02:19.610> tank<00:02:19.940> um

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
have in a certain tank um

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.020 
have in a certain tank um
there's<00:02:21.350> there's<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.950> rule<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.340> thumb<00:02:22.370> it's<00:02:22.850> for

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
there's there's a rule of thumb it's for

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.380 
there's there's a rule of thumb it's for
every<00:02:23.330> one<00:02:23.690> inch<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.310> fish<00:02:25.550> grows<00:02:26.030> it

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
every one inch that the fish grows it

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.920 
every one inch that the fish grows it
should<00:02:26.960> be<00:02:27.170> an<00:02:27.470> extra<00:02:28.280> ten<00:02:28.810> gallons<00:02:29.810> or

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
should be an extra ten gallons or

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.370 
should be an extra ten gallons or
something<00:02:30.260> crazy<00:02:30.560> like<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.850> um<00:02:32.380> the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
something crazy like that but um the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.760 
something crazy like that but um the
most<00:02:33.710> common<00:02:34.370> I'd<00:02:35.300> say<00:02:35.600> 90%<00:02:35.990> of<00:02:36.380> goldfish

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
most common I'd say 90% of goldfish

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.100 
most common I'd say 90% of goldfish
owners<00:02:37.100> have<00:02:37.340> one<00:02:37.670> or<00:02:37.910> two<00:02:38.150> or<00:02:38.330> three<00:02:38.360> goldfish

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
owners have one or two or three goldfish

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.950 
owners have one or two or three goldfish
and<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.740> would<00:02:39.980> say<00:02:40.250> for<00:02:40.760> two<00:02:40.970> goldfish<00:02:41.540> you're

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
and I would say for two goldfish you're

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.360 
and I would say for two goldfish you're
going<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.230> want<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.740> 30<00:02:43.640> gallon<00:02:43.820> aquarium<00:02:44.330> um<00:02:45.370> if
