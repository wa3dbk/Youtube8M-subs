how is this musical different from the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.399 
how is this musical different from the
ones<00:01:45.200> in<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.470> past<00:01:46.960> musical<00:01:47.960> which<00:01:48.140> means

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
ones in the past musical which means

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.499 
ones in the past musical which means
that<00:01:48.590> there's<00:01:48.799> very<00:01:49.040> little<00:01:49.310> actual<00:01:49.790> speaking

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
that there's very little actual speaking

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.440 
that there's very little actual speaking
most<00:01:50.899> of<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.259> is<00:01:51.500> done<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.490> song<00:01:52.759> which<00:01:53.420> is

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
most of it is done to song which is

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.359 
most of it is done to song which is
different<00:01:53.990> than<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.469> musicals<00:01:54.920> we<00:01:54.979> put<00:01:55.189> on<00:01:55.280> in

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
different than the musicals we put on in

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.100 
different than the musicals we put on in
the<00:01:55.460> past<00:01:55.670> because<00:01:56.060> most<00:01:56.689> of<00:01:56.840> our<00:01:56.960> other

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
the past because most of our other

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.740 
the past because most of our other
musicals<00:01:57.590> have<00:01:57.680> been<00:01:57.939> they<00:01:58.939> talked<00:01:59.570> for<00:01:59.689> a

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
musicals have been they talked for a

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.149 
musicals have been they talked for a
while<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.110> then<00:02:00.229> they<00:02:00.320> sing<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.530> song<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.100> they

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
while and then they sing a song and they

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.410 
while and then they sing a song and they
talk<00:02:01.369> for<00:02:01.579> a<00:02:01.610> while<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:01.939> then<00:02:02.060> they<00:02:02.180> sing<00:02:02.360> a

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
talk for a while and then they sing a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.080 
talk for a while and then they sing a
song<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:02.810> it's<00:02:02.960> very<00:02:03.140> different<00:02:04.000> where<00:02:05.000> are

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
song so it's very different where are

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.639 
song so it's very different where are
some<00:02:05.240> pros<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.509> cons<00:02:05.750> with<00:02:06.200> working<00:02:06.530> with

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
some pros and cons with working with

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.770 
some pros and cons with working with
kids<00:02:06.799> in<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.130> age<00:02:07.310> group

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.930 

are<00:02:12.140> very<00:02:12.170> dramatic<00:02:12.710> but<00:02:17.860> but<00:02:18.860> but<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:19.610> good

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
are very dramatic but but but it's good

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.880 
are very dramatic but but but it's good
because<00:02:19.970> all<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.900> our<00:02:21.020> students<00:02:21.530> are<00:02:21.680> very

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
because all of our students are very

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.300 
because all of our students are very
active<00:02:22.430> in<00:02:22.520> school<00:02:22.910> they're<00:02:23.330> very<00:02:23.660> active<00:02:24.310> in

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
active in school they're very active in

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.950 
active in school they're very active in
their<00:02:25.550> classes<00:02:26.240> so<00:02:26.480> we<00:02:26.630> have<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.750> lot<00:02:26.930> of

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
their classes so we have a lot of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.110 
their classes so we have a lot of
leaders<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.590> our<00:02:27.710> group<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.340> think<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.880> it

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
leaders in our group and I think that it

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.360 
leaders in our group and I think that it
makes<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.690> whole<00:02:29.900> experience<00:02:29.930> very<00:02:30.830> good<00:02:31.070> not

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
makes the whole experience very good not

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.010 
makes the whole experience very good not
