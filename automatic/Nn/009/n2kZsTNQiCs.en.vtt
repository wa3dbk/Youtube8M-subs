00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
what was confusing because everyone's

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.190 
what was confusing because everyone's
looking<00:02:29.760> at<00:02:29.849> one<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> trailers<00:02:30.450> oh<00:02:30.720> my<00:02:30.900> why

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
looking at one of the trailers oh my why

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.380 
looking at one of the trailers oh my why
is<00:02:31.230> he<00:02:31.590> becoming<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.130> Super<00:02:32.610> Saiyan<00:02:32.640> yet<00:02:33.120> I

is he becoming a Super Saiyan yet I

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.210 
is he becoming a Super Saiyan yet I
guess<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.319> just<00:02:34.349> one<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.830> main<00:02:35.010> I

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
guess this is just one of the main I

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.380 
guess this is just one of the main I
guess<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.730> one<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.120> main

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
guess this is just one of the main

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.150 
guess this is just one of the main
things<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.870> we<00:02:36.989> actually<00:02:37.290> forgot<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.980> look

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
things that we actually forgot to look

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.180 
things that we actually forgot to look

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
at in details when Toriyama said that he

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.620 
at in details when Toriyama said that he
won't<00:02:41.400> be<00:02:41.489> becoming<00:02:41.849> super<00:02:42.120> saiyan<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.450> lot<00:02:42.540> of

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
won't be becoming super saiyan a lot of

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.630 
won't be becoming super saiyan a lot of
people<00:02:42.870> are<00:02:42.959> saying<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.950> even<00:02:44.220> Toriyama

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
people are saying that and even Toriyama

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.940 
people are saying that and even Toriyama
setting<00:02:45.060> himself<00:02:45.540> where<00:02:45.780> he<00:02:45.810> said<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.440> um<00:02:46.620> I

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
setting himself where he said that um I

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.100 
setting himself where he said that um I
think<00:02:47.370> he<00:02:47.580> said<00:02:47.760> something<00:02:47.790> about<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.660> next

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
think he said something about the next

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.140 
think he said something about the next
movies<00:02:49.590> Goku<00:02:50.069> won't<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.400> having<00:02:50.580> any<00:02:50.850> kind<00:02:51.030> of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.270 
movies Goku won't be having any kind of
transformation<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:52.260> I'm<00:02:52.440> guessing<00:02:52.920> he's<00:02:53.069> only

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
transformation so I'm guessing he's only

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.130 
transformation so I'm guessing he's only
starting<00:02:53.850> this<00:02:54.060> he's<00:02:54.299> early<00:02:54.510> starting<00:02:54.930> this

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
starting this he's early starting this

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.740 
starting this he's early starting this
and<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:56.069> move<00:02:56.340> right<00:02:56.519> here<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.390> it's<00:02:57.569> gonna

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
and this move right here so it's gonna

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.900 
and this move right here so it's gonna
be<00:02:57.900> really<00:02:58.110> confusing<00:02:58.739> on<00:02:58.860> seeing<00:02:59.160> how<00:02:59.370> that

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
