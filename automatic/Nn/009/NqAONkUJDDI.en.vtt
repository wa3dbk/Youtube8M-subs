sort<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:57.120> overarching<00:02:58.120> plot<00:02:58.690> but<00:02:59.109> when<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.290> got

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
sort of overarching plot but when it got

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.259 
sort of overarching plot but when it got
to<00:02:59.409> the<00:02:59.590> cat<00:02:59.829> bit<00:03:00.069> I<00:03:00.220> really<00:03:00.639> just<00:03:00.790> wanted<00:03:01.120> to

actually but no I don't think it's a

failures in the same way that Carter
does<00:06:03.850> I<00:06:04.180> think<00:06:04.479> possibly<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:04.870> problem<00:06:05.200> with

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
does I think possibly the problem with

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.170 
does I think possibly the problem with
something<00:06:05.889> like<00:06:06.100> Kaltura<00:06:06.520> the<00:06:06.639> strong<00:06:06.850> in<00:06:07.000> the

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
something like Kaltura the strong in the

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.629 
something like Kaltura the strong in the
6:30<00:06:07.660> slot<00:06:08.020> is<00:06:08.229> I've<00:06:08.919> just<00:06:08.979> come<00:06:09.340> home<00:06:09.460> from

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
6:30 slot is I've just come home from

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.010 
6:30 slot is I've just come home from
work<00:06:09.850> or<00:06:10.120> I'm<00:06:10.270> just<00:06:10.419> on<00:06:10.539> my<00:06:10.600> way<00:06:10.660> home<00:06:10.900> from

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
work or I'm just on my way home from

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.750 
work or I'm just on my way home from
work<00:06:11.110> and<00:06:11.470> I'm<00:06:11.650> knackered<00:06:11.889> and<00:06:12.250> I<00:06:12.580> don't

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
work and I'm knackered and I don't

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.950 
work and I'm knackered and I don't
really<00:06:12.880> I<00:06:12.940> wouldn't<00:06:13.210> have<00:06:13.300> to<00:06:13.419> work<00:06:13.600> quite<00:06:13.930> so

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
really I wouldn't have to work quite so

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.950 
really I wouldn't have to work quite so
hard<00:06:14.440> for<00:06:15.220> the<00:06:15.610> comedy<00:06:16.060> that's<00:06:16.360> in<00:06:16.510> that<00:06:16.660> slot

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
hard for the comedy that's in that slot

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.300 
hard for the comedy that's in that slot
and<00:06:17.020> so<00:06:17.380> maybe<00:06:17.590> if<00:06:17.800> you<00:06:17.950> are<00:06:17.979> going<00:06:18.250> to

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
and so maybe if you are going to

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.529 
and so maybe if you are going to
Commission<00:06:18.700> something<00:06:19.000> that's<00:06:19.180> quite<00:06:19.360> so

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
Commission something that's quite so

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.900 
Commission something that's quite so
divisive<00:06:19.919> maybe<00:06:20.919> just<00:06:21.160> put<00:06:21.280> it<00:06:21.430> at<00:06:21.729> another

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
divisive maybe just put it at another

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.200 
divisive maybe just put it at another
time<00:06:22.150> or<00:06:22.690> maybe<00:06:23.139> on<00:06:23.470> for<00:06:23.860> extra<00:06:24.220> which<00:06:24.430> seems
