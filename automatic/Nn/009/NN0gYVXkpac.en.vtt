00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.610
 terror and suspense the music of this 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.340
 dark genre I think it's very interesting and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.830
 I guess many of you know the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.600

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.600

 I leave a few seconds of this song 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.170
 a couple of days ago I was looking for this 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.969
 song and it turns out that it has several 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.030
 versions and of them three have 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.219
 seemed very good so much so in a 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.890
 of these the tune no longer sounds so 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.530
 gloomy and may even be a bit sad 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.750
 Well, here is a fragment of 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.089
