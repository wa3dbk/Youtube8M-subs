00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.030
 line galera speaks now is in the area of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.400
 Bringing in another review to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.070
 you and the gun today and given the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.570
 request from mister brasil tur and 15 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.010
 people wanted l'aquila in the comment 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.029
 It 's pwr worth it so let's go there and 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.130
 technical data to pwr is manufactured in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.140
 United States, it has the capacity 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.620
 of 20 bullets in the magazine 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.230
 one in the chamber and then you 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.710
 complete and if so is 60 pounds with it 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.829
 you release the mec stent and this will 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.620
 increase the ammunition capacity to 30 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.739
 bullets in the charger plus one in the chamber 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.260
 the dean of her faith is 750 euros per 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.530
 minute and she has the shot types or 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.530
 self-esteem and a symbol shock time 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.989
 it was 2.5 seconds away if you 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.480
 have ammunition and a loader and 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.119
 you have empty charger time 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.299
 climbs to 3 points 4 seconds 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.030
 its maximum damage is 25 points 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.590
 issue up to eight meters and apart and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.820
 meters the damage falls to 14.3 to 50 meters 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.930
 beauty, because life wr is released there 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.590
 when you reach rank 32 right? 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.549
 so why does this indicate that 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.890
 She's a gun for who she is. 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.020
 developing the game is not prepared 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:43.920
 still for other weapons to take more 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:48.090
 High let's say in bf3 and everything in pwr 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.600
 for me and points to and directs 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.509
 word only an average gun 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.520
 she does not have a high fly hit but also 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.430
 does not have a low hit of fire 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.619
 she does not have a high damage, but she does not have 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:07.770
 a low damage is her record pattern 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.319
 not a record high but also not 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.170
 collect the bass then it means everything 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.590
 This everything in the gun indicates 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:21.530
 she is an average gun in that of shots 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.910
 I mean it would indicate this weapon and it's 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.950
 especially for people who are 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.270
 having difficulty for class 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.510
 snipe pi and get points with the class 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.239
 always because it's the pedals is a 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.239
 weapons that have a great deal of 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.660
 ability to imagine if compared and 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.959
 with other areas such as free health or 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.650
 Car neighborhood because it has actually 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:53.489
 standard denis of a carbenet medium 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.540
 15 and 25 maximum 14.3 minimum 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:03.840
 So if you 're having a hard time and it's in 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:06.720
 class is to get points and such is me 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.530
 would tell you to use this weapon and 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.850
 given as an alternative and to be a 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:19.769
 running win is a bit different and 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.799
 the other candidates as mp7 # 5 here and 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.400
 only 90 because it gives a little more 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.310
 damage but the pace maintains was lower 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.079
 in contrast the pace was lower it is 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.299
 more controllable, right? 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.700
 Can you control her record? 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.400
 better so I would point out to whoever 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.970
 is having difficulty or for whom 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.170
 not yet accustomed to bf3 for 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:50.400
 This folks, I do not think she's a 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.859
 weapon that stands out in no way this is a 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.709
 thing that catches my attention because I 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:59.730
 I managed to do and I did very well with 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:03.750
 She is not having played there, but I 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.209
 I would not trade at just 90 or mp7 or 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.380
 m5 here for her and no kind of 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.209
 situation 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:16.350
 ok then so is I think though 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:19.650
 all this and she being a gun is medium 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.630
 it deserves in my opinion and note 3 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.430
 and whether you agree with me or not with 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.850
 almost feel free to leave 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.360
 then your comment with respect to yo sÃ¡ 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:37.199
 tactically I recommend that you use the 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.840
 ex lieutenant of meg is yes if you do not 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.300
 use the extendmedia you will end up 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.880
 dying many times because he has a 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.100
 enemy and that bullet will be missing. 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.310
 What did you waste? 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.479
 nor the understanding that it will fall 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.330
 very well off this I recommend 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.639
 also the laser site and the aim and its 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.460
 option in your preference 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.750
 I use however do not know the head shot 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.210
 or the snake 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.009
 earned guys a hug for everyone 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.949
 I'll stay here if you guys 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:15.660
 liked the video please well that one 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:18.750
 joinha and that favorite and if you do not 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.599
 liked that the desire to click not already 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.880
 the line and at least tell me what 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.990
 You did not like it and if you do not 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.330
 agree with me 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.660
 earned guys a hug for everyone 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.660
