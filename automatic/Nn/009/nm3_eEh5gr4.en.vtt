00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.910
 and it's worth 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.370
 here is the friends of youtube receive a 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.670
 Warm greetings from your server 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.650
 francisco chaves from this channel the day of 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.990
 today what they would come with is a 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.259
 gameplay in which we will learn how to 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.849
 create a house in our minecraft for 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.200
 create a house what we are going to need 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.820
 it's first to get wood that I 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.250
 I recommend this one here that is 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.430
 birch and then once we have already 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.739
 what got enough wood 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.339
 let's do is go to our table 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.339
 work 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.010
 let's give it right click and we'll 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.720
 move our wood towards 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.310
 manufacture for us to vote the 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.730
 boards 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:00.020
 once we have done this we are going 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.970
 to start creating a base 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.970
 for example here 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:14.330
 I'm going to put 1 2 3 4 5 and the way out 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.450
 leave these spaces that are for the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.240
 door the same way here I will put 1 2 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.049
 3 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.049
 4 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.150
 4 and 5 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.150
 and so we are going to do 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.280
 and good friends once we have 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.290
 created the base that you can see 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.200
 here what we are going to do is get 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.229
 wood the logo plus the easiest place to 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.170
 get the wood will be in the water 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.000
 here as you can observe it and once 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.520
 that they have already achieved the wood what 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.909
 let's do but all the sand what 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.860
 let's do is in our oven give 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.410
 right click put it in the part of 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.110
 up and put wood in the part of 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.540
 down and create crystals like you 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.030
 you can observe here then I'm going to 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.450
 put the crystals here and we will 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.030
 start in the same way here by putting it 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.319
 in each part and then here again the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.319
 video is going to get fast 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.950
 good friends how can you 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.860
 again I created the part of here I 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.800
 we can not do it again is with 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.920
 our wood our tables we are going to 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.770
 go up here 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.180
 and we are going to create again a base for 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.150
 example 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.680
 let's create it here and again the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.680
 video is going to get fast 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.190
 good friends, I'm done 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.640
 sleep so they do not appear 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.640
 zombies 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.900
 and perfect now what we are going to do is 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.780
 create two doors for it let's go to 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.780
 our work table and we're going to put 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.440
 our tables this way here in the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.720
 manufacturing 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.510
 let's put it here and what we 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.670
 will vote are the doors that we are going to 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.660
 I need to be here and then we can 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.370
 again move this to our inventory 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.880
 since we have the doors we're going to 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.790
 die here 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.760
 but what are we going to do about the part of 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.160
 back we're going to click right click 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.190
 right 56 after action here already 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.610
 we had our hose doors 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:23.000
 we are going to close the doors but what 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:26.260
 it makes us almost the end 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.260
 let's go up here 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.260
 and we go again to create what would come 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.260
 being 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.530
 we are doing the other part 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.500
 suppose the ceiling already stops to 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.910
 close it and then here we are going to put 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.910
 again the fast video 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.290
 good friends since we've done this 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.300
 Now what we are going to do is put here 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.870
 let's put all these parts here 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.970
 already to create you ceiling 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.660
 and then let's put the video back 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.660
 Quick 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.440
 ah 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.800
 why 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.470
 and 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.520
 and good friends like you can 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.210
 observe here I have finished creating 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.210
 at home 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:58.590
 they can be but they have door suppose 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:03.000
 what is x are windows or to have a 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:06.560
 better view and better lighting and 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.370
 Well, if we bring it out 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.160
 the truth looks very good and it is 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.320
 basic to start but it will serve us 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.510
 a lot while we survive in minecraft 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.190
 or no friends I hope and this video has them 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:24.190
 served a lot 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.190
