it in and it's a very pretty natural
color<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.599> think<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:37.900> perfect<00:02:38.349> for<00:02:38.409> anything

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.940 
color I think it's perfect for anything
this<00:02:39.819> one's<00:02:40.060> called<00:02:40.329> barely<00:02:40.720> there<00:02:40.950> champagne

this one's called barely there champagne
and<00:02:41.980> root<00:02:42.430> beer<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.120> has<00:02:43.269> like<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.569> whole

time<00:02:43.959> name<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:45.310> guess<00:02:46.239> because<00:02:46.420> there's

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
time name and I guess because there's
