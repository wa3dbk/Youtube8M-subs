00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.960
 Welcome to the job as I am 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.080
 yes hannes source today with the topic 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.990
 I have been stroking and I have 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.960
 in fact , and what can I do 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.279
 on the other hand, they do not grow like that 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.759
 what can you do to train the canteen 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.070
 adjust 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.320
 first of all, Arnold Schwarzenegger 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.710
 also had huge problems with his 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.610
 dare 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.169
 What did he do? He has every training 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.360
 he just has his relevant ones 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.939
 prioritized and said in each 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.390
 training 30 only warm for 40 minutes 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.329
 made 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.949
 price just waiting in sofia on training 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.410
 made head so far grown up 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.690
 that means it works with the 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.620
 other remaining bodies just like that 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.519
 you do not have to grow once 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.129
 train accordingly 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.359
 But there are a few things more 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.019
 a few things that are not so of companies 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.609
 work well 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.170
 on the one hand that the calves the 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.089
 stabilize and wear all day long 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.039
 he must be his endurance 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.719
 muscles that means with one now 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.300
 fat weighty five repetitive 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.100
 Honestly, it's good to be honest 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.930
 The true is actually more like that 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.450
 the really many repetition 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.030
 must do and a bit 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.000
 It has to work biometrically 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.090
 or the boys and girls in theirs 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.650
 youth many start-stop sports 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.140
 have done as for example 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.400
 Sprinting compete 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.930
 football basketball and why what 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.500
 was played a permanent 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.360
 had 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.400
 yes, these are usually the people who stop 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.800
 have been a bit more because 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.180
 she jerks this permanently 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.650
 tearing muscles 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.900
 that is 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.310
 characterized the musculature is rather to 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.510
 maximum low because they are permanent 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.120
 States must stop 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.830
 the other is just that, too 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.750
 Much equal must equal that is 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.880
 if you just take a bath with you 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.440
 appropriate at nowhere else 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.690
 kept it that way even if more 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.350
 Balancing this typical must be stable 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.630
 history and many laws many 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.070
 repetitions and volume simply 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.500
 so huge that they adapt 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.380
 have to 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.120
 In general , this fact is also true 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.160
 so that you through many 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.260
 Repetition you just get the muscles 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.390
 but in that I on point the 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.610
 he can get up and then definitely 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.380
 grow up better now than when the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.620
 Almost so the muscle holds so tightly 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.840
 that you can not grow properly 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.170
 that was the video I'm doing with 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.670
 my line was how can it grow 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.490
 many sentences many repetitions and 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.340
 geometric things that is 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.420
 stories explains videos subscribes to the 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.420
 channel must in chips
