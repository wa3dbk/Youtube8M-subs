haven't done it this is sequence 8 maybe
haven't<00:02:04.110> done<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.649> such<00:02:04.950> 10<00:02:05.340> times

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
haven't done it that such 10 times

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.229 
haven't done it that such 10 times
better<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.899> now<00:02:07.520> what's<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> happen<00:02:09.090> is

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that this is going to put your right

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.930 
that this is going to put your right
point<00:02:11.099> where<00:02:11.220> you've<00:02:11.340> passed<00:02:11.640> all<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
point where you've passed all the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.559 
point where you've passed all the
climbing<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.660> shit<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.020> you're

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
climbing and shit and you're

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.259 
climbing and shit and you're
to<00:02:13.659> the<00:02:13.780> part<00:02:13.989> where<00:02:14.790> your<00:02:15.790> climb<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.180> the

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
to the part where your climb in the

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.520 
to the part where your climb in the
building<00:02:16.569> right<00:02:16.599> now<00:02:18.840> what's<00:02:19.840> his<00:02:20.019> nuts<00:02:20.260> and

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
building right now what's his nuts and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.640 
building right now what's his nuts and
is<00:02:20.769> yelling<00:02:21.099> at<00:02:21.310> his<00:02:22.079> sister<00:02:23.079> which<00:02:23.319> is<00:02:23.499> like

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
is yelling at his sister which is like

his wife or some shit like that so you
just<00:02:27.909> got<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.120> kind<00:02:28.359> of<00:02:28.480> get<00:02:29.049> up<00:02:29.109> there<00:02:29.459> right

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
just got to kind of get up there right

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.619 
just got to kind of get up there right
here<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.700> think<00:02:30.849> this<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.150> where<00:02:31.329> I<00:02:31.389> like

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
here I think this is where I like

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.449 
here I think this is where I like
epically<00:02:32.049> fail<00:02:32.379> I<00:02:32.409> think<00:02:32.769> I<00:02:32.829> get<00:02:33.010> noticed<00:02:33.400> by

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
epically fail I think I get noticed by

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.599 
epically fail I think I get noticed by
the<00:02:33.549> guards<00:02:34.000> or<00:02:34.150> something<00:02:35.219> let's<00:02:36.219> find<00:02:36.400> out

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
the guards or something let's find out

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.909 
the guards or something let's find out
oh<00:02:39.930> yeah<00:02:40.930> if<00:02:41.079> you<00:02:41.200> kill<00:02:41.409> anybody<00:02:41.620> your

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:41.919 
oh yeah if you kill anybody your

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.770 
oh yeah if you kill anybody your
synchronous<00:02:42.450> synchronization<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.569> going<00:02:43.689> to

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
synchronous synchronization is going to

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.959 
synchronous synchronization is going to
be<00:02:43.840> failed<00:02:44.139> it's<00:02:45.040> easier<00:02:45.489> if<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.639> just<00:02:45.669> kill

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:45.969 
be failed it's easier if you just kill

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.819 
be failed it's easier if you just kill
people<00:02:46.329> I<00:02:46.540> mean<00:02:47.019> if<00:02:47.200> you're<00:02:47.319> doing<00:02:47.530> this<00:02:47.590> your

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
people I mean if you're doing this your

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.379 
people I mean if you're doing this your
first<00:02:48.010> time<00:02:48.219> you<00:02:48.430> really<00:02:48.849> care<00:02:49.060> about<00:02:49.090> the

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
first time you really care about the

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.530 
first time you really care about the
full<00:02:49.569> all<00:02:49.750> yeah<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:49.989> felt<00:02:50.290> oh<00:02:50.579> god<00:02:51.579> all<00:02:52.419> right

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
full all yeah I felt oh god all right

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.970 
full all yeah I felt oh god all right
well<00:02:52.659> if<00:02:52.689> you<00:02:52.840> really<00:02:53.079> care<00:02:53.409> about<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.769> full

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
well if you really care about the full

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.039 
well if you really care about the full
synchronization<00:02:54.790> don't<00:02:55.269> kill<00:02:55.480> anybody<00:02:55.689> it's

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
synchronization don't kill anybody it's

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.110 
synchronization don't kill anybody it's
probably<00:02:56.290> gonna<00:02:56.409> make<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.680> harder<00:02:57.040> but<00:02:58.030> you

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
probably gonna make it harder but you

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.289 
probably gonna make it harder but you
can<00:02:58.269> always<00:02:58.480> go<00:02:58.750> back<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:58.959> just<00:02:59.260> relive<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.709> so

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
can always go back and just relive it so

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.309 
can always go back and just relive it so
you<00:03:01.299> might<00:03:01.480> as<00:03:01.599> well<00:03:01.719> just<00:03:01.810> kill<00:03:01.959> people

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
you might as well just kill people

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.640 
you might as well just kill people
doesn't<00:03:03.040> matter<00:03:03.159> I<00:03:04.139> don't<00:03:05.139> think<00:03:05.199> I've<00:03:05.409> got

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
doesn't matter I don't think I've got

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.009 
doesn't matter I don't think I've got
like<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.310> think<00:03:07.209> i<00:03:07.269> mighta<00:03:07.299> got<00:03:07.629> a<00:03:07.659> hundred

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
like I think i mighta got a hundred

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.449 
like I think i mighta got a hundred
percent<00:03:08.109> synchronization<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.069> like<00:03:09.250> two

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
percent synchronization on like two

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.920 
percent synchronization on like two
missions<00:03:10.169> all<00:03:11.169> right<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:11.530> attempt<00:03:12.129> number<00:03:12.280> two

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
missions all right so attempt number two

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.719 
missions all right so attempt number two
you<00:03:13.930> don't<00:03:14.109> want<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.290> climb<00:03:14.500> up<00:03:14.709> here<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:17.729> just

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
you don't want to climb up here and just

you just got to get all the way at the

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.099 
you just got to get all the way at the
top<00:03:20.519> it's<00:03:21.519> a<00:03:21.639> pretty<00:03:21.849> big<00:03:22.030> ass<00:03:22.209> building<00:03:22.720> if<00:03:22.870> I

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
top it's a pretty big ass building if I

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.490 
top it's a pretty big ass building if I
do<00:03:23.379> say<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:23.709> myself<00:03:24.359> it's<00:03:25.359> pretty<00:03:25.810> pretty<00:03:26.290> big

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.069 
do say so myself it's pretty pretty big
ass<00:03:26.680> building<00:03:27.989> all<00:03:28.989> right<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.939> just<00:03:31.150> climb

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
ass building all right so you just climb

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.460 
ass building all right so you just climb
up<00:03:32.109> here<00:03:32.470> kill<00:03:33.310> this<00:03:33.459> guy<00:03:34.079> stabbed<00:03:35.079> them<00:03:35.290> and

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
up here kill this guy stabbed them and

pull them off the edge that's what I did

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.110 
pull them off the edge that's what I did
I<00:03:38.159> think<00:03:39.159> that's<00:03:39.340> what<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.519> did<00:03:39.870> yeah<00:03:40.870> all<00:03:41.769> right
