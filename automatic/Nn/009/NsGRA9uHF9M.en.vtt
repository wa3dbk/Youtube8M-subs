 you want a delicious dessert but a 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.680
 little different from the traditional pay of 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.719
 pumpkin is lucky here you what 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.879

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.539
 Four-layer pumpkin is a 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.860
 true success of crowds let's start 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.599
 Oiled and floured two molds 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.359
 round pie nine inches 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.609
 in a large bowl I place a package of 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:32.169
 yellow cake mix half cup 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.870
 of milk a third of a cup of oil 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.270
 four large eggs 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.590
 a teaspoon of spice for cake 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.449
 pumpkin and a cup of pumpkin puree 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.940
 for this recipe it is better to use mashed 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.860
 canned pumpkin I now bake with a 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.730
 electric mixer at medium speed 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.730
 to mix well 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.940
 then I pour the dough in the molds this 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.760
 It has all the flavors of the season 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.580
 and it smells delicious now I'm going to bake 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.190
 the in an oven at 350 degrees for 30 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.020
 minutes I'm going to take out the cakes from the 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.470
 molds and let them cool on 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 metal grids 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.400
 for our filling in a saucepan I put a 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.250
 cream cheese package philadelphia 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.080
 cream filis that mix with a blender 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.080
 until it is smooth and creamy 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.410
 after adding a cup of sugar in 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.170
 powder a half teaspoon of spice 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.020
 for pumpkin pie videos thirds of 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.550
 cup of the remaining pumpkin puree I'll 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.550
 mix all this very well 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.720
 I add a cover container that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.260
 week with shopping so you have a 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.260
 creamy texture 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.159
 I have a simple method to cut 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.900
 perfectly layers of the cake all 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.330
 What I need are some toothpicks 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.920
 teeth which I will place on the side 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.110
 of the cake to mark the center of 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.450
 cake this way 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.120
 with a serrated knife I make a cut 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.260
 horizontal 2 inches deep 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.060
 around the sides of the cake 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.060
 using the chopsticks as a guide 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.950
 then I cut everything horizontally to 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.950
 create two equal layers 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.010
 I'm going to put this layer aside until 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.320
 you need it this will be the layer 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.870
 top of our cake now comes 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.450
 the fun part put together the cake I will 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.310
 place strips of parchment paper underneath 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.080
 of the bottom layer of the cake for 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.850
 avoid crumbs and stuffing 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.850
 fall on the serving plate 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.030
 together on the bottom layer of the cake 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.290
 one third of our cheese mixture 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.290
 cream in this way 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.460
 then I'll put the other half of the 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.460
 cake 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.970
 and half of the remaining mixture 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.040
 we will continue placing another layer and the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.660
 rest of the cream cheese mixture until 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.660
 finish with our last layer 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.360
 look how it looks now for the cover I've 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.890
 heated a quarter cup of caramel 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.080
 for ice cream in the microwave during 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.820
 a few seconds so you can 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.180
 be easily noticed about our 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.180
 cake 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.099
 and the final touch a quarter cup 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.099
 chopped platters or spicy nuts 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.670
 just remove the parchment paper before 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.769
