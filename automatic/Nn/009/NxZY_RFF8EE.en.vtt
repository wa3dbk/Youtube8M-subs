things that beginners really kind of
struggle<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.750> grasp<00:00:15.929> especially<00:00:16.350> if<00:00:16.890> they're

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
struggle to grasp especially if they're

coming from oil paints they don't know
how<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> get<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.590> nice<00:00:19.859> subtle<00:00:20.250> blend<00:00:20.640> with

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
how to get that nice subtle blend with

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.580 
how to get that nice subtle blend with
acrylic<00:00:21.270> paints<00:00:21.570> because<00:00:21.869> they<00:00:21.990> dries<00:00:22.230> so

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
acrylic paints because they dries so

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.710 
acrylic paints because they dries so
quickly<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.670> truth<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.090> matter<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.390> if

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
quickly the truth of the matter is if

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.839 
quickly the truth of the matter is if
that<00:00:24.869> acrylics<00:00:25.350> aren't<00:00:25.650> really<00:00:25.949> designed<00:00:26.519> to

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
that acrylics aren't really designed to

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.330 
that acrylics aren't really designed to
be<00:00:27.000> blended<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> same<00:00:28.410> way<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.800> oils<00:00:29.220> are

we're<00:00:43.440> looking<00:00:43.500> at<00:00:43.710> two<00:00:43.920> different<00:00:44.040> methods

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
we're looking at two different methods

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.779 
we're looking at two different methods
here

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
here

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.369 
here
first<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.270> being<00:00:45.390> able<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.719> lay<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> paint<00:00:46.200> on

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
first is being able to lay the paint on

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.319 
first is being able to lay the paint on
very<00:00:46.710> very<00:00:46.920> thick<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.399> working<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:47.969> well<00:00:48.149> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
very very thick and working it well it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.080 
very very thick and working it well it
is<00:00:48.390> very<00:00:48.870> thick<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.379> still<00:00:49.590> very<00:00:49.739> wet<00:00:50.090> second

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
is very thick it's still very wet second

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.060 
is very thick it's still very wet second
is<00:00:51.210> not<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.600> much<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.780> technique<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.500> blending

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
is not so much a technique for blending

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.040 
is not so much a technique for blending
as<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.699> learning<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> mix<00:00:54.480> little

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
as it is just learning to mix little

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.319 
as it is just learning to mix little
variations<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.890> those<00:00:56.070> colors<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.670> achieve<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
variations in those colors to achieve a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.319 
variations in those colors to achieve a
sort<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.719> faux<00:00:58.649> blend<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> sake<00:01:00.300> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
sort of faux blend so for the sake of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.119 
sort of faux blend so for the sake of
today's<00:01:00.719> demo<00:01:01.079> I'm<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.739> using<00:01:01.829> two

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
today's demo I'm going to be using two

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.920 
today's demo I'm going to be using two
very<00:01:02.489> different<00:01:02.730> colors<00:01:03.180> first<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.750> some

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
very different colors first is some

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.520 
very different colors first is some
Prussian<00:01:04.290> blue

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
Prussian blue

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.850 
Prussian blue
second<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.400> CAD<00:01:05.760> red<00:01:06.000> medium<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.530> addition

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
second is CAD red medium so in addition

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.710 
second is CAD red medium so in addition
to<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> paints<00:01:08.340> today<00:01:08.610> I've<00:01:08.820> got<00:01:08.850> my<00:01:09.090> regular

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
to the paints today I've got my regular

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.660 
to the paints today I've got my regular
flat<00:01:09.990> brush<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.530> well<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> little<00:01:11.430> bit<00:01:11.549> of

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
flat brush as well as a little bit of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.760 
flat brush as well as a little bit of
water<00:01:11.820> off<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> side<00:01:12.570> before<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.680> get

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
water off to the side before we get

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.609 
water off to the side before we get
started<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.670> make<00:01:14.820> note<00:01:14.880> that

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
started I do want to make note that

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.289 
started I do want to make note that
drying<00:01:16.619> time<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.220> your<00:01:17.400> acrylics<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.060> going

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
drying time with your acrylics is going

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.149 
drying time with your acrylics is going
to<00:01:18.420> depend<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.860> paint's

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to depend not just on the paint's

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.340 
to depend not just on the paint's
themselves<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.270> how<00:01:21.509> long<00:01:21.689> they're<00:01:21.960> exposed

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
themselves but how long they're exposed

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.649 
themselves but how long they're exposed
to<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> air<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.040> relative<00:01:23.520> humidity<00:01:24.090> in

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the environment that you're working in

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.120 
the environment that you're working in
the<00:01:27.090> drier<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.720> environment<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.860> more

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the drier your environment the more

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.679 
the drier your environment the more
likely<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.670> your<00:01:29.820> acrylics<00:01:30.180> are<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.509> to

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
likely that your acrylics are going to

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.569 
likely that your acrylics are going to
dry<00:01:30.960> very<00:01:30.990> quickly<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> more<00:01:32.100> humid<00:01:32.430> your

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
dry very quickly in the more humid your

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.179 
dry very quickly in the more humid your
environment<00:01:33.150> your<00:01:34.079> coats<00:01:34.680> might<00:01:34.920> dry<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
environment your coats might dry a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.370 
environment your coats might dry a
little<00:01:35.369> bit<00:01:35.610> slower<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.110> best

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
little bit slower so as this best

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
little bit slower so as this best
earlier<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.979> first<00:01:38.220> method<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.090> lay

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.810 
now from here you can do a little bit of
playing<00:03:39.630> around<00:03:39.750> with<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.710> era<00:03:41.010> area<00:03:41.490> Mayan

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
playing around with that era area Mayan

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.640 
playing around with that era area Mayan
section<00:03:42.300> because<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.870> pulled<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.260> lot<00:03:43.410> of<00:03:43.440> that

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
section because I pulled a lot of that

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.070 
section because I pulled a lot of that
out<00:03:43.800> now<00:03:44.040> into<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.520> paper<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.970> starting<00:03:45.960> to

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
out now into the paper is starting to

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.980 
out now into the paper is starting to
dry<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.320> little<00:03:46.470> bit<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:47.300> brush<00:03:48.300> in<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.540> bit<00:03:48.750> again

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
dry a little bit a brush in a bit again

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.920 
dry a little bit a brush in a bit again
wipe<00:03:49.740> off<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.130> excess

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
wipe off the excess

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.170 
wipe off the excess
and<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:52.020> can<00:03:52.170> rewrite<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:52.740> section<00:03:53.190> just<00:03:53.910> for

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
and I can rewrite that section just for

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.780 
and I can rewrite that section just for
a<00:03:54.240> little<00:03:54.390> bit<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:55.260> work<00:03:55.500> with<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.860> ever<00:03:56.520> so

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
a little bit and work with it ever so

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.460 
a little bit and work with it ever so
slightly<00:03:56.820> if<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:57.420> want<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.600> little<00:03:57.780> extra<00:03:57.959> you

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
slightly if you want a little extra you

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.320 
slightly if you want a little extra you
can<00:03:58.770> start<00:03:59.040> kind<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.280> doing<00:03:59.910> a<00:03:59.940> little<00:04:00.060> bit<00:04:00.240> of

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
can start kind of doing a little bit of

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.170 
can start kind of doing a little bit of
cross<00:04:00.540> hatching

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.210 

and<00:04:05.360> pretty<00:04:06.230> much<00:04:06.349> do<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.620> opposite<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.099> what

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
and pretty much do the opposite of what

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.430 
and pretty much do the opposite of what
I<00:04:07.250> just<00:04:07.280> told<00:04:07.580> you<00:04:07.700> not<00:04:07.849> to<00:04:07.909> do<00:04:08.180> but<00:04:08.959> again<00:04:09.080> then

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
I just told you not to do but again then

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.199 
I just told you not to do but again then
just<00:04:09.709> kind<00:04:09.890> of<00:04:09.920> going<00:04:10.099> back<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:10.970> forth<00:04:13.209> and

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
just kind of going back and forth and

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.699 
just kind of going back and forth and
then<00:04:14.360> playing<00:04:14.599> this<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:14.840> little<00:04:14.959> bit<00:04:15.110> wider<00:04:15.409> and

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
then playing this a little bit wider and

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.189 
then playing this a little bit wider and
a<00:04:15.769> little<00:04:15.950> bit<00:04:16.040> more<00:04:16.190> subtle<00:04:16.930> okay<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:17.989> our

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
a little bit more subtle okay so our

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.360 
a little bit more subtle okay so our
next<00:04:18.470> technique<00:04:18.650> we're<00:04:18.919> gonna<00:04:19.070> grab<00:04:19.220> our

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
next technique we're gonna grab our

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.490 
next technique we're gonna grab our
pallet<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:19.940> we're<00:04:20.479> going<00:04:20.600> to<00:04:20.630> start<00:04:20.870> with<00:04:21.079> red

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
pallet and we're going to start with red

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.290 
pallet and we're going to start with red
and<00:04:21.590> blue<00:04:21.769> on<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:21.979> side<00:04:22.190> kind<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.120> like<00:04:23.210> we

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
and blue on the side kind of like we

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.909 
and blue on the side kind of like we
just<00:04:23.449> did<00:04:23.630> I'm<00:04:23.810> not<00:04:23.840> sure<00:04:24.020> not<00:04:24.320> even<00:04:24.350> wipe<00:04:24.770> my

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
just did I'm not sure not even wipe my

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.890 
just did I'm not sure not even wipe my
brush<00:04:25.100> off<00:04:25.340> here<00:04:25.610> I'm<00:04:26.240> just<00:04:26.510> gonna<00:04:26.600> have<00:04:26.810> the

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
brush off here I'm just gonna have the

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.250 
brush off here I'm just gonna have the
two<00:04:27.080> colors<00:04:27.229> there

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
two colors there

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.899 
two colors there
I'm<00:04:29.350> gonna<00:04:29.530> lay<00:04:29.800> them<00:04:29.920> out<00:04:32.130> dance

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
I'm gonna lay them out dance

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:38.549 
I'm gonna lay them out dance
oddly<00:04:34.909> don't<00:04:35.599> want<00:04:35.779> on<00:04:35.989> your<00:04:36.109> good<00:04:36.259> pants

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:38.559 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:40.959 

those<00:04:39.559> are<00:04:39.679> our<00:04:39.769> two<00:04:39.919> sections<00:04:40.339> of<00:04:40.459> color<00:04:40.699> and

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:40.969 
those are our two sections of color and

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.539 
those are our two sections of color and
we're<00:04:41.149> gonna<00:04:41.269> mix<00:04:41.569> in<00:04:41.779> the<00:04:41.899> middle<00:04:42.249> so<00:04:43.249> I<00:04:43.309> find

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:43.549 
we're gonna mix in the middle so I find

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.759 
we're gonna mix in the middle so I find
that<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:43.789> easiest<00:04:43.909> way<00:04:44.269> to<00:04:44.299> do<00:04:44.569> this<00:04:44.719> is<00:04:44.959> to

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:45.769 
that the easiest way to do this is to

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:49.149 
that the easiest way to do this is to
mix<00:04:46.609> dark<00:04:47.509> into<00:04:47.989> light<00:04:48.019> and<00:04:48.499> not<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.039> other

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
mix dark into light and not the other

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:51.309 
mix dark into light and not the other
way<00:04:49.279> around<00:04:49.309> it's<00:04:49.819> easy<00:04:50.029> to<00:04:50.209> go<00:04:50.389> darker<00:04:50.839> from<00:04:51.259> a

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
way around it's easy to go darker from a

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:52.749 
way around it's easy to go darker from a
light<00:04:51.499> that's<00:04:51.679> harder<00:04:52.039> to<00:04:52.069> go<00:04:52.219> lighter<00:04:52.459> from<00:04:52.639> a

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
light that's harder to go lighter from a

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.559 
light that's harder to go lighter from a
dark<00:04:52.969> so<00:04:53.539> I'm<00:04:53.629> just<00:04:53.719> gonna<00:04:53.839> tap<00:04:54.199> a<00:04:54.499> tiny<00:04:54.889> bit<00:04:55.569> of

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:56.569 
dark so I'm just gonna tap a tiny bit of

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.079 
dark so I'm just gonna tap a tiny bit of
that<00:04:56.959> blue<00:04:57.199> on<00:04:57.289> the<00:04:57.469> corner<00:04:57.829> of<00:04:57.859> the<00:04:57.949> brush

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:58.089 
that blue on the corner of the brush

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:06.699 
that blue on the corner of the brush
pulling<00:04:59.089> that<00:04:59.209> into<00:04:59.389> the<00:04:59.539> red<00:05:05.079> and<00:05:06.079> just<00:05:06.289> kind

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:06.709 
pulling that into the red and just kind

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:32.420 
pulling that into the red and just kind
of<00:05:06.739> keep<00:05:06.949> slowly<00:05:07.399> adding<00:05:07.819> it<00:05:07.909> in

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.580 

and<00:05:32.820> now<00:05:33.060> for<00:05:33.419> the<00:05:33.630> blue<00:05:34.110> end<00:05:34.290> of<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.440> red

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
and now for the blue end of the red

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.770 
and now for the blue end of the red
worship<00:05:34.889> they<00:05:34.979> come<00:05:35.160> back<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.490> other<00:05:35.520> way

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
worship they come back the other way

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.969 
worship they come back the other way
we're<00:05:36.780> actually<00:05:36.840> going<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.199> add<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.440> ran<00:05:37.620> into

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
we're actually going to add the ran into

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:50.299 
we're actually going to add the ran into
the<00:05:38.040> blue

00:05:50.299 --> 00:05:50.309 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:55.049 

that's<00:05:51.309> pretty<00:05:51.580> good<00:05:53.309> this<00:05:54.309> any<00:05:54.610> residual

00:05:55.049 --> 00:05:55.059 
that's pretty good this any residual

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:57.269 
that's pretty good this any residual
paint<00:05:55.389> you<00:05:55.569> can<00:05:55.779> kind<00:05:56.020> of<00:05:56.050> start<00:05:56.289> blending

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:57.279 
paint you can kind of start blending

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:06.999 
paint you can kind of start blending
those<00:05:57.610> layers<00:05:57.849> together<00:05:59.430> ever<00:06:00.430> so<00:06:00.639> slightly

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.140 

right<00:06:08.009> about<00:06:08.220> like<00:06:08.430> that<00:06:08.610> we<00:06:08.789> have<00:06:08.970> two

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
right about like that we have two

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.270 
right about like that we have two
different<00:06:09.319> gradients<00:06:10.319> of<00:06:10.470> the<00:06:10.620> red<00:06:10.949> and<00:06:11.069> blue

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
different gradients of the red and blue

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.730 
different gradients of the red and blue
but<00:06:11.490> two<00:06:12.180> different<00:06:12.479> techniques<00:06:12.750> now<00:06:13.650> of

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
but two different techniques now of

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.350 
but two different techniques now of
course<00:06:13.949> it's<00:06:14.220> important<00:06:14.699> to<00:06:14.789> remember<00:06:15.030> that

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
course it's important to remember that

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.930 
course it's important to remember that
while<00:06:15.569> painting<00:06:16.190> you<00:06:17.190> may<00:06:17.370> not<00:06:17.580> always<00:06:17.819> be

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
while painting you may not always be

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.879
