quickly and cheaply as possible that way
we're<00:00:25.460> throwing<00:00:25.759> up<00:00:25.880> hundreds<00:00:26.269> of<00:00:26.359> new<00:00:26.509> ideas

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
we're throwing up hundreds of new ideas

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.929 
we're throwing up hundreds of new ideas
every<00:00:27.170> year<00:00:27.439> seeing<00:00:28.099> which<00:00:28.310> ones<00:00:28.580> get<00:00:28.759> good

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
every year seeing which ones get good

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.480 
every year seeing which ones get good
feedback<00:00:29.179> what<00:00:29.689> people<00:00:30.019> like<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:30.859> in<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.250> end

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
feedback what people like and in the end

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.000 
feedback what people like and in the end
hopefully<00:00:31.759> we<00:00:32.090> end<00:00:32.270> up<00:00:32.390> with<00:00:32.570> something<00:00:32.750> that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
hopefully we end up with something that

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.590 
hopefully we end up with something that
people<00:00:34.010> really<00:00:34.460> enjoy<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:35.180> it's<00:00:35.300> something

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
people really enjoy and it's something

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.540 
people really enjoy and it's something
that's<00:00:35.719> useful<00:00:35.960> rather<00:00:36.559> than<00:00:36.829> us<00:00:36.950> just<00:00:36.980> coming

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
that's useful rather than us just coming

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.670 
that's useful rather than us just coming
up<00:00:37.670> with<00:00:37.789> a<00:00:37.850> product<00:00:38.120> then<00:00:38.539> we<00:00:39.289> threw<00:00:39.530> out

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
up with a product then we threw out

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.700 
up with a product then we threw out
there<00:00:39.890> and<00:00:40.010> said<00:00:40.190> hey<00:00:40.340> this<00:00:41.500> basically<00:00:42.500> we'll

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
there and said hey this basically we'll

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.410 
there and said hey this basically we'll
start<00:00:42.980> off<00:00:43.100> with<00:00:43.129> either<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.579> wood<00:00:43.850> carving<00:00:44.239> or

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
start off with either a wood carving or

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.170 
start off with either a wood carving or
a<00:00:44.480> clay<00:00:44.809> model<00:00:45.309> we<00:00:46.309> can<00:00:46.430> use<00:00:46.579> these<00:00:46.760> clay<00:00:46.940> table

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
a clay model we can use these clay table

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.360 
a clay model we can use these clay table
models<00:00:47.480> or<00:00:47.780> wood<00:00:48.289> carvings<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:48.949> basically

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
models or wood carvings to basically

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.260 
models or wood carvings to basically
make<00:00:50.329> a<00:00:50.649> RTV<00:00:51.649> rubber<00:00:52.010> mold<00:00:52.340> which<00:00:52.789> then<00:00:53.000> we<00:00:53.120> can

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
make a RTV rubber mold which then we can

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.900 
make a RTV rubber mold which then we can
actually<00:00:53.420> make<00:00:53.750> a<00:00:53.960> hard<00:00:54.859> pourable<00:00:55.489> mold<00:00:55.730> that

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
actually make a hard pourable mold that

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.150 
actually make a hard pourable mold that
we<00:00:56.000> can<00:00:56.180> pour<00:00:56.359> hot<00:00:56.510> plastic<00:00:56.989> into<00:00:57.289> to<00:00:57.890> make<00:00:58.039> an

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
we can pour hot plastic into to make an

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.130 
we can pour hot plastic into to make an
actual<00:00:58.399> complete<00:00:58.910> working<00:00:59.359> prototype<00:00:59.870> Bloor

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
actual complete working prototype Bloor

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.889 
actual complete working prototype Bloor
we<00:01:00.890> actually<00:01:01.190> use<00:01:01.370> a<00:01:01.399> mold<00:01:02.149> building<00:01:02.510> table

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
we actually use a mold building table

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.200 
we actually use a mold building table
which<00:01:03.050> will<00:01:03.170> allow<00:01:03.440> us<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.649> form<00:01:04.460> up<00:01:04.790> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
which will allow us to form up the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.810 
which will allow us to form up the
actual<00:01:05.600> area<00:01:05.810> we<00:01:06.560> want<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:06.800> pour<00:01:07.010> RTV<00:01:07.580> silicone

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
actual area we want to pour RTV silicone

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.929 
actual area we want to pour RTV silicone
into<00:01:08.409> once<00:01:09.409> we<00:01:09.530> perform<00:01:09.650> up<00:01:10.009> this<00:01:10.130> area<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:10.820> can

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
into once we perform up this area we can

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.240 
into once we perform up this area we can
have<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.299> lure<00:01:11.450> suspended<00:01:12.110> either<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.100> wood

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
have the lure suspended either the wood

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.730 
have the lure suspended either the wood
carving<00:01:13.610> or<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:13.850> clay<00:01:14.000> model<00:01:14.360> look<00:01:15.350> more<00:01:15.560> up

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
carving or the clay model look more up

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.190 
carving or the clay model look more up
the<00:01:15.979> silicone<00:01:16.400> about<00:01:16.640> half<00:01:16.850> way<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.960> about<00:01:18.110> the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
the silicone about half way to about the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.800 
the silicone about half way to about the
seam<00:01:18.409> of<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.560> lure<00:01:18.909> once<00:01:19.909> we<00:01:20.060> do<00:01:20.180> that<00:01:20.360> the

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
seam of the lure once we do that the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.990 
seam of the lure once we do that the
actual<00:01:21.140> rubber<00:01:21.320> will<00:01:21.530> set<00:01:21.829> after<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.790> rubber

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
actual rubber will set after the rubber

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.999 
actual rubber will set after the rubber
set<00:01:23.420> we<00:01:23.810> can<00:01:23.990> actually<00:01:24.140> pour<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:24.560> top<00:01:24.740> half<00:01:24.979> of

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
set we can actually pour the top half of

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.399 
set we can actually pour the top half of
the<00:01:25.220> mold<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.240> then<00:01:26.390> as<00:01:26.750> we're<00:01:27.020> actually

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
the mold so then as we're actually

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.260 
the mold so then as we're actually
finishing<00:01:27.829> the<00:01:27.920> mold<00:01:28.220> we'll<00:01:28.460> have<00:01:28.579> two<00:01:28.850> parts

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
finishing the mold we'll have two parts

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.990 
finishing the mold we'll have two parts
that<00:01:29.509> we<00:01:29.900> can<00:01:30.020> effectively<00:01:30.409> pour<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.310> hard

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
that we can effectively pour a hard

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.060 
that we can effectively pour a hard
negative<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.720> a<00:01:32.750> hard<00:01:32.899> positive<00:01:33.380> from<00:01:36.070> the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
negative and a hard positive from the

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.499 
negative and a hard positive from the
next<00:01:37.310> step<00:01:37.460> in<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:37.670> mold<00:01:37.850> building<00:01:38.149> process

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
next step in the mold building process

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.510 
next step in the mold building process
is<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.930> actually<00:01:39.079> pour<00:01:39.409> our<00:01:39.619> hardened

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
is to actually pour our hardened

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.830 
is to actually pour our hardened
negatives<00:01:40.939> which<00:01:41.240> we're<00:01:41.390> actually<00:01:41.509> going<00:01:41.750> to

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
negatives which we're actually going to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.100 
negatives which we're actually going to
be<00:01:41.960> able<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.409> pour<00:01:42.950> our<00:01:43.820> plastic<00:01:44.299> into<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.990> make

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
be able to pour our plastic into to make

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.800 
be able to pour our plastic into to make
a<00:01:45.140> full<00:01:45.439> working<00:01:45.799> prototype<00:01:46.329> first<00:01:47.329> step<00:01:47.600> is

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
a full working prototype first step is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.350 
a full working prototype first step is
to<00:01:48.049> take<00:01:48.500> our<00:01:48.680> silicone<00:01:49.189> mold<00:01:49.430> usually<00:01:50.119> we'll

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
to take our silicone mold usually we'll

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.810 
to take our silicone mold usually we'll
try<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.630> use<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.920> wood<00:01:51.920> carving<00:01:52.310> because<00:01:52.610> the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
try to use a wood carving because the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.800 
try to use a wood carving because the
wood<00:01:52.969> carving<00:01:53.299> will<00:01:53.390> actually<00:01:53.630> let<00:01:53.780> us

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
wood carving will actually let us

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.420 
wood carving will actually let us
separate<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.740> two<00:01:54.890> parts<00:01:55.219> without

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
separate the two parts without

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.429 
separate the two parts without
destroying<00:01:55.909> our<00:01:56.270> prototype<00:01:56.840> well<00:01:57.200> actually

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
destroying our prototype well actually

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.719 
destroying our prototype well actually
insert<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.829> wood<00:01:57.950> carving<00:01:58.310> into<00:01:58.610> the

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
insert the wood carving into the

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.569 
insert the wood carving into the
silicone<00:01:59.149> pour<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.659> negative<00:02:00.259> out<00:02:01.039> of<00:02:01.100> aluminum

silicone pour a negative out of aluminum
epoxy<00:02:02.000> over<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.570> top<00:02:02.750> will<00:02:03.380> then<00:02:03.590> remove<00:02:03.950> the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
epoxy over the top will then remove the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.480 
epoxy over the top will then remove the
aluminum<00:02:04.850> epoxy<00:02:05.240> place<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:05.960> model<00:02:06.649> in<00:02:07.009> the

aluminum epoxy place the model in the
other<00:02:07.670> side<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:07.969> the<00:02:08.090> RTV<00:02:08.509> pour<00:02:09.259> once<00:02:09.500> again

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
other side of the RTV pour once again

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.770 
other side of the RTV pour once again
and<00:02:10.100> then<00:02:10.640> we'll<00:02:10.820> actually<00:02:10.940> have<00:02:11.240> two<00:02:11.510> sides

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
and then we'll actually have two sides

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.690 
and then we'll actually have two sides
of<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.020> mold<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.920> we<00:02:13.040> can<00:02:13.190> actually<00:02:13.340> pour

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
of the mold that we can actually pour

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.480 
of the mold that we can actually pour
directly<00:02:14.540> into<00:02:14.840> with<00:02:15.050> hot<00:02:15.200> plastic<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:16.220> make

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
directly into with hot plastic to make

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.850 
directly into with hot plastic to make
complete<00:02:16.790> working<00:02:17.150> prototype<00:02:17.630> now<00:02:18.500> we<00:02:18.560> can

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
complete working prototype now we can

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.130 
complete working prototype now we can
actually<00:02:19.010> take<00:02:19.460> this<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.730> put<00:02:20.240> it<00:02:20.270> into<00:02:20.600> the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
actually take this and put it into the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.410 
actually take this and put it into the
computer<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.830> get<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.550> results<00:02:22.910> we<00:02:23.030> need<00:02:23.150> for

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
computer and get the results we need for

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.070 
computer and get the results we need for
a<00:02:23.450> production<00:02:23.780> writing<00:02:24.080> mold<00:02:25.690> using<00:02:26.690> programs

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
a production writing mold using programs

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.050 
a production writing mold using programs
like<00:02:27.200> inventor<00:02:27.830> or<00:02:28.040> SolidWorks<00:02:28.550> I<00:02:28.760> can<00:02:28.940> then

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
like inventor or SolidWorks I can then

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.550 
like inventor or SolidWorks I can then
transfer<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.630> dimensions<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.200> our

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
transfer the dimensions of our

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.350 
transfer the dimensions of our
prototypes<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.310> at<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.490> computer<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.240> we<00:02:32.300> can

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
prototypes and at the computer so we can

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.420 
prototypes and at the computer so we can
get<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.570> production<00:02:33.050> test<00:02:33.320> mold<00:02:33.620> machined<00:02:34.100> they

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
get a production test mold machined they

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.800 
get a production test mold machined they
saw<00:02:34.580> on<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.760> last<00:02:34.970> step<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.210> we<00:02:35.510> actually

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
saw on the last step that we actually

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.350 
saw on the last step that we actually
had<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.560> test<00:02:36.950> mold<00:02:37.220> will<00:02:37.460> report<00:02:37.880> in<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.060> single

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
had a test mold will report in a single

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.580 
had a test mold will report in a single
shot<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.780> we're<00:02:39.050> actually<00:02:39.140> going<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.440> take

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
shot and we're actually going to take

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.470 
shot and we're actually going to take
this<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:40.100> can<00:02:40.550> transfer<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:40.910> into<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.120> software

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
this I can transfer it into the software

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.120 
this I can transfer it into the software
and<00:02:41.750> we're<00:02:42.110> actually<00:02:42.230> only<00:02:42.470> one<00:02:42.740> step<00:02:42.980> away

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
and we're actually only one step away

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.530 
and we're actually only one step away
pretty<00:02:43.520> much<00:02:43.700> from<00:02:43.850> having<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.120> fully

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
pretty much from having a fully

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.180 
pretty much from having a fully
functioning<00:02:45.080> mold<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.590> allows<00:02:45.860> for<00:02:46.040> multiple

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
functioning mold it allows for multiple

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.220 
functioning mold it allows for multiple
lures<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.700> be<00:02:46.790> injected<00:02:47.180> at<00:02:47.270> one<00:02:47.420> time<00:02:47.630> at<00:02:48.050> this

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
lures to be injected at one time at this

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.810 
lures to be injected at one time at this
point<00:02:48.440> we<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.800> actually<00:02:48.950> get<00:02:49.220> fishing<00:02:49.640> guides

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
point we can actually get fishing guides

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.820 
point we can actually get fishing guides
and<00:02:50.210> also<00:02:50.330> other<00:02:50.600> langurs<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.380> actually<00:02:51.680> get

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
and also other langurs to actually get

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.980 
and also other langurs to actually get
us<00:02:52.040> feedback<00:02:52.520> what<00:02:53.240> we<00:02:53.330> could<00:02:53.480> do<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.720> make<00:02:53.780> the
