 hello today we are going to see this exercise 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.190
 Y 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.130
 the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.010
 although it seems difficult and I 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:32.280
 it really is not, let's analyze it 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.280
 you start putting this position here 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.160
 second string 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.350
 and behind three fifth string with these 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.859
 two fingers 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.600
 then following the rule of the fingers 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.100
 we use the thumb for the strings 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.850
 fattest 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.850
 in the second prime 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.330
 slowly first part 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.330
 ah 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.540

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.300
 second part 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.480
 you leave it still and it goes up to sixth 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.480
 rope 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.250
 Y 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.580
 third part we put a major re 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.020
 ah 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.020
 and we finish 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.260
 fifth rope for this 3 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.070
 Y 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.070
 sixth string 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.049
