00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.730
 hello today we are going to make a cake of 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.530
 pumpkin very simple and very tasty for 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.110
 elaborate what we are going to use 300 grams 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.750
 We are going to chop pumpkin 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.140
 use eggs pinhole cinnamon flour 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.810
 half a glass of olive oil and yeast 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.029
 let's start slicing the pumpkin 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.890
 then we're going to boil it 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.539
 we are very soft, so the 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.340
 courts must do so in a way it 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.820
 smallest possible without needing 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.820
 grate the 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.520
 once we have already served it, we are going to 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.260
 pick up a fork and so power 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.460
 crush it so that we have one 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.460
 small pumpkin dough 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.640
 is that we already have all the pumpkin in 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.830
 chopped as you see has been enough 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.320
 loose let's start adding the rest 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.820
 of the ingredients the first thing we go 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.820
 to put is going to be the oil 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.270
 and after the oil we're going to put the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.789
 sugar 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.469
 one or two things together let's start 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.539
 remove those in a more 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.159
 uniform and we will continue to add the 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.800
 rest of the ingredients for example the 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.900
 cinnamon 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.880
 where we have everything well mixed 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.810
 let's take another bowl because we're going to 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.810
 do now is to put the egg 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.180
 let's leave in the bowl that we have 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:50.250
 empty only the whites and the yolks 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.250
 let's put the rest to the mix 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.180
 we have removed the clear blind buds 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.770
 let's move on to finish removing all 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.250
 the mix we have with the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.140
 main ingredients and the egg 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.240
 we are going to add the flour and we are going to 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.830
 keep mixing the whole set to 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.830
 that does not fit well with the mass 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.540
 the keys of the eggs are going to 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.670
 leave at the point of snow 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.560
 and once we have them ready we will 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.140
 mix with the rest of the dough as the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.060
 liver 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.260
 in this way the sponge is 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.569
 it will be much more spongy 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.569
 and we passed again to mix everything well 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.459
 once we have everything right 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.769
 mixed let's put it in a 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.970
 container all the interior we will have 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.890
 given with a little butter 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.660
 when carrying yeast we have to tell 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.160
 that the cake will go up a little bit 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.560
 then we will not fill it whole 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.540
 but we 're going to leave half 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.730
 and we have everything we 're going to put in 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.110
 oven approximately 40 minutes to 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.450
 an average temperature but always 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.130
 controlling around 180 degrees and 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.940
 let's see how it goes up and how it goes 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.980
 darkening 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.050
 and in this simple way we have 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.280
 our pumpkin cake if you have
