00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 how about friends from the community of 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.930
 markets how are you here this time 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.430
 I bring 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.280
 a tip or a tip when they remove the 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:16.849
 bolts 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.849
 the bolts of the calipers that go here 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.599
 a very practical tip so that they are not 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.990
 loosen up like me they were 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.279
 loosening 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.279
 this caliper fell 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.910
 well when when that happens that is 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.850
 what happens to them I hope not when 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.250
 also simply the bone clamp 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.100
 apart from hitting the master cylinder 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.120
 of strobe to return opposition 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.860
 it must be with a rubber mallet or something 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.829
 I have to hit him and return his 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.800
 position to ride 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.370
 before they must remove the connection 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.579
 to put them this live them 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.460
 adjusters is the advice that you throw 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.210
 a little silicone 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:14.119
 to the rope so that later 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:16.970
 that silicone on drying fits and does not 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.570
 come out again with the vibration 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.220
 you get a kind of glue but if 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.620
 we do not have the special glue that is 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.800
 for screw strings you can 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.340
 put silicone of preference and with this 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.740
 of refaccionaria if friends and good would be 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.460
 everything is a small tip 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.770
 for when they want to change bolts or 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.009
 change from balatas put them back 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.659
 change calipers change anything 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.970
 from the brake system to the blackbirds there 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.729
 than to give them some glue 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.820
 remember or silicon and good friends would be 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.200
 all any doubt by comment ivÃ¡n 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.200
