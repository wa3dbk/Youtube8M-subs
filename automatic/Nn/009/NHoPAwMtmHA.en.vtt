we're gonna load a boat go now the nice
thing<00:02:17.310> about<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.489> stacker<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:19.349> get

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:19.499 
thing about a stacker you can get

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.269 
thing about a stacker you can get
multiple<00:02:20.099> boats<00:02:20.510> on<00:02:21.510> your<00:02:22.469> crossbars<00:02:22.980> using

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:23.279 
multiple boats on your crossbars using

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.440 
multiple boats on your crossbars using
minimal<00:02:23.549> space<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.939> boat<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.180> going<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.359> be

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
minimal space the boat is going to be

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.070 
minimal space the boat is going to be
resting<00:02:24.749> on<00:02:24.810> it

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
resting on it

side<00:02:25.230> up<00:02:25.860> right<00:02:26.100> against<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.550> stacker<00:02:28.160> what

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
side up right against the stacker what

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.950 
side up right against the stacker what
is<00:02:29.280> nice<00:02:29.520> about<00:02:29.550> this<00:02:30.000> particular<00:02:30.240> stackers

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
is nice about this particular stackers

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.650 
is nice about this particular stackers
it<00:02:31.110> comes<00:02:31.320> with<00:02:31.530> two<00:02:31.890> sets<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.610> these<00:02:32.970> cradles

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
it comes with two sets of these cradles

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.060 
it comes with two sets of these cradles
and<00:02:33.870> they<00:02:33.960> are<00:02:34.050> actually<00:02:34.380> sold<00:02:34.590> separately

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
and they are actually sold separately

and they are actually sold separately
the<00:02:35.610> IMA<00:02:35.940> 451<00:02:36.900> cradles<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.040> what<00:02:38.160> they'll<00:02:38.310> do

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
the IMA 451 cradles and what they'll do

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.130 
the IMA 451 cradles and what they'll do
is<00:02:38.640> they'll<00:02:38.760> act<00:02:38.940> as<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> stop<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.750> when<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.930> put

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
is they'll act as a stop so when I put

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.470 
is they'll act as a stop so when I put
my<00:02:40.170> boat<00:02:40.500> up<00:02:40.650> against<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.070> uprights<00:02:41.400> here<00:02:41.640> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
my boat up against the uprights here the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.930 
my boat up against the uprights here the
boat<00:02:42.660> won't<00:02:42.870> want<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> slide<00:02:43.650> down<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.790> when<00:02:44.910> I

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
boat won't want to slide down so when I

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.880 
boat won't want to slide down so when I
strap<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.600> going<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.810> stay<00:02:45.960> in<00:02:46.080> place<00:02:46.290> and

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
strap it it's going to stay in place and

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.440 
strap it it's going to stay in place and
so<00:02:47.130> if<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.430> an<00:02:47.520> existing<00:02:47.760> stacker

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
so if you have an existing stacker

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.930 
so if you have an existing stacker
or<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.170> have<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> homemade<00:02:49.590> one<00:02:49.830> on<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.820> can

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
or you have a homemade one on you can

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.980 
or you have a homemade one on you can
buy<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> set<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.420> these<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.540> that'll<00:02:51.900> make

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
buy a set of these and that'll make

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.530 
buy a set of these and that'll make
loading<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.440> lot<00:02:52.620> easier<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.880> have<00:02:54.090> one<00:02:54.270> set

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
loading a lot easier and I have one set

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.300 
loading a lot easier and I have one set
mounted<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:54.990> but<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.230> also<00:02:55.380> get<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.620> second<00:02:56.100> set

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
mounted on but you also get a second set

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.090 
mounted on but you also get a second set

materials as well now the way that in O
shows<00:03:11.490> in<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.820> diagram<00:03:12.240> if<00:03:12.330> you're<00:03:12.450> using<00:03:12.630> two

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
shows in the diagram if you're using two

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.530 
shows in the diagram if you're using two
boats<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.890> actually<00:03:14.220> put<00:03:14.370> them<00:03:14.520> both<00:03:14.640> on<00:03:14.940> this

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
boats you actually put them both on this

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.660 
boats you actually put them both on this
one<00:03:15.959> side<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.530> stacker<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:17.490> you<00:03:17.550> would

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
one side of the stacker so you would

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.340 
one side of the stacker so you would
have<00:03:17.790> one<00:03:18.000> set<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.300> cradles<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:18.959> would

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
have one set of cradles so you would

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.110 
have one set of cradles so you would
push<00:03:19.560> these<00:03:19.740> stackers<00:03:20.340> further<00:03:20.610> down<00:03:20.880> you've

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
push these stackers further down you've

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.630 
push these stackers further down you've
probably<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.420> picked<00:03:21.630> bike<00:03:21.840> off<00:03:22.020> maybe<00:03:22.470> not<00:03:22.680> and

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
probably a picked bike off maybe not and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.160 
probably a picked bike off maybe not and
you<00:03:24.000> would<00:03:24.090> have<00:03:24.180> one<00:03:24.240> set<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.660> cradles<00:03:24.990> and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
you would have one set of cradles and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.720 
you would have one set of cradles and
then<00:03:25.410> behind<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.830> second<00:03:26.190> set<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.340> cradles<00:03:26.640> so

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
then behind a second set of cradles so

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.220 
then behind a second set of cradles so
the<00:03:26.850> first<00:03:27.090> boat<00:03:27.300> will<00:03:27.420> go<00:03:27.540> up<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.810> rest

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
the first boat will go up and rest

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.870 
the first boat will go up and rest
against<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.680> cradles<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.340> second<00:03:29.670> boat<00:03:29.760> will

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
against the cradles the second boat will

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
against the cradles the second boat will
go<00:03:29.970> up<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.180> then<00:03:30.269> you'll<00:03:30.390> strap<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.780> two

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
go up and then you'll strap the two

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.520 
go up and then you'll strap the two
together<00:03:31.100> other<00:03:32.450> people<00:03:33.450> will<00:03:33.630> perhaps<00:03:33.930> maybe

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
together other people will perhaps maybe

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.410 
together other people will perhaps maybe
put<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.920> cradles<00:03:35.730> on<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.880> other<00:03:36.030> side<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.269> the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
put the cradles on the other side of the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.759 
put the cradles on the other side of the
stacker<00:03:36.660> you've<00:03:37.140> got<00:03:37.230> one<00:03:37.380> boater<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.620> each

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
stacker you've got one boater in each

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.190 
stacker you've got one boater in each
side<00:03:37.950> either<00:03:38.310> way<00:03:38.430> will<00:03:38.910> work<00:03:38.940> just<00:03:39.090> fine<00:03:39.450> I've

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
side either way will work just fine I've

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
down and that makes it really easy to

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.620 
down and that makes it really easy to
tighten<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.550> and<00:04:59.670> get<00:04:59.790> a<00:04:59.820> nice<00:04:59.970> and<00:05:00.090> secure<00:05:00.360> and

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
on the other side as well I would have

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.050 
on the other side as well I would have
done<00:05:03.810> I<00:05:03.840> just<00:05:04.140> take<00:05:04.230> the<00:05:04.320> slack<00:05:04.530> and<00:05:05.340> you<00:05:05.970> know

I get creative with it double up the

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.200 
I get creative with it double up the
loop<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:08.610> just<00:05:08.790> kind<00:05:08.940> of<00:05:09.000> loop<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.180> around

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
loop and just kind of loop it around

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.030 
loop and just kind of loop it around
like<00:05:09.480> this<00:05:09.540> perhaps<00:05:10.020> something<00:05:10.680> like<00:05:10.860> that
