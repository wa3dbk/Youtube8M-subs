 with a button and usually this 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.340
 Some repetitive calls for more

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.269

 was the case of the game extract 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.930
 Let's open the law and she's the book. 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.120
 first phase we just had to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.559
 they can catch it was good was the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.940
 marketing cuts part we just had 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.989
 Can you take a look at it, beauty? 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.270
 which is the game tightens screen your balloon 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.430
 rises s sawtelle 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.049
 you can not find things maybe 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.180
 the one inside the balloon that has a lot 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:15.270
 of light balls 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.200
 besides what you see is a coffee table lamp 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.850
 in the morning 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.400
 I only said it because the only word of the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.400
 dictionary that rhymes room, right? 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.530
 funny 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.900
 then certainly balloon full of vague 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.030
 face flies then this model are your 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.860
 life are the ones that let you continue 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.500
 flying if we had a blaze and to 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.540
 flying you just have to get more students from 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.950
 phase and can not touch anything if 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.909
 get something will lose more 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.649
 fireflies 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.570
 I do not know exactly what fireflies are but only 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.220
 will lose these bugs now opt for 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.070
 but a name I 'll go 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.020
 something else is happening, and you? 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.270
 The more you hold onto the screen for him 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.130
 up more speed it picks you 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.009
 slow down it is only you 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.740
 do what gives several quick pads 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.659
 or now is not good is for this several 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.280
 Quick touches on the screen it will be fine 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.350
 slowly 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.759
 I just want to play is not good because your 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.569
 eyes are coming out a little 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.400
 a little 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.800
 so the longer you have the more time 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.230
 You have the least fireflies you go 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.510
 losing this game sounds like fun 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.880
 that he has a mathematics he looks only 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.180
 has an honor to welcome you very pretty 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.890
 so the artistic part of them are 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.140
 creditors with fun songs 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.640
 well, my colleagues, too. 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.600
 this beast that I can not do beats him 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.850
 of three volumes and so you go 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.670
 recording this strange and 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.870
 passing through the phases as if 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:50.739
 there was tomorrow 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:53.560
 the novel is a novel that he did not even know in order to 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.280
 what the music of 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:03.040
 the couple is 1 million vacancies flames 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.950
 for the good of the goal and hit face in the favela 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.560
 within the program of another channel to 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.810
 dengue 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.270
 probably suffer from the colors of 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.100
 another thing 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:26.610
