00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.699 

unfortunately<00:02:46.180> i<00:02:46.209> don't<00:02:46.390> think<00:02:47.049> i'm<00:02:47.260> going<00:02:47.560> to

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
unfortunately i don't think i'm going to

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.149 
unfortunately i don't think i'm going to
be<00:02:47.920> able<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.519> get<00:02:48.879> the<00:02:49.060> train<00:02:49.680> because<00:02:50.680> there's

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
be able to get the train because there's

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.809 
be able to get the train because there's
only<00:02:51.390> three<00:02:52.390> minutes<00:02:52.599> left<00:02:53.379> on<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:54.370> video

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.130 

I<00:02:58.159> don't<00:02:58.730> really<00:02:58.849> think<00:02:59.030> anybody<00:02:59.569> wants<00:02:59.959> to

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
I don't really think anybody wants to

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.670 
I don't really think anybody wants to
see<00:03:00.349> three<00:03:00.829> minutes<00:03:01.159> of<00:03:01.310> nothing

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
see three minutes of nothing

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.030 
see three minutes of nothing

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
let's see what we got here so this is

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.810 
let's see what we got here so this is
the<00:03:13.820> local<00:03:14.180> train<00:03:14.680> it's<00:03:15.680> much<00:03:15.890> slower<00:03:16.220> than

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
the local train it's much slower than

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.960 
the local train it's much slower than
the<00:03:17.210> regular<00:03:17.840> train<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:19.040> stops<00:03:19.400> at<00:03:19.550> all<00:03:19.670> the

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
the regular train it stops at all the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.740 
the regular train it stops at all the
small<00:03:20.270> cities<00:03:20.630> between<00:03:20.660> larger<00:03:21.560> cities

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.720 

as<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.050> can<00:03:25.140> see<00:03:25.350> this<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.770> going<00:03:26.010> for<00:03:26.430> Nam

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
as you can see this is going for Nam

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.800 
as you can see this is going for Nam
bong<00:03:26.940> rovol<00:03:27.360> stops

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.730 

here<00:03:31.349> we<00:03:31.530> have<00:03:31.709> the

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
here we have the

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:49.640 
here we have the
timetable<00:03:34.700> when<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.630> trains<00:03:35.900> are<00:03:36.020> coming

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.860 

I've<00:03:49.860> been<00:03:50.040> down<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.400> way

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.090

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
and this is my train

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.190 
and this is my train
so<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.760> think<00:03:58.240> this<00:03:58.510> we're<00:03:58.870> going<00:03:59.020> to<00:03:59.080> go<00:03:59.170> ahead

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
so I think this we're going to go ahead

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.860 
so I think this we're going to go ahead
and<00:03:59.500> cut<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.860> off<00:03:59.980> right<00:04:00.220> here<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.780> keep<00:04:01.780> an

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
and cut it off right here and keep an

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.730 
and cut it off right here and keep an
eye<00:04:01.990> out<00:04:02.020> for<00:04:02.320> my<00:04:02.410> next<00:04:02.440> video<00:04:02.860> bye<00:04:03.430> bye<00:04:03.460> now
