00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.789 
definitely a great app and I do
recommend<00:01:33.299> checking<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.900> out<00:01:33.990> even<00:01:34.380> though<00:01:34.619> it

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
recommend checking it out even though it

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.969 
recommend checking it out even though it
does<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.640> $0.99<00:01:36.450> price<00:01:36.900> tag<00:01:37.229> now

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
does have that $0.99 price tag now

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.980 
does have that $0.99 price tag now
