00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.010 
has added and that is the avid media
access<00:00:18.650> or<00:00:19.280> AMA<00:00:20.120> which<00:00:20.540> is<00:00:20.660> really<00:00:20.840> great

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
access or AMA which is really great

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.290 
access or AMA which is really great
because<00:00:21.230> it<00:00:21.620> speeds<00:00:22.310> up<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:22.610> workflow<00:00:23.060> and

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
because it speeds up the workflow and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.750 
because it speeds up the workflow and
there's<00:00:23.450> no<00:00:23.570> longer<00:00:23.960> waiting<00:00:24.590> to<00:00:24.920> convert<00:00:25.550> all

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
there's no longer waiting to convert all

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.410 
there's no longer waiting to convert all
of<00:00:26.060> your<00:00:26.210> mp4<00:00:26.810> files<00:00:27.260> into<00:00:27.620> another<00:00:28.430> format<00:00:28.820> so

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
of your mp4 files into another format so

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.390 
of your mp4 files into another format so
what<00:00:30.380> we're<00:00:30.500> going<00:00:30.620> to<00:00:30.740> be<00:00:30.860> showing<00:00:31.040> you<00:00:31.250> today

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
what we're going to be showing you today

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.380 
what we're going to be showing you today
is<00:00:31.790> the<00:00:32.450> mp4<00:00:33.170> format<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:34.040> how<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:34.940> works<00:00:35.090> with

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
is the mp4 format and how it works with

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.410 
is the mp4 format and how it works with
avid's<00:00:35.810> AMA<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:37.340> here<00:00:37.490> we<00:00:37.580> go<00:00:37.610> we're<00:00:38.210> going<00:00:38.360> to

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
avid's AMA so here we go we're going to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
avid's AMA so here we go we're going to
make<00:00:38.540> a<00:00:38.600> new<00:00:38.870> project<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:40.990> this<00:00:41.990> new<00:00:42.200> project

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
make a new project and this new project

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.100 
make a new project and this new project
has<00:00:42.920> defaulted<00:00:43.700> if<00:00:44.300> it<00:00:44.450> doesn't<00:00:44.600> default<00:00:44.960> to

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
has defaulted if it doesn't default to

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.260 
has defaulted if it doesn't default to
this<00:00:45.260> then<00:00:45.500> just<00:00:45.680> select<00:00:45.800> it<00:00:46.130> but<00:00:46.640> 1080p<00:00:47.350> 24<00:00:48.350> or

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
this then just select it but 1080p 24 or

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.880 
this then just select it but 1080p 24 or
23.976<00:00:50.270> it's<00:00:50.989> important<00:00:51.410> that<00:00:51.560> you<00:00:51.650> choose

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
23.976 it's important that you choose

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.380 
23.976 it's important that you choose
23.976<00:00:53.260> because<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.500> HM<00:00:54.980> 107<00:00:55.790> hundred<00:00:56.030> are

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
23.976 because the HM 107 hundred are

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.050 
23.976 because the HM 107 hundred are
actually<00:00:56.750> in<00:00:56.899> capable<00:00:57.440> of<00:00:57.620> recording<00:00:58.399> at<00:00:58.700> true

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
cameras that do 24p are actually

cameras that do 24p are actually
recording<00:01:11.359> at<00:01:11.590> 23.976<00:01:12.729> so<00:01:13.729> we<00:01:13.939> make<00:01:14.060> sure<00:01:14.090> we

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
recording at 23.976 so we make sure we

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.690 
recording at 23.976 so we make sure we
choose<00:01:14.569> that<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.079> as<00:01:15.859> well<00:01:16.069> our<00:01:16.249> raster

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
choose that and as well our raster

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.569 
choose that and as well our raster
dimension<00:01:17.149> if<00:01:17.299> you<00:01:18.079> were<00:01:18.439> shooting<00:01:18.619> an<00:01:18.889> HQ

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579

dimension if you were shooting an HQ
format<00:01:20.149> which<00:01:20.389> is<00:01:20.420> 35<00:01:20.959> megabits<00:01:21.409> per<00:01:21.469> second

format which is 35 megabits per second

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.459 
format which is 35 megabits per second
make<00:01:22.429> sure<00:01:22.459> you<00:01:22.700> choose<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:22.969> 1920<00:01:23.689> x<00:01:23.840> 1080<00:01:24.020> if

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
make sure you choose the 1920 x 1080 if

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.569 
make sure you choose the 1920 x 1080 if
you<00:01:25.249> were<00:01:25.520> shooting<00:01:25.670> in<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:25.939> SP<00:01:26.560> which<00:01:27.560> is<00:01:27.799> 25

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
you were shooting in the SP which is 25

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.080 
you were shooting in the SP which is 25
or<00:01:28.999> 19<00:01:29.749> megabits<00:01:30.200> per<00:01:30.259> second<00:01:30.759> and<00:01:31.759> in<00:01:31.969> our

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
or 19 megabits per second and in our

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.139 
or 19 megabits per second and in our
case<00:01:32.119> it<00:01:32.569> would<00:01:32.719> be<00:01:32.840> 25<00:01:33.229> for<00:01:33.499> 1080<00:01:33.799> then<00:01:34.549> the

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
case it would be 25 for 1080 then the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.019 
case it would be 25 for 1080 then the
horizontal<00:01:35.840> resolution<00:01:35.929> would<00:01:36.350> be<00:01:36.499> 1440<00:01:37.279> but

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:38.029 
horizontal resolution would be 1440 but

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:40.749 
horizontal resolution would be 1440 but
we<00:01:39.020> shot<00:01:39.200> in<00:01:39.409> full<00:01:39.679> thirty<00:01:39.979> five<00:01:40.159> megabits<00:01:40.490> so

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
we shot in full thirty five megabits so

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.239 
we shot in full thirty five megabits so
we're<00:01:40.939> choosing<00:01:41.060> 1920<00:01:41.749> x<00:01:41.840> 1080<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.799> we'll

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
we're choosing 1920 x 1080 and we'll

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:44.620 
we're choosing 1920 x 1080 and we'll
just<00:01:43.279> give<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:43.639> a<00:01:43.700> name<00:01:43.999> will<00:01:44.299> call<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:44.539> the

this workflow is designed really for

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.690 
this workflow is designed really for
news<00:02:27.850> so<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.630> news<00:02:29.080> cameraman<00:02:29.530> could<00:02:29.830> bring<00:02:30.489> a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
news so a news cameraman could bring a

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.300 
news so a news cameraman could bring a
card<00:02:31.030> into<00:02:31.480> an<00:02:31.600> editor<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.170> go<00:02:32.739> okay<00:02:33.069> here's

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
card into an editor and go okay here's

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.220 
card into an editor and go okay here's
the<00:02:33.370> footage<00:02:33.790> has<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.690> be<00:02:34.780> on<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.050> five

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
the footage has to be on the five

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.920 
the footage has to be on the five
o'clock<00:02:35.260> news<00:02:35.769> start<00:02:36.519> cutting<00:02:36.790> now<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.239> you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
o'clock news start cutting now and you

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.960 
o'clock news start cutting now and you
could<00:02:38.080> cut<00:02:38.319> literally<00:02:38.800> from<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.190> card<00:02:39.489> that

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
could cut literally from the card that

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.050 
could cut literally from the card that
wouldn't<00:02:40.180> be<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.569> problem<00:02:41.160> usb2<00:02:42.160> can<00:02:42.550> handle<00:02:42.970> it

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
wouldn't be a problem usb2 can handle it

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.600 
wouldn't be a problem usb2 can handle it
but<00:02:43.840> then<00:02:44.019> what<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.260> would<00:02:44.380> do<00:02:44.560> if<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.010> wanted

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
but then what you would do if you wanted

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.940 
but then what you would do if you wanted
a<00:02:45.700> permanent<00:02:45.730> copy<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.660> at<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.560> end<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.799> your

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
a permanent copy is at the end of your

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.110 
a permanent copy is at the end of your
sequence<00:02:48.519> you<00:02:48.670> would<00:02:48.790> cut<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.030> together

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
sequence you would cut it together

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880 
sequence you would cut it together
really<00:02:49.420> quickly<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.049> then<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.769> would

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
really quickly and then you would

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.120 
really quickly and then you would
consolidate<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.790> too<00:02:52.480> hard<00:02:53.019> drive<00:02:53.319> after<00:02:54.040> the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
consolidate it too hard drive after the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.380 
consolidate it too hard drive after the
fact<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.489> that<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.819> at<00:02:54.970> least<00:02:55.000> had<00:02:55.360> the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
fact so that you at least had the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.500 
fact so that you at least had the
footage<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.590> used<00:02:56.830> in<00:02:57.459> your<00:02:58.000> sequence

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
footage that you used in your sequence

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.979 
footage that you used in your sequence
well<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.380> thing<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.590> that<00:03:00.810> isn't<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.840> really

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
well the thing is that isn't a really

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.259 
well the thing is that isn't a really
great<00:03:02.230> workflow<00:03:02.739> if<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.519> want<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.880> protect

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
great workflow if you want to protect

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.080 
great workflow if you want to protect
this<00:03:04.690> media<00:03:05.110> because<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.950> AMA<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.610> referring

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
this media because the AMA is referring

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.180 
this media because the AMA is referring
directly<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.840> card<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.739> what<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:08.890> want<00:03:09.130> to

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
directly to the card so what I want to

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.370 
directly to the card so what I want to
do<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:09.400> import<00:03:10.060> my<00:03:10.299> clips<00:03:10.690> that<00:03:10.900> I've<00:03:11.049> actually

so when I activate this bin that I
custom-made<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.549> want<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.180> import<00:03:31.600> those<00:03:31.750> clips

custom-made I want to import those clips
into<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.560> bin<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:34.299> other<00:03:34.510> thing<00:03:34.840> I<00:03:34.989> want<00:03:35.230> to

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
into that bin the other thing I want to

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.520 
into that bin the other thing I want to
do<00:03:35.470> is<00:03:35.709> on<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.760> volume<00:03:37.120> mounting<00:03:37.690> if<00:03:37.840> I've

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
do is on the volume mounting if I've

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.860 
do is on the volume mounting if I've
already<00:03:39.030> imported<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.500> bin<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:43.090> won't<00:03:43.630> do<00:03:43.780> it

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
already imported a bin it won't do it

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.660 
already imported a bin it won't do it
again<00:03:43.959> I'll<00:03:44.290> only<00:03:44.440> do<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.620> once<00:03:44.950> unless<00:03:45.489> you

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
again I'll only do it once unless you

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.550 
again I'll only do it once unless you
turn<00:03:45.910> on<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:46.329> always<00:03:46.720> mount<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.109> volume<00:03:47.440> do

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
turn on this always mount the volume do

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.020 
turn on this always mount the volume do
not<00:03:47.680> check<00:03:47.950> for<00:03:48.130> modifications<00:03:50.970> okay<00:03:51.970> so

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
not check for modifications okay so

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.430 
not check for modifications okay so
let's<00:03:52.329> just<00:03:52.510> give<00:03:52.660> this<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.840> try<00:03:53.049> so<00:03:53.319> I've

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
let's just give this a try so I've

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.940 
let's just give this a try so I've
selected<00:03:53.650> this<00:03:54.160> bin<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:55.440> I'm<00:03:56.440> going<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.709> link

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
selected this bin and I'm going to link

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.030 
selected this bin and I'm going to link
to<00:03:57.430> an<00:03:57.519> AMA<00:03:57.970> volume<00:03:58.450> and<00:04:00.120> here's<00:04:01.120> my<00:04:01.680> my<00:04:02.680> folder

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
to an AMA volume and here's my my folder

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.759 
to an AMA volume and here's my my folder
that<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.220> made<00:04:03.459> hm<00:04:03.760> 107<00:04:04.750> hundred<00:04:04.989> media<00:04:05.290> and

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
that I made hm 107 hundred media and

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.430 
that I made hm 107 hundred media and
inside<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.280> course<00:04:06.549> you<00:04:06.729> see<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.000> BP<00:04:07.329> AV

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
inside of course you see the BP AV

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.400 
inside of course you see the BP AV
so<00:04:08.950> I'm<00:04:09.490> just<00:04:09.850> going<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.150> select<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:11.170> top

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
so I'm just going to select the top

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.870 
so I'm just going to select the top
folder<00:04:11.920> here<00:04:12.570> say<00:04:13.570> okay<00:04:14.020> and<00:04:14.820> there's<00:04:15.820> the

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
folder here say okay and there's the

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.440 
folder here say okay and there's the
clips<00:04:16.269> they<00:04:16.690> came<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.140> now<00:04:18.040> this<00:04:18.340> time<00:04:18.730> they're

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
clips they came in now this time they're

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.780 
clips they came in now this time they're
playing<00:04:19.810> off<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.080> the<00:04:20.380> hard<00:04:20.590> drive<00:04:22.080> so<00:04:23.080> i<00:04:23.410> can

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
playing off of the hard drive so i can

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.140 
playing off of the hard drive so i can
take<00:04:24.790> this<00:04:24.850> one<00:04:25.300> Volume<00:04:25.750> II<00:04:26.910> don't<00:04:27.910> want<00:04:28.060> the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
take this one Volume II don't want the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.840 
take this one Volume II don't want the
volume<00:04:28.450> ii<00:04:28.600> bin<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.520> i'm<00:04:30.520> just<00:04:30.610> going<00:04:30.730> to

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
volume ii bin and i'm just going to
