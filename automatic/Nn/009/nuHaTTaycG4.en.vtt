 today we are going to make chicken ships with 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.640
 pineapple sauce the ingredients that we're going 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:28.360
 to need are pineapple black pepper 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:30.910
 lemon garlic oil egg salt chicken and the 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.890
 bag of flumen refuses batter 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.230
 crunchy lemon for oven that we 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.230
 the friends of gustavo have been given here 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.409
 and with great force 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:10.740
 you have to turn it around 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.870
 ok and we have already taken the shape of the lake 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.860
 that would be here because we're going to 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.860
 do with all the chicken 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.440
 once we have the shape of the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.750
 chicken in the shape of nobody let's catch and 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.820
 we are going to rest in egg 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.850
 once the egg is well soaked 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.120
 we're going to go through the bread crumbs of 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.729
 the brand I smoked that this does not need to fry 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.830
 so it's much faster is done 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.460
 directly in the oven and it stays very 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.190
 crunchy 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.710
 this package we have achieved in the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.010
 this middle box of gustavo once 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.740
 that is well spent by this bread 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.570
 crunchy grated let's put and what 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.560
 We are going to do everything and we are going to preheat 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.460
 the oven at 180 degrees 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.460
 once we have 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.810

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.150
 after 15 minutes they have already been done 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.070
 our baked nuggets ready for 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.060

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.060
