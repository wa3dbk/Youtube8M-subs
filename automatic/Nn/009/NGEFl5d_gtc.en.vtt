00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.129
 hello everyone and welcome to retro 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.510
 well fifth little trainer of which is 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.220
 returned here man in one of the 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.869
 revolutions of ibi is not silvio is a 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.759
 great but good of increase either 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.650
 we know nothing more about silvio and 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.689
 well let's start quick one 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.460
 experience that concretely invented 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.020
 I have not seen him have internet 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.040
 been looking for something similar and yes that 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.380
 there are similar things but it is not 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.030
 exactly what I have and good 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.950
 let's start commenting braking the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.809
 nature the nature of a veron goes 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.940
 to be synchronicity that is the nature that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.559
 has in itself this nature what 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.300
 ago is that when he entered second a 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.249
 change of status such as 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.809
 do they poison us do not do it in a 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:48.329
 attack of paralysis what the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.949
 they sleep for example a being and bad too 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.019
 is going to sleep has been poisoned is going to 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.190
 copy this what we have so 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.600
 that comes this very well because if 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.239
 they do anything for the rival 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.739
 I also have it and also has a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.059
 side effect that is that it can happen 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.379
 nature the wild pokemon 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.850
 people do not care because we do not want it 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.400
 to catch because we have what we're going to 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.620
 do it competitively so how do you 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.540
 I say the skill synchrony has the 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.840
 en world skill which is focus 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.159
 internal that prevents backspace but 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.100
 we do not care 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.960
 It's pretty much the same with that and as I say 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.520
 synchrony you go in your skill well then 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.710
 as you will know one of suppo with a type 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.899
 sinister that above all is known by 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.549
 have a lot of psi 's 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:31.829
 defenses specifically has a maximum 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.840
 of 300 94 countries 350 defense and 394 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.520
 special people this means that a 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.840
 little although although it has a lot of defense 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.060
 does not have much attack in special attack 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.459
 so focus rather on this that 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.259
 have more defense and we will see more or 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.849
 less how can we make it attack 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.950
 of this shoulder in rise to be more 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.719
 strong and can hit harder 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.939
 Well, this, like the week ones, there's only 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.950
 a single set but even if only one thing 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.329
 we can change in many ways I 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.829
 made a few a veron so that 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.989
 you can see more or less how we can 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.610
 shuffle the possibilities to use this 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:01.679
 shoulder and good let's start with the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.030
 first it is personally the one that I have 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.950
 in the equipment that I use in some like 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.170
 digital is a man of nature 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.269
 rude as you know you will defend 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.190
 special against getting off pretty 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.599
 the speed but good the number that 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.790
 let's use it will not have anything of 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.680
 speed is more 7 this man more 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.000
 brewer will not have anything from yves the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.870
 truth is that the entity does not care 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.099
 nothing so 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.230
 the nature of this is very good 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.680
 as I tell you but it will be more defenses 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.239
 special minus speed in the eps van 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.580
 to be 252 hp of life so you have 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.620
 394 concretely then it's going to have 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.920
 four points in the defense and will have 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.870
 also 252 on the official agenda for 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.659
 have the maximum possible that you can have 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.849
 as I tell you the tips of the speed 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.470
 The less the better gives us enough 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.329
 equal the speed of this man so 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.799
 that if you have zero then better than better 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.840
 good for let's quickly move the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.609
 attacks in the first place has curse 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.470
 just like king and rock in the video 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.450
 previous that does curse if you remember 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.609
 curse but group contains ghost 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.349
 before we have more attack more 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.030
 defense against losing more 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.170
 speed as I tell you the speed we 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.150
 no matter what else we have put 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.890
 nature against the speed you 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.659
 we have set zero and speed pge 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.060
 we have set zero away from speed we 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.500
 it does not matter the speed really 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.450
 as I tell you curse is going to 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.129
 multiply by 1.5 the attack and the 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.480
 defense every turn we do it in 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.130
 against losing speed that gives us 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.050
 absolutely the same 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.700
 what does this mean that when 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.840
 let's have for example then without 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.850
 curses that is the most we 're going 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.850
 to make a look our number 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.440
 specifically will have an attack of 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.540
 498 but here it's pretty good has 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.140
 enough power with 498 to be 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.030
 true 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.260
 It is a very good attack, in addition to the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.150
 defenses that you have for is an attack 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.150
 pretty decent to be able to hit everything 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.010
 the competitive pokemon and then like 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.720
 Second attack has vendetta vendetta 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.640
 is an attack that has 50 power 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.900
 sinister type or that a verón 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.180
 it also has to be to be type 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.190
 sinister has 50 power but 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.230
 remember that if you hit us before 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.180
 we have 100 power 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.340
 multiply the power of vendetta by 2 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.720
 what does this mean and if the opponent is 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.340
 faster than us and what 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.960
 we will easily get through with 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.420
 curse and with nature and so on 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.950
 because we have very little speed if 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.510
 the opponent is faster hits us first 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.310
 our athlete is going to be mention of 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.350
 power or leave without very strong attack 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.940
 it's like a sinister earthquake is physical 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.700
 also and as I tell you as an edition 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.630
 we will have 498 attack 100 power 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.710
 in curse there is a weathervane forgiveness was going to 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.300
 be very powerful attack that is going to 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.650
 destroy everyone but well 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.680
 while we have to do the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.670
 curses surely 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.920
 so what we have to pretend 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.050
 have debugging attacks 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.760
 for protection and desire is a very like 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.590
 good since we can protect ourselves 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.360
 turn while the other one is hitting us and 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.030
 others and we left half of life 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.790
 with desire besides desire also 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.560
 we can pass them to the pokemon of 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.300
 team if we have more in the team 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.980
 apart from a life broncón we are going to do 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.390
 I want to change and that can be very 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.430
 thanks to these to that it tries that enough 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.540
 flight only serves for men but 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.520
 for all our team is pretty 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.160
 good and as I tell you as of his 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.500
 I really like protection and I think that 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.290
 use in this in this combo in this 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.450
 world be forgiveness to be able to leave 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.400
 making the curses have a lot more 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.350
 defense remember we have a lot 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.120
 defense in a lot of special thoughts with 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.590
 the curse we will have even more and once 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.970
 let's do three or four curses 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.100
 it will not be necessary to make even versions 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.840
 we will talk about the object from time to time 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.650
 that has equipped a veron is remains or 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.980
 we are also recovering 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.240
 enough life with the remains and I do not think 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.130
 that it takes a bit too much more 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.180
 so that this man can not throw only 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.340
 He has an attack as I tell you he has 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.760
 damn curse damn what a mess 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.520
 has vendetta 16 pp is has with the 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.310
 more colors 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.039
 it's pretty good I think 16 turns that 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.810
 we can deliver with 498 attack and 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.280
 I think it's very good, I love you too 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.020
 teach others a veron that I have 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.460
 it simply differs in attacks 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.860
 does not change anything else if the man is 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.900
 exactly the same and good this man in 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.669
 concrete has toxic instead of 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.340
 protection because toxic because 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.629
 remember that with toxic each shift 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.340
 let's remove a marc vidal pokemon 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:06:00.220
 rival if we believe that we have dispensed 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.080
 of protection in green if we want to 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.090
 the toxic because it is also very good is 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.409
 more sometimes I used this chocolate and the 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.940
 it's really good to do toxic 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.590
 if vendetta is ineffective against the 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.970
 rival remember that sell you sell 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.500
 everybody that does mean what 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.360
 sold affected everyone not like 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.550
 toxic but take out some lipocero 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.289
 Well, we can not do anything so good 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.259
 with toxic is fine if we do not go 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:22.360
 trying with the desire and if not us 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.940
 like this combo, we can put it 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.409
 luke donald instead of wish light the 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.900
 We remember that it is the same as I want but 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.729
 in a turn without any weird weather it's not going 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.650
 to recover half of life is to say 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.710
 just like recovery the only bad thing 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:38.139
 is that it has 5 pp is maximum 8 with the 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.130
 Max pp has very few pp but the truth 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.360
 is that good while doing the 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.009
 curse comes 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.530
 because then when we are at maximum 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:46.599
 of defense almost that we will not make serve 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.449
 as much once or twice or that is 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:51.129
 it is also very well to make light mari and 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:52.479
 Toxic the truth that I do not opt ​​for 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.740
 a single man I recommend that 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:55.750
 try all three and see what is 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.090
 your man can that more fits 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.830
 to your to your game I say that I 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.879
 I'm with the first but used the 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.050
 two others and the truth is that they come 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.669
 pretty good and I can not find any 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.169
 problem using them and I think that 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:07.210
 they can give a lot of play at the level 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:08.770
 competitive well so far the 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.509
 fifth pokemon the week I played the 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.979
 next week and as I always say 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:14.500
 You liked this video, you write it 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:18.270
