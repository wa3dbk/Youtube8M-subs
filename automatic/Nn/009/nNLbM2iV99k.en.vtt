00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:18.330
 It's good and that's it, beauty is today. Let's go. 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.240
 become a video and ten times the jazz 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.539
 was the first boxing video here in the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.390
 channel and will be from my new head set from 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:36.690
 The right color is the cerri rapto raptors e 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:38.070
 lh a mistake I bought this phone in 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.070
 game set 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:50.070
 he was in 119 if I'm not mistaken, huh? 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:59.120
 and a little of the box is foldable for 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:59.120
 easy transport here has some 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:09.570
 specifications of him I will not speak 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.960
 because why not leave the description 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:18.119
 of the video there the link for whoever you want 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:22.460
 buy the phone there in the game set and I'll go 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.890
 open here and I'm going to go fast again 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:37.229
 so the people here are the box of the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:42.240
 phone rang with the hand only then it will be 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.850
 very difficult to recover and how I go 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.860
 get out of here then I'll come back easier 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:56.700
 the folks came this leaflet that gives 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:02:01.430
 certain things about him and 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:07.069
 two is not usb but it's plate goal 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:10.720
 will show right to cleiton goal that 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:19.420
 improves slightly in conductivity 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:23.920
 with time 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.650
 A funk is pretty heavy. I did not think 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.060
 it was lighter in the photos I found 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:44.490
 that he was much simpler but he is 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:44.490
 well it looks like a robust d 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:03:05.950
 it can leave you closer to the mouth more 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:11.310
 far learn in the shirt the yarn and stay 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.310
 easier to use 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:23.410
 there is nothing much and that's it folks 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:27.760
 Now I'm going to test and then I'm back 31 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:32.620
 with a microphone from him to finish this 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:39.090
 review and iam rather headset boxing 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:43.420
 abduction lh an evo I'll be right back 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:47.709
 the crowd then leave the ambu xxi 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:53.110
 headset now I just think with the 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:55.060
 sheik I did not find the microphone good 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.819
 for 72 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:05.689
 he has a slight cheadle 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:08.349
 There's nothing else I 've worked on. 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.349
 so do not 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:19.729
 and it shows that's how I got a name 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.690
 very pleased was that it tightens a 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.250
 I do not know if it's because I'm 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.789
 brand new 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.690
 he's still a little hard so I do not know 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:35.360
 I already had a phone that was not like that 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:39.500
 first days is uncomfortable love 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:43.000
 but then it got a bit more 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.000
 more comfortable, huh? 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:56.360
 It's another one. Yes, his son is not. 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:05:00.860
 a son there very very thick so not 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.580
 plus a short yarn I like short yarn 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.169
 huh 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:09.169
 But everyone has their own opinion, right? 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:13.940
 I'm playing in that tom clancy's 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:20.240
 ghost recon felton né 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:22.360
 It is available for free right on steam right 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.400
 not 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.400
 First I'm playing the game. 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:36.870
 and sorry guys for a while 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:39.780
 A lot is said on the channel because I 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.960
 problems with the internet, I'm not 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.660
 Finally the total receiving signal 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.229
 internet that I paid 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:52.430
 so it's kind of complicated to record 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:57.690
 online video game né 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:02.430
 But now the time for photographing like this is 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:06.260
 So little better on the internet, right? 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.260
 You're one of the best, huh? 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.960
 so this is it guys and videos 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:25.800
 quickie just to show a little to 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:29.789
 you the quality of the headset and also the 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.660
 my opinion about it but so is the 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:39.389
 Worth buying is worth investing in. 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:44.190
 Because I found it a lot and I liked a phone it 's 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:47.400
 for the robust is not a phone to take 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.139
 a certain security to use it seems not to 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.360
 it will break right 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:56.990
 That's it people was my opinion on 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.990
 the headset's it worth then I got
