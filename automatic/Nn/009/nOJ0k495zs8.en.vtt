the<00:00:12.000> sound<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.840> being<00:00:13.110> done<00:00:13.290> with<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.620> blue

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the sound is being done with the blue

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.880 
the sound is being done with the blue
Yeti<00:00:14.430> microphone<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:15.930> hopefully<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
Yeti microphone and so hopefully the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.769 
Yeti microphone and so hopefully the
sound<00:00:17.099> is<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> bit<00:00:17.640> better<00:00:17.790> and<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.540> said

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
sound is a bit better and like I said

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.600 
sound is a bit better and like I said
that<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.200> new<00:00:19.410> webcam<00:00:20.040> will<00:00:20.220> be<00:00:20.310> coming<00:00:20.580> soon

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
that the new webcam will be coming soon

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.160 
that the new webcam will be coming soon
so<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> quality<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.540> the<00:00:21.630> video<00:00:21.869> should<00:00:22.110> be

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
so the quality of the video should be

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.499 
so the quality of the video should be
much<00:00:22.410> better<00:00:22.590> -<00:00:22.860> and<00:00:23.189> today<00:00:24.119> I'm<00:00:24.210> going<00:00:24.329> to<00:00:24.390> do

you just basically go ahead and open it
and<00:02:49.900> that's<00:02:50.440> what<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.620> want<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.800> say<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.010> just

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
and that's what you want to say it just

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.280 
and that's what you want to say it just
looks<00:02:51.340> like<00:02:51.400> mascara<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.300> we'll<00:02:52.900> just<00:02:53.080> push

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
looks like mascara and we'll just push

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.130 
looks like mascara and we'll just push
it<00:02:53.470> over<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.920> brows<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:57.670> like<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:59.050> I

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
it over the brows just like that and I

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.890 
it over the brows just like that and I
get<00:02:59.290> on<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.470> other<00:02:59.620> one

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
get on the other one

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.980

and<00:03:02.490> all<00:03:03.490> that<00:03:03.700> does<00:03:03.940> is<00:03:04.180> keep<00:03:04.540> them<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.840> place

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
and all that does is keep them in place

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.860 
and all that does is keep them in place
it<00:03:05.350> keeps<00:03:05.560> them<00:03:05.710> very<00:03:05.740> nice<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.370> neat<00:03:06.550> and

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
it keeps them very nice and neat and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.410 
it keeps them very nice and neat and
also<00:03:07.870> look<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.380> lot<00:03:08.980> less<00:03:09.160> filled<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.240> with

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
also look a lot less filled in with

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.660 
also look a lot less filled in with
powder<00:03:10.690> if<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.080> know<00:03:11.140> what<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.290> mean<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.830> it

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
powder if you know what I mean and it

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.340 
powder if you know what I mean and it
gives<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:13.000> texture<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.780> actually<00:03:14.170> looking

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
gives that texture of actually looking

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.900 
gives that texture of actually looking
