we're<00:00:32.399> using<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.820> right<00:00:33.030> test<00:00:33.390> no<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:34.200> not

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
we're using the right test no it's not

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
we're using the right test no it's not
the<00:00:34.530> only<00:00:34.770> measure<00:00:35.190> were<00:00:35.489> using<00:00:36.000> well<00:00:36.239> it's

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the only measure were using well it's

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.360 
the only measure were using well it's
the<00:00:36.600> only<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:37.260> used<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.710> terms<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.160> national

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.400 
the only one used in terms of national
percentiles<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.750> maybe<00:00:40.050> we<00:00:40.230> should

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
percentiles and maybe we should

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.110 
percentiles and maybe we should
determine<00:00:40.680> if<00:00:40.950> as<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.250> board<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:41.940> it's

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
determine if as a board if it's

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
determine if as a board if it's
something<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.570> should<00:00:42.600> be<00:00:42.840> looking<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.680> don't

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
something we should be looking I don't

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.889 
something we should be looking I don't
think<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.700> should<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:45.059> deciding<00:00:45.690> what

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
think that we should be deciding what

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.900

don't think should we not report that
though<00:03:37.830> because<00:03:38.070> it's<00:03:38.430> not<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.880> way<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.269> we
