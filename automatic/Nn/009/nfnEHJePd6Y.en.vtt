00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.160
 very good to everyone how are you today in 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.279
 Miami and here we are to do this 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.730
 pokemon raffle of the gts as we did in 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.460
 the previous draw that if you remember 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.039
 sorte a worthy and this time 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.619
 He has touched it here, sister, as you see 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:33.340
 and good, here I am going to show you the carbon 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.170
 that I am going to teach you what you have 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.879
 of special this coal to good as 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.970
 You see this carbon because it has the 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.610
 firm nature that will empower us 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.700
 the physical attack also has skill 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.700
 hidden has two egg movements that 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.860
 would be double-edged and same destiny some 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.329
 of them will only have double edge 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.570
 that would be the first ones because 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.170
 then the following came out 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.350
 they have the same destiny only 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.950
 some of them are normal as you see 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.180
 And here because as I see it 4 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.900
 evans there are some of 4 i vents 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.630
 I have also 35 other vents as you see 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.310
 even if they are of 5 i vents there are some that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.380
 they have no hidden ability but good 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.229
 they have in motion egg that would be the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.700
 same destination and they are also 5 and vince 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.290
 as you see and then then here only 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.330
 here are some four and five and 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.119
 less but good because I could not fit 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.060
 calls from in the boxes but there are two 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.420
 I think it's east-west one of these 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.229
 two I think they are from 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.420
 of 6 ivens and good as you can see I'm going to 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.080
 raffle all these boxes as you are 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.220
 seeing here that it would be 1 2 3 and monkey is 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.110
 in half they are 100 in total 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.039
 caravans that I'm going to draw during this 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.920
 late and good apart from all this then 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:04.430
 I'm also going to draw another carbon but 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.670
 which is very special and because as you are 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.970
 seeing here is a coal like this or with 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.700
 the hidden skill that would be boost 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.760
 I will also give you a fence 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.880
 enigma to any of you because as 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.130
 you already know in the raffles of gts are at 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.670
 chance so it can be any 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.430
 coal to any of you have will 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.190
 lucky and will take this coal like this nor 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.980
 with hidden ability and apart from this 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.230
 he also has this coal to 6 events that 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.360
 the truth for new editions of 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.020
 ruby sapphire the truth is that it will not go 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.660
 great as you can see it has 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.460
 It has no egg movement 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.460
 because it is in the opinion because Carvana 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.040
 They have given me a gift, but others 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.080
 Yes as you see that are mine are 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.140
 these that I'm going to draw and I'm going to 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.150
 raffle a total of 100 caravans as you see 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.550
 and well now you will say that you have to 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.980
 do so to be able to get all 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.100
 these cars go to all of them 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.350
 not so what you have to do is like 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.070
 we did on the other occasion but the other 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.870
 occasion we chose a led chin 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.350
 this time I wanted to choose 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:22.400
 a is crank book to the pokemon bug this 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.680
 of pokemon xy that goes on route 3 and in 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.020
 the forest is not art and there are many 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.030
 that you will not have problems and nobody is going 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.660
 to change then um 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.250
 one for a skater book nobody is going to 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.709
 exchange a go cart go to I think 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.250
 because it will be quite strange that you 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.380
 change and good also so what 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.760
 you can do to get it changed 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.459
 I think that nobody changes it but good 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.500
 just in case because with the law did not happen 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.319
 that some of you changed it 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.630
 you can even put a nickname to 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.090
 some name or something like that and usually not 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.630
 people do not like the nicknames to the 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.050
 pokemon sepe well gts as they put no 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.800
 nor like tea or something like that they put it in English 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.910
 who do not like the two nickname played 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.440
 well and good then it's good now what 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.109
 I will explain for all those 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.989
 that you do not do you have not done in any 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.299

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.330
 to teach for all those then what 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.810
