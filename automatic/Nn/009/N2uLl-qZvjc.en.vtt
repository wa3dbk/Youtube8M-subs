00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.319 
can see I'm flying an actual plane uh
and<00:01:45.890> GTA<00:01:46.890> 4<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.490> could<00:01:47.700> not<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.090> you

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and GTA 4 you could not do this you

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.480 
and GTA 4 you could not do this you
could<00:01:48.540> not<00:01:48.570> fly<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> plane<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.619> don't<00:01:50.250> know<00:01:50.369> why

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
could not fly a plane I don't know why

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.800 
could not fly a plane I don't know why
they<00:01:50.640> took<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.820> out<00:01:51.000> I'm<00:01:51.149> pretty<00:01:51.299> sure<00:01:51.540> because

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
they took it out I'm pretty sure because

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.899 
they took it out I'm pretty sure because
they<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:53.009> run<00:01:53.189> out<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> disk<00:01:53.579> space

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
they like it run out of disk space

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.130 
they like it run out of disk space
because<00:01:54.180> they're<00:01:54.299> putting<00:01:54.540> too<00:01:54.720> much<00:01:54.840> shit<00:01:55.049> in

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
because they're putting too much shit in

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.230 
because they're putting too much shit in
the<00:01:55.229> graphics<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.799> stuff<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.340> maybe<00:01:57.090> they

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the graphics and stuff but maybe they

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.730 
the graphics and stuff but maybe they
just<00:01:57.270> wanted<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.600> sell<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:57.930> DLC<00:01:58.170> I'm<00:01:58.590> not

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
I think Grand Theft Auto 4 was just

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.000 
I think Grand Theft Auto 4 was just
lacking<00:02:53.300> so<00:02:53.720> much<00:02:53.750> in<00:02:54.110> content<00:02:54.650> from<00:02:54.860> this

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010
