00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
jump you can get to higher in places a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.490 
jump you can get to higher in places a
lot<00:01:04.920> easier<00:01:05.780> um<00:01:06.780> which<00:01:06.990> brings<00:01:07.229> me<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.380> my

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
lot easier um which brings me to my

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.399 
lot easier um which brings me to my
second<00:01:07.890> thing<00:01:08.010> bait<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.520> uh<00:01:09.020> well<00:01:10.020> before<00:01:10.170> I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
second thing bait it's uh well before I

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.890 
second thing bait it's uh well before I
do<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.150> tell<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.390> how<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.720> it

do that I have to tell you how to do it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.800 
do that I have to tell you how to do it
of<00:01:13.740> course<00:01:14.010> keep<00:01:14.939> thinking<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.420> guys<00:01:15.600> know

of course keep thinking you guys know
everything<00:01:16.430> now<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> double<00:01:17.850> jump<00:01:17.970> basically

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
everything now to double jump basically

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.820 
everything now to double jump basically
you<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.630> hit<00:01:18.900> enter<00:01:19.049> while<00:01:19.380> you're<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.650> or

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you just hit enter while you're in or

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.910 
you just hit enter while you're in or
not<00:01:19.920> enter<00:01:20.990> sorry<00:01:21.990> I've<00:01:22.200> changed<00:01:22.590> controls

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
not enter sorry I've changed controls

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.219 
not enter sorry I've changed controls
you<00:01:23.130> hit<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.520> hit<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.060> spacebar<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:24.990> whatever

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
you hit you hit the spacebar or whatever

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.640 
you hit you hit the spacebar or whatever
the<00:01:25.350> default<00:01:25.650> jump<00:01:26.009> button<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.500> that<00:01:28.500> is

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the default jump button is and that is

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.590 
the default jump button is and that is
how<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.829> double<00:01:29.280> jump<00:01:29.490> should<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.360> fairly

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
how you double jump should it's fairly

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.590 
how you double jump should it's fairly
fairly<00:01:31.590> simple<00:01:31.979> now<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.150> leads<00:01:33.270> me<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> my

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
fairly simple now that leads me to my

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.590 
fairly simple now that leads me to my
second<00:01:34.049> thing<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.439> basically<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.150> glide

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
second thing is basically you can glide

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.530 
second thing is basically you can glide
now<00:01:37.170> how<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.770> do<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.180> simply

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
now how you do this is you just simply

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.880 
now how you do this is you just simply
hold<00:01:39.659> down<00:01:39.869> your<00:01:39.900> sprint<00:01:40.350> key<00:01:40.530> while<00:01:40.770> you're

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
hold down your sprint key while you're

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.210 
hold down your sprint key while you're
falling<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.960> it<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.560> kind<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.799> slows<00:01:44.009> your

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
falling and it just kind of slows your

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.510 
falling and it just kind of slows your
descent<00:01:44.610> maybe<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.570> lets<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.040> once<00:01:47.040> again<00:01:47.189> get

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
descent maybe it lets you once again get

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.249 
descent maybe it lets you once again get
to<00:01:47.990> different<00:01:48.990> places<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:51.049> moving<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.140> from

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
to different places so moving on from

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.350 
to different places so moving on from
that<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.770> mentioned<00:01:53.549> at<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.700> beginning<00:01:53.820> how<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that I mentioned at the beginning how it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.929 
that I mentioned at the beginning how it
added<00:01:54.750> something<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.530> noclip<00:01:56.070> more<00:01:56.850> or

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
added something to the noclip more or

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.520 
added something to the noclip more or
less<00:01:57.149> what<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.630> does<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.140> kind<00:01:58.469> of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
less what it does is it just kind of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
less what it does is it just kind of
changes<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.920> style<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.520> how<00:01:59.700> you're<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.180> how

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
changes the style of how you're of how

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.310 
changes the style of how you're of how
you<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.780> clip<00:02:02.450> okay<00:02:03.450> my<00:02:03.719> head<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you know clip okay my head is in the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.950 
you know clip okay my head is in the
ground<00:02:04.909> along<00:02:05.909> with<00:02:06.060> everything<00:02:06.420> else<00:02:06.570> okay

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
ground along with everything else okay

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.070 
ground along with everything else okay
so<00:02:07.890> what<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.879> does<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.599> just<00:02:09.810> normal

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
so what it does is this is just normal

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.229 
so what it does is this is just normal
I'm<00:02:10.349> not<00:02:10.500> sprinting<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.760> what<00:02:12.120> I'm

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
I'm not sprinting this is what I'm

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.550 
I'm not sprinting this is what I'm
sprinting

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
sprinting

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.100 
sprinting
and<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.180> makes<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.480> look<00:02:15.600> like<00:02:15.930> you're

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and so it just makes it look like you're

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.760 
and so it just makes it look like you're
flying<00:02:16.350> instead<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.240> walking<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.900> midair<00:02:19.350> so

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
flying instead of walking in midair so

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.809 
flying instead of walking in midair so
it<00:02:20.760> adds<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.030> little<00:02:21.240> bit<00:02:21.390> more<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:23.250> feel

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
it adds a little bit more of the feel

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.490 
it adds a little bit more of the feel
that<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.240> know<00:02:24.420> you're<00:02:24.450> using<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.260> mod<00:02:25.470> I

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
that you know you're using this mod I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.710 
that you know you're using this mod I
guess<00:02:25.830> would<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.130> good<00:02:26.250> way<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.459> say<00:02:26.670> it

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
guess would be a good way to say it

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.610 
guess would be a good way to say it
another<00:02:27.720> thing<00:02:27.900> I'd<00:02:28.050> like<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.290> show<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.470> guys
