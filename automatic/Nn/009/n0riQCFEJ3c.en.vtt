00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.360
 techno house we are the 7th of july 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.980
 2013 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.810
 and that's episode 21 what happened 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.040
 in the world of technology the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.300
 answer every week in techno 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.190
 house and today we're going to talk 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.780
 socks made from carbonized coffee 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.370
 a flashlight powered by the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.320
 human warmth of sound commercials and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.910
 an interesting system of xbox one 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.609
 the episode 21 technique 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.930
 it's gone the online game is experiencing a 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.699
 huge success for some time 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.580
 with the call of duty battlefield and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.010
 other mmorpg for organ example the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.160
 newspaper but word pig looking for the name 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.809
 barbarian which designates the role plays in 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.460
 line in which we take part with others 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.739
 virtual companions 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.969
 it's called like that I'm sorry and 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.739
 the problem of these games is usually 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.850
 the difficult community for 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.200
 developers to remedy this 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.000
 situation that anyone who's played 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.410
 an online game knows you know when 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.670
 you just killed the little kevin of 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.079
 eight years and that he insult you with 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.820
 words that you do not even know 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.570
 it's a recurring problem as well 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.860
 for the players as for the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.120
 developers since it tends to 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.949
 deteriorate the pleasure of the game 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.750
 microsoft thought about it for its new 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.649
 console the xbox good and to maybe 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.359
 found the solution 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.739
 in the final kinect is going to have a real 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.120
 useful since he will be watching you 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.589
 when you play it so it will 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.180
 detect if you insult or if at 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.619
 contrary you are courteous if this 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.299
 system is set up all my right 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.799
 a reputation score that will drop if 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.479
 you insult or if you are 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.830
 reported by the players and you will be 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.420
 then doomed to play with players 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.920
 as friendly as you I you 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.540
 lets imagine the festival of insult 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.130
 but rest assured if you have a friend 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.930
 xbox live who spends his time insulting 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.610
 his world you will still be able to play 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.840
 with him more certain events 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.700
 community will allow your friend 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.990
 to forgive his sins hope that this 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.310
 system if it is set up 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.659
 succeed in making the good 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.659
 mood and courtesy on the live 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.729
 advertising you have the impression 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.360
 that she is everywhere tell you that this 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.920
 is only the beginning 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.420
 Ad does not change in itself is 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.740
 rather the way we see it that 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.630
 change at least that's what this cargo 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.040
 seems to have succeeded the system is based 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.869
 actually on creating a contact 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.310
 sound with an individual who would be the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.600
 only to hear for example you are 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.579
 in the train you put your head on the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.560
 glass bÃ®mes no respite an advertisement 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.909
 sound happens more precisely this 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.439
 works with an emitting device 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.969
 who sends waves that through 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.290
 vibrations on the window perfectly 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.180
 adjusted to create a conduction 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.590
 cranial bone allows the human to 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.119
 detect sounds and lyrics 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.190
 just hope the system does not 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.619
 does not land anywhere in our cities 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.450
 it's summer you go camping you 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.010
 have all been waiting for the sudoku the paper 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.600
 toilet the flashlight but you have 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.920
 forgot to change the batteries and yes this 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.870
 scenario often happens but thanks 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.070
 at alma kosinski you will not need 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.660
 batteries or turn a crank 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.430
 for hours in order to feed the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.480
 lamp this girl of 15 years put 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.100
 to the point a prototype of lamps 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.660
 powered by the simple heat of 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.250
 the anne man had the idea to play on 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.510
 the temperature differences between the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.460
 heat produced by the palm of the hand 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.840
 of an individual and makes them well collected 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.560
 by a heat sink for 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.330
 feed his tongue 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.950
 having an aluminum model and 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.840
 another pvc and it is necessary 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.310
 to produce 5 degrees of difference between 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.650
 both materials to generate up 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.090
 5 4 megawatts is about the energy 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.830
 necessary for a led lamp of a 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.360
 range of 2 m so drop the 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.800
 batteries for your hand more only 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.300
 $ 26 worth of equipment 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.250
 necessary for the manufacture of a lamp 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.540
 torch of this type 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.100
 human warmth that's it you 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.150
 light up your aunt aunts 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.680
 plush looks but does not equal 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.880
 sweating and there you tell yourself that 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.740
 you should not have put yourself in the 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.210
 uncle gerard's tent do not worry 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.890
 not I have the solution at least the 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.550
 engineers think of having finished them 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.890
 traditional white socks 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.780
 place to class these socks are 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.970
 designed from polyester cotton and 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.200
 two charred coffees and yes the coffee 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.090
 charred allows filtering and 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.050
 to absorb sweat and odors but 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.459
 it's not all these socks 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.140
 benefit from technologies such as 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.580
 mapping the pressure inflicted on 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.870
 your ends and imagery 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.640
 thermal in order to have a comfort 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.170
 optimal class is a project 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.820
 kickstarter so if you do not want 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.410
 sleep with a pin on the but does 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.850
 a donation to the class and offer them 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.760
 expectations gerard years your nostrils you 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.900
 thank you every week I will you 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.730
 ask a question related to 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.290
 the news you answer it and I 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.459
 harvest your opinion the question of the 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.959
 previous technique you been pretty 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.370
 complicated many of you do not have 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.720
 to answer it I forgive you for 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.400
 this time but caught up on lund this 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.560
 week I remind him what do you think 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.970
 cyborg plants to learn more 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.320
 on this project I invite you to click 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.970
 on the thumbnail that appears on the screen 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.280
 she will pause the video and you 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.840
 will redirect to techno number 1 47% 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.060
 of you find the plant cyborg 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.750
 useless or even dangerous 32% finds that 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.790
 It's a good idea 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.350
 and finally 21% are a little between 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.000
 two do not really know what to think 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.590
 personally I am quite mixed 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.489
 on the one hand I think it's a good 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.840
 ecological idea 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.010
 on the other hand I do not see myself 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.730
 to walk with many plants with legs 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.989
 who run everywhere 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.580
 I am waiting to know a little more about 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.019
 these futuristic plants from elsewhere in 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.459
 futuristic speaking a big part 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.150
 of you thought you were in a film of 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.160
 james cameron 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.020
 the cyborgs who lose their heads and who 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.070
 ravage the city and somewhere you 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.579
 do not be wrong it's true we're not 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.959
 never 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.430
 reid bug with this intelligence 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.229
 artificial more and more developed 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.060
 and as microbes say so well 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.310
 I'm not for cyborgs because 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.900
 of terminator thank you all for your opinion 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.340
 decidedly this question about 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.870
 cyborgs you to grill neurons 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.219
 that's why this week we're going 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.569
 do a little bit more soft with a 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.889
 simpler question with the 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.120
 information available 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.610
 lean instead for the playstation 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.870
 4 or the good xbox to answer this 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.280
 question it's very simple it you 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.409
 just post your answer in the 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.120
 comments from this video
