because it's such a unique color and it
so<00:05:50.890> is<00:05:51.890> just<00:05:52.820> packed<00:05:53.120> with<00:05:53.330> pigments<00:05:54.050> I<00:05:54.170> mean

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320

it's crazy and it's right here and this

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.620 
it's crazy and it's right here and this
swatch<00:05:58.190> is<00:05:58.400> actually<00:05:58.850> a<00:05:58.880> little<00:05:59.060> bit<00:05:59.330> sheared

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
swatch is actually a little bit sheared

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.420 
swatch is actually a little bit sheared
out<00:05:59.840> now<00:06:00.110> like<00:06:00.500> when<00:06:00.710> I<00:06:00.740> had<00:06:01.040> it<00:06:01.160> on<00:06:01.220> my<00:06:01.370> finger

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
out now like when I had it on my finger

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.600

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
think that you can make this wearable

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.600 
think that you can make this wearable
and<00:06:07.540> I'm<00:06:08.830> definitely<00:06:09.830> going<00:06:10.130> to<00:06:10.220> do<00:06:10.370> some

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
and I'm definitely going to do some

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.310 
and I'm definitely going to do some
licks<00:06:10.790> with<00:06:10.940> that<00:06:11.150> probably<00:06:11.660> like<00:06:12.020> towards

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
licks with that probably like towards

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.080 
licks with that probably like towards
the<00:06:12.380> spring<00:06:12.740> and<00:06:12.920> summer<00:06:13.190> so<00:06:13.820> I<00:06:13.850> feel<00:06:14.000> like

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
the spring and summer so I feel like

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.120 
the spring and summer so I feel like
it'd<00:06:14.240> be<00:06:14.360> really<00:06:14.630> pretty<00:06:14.960> summer<00:06:15.320> color<00:06:15.650> so

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
it'd be really pretty summer color so

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.460 
it'd be really pretty summer color so
those<00:06:16.880> are<00:06:16.910> the<00:06:17.120> shades<00:06:17.450> i<00:06:17.630> have<00:06:17.900> and<00:06:18.380> all

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
those are the shades i have and all

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.340 
those are the shades i have and all
switched<00:06:18.860> on<00:06:19.070> my<00:06:19.160> hand<00:06:19.490> here<00:06:19.940> and<00:06:20.150> i<00:06:21.050> can

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
switched on my hand here and i can

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.730 
switched on my hand here and i can
honestly<00:06:21.620> say<00:06:22.400> i<00:06:22.810> love<00:06:23.810> every<00:06:24.230> single<00:06:24.410> killer

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
honestly say i love every single killer

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.520 
honestly say i love every single killer
and<00:06:25.100> i<00:06:25.190> think<00:06:25.490> that<00:06:25.700> they<00:06:25.850> really<00:06:26.230> hit<00:06:27.230> it<00:06:27.260> out

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
and i think that they really hit it out

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.320 
and i think that they really hit it out
of<00:06:27.590> the<00:06:27.770> ballpark<00:06:28.040> with<00:06:28.670> the<00:06:28.790> quality<00:06:29.300> of

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
of the ballpark with the quality of

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.920 
of the ballpark with the quality of
these

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
these

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.590 
these
products<00:06:30.229> and<00:06:30.590> I<00:06:31.280> think<00:06:31.610> it<00:06:31.729> is<00:06:31.880> because<00:06:32.090> she's

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
products and I think it is because she's

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.310 
products and I think it is because she's
a<00:06:32.630> makeup<00:06:32.900> artist<00:06:33.169> and<00:06:33.680> a<00:06:33.889> YouTube<00:06:34.370> guru<00:06:35.180> and<00:06:35.449> I

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
a makeup artist and a YouTube guru and I

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.020 
a makeup artist and a YouTube guru and I
just<00:06:36.800> think<00:06:37.009> it<00:06:37.130> was<00:06:37.190> really<00:06:37.400> important<00:06:38.000> to

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
just think it was really important to

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.379 
just think it was really important to
her<00:06:38.150> to<00:06:38.470> put<00:06:39.470> out<00:06:39.650> quality<00:06:40.280> products<00:06:41.030> at<00:06:41.240> an

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
her to put out quality products at an

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.210 
her to put out quality products at an
affordable<00:06:41.630> price<00:06:41.900> and<00:06:42.440> I<00:06:42.590> think<00:06:42.650> that<00:06:42.949> she

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
affordable price and I think that she

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.590 
affordable price and I think that she
really<00:06:43.250> nailed<00:06:43.669> it<00:06:43.940> when<00:06:44.300> if<00:06:44.449> you're

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
really nailed it when if you're

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.300 
really nailed it when if you're
wondering<00:06:44.840> about<00:06:45.199> ordering<00:06:45.770> them<00:06:46.039> off<00:06:46.280> of
