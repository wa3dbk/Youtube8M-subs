00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.900 
of the engineers at valve was working on
the<00:00:03.629> controller<00:00:04.110> project<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:05.520> wanted<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.790> put

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
the controller project we wanted to put

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.509 
the controller project we wanted to put
together<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.210> gameplay<00:00:06.600> video<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:07.350> shows<00:00:07.710> how

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
together a gameplay video that shows how

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.799 
together a gameplay video that shows how
the<00:00:08.550> controllers<00:00:09.030> used<00:00:09.240> in<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.450> number<00:00:09.660> of

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
the controllers used in a number of

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.959 
the controllers used in a number of
different<00:00:10.110> types<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.769> games<00:00:11.040> so<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.639> have<00:00:11.759> some

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
different types of games so we have some

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.910 
different types of games so we have some
first-person<00:00:12.450> shooters<00:00:12.780> some<00:00:13.290> strategy

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
type games we're gonna try and put

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.359 
type games we're gonna try and put
together<00:00:18.350> these<00:00:19.350> updates<00:00:19.770> pretty<00:00:19.980> frequently

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369

of games you'd like to see go ahead and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.200 
of games you'd like to see go ahead and
let<00:00:26.849> us<00:00:26.939> know<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.210> comments<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.119> first

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
let us know in the comments so the first

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.490 
let us know in the comments so the first
game<00:00:30.390> we're<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> show<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.140> portal

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
game we're going to show you is portal

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.130 
game we're going to show you is portal
two<00:00:31.700> one<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> most<00:00:33.270> important<00:00:33.690> features

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
two one of the most important features

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.450 
two one of the most important features
of<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> controller<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> two<00:00:35.250> track

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
of the controller is that the two track

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
of the controller is that the two track
pads<00:00:35.700> are<00:00:35.910> fully<00:00:36.090> configurable<00:00:36.719> what<00:00:37.500> we're

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
pads are fully configurable what we're

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.080 
pads are fully configurable what we're
showing<00:00:37.829> here<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.100> what<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.399> call<00:00:38.550> legacy<00:00:38.940> mode

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
showing here is what we call legacy mode

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.970 
showing here is what we call legacy mode
which<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.540> playing<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.050> game<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.440> hasn't<00:00:40.950> been

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
which is playing a game that hasn't been

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.290 
which is playing a game that hasn't been
modified<00:00:41.430> at<00:00:41.610> all<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.910> support<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
modified at all to support the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.490 
modified at all to support the
controller<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.320> standard

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
controller so this is just standard

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.369 
controller so this is just standard
keyboard<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.309> mouse<00:00:44.430> style<00:00:44.850> portal<00:00:45.539> 2<00:00:45.690> but

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
keyboard and mouse style portal 2 but

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.959 
keyboard and mouse style portal 2 but
the<00:00:46.469> controller<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.010> acting<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.700> mouse

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the controller is acting like a mouse

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.110 
the controller is acting like a mouse
and<00:00:48.180> keyboard<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.829> mapped<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.160> output

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and keyboard and is mapped to output

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.630 
and keyboard and is mapped to output
keyboard<00:00:51.809> events<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.890> portal<00:00:53.309> expects

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
keyboard events that portal expects

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.369 
keyboard events that portal expects
since<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> two<00:00:54.719> track<00:00:54.930> pads<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.320> be

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
since the two track pads can be

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.220 
since the two track pads can be
configured<00:00:55.739> independently<00:00:56.629> we<00:00:57.629> use<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
configured independently we use the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.920 
configured independently we use the

a<00:03:39.470> predominantly<00:03:40.040> mouse-driven<00:03:40.310> game<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:41.180> so

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
a predominantly mouse-driven game and so

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.720 
a predominantly mouse-driven game and so
we<00:03:41.660> can<00:03:41.840> use<00:03:41.989> both<00:03:42.260> track<00:03:42.590> pads<00:03:42.830> to<00:03:43.190> control

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
we can use both track pads to control

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.500 
we can use both track pads to control
the<00:03:43.820> mouse<00:03:43.940> alternately<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:46.160> two<00:03:46.910> mouse

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
the mouse alternately the two mouse

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.030 
the mouse alternately the two mouse
movements<00:03:47.930> get<00:03:48.050> blended<00:03:48.260> together<00:03:48.530> so<00:03:48.980> I<00:03:49.010> can

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
movements get blended together so I can

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.410 
movements get blended together so I can
move<00:03:49.310> with<00:03:49.489> my<00:03:49.610> left<00:03:49.850> thumb<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.239> then<00:03:50.330> my

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
move with my left thumb and then my

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.180 
move with my left thumb and then my
right<00:03:50.600> thumb<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.620> allows<00:03:51.800> you<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:52.040> do<00:03:52.160> a

right thumb and it allows you to do a

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.940 
right thumb and it allows you to do a
really<00:03:52.459> quick<00:03:52.520> walk<00:03:53.060> across<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.540> screen<00:03:53.950> it's

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
really quick walk across the screen it's

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.979 
really quick walk across the screen it's
a<00:03:55.100> very<00:03:55.489> comfortable<00:03:55.880> way<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.090> control<00:03:56.720> games

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
a very comfortable way to control games
