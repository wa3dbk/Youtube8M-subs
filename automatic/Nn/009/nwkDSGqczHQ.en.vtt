bonhomie bought land if they are chunk

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.939 
bonhomie bought land if they are chunk
if<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.449> recall<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.379> you're<00:01:04.559> balling

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
if they have to recall so you're balling

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.350 
if they have to recall so you're balling
can<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:05.339> an<00:01:05.430> advantage<00:01:05.700> from<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.150> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
can get an advantage from that and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.940 
can get an advantage from that and
there's<00:01:06.840> actually<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> lot<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.409> pros<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.799> this

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
there's actually a lot of pros to this

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.219 
there's actually a lot of pros to this
as<00:01:08.159> there's<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.090> super<00:01:09.570> advantage<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.170> your

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
as there's a super advantage for your

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.929 
as there's a super advantage for your
team<00:01:10.290> when<00:01:10.619> they<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.340> there's<00:01:11.700> not

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
team when they do this and there's not

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.210 
team when they do this and there's not
really<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.240> lot<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.570> concepts<00:01:13.020> since<00:01:13.860> basically

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
really a lot of concepts since basically

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950 
really a lot of concepts since basically
if<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> enemy<00:01:14.729> doesn't<00:01:14.880> show<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.180> there<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
if the enemy doesn't show up there you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.359 
if the enemy doesn't show up there you
just<00:01:16.170> take<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.439> buff<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:16.920> d'alene<00:01:17.100> just

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
just take the buff and your d'alene just

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.550 
just take the buff and your d'alene just
go<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.729> lanes<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.900> maybe<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> only

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
go to the lanes like maybe the only

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.200 
go to the lanes like maybe the only
disadvantage<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.369> they<00:01:20.610> come<00:01:20.820> late<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
disadvantage is that they come late the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.359 
disadvantage is that they come late the
lane<00:01:21.390> by<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.780> five<00:01:22.080> seconds<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> reward

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
lane by like five seconds but the reward

point of that if you ever get laid
invaded<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.490> should<00:01:32.670> react<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.150> that

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
invaded on you should react to go that

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.390

enemies<00:01:33.630> other<00:01:33.810> buff<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.290> basically<00:01:35.220> when

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
enemies other buff as basically when

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.920 
enemies other buff as basically when
you're<00:01:35.490> doing<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> blue<00:01:35.850> buff<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.689> juggle

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you're doing the blue buff the juggle

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.359 
you're doing the blue buff the juggle
who<00:01:37.049> stole<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:37.290> buff<00:01:37.500> cannot<00:01:37.860> get<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.100> other

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
who stole your buff cannot get to other

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.160 
who stole your buff cannot get to other
both<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.729> time<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.119> he<00:01:39.390> was<00:01:39.600> doing<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> first

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
both in time as he was doing the first

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.719 
both in time as he was doing the first
puff<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.979> I'm<00:01:41.070> pretty<00:01:41.220> sure<00:01:41.340> that's<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
puff so I'm pretty sure that's the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.069 
puff so I'm pretty sure that's the
counter<00:01:42.030> play<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.450> cheese<00:01:42.780> strap

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
counter play to that cheese strap

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.450 
counter play to that cheese strap
alright<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
alright so this is going to be the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.399 
alright so this is going to be the
purple<00:01:44.759> sign<00:01:44.939> late<00:01:45.149> invade<00:01:45.450> version<00:01:45.869> as<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
purple sign late invade version as you

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.810 
purple sign late invade version as you
can<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.680> we're<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:46.920> through<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> top<00:01:47.520> side

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
can see we're going through the top side

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.690 
can see we're going through the top side
and<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.780> purple<00:01:49.470> side<00:01:49.619> that's<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.829> bit<00:01:50.070> harder

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and on purple side that's a bit harder

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.460 
and on purple side that's a bit harder
to<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.210> sometimes<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.049> mid<00:01:52.229> does

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
to do because sometimes the mid does

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.109 
to do because sometimes the mid does
scout<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.070> ramp<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.460> they<00:01:54.030> have

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
scout out this ramp and they have

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.550 
scout out this ramp and they have
nothing<00:01:54.240> better<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.170> keep<00:01:55.320> an<00:01:55.470> eye

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
nothing better to do but to keep an eye

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.679 
nothing better to do but to keep an eye
out<00:01:55.680> since<00:01:56.310> they<00:01:56.430> don't<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.850> leash<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.570> of

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
out since they don't have to leash so of

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.510 
out since they don't have to leash so of
course<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.020> side<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.469> trickier<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.399> of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
course this side is trickier but of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.550 
course this side is trickier but of
course<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.939> still<00:02:00.149> doable<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.290> reason

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
course it is still doable and the reason

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.320 
course it is still doable and the reason
you<00:02:01.649> go<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:02.040> top<00:02:02.310> side<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.729> because

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
you go this top side is because

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.690 
you go this top side is because
has<00:02:03.420> more<00:02:03.810> fog<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.320> war<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.710> if<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.310> enemy<00:02:05.520> does

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
has more fog of war as if the enemy does

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.670 
has more fog of war as if the enemy does
sit<00:02:05.910> in<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.060> bush<00:02:06.210> by<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.510> red<00:02:06.780> buff<00:02:06.990> they<00:02:07.530> can

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
sit in the bush by the red buff they can

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.020 
sit in the bush by the red buff they can
particularly<00:02:08.009> see<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.399> coming<00:02:08.759> from<00:02:08.880> that

another camp so as you can see it's a
low<00:02:19.740> risk<00:02:19.980> high<00:02:20.130> reward<00:02:20.640> strategy<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.480> is

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
low risk high reward strategy that is

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.880 
low risk high reward strategy that is
