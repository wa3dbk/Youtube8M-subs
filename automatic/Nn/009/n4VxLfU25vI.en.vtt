00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:27.919
 your profile tuber are all very 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.289
 welcome to anyone else so the 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.170
 car rj bringing you here one 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.290
 little office that that little game 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.629
 and fps being released on xbox live 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.059
 for everyone there who is a gold subscriber 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.610
 and has access to beta 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.949
 In this game I downloaded yesterday 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.559
 staff actually completed one year 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.629
 written here from the channel and quickly fla 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.489
 because to download and so 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.420
 played well played and had fun 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.640
 no pc 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.640
 only as I have this the difficulty 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.809
 is dealing with the mouse and keyboard 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.369
 I really just let the game go 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.040
 I did not go deep into it 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:06.380
 but I was already cheering for some time, huh? 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.760
 for him he is acting for xbox 360 and 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.500
 when we heard that he was 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.170
 would come our was very happy 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.420
 and so I like the game, it's a lot of fun 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.159
 it is a theoretically simple game I think 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.619
 that it was never structural that it needs 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.869
 keep an eye on his issue if a 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.060
 flash player but he saw that lot of 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.039
 things to buy one of the things that 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.960
 They made the galley play stop 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.240
 Why is there that helmet that repels 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.280
 the first shot of the suit that 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.259
 repels the first shot shotgun study 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.149
 you buy ends up getting a boring game 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.130
 but all of a sudden the buddy 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.179
 CBC it there is virtually 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.729
 vulnerable 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.499
 It's really game he ends up losing the 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.689
 thanks but for this I think it's a game 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:46.310
 very interesting is that in xbox live 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.380
 especially by the time when he 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.890
 It's showing because we 're there. 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.329
 by a boom of goals has bad and expensive by 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.979
 At least in my case, I already have a little 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.479
 I can not get enough of anything. 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.030
 I adapt the tf well 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.829
 I think any party is welcome, the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.840
 only problem of his staff at least 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.729
 I could not stop so far and what 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.679
 was what motivated me to leave playing and 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.780
 very little game and maybe a six or 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.000
 seven matches were not many 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.160
 is really the connection issue when 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.870
 We start to play, we have there. 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.490
 three servers three locations 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.080
 you are connecting to 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.330
 if you want you can do it even 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.770
 to a soldier for each of these 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.440
 servers for you from within the 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.600
 playing but there are none of them in 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.720
 brazil acting in the united states europa 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.490
 and if I'm not mistaken, australia and asi asi 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.860
 that something like only 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.300
 Australia and a result exactly this 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.340
 What are you seeing now? 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.680
 leg look you is not there with 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.960
 included connections yesterday 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.060
 I downloaded it but I could not 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.560
 play because of this not every time 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.780
 that I tried to enter a room 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.160
 tried to enter the lobby he told me that 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.920
 My connection was with some kind of 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.450
 problem with these locking stays 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.030
 sounding like that little sign saying 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.130
 There is a problem with the connection and you 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.690
 can play i played a three or 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.940
 four matches today was inclusive 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.470
 even with a vine with a band called but 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.480
 later it became possible because it 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.670
 every hour giving this treatment by locking 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.459
 locking up I give up playing and 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.200
 created a room that this is there and happens 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.150
 same way that you are being told you are 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.890
 creating a room and for 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.770
 because you are creating a server that 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.060
 it's far to hell and so 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.340
 visibly he's got some kind of 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.590
 problem of these connections as well as a 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.940
 little more away so I guess 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.860
 that a really cool game I think it's worth 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.560
 worth investing in it but since it has 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.330
 a server at least here in the region 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.160
 Central America and South America 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.980
 because otherwise it gets very difficult 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.050
 they should give one say a 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.880
 polished and in this system at least for 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.800
 that we can connect to the 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.230
 United States servers and play 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.010
 but at least for now it 's fine 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.600
 difficult 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.280
 That's good folks, I hope you guys 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.650
 enjoyed'll see you next 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.650
 game play but only fox carrion
