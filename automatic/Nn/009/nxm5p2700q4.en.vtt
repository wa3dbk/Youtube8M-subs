the controller again as we mentioned it

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.810 
the controller again as we mentioned it

has three channels you can queue on each

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.300 
has three channels you can queue on each
channel<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.900> have<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.050> 3<00:04:46.320> band<00:04:46.530> EQ<00:04:46.950> it's<00:04:47.160> not

full<00:04:47.640> kill<00:04:47.940> full<00:04:48.330> kill<00:04:48.540> meaning<00:04:48.900> that<00:04:49.050> it

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
full kill full kill meaning that it

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.630 
full kill full kill meaning that it
actually<00:04:49.320> goes<00:04:49.620> completely<00:04:50.100> silent<00:04:50.550> when

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
actually goes completely silent when

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.040 
actually goes completely silent when
they're<00:04:50.760> all<00:04:50.850> turned<00:04:51.090> down<00:04:51.300> there<00:04:51.960> are

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
they're all turned down there are

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.260 
they're all turned down there are
negative<00:04:52.410> 28<00:04:52.860> DB<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:53.460> it's<00:04:53.610> very<00:04:53.910> close<00:04:54.240> to

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
negative 28 DB so it's very close to
