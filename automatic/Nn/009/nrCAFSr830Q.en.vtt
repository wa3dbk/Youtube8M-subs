00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
series two and the first series we

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.320 
series two and the first series we
talked<00:00:11.940> about<00:00:13.519> getting<00:00:14.519> rid<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.700> these<00:00:15.000> two

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
talked about getting rid of these two

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.830 
talked about getting rid of these two
rubber<00:00:15.809> feet<00:00:16.139> like<00:00:16.529> inside<00:00:17.010> here<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.060> then

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
rubber feet like inside here and then

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.230 
rubber feet like inside here and then
that<00:00:19.410> resulted<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:21.199> wider<00:00:22.199> sweep<00:00:22.560> range<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
that resulted in wider sweep range and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.570 
that resulted in wider sweep range and
easier<00:00:24.240> on/off<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> WHA<00:00:25.340> today<00:00:26.340> I've<00:00:26.550> got

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
easier on/off for the WHA today I've got

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.549 
easier on/off for the WHA today I've got
a<00:00:27.980> standard<00:00:28.980> crybaby<00:00:29.960> with<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.260> cool<00:00:31.650> led<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.340> it

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
a standard crybaby with a cool led on it

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.060 
a standard crybaby with a cool led on it
some<00:00:34.559> people<00:00:34.680> ask<00:00:34.950> me<00:00:35.190> about<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:37.559> trick<00:00:37.829> that

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
some people ask me about the trick that

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.600 
some people ask me about the trick that
you<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:39.290> adjust<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.620> potentiometer<00:00:40.770> inside

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
you can adjust the potentiometer inside

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.340 
you can adjust the potentiometer inside
of<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> puddle<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:44.120> make<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> pedal<00:00:45.570> maybe

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
of the puddle and make the pedal maybe

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.680 
of the puddle and make the pedal maybe
like<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:46.829> brighter<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.570> know

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
like you know brighter or you know

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.240 
like you know brighter or you know
dueler

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.400 

this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> kind<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> default<00:00:57.260> I'm<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
this is kind of like a default I'm not a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.819 
this is kind of like a default I'm not a
default<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.949> actually<00:00:59.190> always<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.120> walk<00:01:00.329> and

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
default I actually always the walk and

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.189 
default I actually always the walk and
using<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.059> trick<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.660> we're<00:01:03.780> gonna<00:01:03.870> go<00:01:04.049> over

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
using that trick so we're gonna go over

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.280 
using that trick so we're gonna go over
what<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.270> to<00:01:06.270> change<00:01:07.369> kind<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
what we can do to change kind of like a

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.469 
what we can do to change kind of like a
the<00:01:10.290> Q<00:01:10.619> value<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.210> walk<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:13.229> kind<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
the Q value of the walk it's kind of

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.749 
the Q value of the walk it's kind of
widely<00:01:15.479> known<00:01:15.900> at<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.380> point<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.400> some

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
widely known at this point but some

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.600 
widely known at this point but some
people<00:01:18.060> still<00:01:18.979> don't<00:01:19.979> know<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
people still don't know about it and

it's loose it's free to move kind of get
it<00:02:36.350> away<00:02:36.500> from<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.930> plastic<00:02:39.140> lever<00:02:39.560> inside

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
it away from the plastic lever inside

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.850 
it away from the plastic lever inside
here<00:02:40.750> let<00:02:41.750> secret<00:02:42.170> lever<00:02:44.200> your<00:02:45.200> plastic<00:02:45.650> lever

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
here let secret lever your plastic lever

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.740 
here let secret lever your plastic lever
here<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.170> then<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:50.240> turn<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.600> potentiometer

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
here and then to turn the potentiometer

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.520 
here and then to turn the potentiometer
you<00:02:52.060> need<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.120> get<00:02:53.300> this<00:02:53.510> lever<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.080> plastic

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
you need to get this lever the plastic

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.880 
you need to get this lever the plastic
bar<00:02:54.860> thing<00:02:55.190> away<00:02:55.670> from<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.209> potentiometer

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
bar thing away from the potentiometer

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.350 
bar thing away from the potentiometer
it's<00:02:57.890> kind<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.190> like<00:02:58.340> like<00:02:59.239> this<00:02:59.680> here<00:03:00.680> and

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
it's kind of like like this here and

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.490 
it's kind of like like this here and
then<00:03:02.360> if<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:02.810> turn<00:03:03.080> this<00:03:04.690> this<00:03:05.690> way<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.380> it

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
then if you turn this this way so it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.259 
then if you turn this this way so it
some<00:03:08.980> direction<00:03:09.980> is<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.280> counter<00:03:11.000> clockwise

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
some direction is that counter clockwise

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.210 
some direction is that counter clockwise
the<00:03:12.110> pedals<00:03:12.380> gonna<00:03:12.560> get<00:03:12.739> brighter

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
the pedals gonna get brighter

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.090 
the pedals gonna get brighter
so<00:03:13.550> like<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.880> top<00:03:14.060> end<00:03:14.300> will<00:03:14.590> come<00:03:15.590> alive<00:03:15.860> as

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
so like the top end will come alive as

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:24.100 
so like the top end will come alive as
you<00:03:19.239> as<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.540> apply<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.840> pedal<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:23.110> the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
you as you apply the pedal and the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.720 
you as you apply the pedal and the
reverse<00:03:24.380> would<00:03:24.590> be<00:03:24.739> reversed<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:25.310> know<00:03:25.430> like

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
reverse would be reversed you know like

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.039 
reverse would be reversed you know like
you<00:03:25.910> get<00:03:26.090> dollar<00:03:27.220> dollar<00:03:28.220> range<00:03:28.489> overall<00:03:29.299> so

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
you get dollar dollar range overall so

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.780 
you get dollar dollar range overall so
you<00:03:30.140> can<00:03:30.320> kind<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.620> fine-tune<00:03:30.860> it<00:03:31.220> as<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.610> go

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
you can kind of fine-tune it as you go

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:41.089

I'm<00:03:32.120> gonna<00:03:34.360> storm<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.450> court<00:03:35.769> back<00:03:36.769> or<00:03:37.070> even

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.680 

here<00:03:44.310> it's<00:03:45.310> like<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.519> maximum<00:03:46.120> view<00:03:46.330> point<00:03:46.540> or

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
here it's like a maximum view point or

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:56.720 
here it's like a maximum view point or
maximum<00:03:47.620> top-end

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.030 

if<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:57.849> think<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.840> is<00:03:59.049> not<00:03:59.230> enough<00:03:59.290> you

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
simply turn this thing clockwise so

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:18.180 
simply turn this thing clockwise so
it'll<00:04:07.480> get<00:04:07.599> brighter<00:04:16.769> kind<00:04:17.769> of<00:04:17.829> deceiving

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
it'll get brighter kind of deceiving

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.759 
it'll get brighter kind of deceiving
because<00:04:18.489> I'm<00:04:19.030> not<00:04:19.239> properly<00:04:19.600> playing<00:04:20.049> but

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
you simply just turn this potentiometer

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.000
