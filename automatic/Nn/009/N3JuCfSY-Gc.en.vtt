all<00:00:01.110> right<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:01.650> kind<00:00:01.890> of<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:02.070> how-to<00:00:02.280> or<00:00:02.760> at

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
all right this is kind of a how-to or at

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.539 
all right this is kind of a how-to or at
least<00:00:02.970> how<00:00:03.149> I'm<00:00:03.449> going<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:04.049> modify<00:00:04.380> in<00:00:04.799> a

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
least how I'm going to modify in a

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.589 
least how I'm going to modify in a
twenty<00:00:06.060> series<00:00:06.540> peerless<00:00:07.189> transmission

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
twenty series peerless transmission

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.299 
twenty series peerless transmission
which<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:09.780> originally<00:00:10.139> have<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.440> one<00:00:10.679> inch<00:00:10.860> axle

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
which we originally have a one inch axle

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.060 
which we originally have a one inch axle
out<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.519> each<00:00:11.639> side<00:00:12.259> anyways<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.530> got<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.889> case

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
out of each side anyways I got the case

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.980 
out of each side anyways I got the case
apart<00:00:14.429> got<00:00:14.969> all<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.240> grease<00:00:15.420> kind<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.780> cleaned

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
apart got all the grease kind of cleaned

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.099 
apart got all the grease kind of cleaned
out<00:00:16.460> this<00:00:17.460> model<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.210> don't<00:00:18.480> remember<00:00:18.930> which

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
out this model I don't remember which

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.370 
out this model I don't remember which
one<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.039> five-speed<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:22.170> plan

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
one it is but it's a five-speed the plan

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.640 
one it is but it's a five-speed the plan
is<00:00:22.619> number<00:00:22.859> one<00:00:23.070> biggest<00:00:23.460> thing<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.289> this<00:00:25.289> gear

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
is number one biggest thing is this gear

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.429 
is number one biggest thing is this gear
here<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.699> gear<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:28.260> been

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
here and this gear here have been

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.890 
here and this gear here have been
swapped<00:00:28.710> out<00:00:29.070> those<00:00:30.000> are<00:00:30.240> eye<00:00:30.390> gears<00:00:30.750> from

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
swapped out those are eye gears from

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.170 
swapped out those are eye gears from
romps<00:00:31.320> reworks<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.579> gears<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
romps reworks and it gears up the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.139 
romps reworks and it gears up the
differential<00:00:33.660> ratio<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> around<00:00:34.850> three<00:00:35.850> point

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
differential ratio to around three point

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.310 
differential ratio to around three point
four<00:00:36.450> four<00:00:36.719> as<00:00:36.989> opposed<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.710> eight<00:00:38.059> to<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.320> so

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
four four as opposed to eight to one so

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.750 
four four as opposed to eight to one so
it's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> lot<00:00:40.710> faster<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.399> don't<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
it's a lot faster you don't have to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.490 
it's a lot faster you don't have to
speed<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.210> transmission<00:00:42.719> nearly<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.260> much

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
speed up the transmission nearly as much

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.310 
speed up the transmission nearly as much
I<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:44.760> run<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.059> transmission<00:00:45.690> at<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.140> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
I can run this transmission at a one to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.200 
I can run this transmission at a one to
one<00:00:46.350> ratio

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
one ratio

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.580 
one ratio
probably<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> six<00:00:48.510> inch<00:00:48.719> pulley<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> engine

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
probably a six inch pulley on the engine

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.779 
probably a six inch pulley on the engine
and<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.800> six<00:00:50.039> inch<00:00:50.250> pulley<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.670> the

40<00:00:54.300> 41<00:00:54.719> miles<00:00:55.079> an<00:00:55.260> hour<00:00:56.239> but<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> gears<00:00:57.899> are

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
40 41 miles an hour but the gears are

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.420 
40 41 miles an hour but the gears are
the<00:00:58.170> biggest<00:00:58.320> reason<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.039> but<00:00:59.250> they're

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the biggest reason for that but they're

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.990 
the biggest reason for that but they're
not<00:00:59.550> cheap

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
not cheap

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.889 
not cheap
there<00:01:00.149> are<00:01:00.210> about<00:01:00.410> $180<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.649> set<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.980> gears

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
there are about $180 for a set of gears

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.440 
there are about $180 for a set of gears
moving<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.189> originally<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.250> would<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.580> two

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
moving on originally you would have two

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.750 
moving on originally you would have two
axles<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.320> each<00:01:07.439> side<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
axles one on each side and a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.460 
axles one on each side and a
differential<00:01:09.299> inside<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.780> here<00:01:10.020> well<00:01:10.290> I've

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
differential inside of here well I've

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.230 
differential inside of here well I've
done<00:01:10.680> away<00:01:10.799> with<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.159> differential<00:01:11.700> gears<00:01:11.939> in

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
done away with the differential gears in

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.370 
done away with the differential gears in
two<00:01:12.600> axles<00:01:13.939> instead<00:01:14.939> I'll<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.990> putting<00:01:16.200> this

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
two axles instead I'll be putting this

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.249 
two axles instead I'll be putting this
solid<00:01:16.830> go-kart<00:01:17.340> axle<00:01:18.049> completely<00:01:19.049> through

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
solid go-kart axle completely through

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.440 
solid go-kart axle completely through
the<00:01:19.380> transmission<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:20.369> order<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.210> I

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the transmission in order to do that I

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.670 
the transmission in order to do that I
had<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.170> take<00:01:22.409> these<00:01:24.229> well<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> don't<00:01:25.500> know<00:01:25.590> what

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
had to take these well I don't know what

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.929 
had to take these well I don't know what
you<00:01:25.770> want<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> call<00:01:26.130> them<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.369> bushings

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you want to call them but bushings

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.640 
you want to call them but bushings
that's<00:01:27.360> what<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.229> originally

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
that's what they are now they originally

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.859 
that's what they are now they originally
had<00:01:28.710> needle<00:01:29.130> bearings<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.640> them<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.570> had<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
had needle bearings in them so I had to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.480 
had needle bearings in them so I had to
swap<00:01:31.110> them<00:01:31.290> out<00:01:31.380> two<00:01:31.500> bushings<00:01:31.920> which<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
swap them out two bushings which is a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.539 
swap them out two bushings which is a
seventy<00:01:33.210> eight<00:01:33.390> zero<00:01:34.049> zero<00:01:34.170> zero<00:01:34.590> 2<00:01:34.950> part

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
seventy eight zero zero zero 2 part

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.330 
seventy eight zero zero zero 2 part
number<00:01:35.909> from<00:01:36.119> peerless<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.689> believe<00:01:37.070> anyways

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
number from peerless I believe anyways

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.370 
number from peerless I believe anyways
I<00:01:38.369> pressed<00:01:39.090> out<00:01:39.240> needle<00:01:39.630> bearings<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.170> pushed

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
I pressed out needle bearings and pushed

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.740 
I pressed out needle bearings and pushed
into<00:01:40.619> bronze<00:01:40.860> bushings<00:01:41.310> because<00:01:41.750> when

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
into bronze bushings because when

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.960 
into bronze bushings because when
running<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.320> steel<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:44.159> kart<00:01:44.430> axle<00:01:44.759> it's

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
running on this steel go kart axle it's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.929 
running on this steel go kart axle it's
not<00:01:45.149> hardened<00:01:45.770> for<00:01:46.770> needle<00:01:47.130> bearings<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
not hardened for needle bearings and it

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.569 
not hardened for needle bearings and it
would<00:01:48.060> ruin<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.649> bearings<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.860> or

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
would ruin the bearings in it or

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.010 
would ruin the bearings in it or
actually<00:01:51.000> would<00:01:51.119> call<00:01:51.329> up<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> metal<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
actually would call up the metal on the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.440 
actually would call up the metal on the
shaft<00:01:52.579> so<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.610> next<00:01:53.850> problem<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.299> how<00:01:54.420> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
shaft so the next problem is how to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.859 
shaft so the next problem is how to
install<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.229> onto<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.040> one<00:01:56.159> inch<00:01:56.399> axle<00:01:56.869> this

install this onto the one inch axle this
one<00:01:58.110> here<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.500> out<00:01:58.649> sitting<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.159> part

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
one here I have out sitting in a part

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.859 
one here I have out sitting in a part
first<00:02:01.049> off<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.649> spacer<00:02:02.600> I'm<00:02:03.600> going

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
first off I have this spacer I'm going

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.319 
first off I have this spacer I'm going
to<00:02:03.960> drill<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> hole<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.530> middle<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.329> put

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
to drill a hole in the middle of it put

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.570

in<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.849> middle<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.660> spacer<00:02:10.229> acts<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> lock

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
in the middle this spacer acts as a lock

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.100 
in the middle this spacer acts as a lock
to<00:02:11.610> keep<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.940> differential<00:02:12.629> from<00:02:12.720> slide

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
to keep the differential from slide

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.780 
to keep the differential from slide
side<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.560> side<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.040> keep<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> axe<00:02:14.490> from

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
coming out the axle halves themselves

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.870 
coming out the axle halves themselves
have<00:02:18.840> been<00:02:18.960> bored<00:02:19.170> out<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.500> one<00:02:19.680> inch<00:02:19.920> these

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
have been bored out to one inch these

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.300 
have been bored out to one inch these
were<00:02:21.090> originally<00:02:21.450> 7/8<00:02:21.990> ID

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
were originally 7/8 ID

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.130 
were originally 7/8 ID
they've<00:02:23.520> been<00:02:23.610> bored<00:02:23.880> out<00:02:24.000> on<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.180> lathe<00:02:24.420> to

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
they've been bored out on a lathe to

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.870 
they've been bored out on a lathe to
slightly<00:02:25.470> under<00:02:25.830> one<00:02:26.070> inch<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.580> give<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.820> a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
slightly under one inch to give it a

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.520 
slightly under one inch to give it a
little<00:02:27.030> bit<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.300> press<00:02:27.540> fit<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.020> axle<00:02:28.410> so

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
little bit of a press fit on the axle so

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.670 
little bit of a press fit on the axle so
they're<00:02:28.650> not<00:02:28.770> loose<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.350> one's<00:02:31.530> been

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
they're not loose and this one's been

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.370 
they're not loose and this one's been
bored<00:02:31.890> out<00:02:32.010> also<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:33.270> next<00:02:33.570> step<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.200> have

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
bored out also the next step is I have

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.380 
bored out also the next step is I have
to<00:02:34.530> take<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:34.770> brooch<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.670> have<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:35.940> cut<00:02:36.180> a

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
to take a brooch and I have to cut a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.560 
to take a brooch and I have to cut a
quarter<00:02:36.750> inch<00:02:36.960> keyway<00:02:37.550> in<00:02:38.550> both<00:02:38.940> halves<00:02:39.209> of

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
quarter inch keyway in both halves of

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.830 
quarter inch keyway in both halves of
these<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:41.190> then<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:41.910> can<00:02:42.120> slide<00:02:42.390> them<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:42.660> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
these and then I can slide them on the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.460 
these and then I can slide them on the
axle<00:02:43.320> one<00:02:43.950> from<00:02:44.160> each<00:02:44.280> side<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:46.260> course

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
axle one from each side and of course

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.990 
axle one from each side and of course
the<00:02:46.620> gear<00:02:46.800> will<00:02:46.920> be<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.160> between<00:02:47.280> them<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.820> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
the gear will be in between them and the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000 
the gear will be in between them and the
spacer<00:02:48.270> will<00:02:48.510> be<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.720> between<00:02:48.840> them<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.320> that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
spacer will be in between them and that

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.550 
spacer will be in between them and that
will<00:02:50.130> lock<00:02:50.310> everything<00:02:50.640> together<00:02:51.410> then<00:02:52.410> it's

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
will lock everything together then it's

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.500 
will lock everything together then it's
just<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.860> matter<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.220> putting<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.180> into<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
just a matter of putting it into the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.630 
just a matter of putting it into the
transmission<00:02:54.690> sliding<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.739> bushings<00:02:56.100> on<00:02:56.310> and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
transmission sliding the bushings on and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.840 
transmission sliding the bushings on and
the<00:02:57.180> bearings<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.780> setting<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.260> in<00:02:58.380> there<00:02:58.850> the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
the bearings and setting it in there the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.670 
the bearings and setting it in there the
other<00:02:59.940> modifications<00:03:00.720> for<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.020> transmission

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
other modifications for the transmission

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.170 
other modifications for the transmission
are<00:03:01.830> it's<00:03:02.280> probably<00:03:02.370> going<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> drink

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
are it's probably going to have a drink

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.120 
are it's probably going to have a drink
it's<00:03:03.300> going<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.540> have<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.660> drain<00:03:03.959> line<00:03:04.130> probably

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
it's going to have a drain line probably

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.970 
it's going to have a drain line probably
in<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.640> rear<00:03:05.880> here's<00:03:06.180> another<00:03:06.980> transmission

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
in the rear here's another transmission

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.070 
in the rear here's another transmission
case<00:03:08.190> that's<00:03:08.459> empty<00:03:08.810> probably<00:03:09.810> going<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.989> have

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
case that's empty probably going to have

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.900 
case that's empty probably going to have
a<00:03:10.110> drain<00:03:10.380> line<00:03:10.410> around<00:03:10.830> here<00:03:11.220> or<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.610> have

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
a drain line around here or so you have

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.340 
a drain line around here or so you have
to<00:03:12.000> tip<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.239> transmission<00:03:12.900> up<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.110> get<00:03:13.230> all

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
to tip the transmission up to get all

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.130 
to tip the transmission up to get all
the<00:03:13.470> oil<00:03:13.500> out<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.130> whoop-dee-doo<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:15.510> then

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
the oil out the whoop-dee-doo and then

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.640 
the oil out the whoop-dee-doo and then
I'll<00:03:16.260> probably<00:03:16.410> have<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.680> fill<00:03:16.980> line<00:03:18.200> in<00:03:19.200> the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
I'll probably have a fill line in the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.259 
I'll probably have a fill line in the
top<00:03:19.860> somewhere<00:03:20.190> haven't<00:03:20.820> really<00:03:20.970> decided

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
top somewhere haven't really decided

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.690 
top somewhere haven't really decided
where<00:03:21.630> yet<00:03:21.900> but<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.920> fill<00:03:23.100> line<00:03:23.310> will<00:03:23.489> serve

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
where yet but the fill line will serve

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.250 
where yet but the fill line will serve
two<00:03:23.910> purposes<00:03:23.940> one<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.750> can<00:03:24.870> change<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.170> oil

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
two purposes one you can change the oil

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.840 
two purposes one you can change the oil
in<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.500> transmission<00:03:26.070> without<00:03:26.310> removing<00:03:26.760> it

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
in the transmission without removing it

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.500 
in the transmission without removing it
and<00:03:27.630> two<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:29.130> will<00:03:29.310> serve<00:03:29.580> as<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.790> vent<00:03:30.120> for<00:03:30.299> when

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
and two it will serve as a vent for when

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.180 
and two it will serve as a vent for when
the<00:03:30.600> oil<00:03:30.630> gets<00:03:31.080> hot<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.530> doesn't<00:03:31.799> try<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:31.950> push

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
the oil gets hot it doesn't try to push

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.130 
the oil gets hot it doesn't try to push
out<00:03:32.340> past<00:03:32.610> seals<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:36.600> that's<00:03:36.780> kind<00:03:37.019> of<00:03:37.080> my

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
out past seals so that's kind of my

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.370 
out past seals so that's kind of my
overview<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:38.269> 820<00:03:39.269> I'm<00:03:39.390> prepping<00:03:39.690> for<00:03:39.989> us

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
overview of a 820 I'm prepping for us
