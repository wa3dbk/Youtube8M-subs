to show us what do you have today

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.369 
to show us what do you have today
today<00:00:06.600> we're<00:00:06.810> going<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.080> talk<00:00:07.259> about

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
today we're going to talk about

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.740 
today we're going to talk about
graduated<00:00:08.069> strands<00:00:08.429> okay<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.090> it's<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.540> great

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
graduated strands okay so it's a great

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.450 
graduated strands okay so it's a great
way<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.929> use<00:00:10.170> these<00:00:10.380> large<00:00:10.710> beads<00:00:11.040> with<00:00:11.309> some

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
way to use these large beads with some

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.310 
way to use these large beads with some
smaller<00:00:11.790> spacers<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.540> between<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:13.110> really

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
smaller spacers in between it really

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.749 
smaller spacers in between it really
gives<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.590> some<00:00:13.650> depth<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.340> dimension<00:00:14.460> to

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
gives you some depth and dimension to

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.700 
gives you some depth and dimension to
your<00:00:14.969> piece<00:00:15.210> which<00:00:15.719> helps<00:00:16.199> when<00:00:16.350> you're<00:00:16.529> using

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
your piece which helps when you're using

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.689 
your piece which helps when you're using
big<00:00:17.039> beads<00:00:18.350> right<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.039> started<00:00:20.340> with<00:00:20.520> some

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
big beads right so I started with some

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.779 
big beads right so I started with some
chalk<00:00:20.939> turquoise<00:00:21.480> beads<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:23.100> kind<00:00:23.699> of

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
chalk turquoise beads and I kind of

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.939 
chalk turquoise beads and I kind of
space<00:00:24.090> them<00:00:24.330> evenly<00:00:24.480> across<00:00:25.050> my<00:00:25.529> bead<00:00:25.710> board

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
space them evenly across my bead board

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.279 
space them evenly across my bead board
and<00:00:26.250> then<00:00:26.880> went<00:00:27.090> back<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.510> filled<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.930> to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
and then went back and filled in to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.500 
and then went back and filled in to
create<00:00:28.619> some<00:00:28.949> dimension<00:00:29.189> there<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> used<00:00:30.210> six

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
create some dimension there I used six

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.389 
create some dimension there I used six
millimeter<00:00:30.990> rounds<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.710> four<00:00:31.980> millimeter

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
millimeter rounds and four millimeter

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.979 
millimeter rounds and four millimeter
rounds<00:00:32.850> okay<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.630> know<00:00:33.750> when<00:00:33.870> you're

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
rounds okay and you know when you're

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.209 
rounds okay and you know when you're
working<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.410> bead<00:00:34.649> board<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.040> really

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
working with a bead board it's really

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.709 
working with a bead board it's really
wonderful<00:00:35.610> because<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.600> your

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
wonderful because you can see what your

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.150 
wonderful because you can see what your
piece<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> look<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.649> before<00:00:37.860> you

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
piece is going to look like before you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.280 
piece is going to look like before you
string<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.489> save<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.270> time<00:00:39.510> however

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
string it save it in time however

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.319 
string it save it in time however
sometimes<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.610> hard<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.090> what<00:00:42.210> it's

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
sometimes it's hard to see what it's

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.490 
sometimes it's hard to see what it's
going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.570> look<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.780> once<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.230> get<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
going to look like once you get the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.090 
going to look like once you get the
metallic<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.460> there<00:00:44.700> okay<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
metallic in there okay so what I do is I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
metallic in there okay so what I do is I
like<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.670> add<00:00:47.879> those<00:00:48.149> metals<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.780> string

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
like to add those metals as I string

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.279 
like to add those metals as I string
okay<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.250> piece<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.870> showing<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
okay so this piece is showing with the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.700 
okay so this piece is showing with the
metal<00:00:52.559> beads<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:53.100> with<00:00:54.030> our<00:00:54.289> chalk<00:00:55.289> turquoise

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
metal beads in with our chalk turquoise

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.639 
metal beads in with our chalk turquoise
beads<00:00:55.949> beads<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.530> bit

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
beads beads so this is more a little bit

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.810 
beads beads so this is more a little bit
more<00:00:58.800> closer<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.340> finished<00:00:59.640> project

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
more closer to the finished project

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.560 
more closer to the finished project
right<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.559> what<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> did<00:01:01.980> was<00:01:02.180> same<00:01:03.180> idea

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
right so then what I did was same idea

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.539 
right so then what I did was same idea
with<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.930> evenly<00:01:04.379> spaced<00:01:04.650> larger<00:01:05.040> beads<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
with the evenly spaced larger beads and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.030 
with the evenly spaced larger beads and
just<00:01:05.760> filling<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.210> between<00:01:06.540> okay<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.710> I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
just filling in between okay so I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.620 
just filling in between okay so I
created<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> three<00:01:08.909> strands<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> then

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
created the three strands and then

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.820 
created the three strands and then
realized<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.170> know<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.470> piece<00:01:10.650> really

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
realized you know this piece really

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.130 
realized you know this piece really
needs<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.130> pendant<00:01:11.490> since<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.630> hadn't<00:01:12.930> attach

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
needs a pendant since I hadn't attach

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.690 
needs a pendant since I hadn't attach
the<00:01:13.320> clasp<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.680> anything<00:01:14.010> yet<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.369> could<00:01:14.549> go

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the clasp for anything yet I could go

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.609 
the clasp for anything yet I could go
back<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.180> add<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.630> pendant<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> center

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
back and add the pendant to the center

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.160 
back and add the pendant to the center
right<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.520> last<00:01:17.700> strand<00:01:18.060> no<00:01:18.390> perfect<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
right of the last strand no perfect and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.380 
right of the last strand no perfect and
then<00:01:19.530> what's<00:01:20.189> great<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:20.820> pick<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.270> up

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
then what's great is you can pick it up

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
then what's great is you can pick it up
and<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> drape<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.220> look

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and see what the drape is going to look

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.679 
and see what the drape is going to look
like<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.970> something<00:01:24.299> stopping<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
like if you have something stopping the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.660 
like if you have something stopping the
beads<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.960> falling<00:01:25.259> right<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> actually

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
beads of falling right so I actually

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.960 
beads of falling right so I actually
just<00:01:26.939> pick<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.360> each<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:28.020> my<00:01:28.140> strands<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.040> have

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
just pick up each of my strands and have

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.510 
just pick up each of my strands and have
a<00:01:30.000> look<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.009> especially

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
a look and I like to do this especially

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.950 
a look and I like to do this especially
with<00:01:32.759> graduated<00:01:33.390> because<00:01:33.630> you're<00:01:33.780> never

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
with graduated because you're never

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
with graduated because you're never
really<00:01:34.290> sure<00:01:34.560> how<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.070> graduated<00:01:35.729> strands

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
really sure how the graduated strands
