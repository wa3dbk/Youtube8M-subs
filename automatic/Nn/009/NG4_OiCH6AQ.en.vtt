00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.089
 web video repair yourself in this 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.420
 case the video will be dedicated to how 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:14.160
 disassemble the main covers of a 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.580
 nesx crux coffee machine model xn 7 thousand 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.580
 5 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.710
 when we proceed to disassemble we will remove it 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.710
 the part of the water tank 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.840
 the capsule box 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.840
 to the bottom 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.530
 we knocked it down and proceeded to draw 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.650
 the screws from the bottom 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.880
 I have already removed five of the six 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.090
 They carry 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.670
 we will need a tool 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.380
 homemade for example like the one that we 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.900
 shows in a few previous videos is 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.690
 made with a wooden handle and a 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.910
 pin of those used in mechanics 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.550
 If you see other videos, you will see how 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.189
 can perform the same we take the 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.520
 screws 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:11.869
 since they are special and 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.930
 they have the shape of a hub as you can 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.930
 observe 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.880
 we remove all the screws 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.810
 and this will allow us to be able to extract from 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.600
 stretch from bottom side with the same no 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.350
 you know totally since it is subject by 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.030
 the right side by the wiring of the 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.460
 ignition switch but this already 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 allows us to dismantle the rest of 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.690
 stages which is what interests us most 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.190
 to disassemble the rest of the covers what 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.040
 we do is help from a 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.070
 flat screwdriver and for example from 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.770
 a pair of tweezers or clamp used 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.979
 to take care of the clothes since we have to 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.570
 go doing a slight lever in the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.979
 lid and the same so as not to damage it 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.560
 perform in a deformity with the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.739
 help of a quilt 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.080
 We can never do it and we can not 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.520
 we will form the lid 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.840
 nor will we harm anymore we have the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.580
 first stage 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.580
 let's take out the second 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.069
 and organizing an old mansion in the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.049
 help the way clamp 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.260
 It is simply to not deform the 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.020
 table to neutralize lenin a notch 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.080
 no sign of the etc 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.190
 and since we are proceeding to take out the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.190
 upper part 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.630
 it comes out in a more or less similar way to 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.930
 how the bottom has come out 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.459
 to the top 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.459
 we make a slight pressure 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.150
 in the hooks that carry 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.010
 at the top 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.329
 we could also help on the track 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.329
 that we have used before 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.570
 Y 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.330
 with the closed capsules raised us 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.060
 allows you can close the lid the lid does not 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.030
 we can remove it totally since it has 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.380
 the wiring on one side but the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.380
 cables of said stage 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:47.190
 have enough length to 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.350
 allow us to remove it in this way and 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.820
 we have the lid unhook 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.820
 now if we wanted 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.830
 So are the part of thinking capsules 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:08.500
 we need a screwdriver tones 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.500
 Now I'm looking for the number 15 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.640
 with a torch 15 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:25.689
 a second forgiveness points of the number 10 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.039
 the points are very similar and there was 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:28.460
 confused one by the other asked 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:32.210
 apologies 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.120
 we will remove the screws that it takes in the 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.240
 top the boats are at 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.240
 view 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.330
 those are about four screws 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.730
 and this will allow us to raise 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.110
 the country to capsules 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.430
 we will remove the front that also goes 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.050
 hooked 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.050
 We take out in 30 capsules 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.470
 if we want to disengage the same 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.430
 we take out the press that holds 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.430
 The tube 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.500
 and let us hook it 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.930
 We have already prepared the pensÃ¡ 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.850
 capsules of the machine set 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.860
 I know, you'll see that you dismantle some of 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.660
 the other pieces when it has not arrived 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.000
 I'll have the problem of the fault 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.130
 that I wanted to swim but good 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.280
 basically you have already seen the mechanics 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.490
 simple how to go disassembling the 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.169
 different pieces the front also what 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.389
 we can also remove the pressure 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.020
 and we already have the paper for another capsule 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.060
 it's free 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.770
 I hope you disassembly video 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.340
 has been useful to you 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.900
 liked and nothing that if you stop riding 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.539
 some machine because you pay more or 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.520
 less where to throw a greeting and I hope 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.030
 keep visiting the website at 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.020
 videos 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.020
 9 for yourself
