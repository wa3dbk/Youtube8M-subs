00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.300
 magic potion terrestrial insects 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.300
 poisonous snakes 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:52.530
 dried tomatoes troll ears a head 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:58.220
 of garlic and sewer rats 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.220
 hahaha we have everything all populus 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:08.820
 a cic panda the potion for brooms 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.470
 flying has worked for us you know 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.570
 I tell you, panda, so that the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.700
 spell work I'm going to make a hat 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.640
 of a witch and a green nose with warts 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.740
 the materials are black cardboards 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.960
 black tissue paper silvery cardboard 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.600
 green cardboard a sheet of foam see 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.060
 black elastic rubber scissors glue 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.360
 bar and transparent tape with 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.570
 black cardboard we are going to make a cone of 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.130
 this way we have to mark a 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.369
 circle with pencil 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.820
 we doubled here 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.210
 we mark the line a little bit and we do 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.030
 a circle like that to remove this corner 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.429
 do not forget to use school scissors and 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.039
 if we do not have help for an adult with a 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.490
 rule let's cut this side of here 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.490
 that we have left 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.490
 now we will only have to put one side together 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.860
 with the other so that we have the hat 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.260
 of witch we can close the circle so much 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.060
 as we want more little ones and we have 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.380
 the head small or larger if 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.380
 we have very grandota head 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.180
 very well panda and hold strong so that 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.180
 do not move us 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.480
 let's continue doing it with paper of 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.840
 black silk that is this paper that is 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.400
 wrinkle 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.840
 we fold it in half 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.840
 and again in half 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.690
 and the wrinkle plus a little bit like that 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.350
 to give it a rounded shape and now 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.930
 we will put transparent tape on 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.390
 the folds and we will stick subject improvements 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.390
 and inside the hat 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.920
 look panda we have the hat almost 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.439
 finished now we could decorate it by 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.629
 example by putting here a tape with 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.090
 a buckle with those cards that 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.040
 you bring there a straight line and cut 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.689
 now we draw on this green card 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.879
 a buckle we put a little bit of 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:28.359
 glue bar in the buckle the 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:39.320
 we center and now we put glue on 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:42.450
 bar across the strip they cross 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.010
 We'll do the green nose with this 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.680
 material that is how much it is like a 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.540
 very soft foam we will draw a cone 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.170
 taking advantage of one of the corners of the 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.850
 Cardboard I have put a little tape 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.530
 double-sided on this side and so on 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.880
 I can close the triangle in this way 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.340
 as to this material we can give it shape 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.100
 we would have to do with the nose a 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.430
 little wrinkled and ugly 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.970
 and we could with a paint marker 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.390
 some warts and now we need a 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.080
 little piece of black rubber we give a little nudite 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.019
 on one side we measure our heads 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.730
 until the nose we cut what's left and 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.310
 we give another knot on the other end 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:30.090
 now we can only join it to the nose 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.130
 Y 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.130
 fantastic we already have the nose drawn 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.229
 how fun this is to make spells of 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.949
 panda now we throw the head of 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:47.940
 garlic the sewer rats we remove 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:50.750
 strong and jo plus the potion to fly in 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:55.360
 Broom is ready 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:59.190
 try a little bit with gto broom 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:03.110
 and talk until the next 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.110
 of flight
