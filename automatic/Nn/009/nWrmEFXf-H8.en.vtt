00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
back to the next step okay so now I have

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.500 
back to the next step okay so now I have
a<00:03:00.599> five<00:03:01.109> gallon<00:03:01.439> bucket<00:03:01.819> which<00:03:02.819> is<00:03:03.030> half<00:03:03.269> full

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
of warm water and this is actually a

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.509 
of warm water and this is actually a
little<00:03:06.750> bit<00:03:06.870> larger<00:03:07.319> than<00:03:07.439> five<00:03:07.799> gallons<00:03:08.310> it's

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.800 
a brewing bucket I forget it this is six
or<00:03:11.639> eight<00:03:11.760> or<00:03:11.909> what<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.180> that's<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.629> little

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
or eight or what it is that's a little

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.659 
or eight or what it is that's a little
bigger<00:03:13.019> so<00:03:13.190> actually<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> little<00:03:14.430> more<00:03:14.519> than

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:14.669 
bigger so actually a little more than

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:21.680 
bigger so actually a little more than
hassle<00:03:15.319> but<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:18.169> mounted<00:03:19.169> my<00:03:19.909> soap<00:03:20.909> flakes<00:03:21.090> or<00:03:21.659> I

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
hassle but I mounted my soap flakes or I

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.140 
hassle but I mounted my soap flakes or I

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
think I have it's kind of hard to tell

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.530

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
it all up nice and it's my understanding

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.890 
it all up nice and it's my understanding
that<00:03:56.400> what<00:03:56.669> you<00:03:56.819> then<00:03:57.000> do<00:03:57.299> is<00:03:59.509> after<00:04:00.509> you've

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
that what you then do is after you've

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.740 
that what you then do is after you've
done<00:04:01.109> this<00:04:01.319> you<00:04:01.379> fill<00:04:01.859> the<00:04:02.009> rest<00:04:02.220> up<00:04:02.599> so<00:04:03.599> that

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
done this you fill the rest up so that

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.270 
done this you fill the rest up so that
your<00:04:03.870> five-gallon<00:04:04.470> bucket<00:04:04.799> is<00:04:04.919> more<00:04:05.159> or<00:04:05.250> less

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
your five-gallon bucket is more or less

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.589 
your five-gallon bucket is more or less
full<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:06.989> let<00:04:07.169> it<00:04:07.290> sit<00:04:07.530> overnight<00:04:08.599> at

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
full and you let it sit overnight at

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.569 
full and you let it sit overnight at
which<00:04:09.810> point<00:04:10.199> it's<00:04:10.439> supposed<00:04:10.829> to<00:04:11.040> turn<00:04:11.250> into

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
which point it's supposed to turn into

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:12.510 
which point it's supposed to turn into
sort<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.060> a

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
sort of a

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.370 
sort of a
and<00:04:13.240> gel<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:13.990> gelatinous<00:04:14.590> on<00:04:15.040> gel<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:16.510> I<00:04:16.840> guess<00:04:17.110> I

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
and gel a gelatinous on gel so I guess I

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:25.410 
and gel a gelatinous on gel so I guess I
will<00:04:17.560> be<00:04:17.740> back<00:04:17.980> tomorrow<00:04:18.310> for<00:04:19.770> that<00:04:20.770> part<00:04:24.420> ok

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.660 
in mind is that every time before you
use<00:05:06.790> it<00:05:07.030> you<00:05:07.240> have<00:05:07.270> to<00:05:07.450> shake<00:05:07.840> it<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.670> looking

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
use it you have to shake it and looking

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.370 
use it you have to shake it and looking
at<00:05:09.790> the<00:05:09.970> SKU<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:10.270> can<00:05:10.660> see<00:05:10.870> why<00:05:11.050> they<00:05:11.170> would<00:05:11.350> say

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
at the SKU I can see why they would say

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.600 
at the SKU I can see why they would say
that<00:05:12.630> this<00:05:13.630> is<00:05:13.840> you<00:05:14.680> use<00:05:14.950> 1/4<00:05:15.520> cup<00:05:15.960> per<00:05:16.960> load

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
that this is you use 1/4 cup per load

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.790 
that this is you use 1/4 cup per load

which is anywhere between 11 and $19 for
the<00:05:38.050> large<00:05:39.180> container<00:05:40.180> which<00:05:41.050> is<00:05:41.440> let's<00:05:41.950> see

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
the large container which is let's see

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.140 
the large container which is let's see
1.3<00:05:44.320> 2<00:05:44.560> gallons<00:05:46.680> yeah<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.890> price<00:05:48.160> of<00:05:48.430> this<00:05:48.730> was

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
1.3 2 gallons yeah the price of this was

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.560 
1.3 2 gallons yeah the price of this was
about<00:05:49.390> a<00:05:49.450> buck<00:05:49.750> 50<00:05:50.170> for<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.440> bar<00:05:50.650> of<00:05:50.770> soap<00:05:51.100> I

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
about a buck 50 for the bar of soap I

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.300 
about a buck 50 for the bar of soap I
think<00:05:52.570> I<00:05:52.690> gave<00:05:52.930> you<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.110> prices<00:05:53.590> earlier<00:05:54.070> on

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
think I gave you the prices earlier on

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.240 
think I gave you the prices earlier on
the<00:05:54.460> borax<00:05:54.850> in<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:55.240> washing<00:05:56.230> soda<00:05:56.650> which<00:05:57.040> are

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
the borax in the washing soda which are

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.270 
the borax in the washing soda which are
only<00:05:57.640> a<00:05:58.030> cup<00:05:58.450> of<00:05:58.870> the<00:05:59.200> washing<00:05:59.590> soda<00:05:59.800> and<00:06:00.190> a

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
only a cup of the washing soda and a

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.590 
only a cup of the washing soda and a
half<00:06:00.460> cup<00:06:00.700> of<00:06:00.820> the<00:06:01.000> borax

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
half cup of the borax

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.410 
half cup of the borax
so<00:06:02.380> I'm<00:06:02.620> guessing<00:06:03.190> this<00:06:03.370> whole<00:06:03.610> bucket<00:06:04.060> cost

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
so I'm guessing this whole bucket cost

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.220 
so I'm guessing this whole bucket cost
maybe<00:06:05.160> 3<00:06:06.160> bucks<00:06:06.430> to<00:06:06.880> make<00:06:07.060> and<00:06:07.360> I'm<00:06:07.450> figuring

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
maybe 3 bucks to make and I'm figuring

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.950 
maybe 3 bucks to make and I'm figuring
that<00:06:08.350> hi<00:06:08.790> remember<00:06:09.790> we're<00:06:10.120> going<00:06:10.240> to<00:06:10.330> mix<00:06:10.780> this

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
that hi remember we're going to mix this

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.470 
that hi remember we're going to mix this
with<00:06:11.200> 50<00:06:11.500> percent<00:06:11.920> water<00:06:12.130> so<00:06:12.550> you<00:06:13.180> basically

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
with 50 percent water so you basically

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.210 
with 50 percent water so you basically
get<00:06:14.080> 10<00:06:14.500> gallons<00:06:14.770> of<00:06:15.690> this<00:06:16.690> detergent<00:06:17.500> for

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
get 10 gallons of this detergent for

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.290 
get 10 gallons of this detergent for
about<00:06:18.670> 3<00:06:19.210> dollars<00:06:19.650> which<00:06:20.650> is<00:06:21.010> a<00:06:21.040> huge<00:06:21.730> savings

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
about 3 dollars which is a huge savings

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.719 
about 3 dollars which is a huge savings
especially<00:06:22.930> if<00:06:23.050> you<00:06:23.169> do<00:06:23.320> as<00:06:23.440> much

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
especially if you do as much

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.350 
especially if you do as much
laundry<00:06:24.029> as<00:06:24.120> I<00:06:24.330> do<00:06:24.389> so<00:06:25.400> the<00:06:26.400> next<00:06:26.639> question<00:06:26.879> is

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
laundry as I do so the next question is

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.929
