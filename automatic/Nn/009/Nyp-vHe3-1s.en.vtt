football<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.270> goals<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.809> got<00:00:33.989> teams<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
football that goals you got teams that

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.069 
football that goals you got teams that
have<00:00:34.649> momentum<00:00:35.219> everything<00:00:35.760> flows<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.450> just

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
have momentum everything flows it just

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.959 
have momentum everything flows it just
falls<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.590> its<00:00:37.770> nicely<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.730> games

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
falls in its nicely and you have games

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.330 
falls in its nicely and you have games
that<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.510> momentum<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.379> there<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
that the momentum is in there and it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.920 
that the momentum is in there and it
just<00:00:41.610> doesn't<00:00:41.879> come<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.719> you're

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
just doesn't come it's like you're

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.990 
just doesn't come it's like you're
dragging<00:00:43.200> yourself<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.489> was<00:00:44.670> happening

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
dragging yourself and that was happening

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.760 
dragging yourself and that was happening
and<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.660> has<00:00:45.840> been<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> little<00:00:46.440> bit<00:00:46.620> of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and I think it has been a little bit of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.840 
and I think it has been a little bit of
a<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.100> little<00:00:48.059> bit<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.930> know<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.760> follow<00:00:50.760> up

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
a a little bit of a you know a follow up

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.459 
a a little bit of a you know a follow up
from<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.300> recent<00:00:51.719> games<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.140> we've<00:00:52.230> had

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
from the recent games that we've had

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.229 
from the recent games that we've had
where<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.739> should<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.190> gone<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.699> front<00:00:54.030> we

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
where we should have gone in front we

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.080 
where we should have gone in front we
should<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.480> got<00:00:54.629> something<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> game

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.310 

yeah<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.260> that's

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
yeah but it can it can be but that's

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.660 
yeah but it can it can be but that's
that<00:01:01.530> where<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> dangerous<00:01:02.160> that's<00:01:02.460> where

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that where the dangerous that's where

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.160

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
are the good things that we've been

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.600 
are the good things that we've been
producing<00:01:15.030> right<00:01:16.020> why<00:01:16.560> haven't<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.009> got<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
producing right why haven't we got to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.920 
producing right why haven't we got to
this<00:01:17.700> situation<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.210> because<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.720> haven't

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
this situation is because we haven't

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.560 
this situation is because we haven't
done<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.320> well<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.490> certain<00:01:21.119> areas

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
done as well as we can in certain areas

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.080 
done as well as we can in certain areas
which<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.350> should<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.590> taken<00:01:22.799> chances

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
which is we should have taken chances

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.640 
which is we should have taken chances
better<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.509> know<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.900> get<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.170> noses<00:01:25.350> in

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
better you know if you get your noses in

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.830 
better you know if you get your noses in
front<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.820> ghost<00:01:27.390> change<00:01:27.689> this

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
front that one is ghost change this

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960 
front that one is ghost change this
games<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.290> also<00:01:28.470> goals<00:01:29.250> change<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.729> mindset

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
games but also goals change this mindset

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.219 
games but also goals change this mindset
it<00:01:30.450> creates<00:01:31.110> confidence<00:01:31.409> or<00:01:31.970> it<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:33.960> it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it creates confidence or it you know it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.109 
it creates confidence or it you know it
takes<00:01:34.530> confidence<00:01:35.040> away<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.700> think

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
takes confidence away and that I think

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.210 
takes confidence away and that I think
was<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.570> little<00:01:36.630> bit<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.079> illustrative<00:01:38.009> what

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
was a little bit of illustrative what

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.719 
was a little bit of illustrative what
you<00:01:38.340> saw<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.970> Tuesday<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:40.079> we've<00:01:40.950> picked<00:01:41.610> up

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you saw on Tuesday that we've picked up

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
it might sound strange because I've

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.879

too<00:06:07.310> much<00:06:07.520> quality<00:06:08.090> to<00:06:08.630> be<00:06:08.780> in<00:06:08.840> a<00:06:08.930> position

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
too much quality to be in a position

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.589 
too much quality to be in a position
where<00:06:09.349> in<00:06:09.650> we've<00:06:10.159> added<00:06:10.460> energy<00:06:10.849> and<00:06:11.240> quality
