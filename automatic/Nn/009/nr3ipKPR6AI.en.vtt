a<00:00:37.890> real<00:00:38.460> craftsmen<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.270> certainly<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:39.899> I'm

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
a real craftsmen I certainly do and I'm

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.869 
a real craftsmen I certainly do and I'm
learning<00:00:40.379> all<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.040> time<00:00:41.070> about<00:00:41.399> my<00:00:41.579> knife

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
learning all the time about my knife

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.330 
learning all the time about my knife
skills<00:00:42.090> when<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:43.250> build<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.370> fish<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:46.340> we

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
skills when we build a fish so we we

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.510 
skills when we build a fish so we we
have<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.420> very<00:00:48.840> careful<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> touch<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
have to be very careful to touch the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.450 
have to be very careful to touch the
fish<00:00:50.700> because<00:00:51.360> raw<00:00:51.660> fish<00:00:51.989> usually<00:00:52.379> use<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
fish because raw fish usually use and

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.840 
fish because raw fish usually use and
then<00:00:54.260> no<00:00:55.260> fish<00:00:55.620> must<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.430> very<00:00:57.090> very<00:00:57.329> difficult

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
then no fish must be very very difficult

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.540 
then no fish must be very very difficult
so<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.960> use<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.590> very<00:01:01.980> sharp<00:01:02.309> knife

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
so we have to use very very sharp knife

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.859 
so we have to use very very sharp knife
otherwise<00:01:03.539> qualities<00:01:04.260> become<00:01:05.189> not<00:01:06.150> good<00:01:06.540> if

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
otherwise qualities become not good if

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.069 
otherwise qualities become not good if
cut<00:01:07.409> will<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:09.510> shocked

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
cut will be with not shocked

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.029 
cut will be with not shocked
is<00:01:11.939> after<00:01:12.939> like<00:01:13.810> their<00:01:14.049> two<00:01:14.469> days<00:01:14.740> or<00:01:15.009> three

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
is after like their two days or three

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.310 
is after like their two days or three
days<00:01:15.280> we<00:01:15.670> have<00:01:15.880> total<00:01:16.359> different<00:01:16.719> qualities

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.610 

we<00:01:19.830> need<00:01:20.040> good<00:01:20.370> technique<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.000> well<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:22.380> just

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
we need good technique as well you just

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.060 
we need good technique as well you just
take<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.130> out<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.670> scale<00:01:24.030> reason<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:25.070> because

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
take it out the scale reason I because

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.040 
take it out the scale reason I because
more<00:01:26.340> money<00:01:26.370> people<00:01:26.760> taking<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.330> scale<00:01:27.630> with

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
more money people taking this scale with

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.860 
more money people taking this scale with
the<00:01:28.350> other<00:01:28.770> staff<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.760> it's<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.780> be

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
the other staff like it's going to be

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.450 
the other staff like it's going to be
damage<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.860> fish
