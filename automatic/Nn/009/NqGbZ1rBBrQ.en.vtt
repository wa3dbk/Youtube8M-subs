00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Are you sure that if you spoke old 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.060
 videogame player about games and fighting 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.189
 of super nintendo the first thing that 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.670
 come to the head will be the games of the series 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.790
 deadly kombat of the street fighter series 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.270
 or that he insists or who knows 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.189
 Samurai shodown this because those were 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.119
 games of super fight this more 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.070
 had fame 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.830
 really does not even have to be a great 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.019
 understanding of games to meet the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.820
 There were several other fighting games 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.219
 for the super nintendo classic 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.440
 some are not so well-known 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.600
 Well, that's when I separated. 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.190
 some of these games more known than 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.160
 others but it's worth taking a look 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.559
 in all beginning by brutal bell 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.140
 zafiri game where the characters are 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.110
 humanized animals fighting arts 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.039
 interesting martial arts 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.420
 It's more or less the commonplace story. 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.699
 in it the players go to an island 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.520
 called for such a reason to fight for 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.329
 fame recognition of course a prize in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.609
 money 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.510
 but okay at least the characters 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.590
 are cool 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.869
 among them we have a cafofo bane the rabbit 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.510
 Shaolin monk known for his 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.310
 kicks and we also have the price 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.250
 none is the African lion that his 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.220
 guitar against opponents in that 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.530
 the fifth the coyote a greedy coyote 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.000
 who fights and with the bank even more 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.700
 four characters to choose from 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.850
 totaling 7 and still a secret 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.320
 can be released with mother but the game is 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.120
 in and of itself it is good 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.340
 Ah, I'd say not 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.080
 although designs are beautiful to 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.080
 gameplay is very bad 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.080
 even with the 14 difficulty itself 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.790
 fourteen difficulties due to the fact that 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.770
 bad to control the characters 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.540
 The game gets a bit difficult until the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.400
 lower difficulties 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.530
 remembering that these other gameplay 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.480
 background this video I'm not playing 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.890
 against the machine 15 even my girlfriend 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.890
 and multiplayer 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.930
 the two then a good game the power one 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.270
 style that them times not power list 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.630
 The game is also known as gugu which 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.560
 arises and xvii punches or else the club what 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.360
 comes up 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.880
 because the story of this game is 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.250
 basically around this clan that the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.930
 every five years holds a tournament that 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.830
 determines who will be your next 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.830
 leader 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.610
 the only one to flee is the current leader and has 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.650
 defended his reign for 60 years but 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.140
 now many strong fighters are 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.060
 willing to defeat him as only of 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.310
 within the clan can participate in the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.620
 tournament all the characters have some 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.500
 kinship and let's talk not about 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.780
 some of them my favorite that I always 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.110
 picked 15 years ago from super nintendo 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.459
 is the kit with a young rebel who was doing 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.080
 part of a gang 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.940
 only that he abandoned her because of 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.070
 father's implication 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.410
 another also liked the white 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.000
 buffalo a native american tries 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.730
 protect the rights of its people to 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.110
 any cost and the most 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.840
 bizarre of all 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.720
 the other denied that she messes with her younger sister 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.489
 of the current clan leader wisdom 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.510
 loosened your mouth when your 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.370
 opponents 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.080
 You do not know what plate I asked. 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.900
 person comes back older than 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.850
 say no this is not the craziest for sale 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.560
 but suppose the other fighters saw a 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.560
 young beautiful for a while 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.370
 not using the game's gameplay is 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.140
 very good 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.510
 the characters have legal powers 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.489
 scenarios although it is a bit simple 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.769
 of a better setting the game 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.260
 summing up your own voice for the 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.900
 next round of the robots 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.760
 is a fighting game about cyborgs robots 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.769
 and machines of destruction รณ appear legal 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.530
 we will see the gameplay is very caught 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.170
 but at least that does not hinder the game 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.660
 as much as gross safi hotel 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.430
 I do not know if you have powers in the game because I 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.250
 I tried to go back to the album but I could not 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.200
 hit the combination no good but 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.620
 at least you can select character 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.859
 cool not the only character is a guy 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.829
 called cyborg and you play that way 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.640
 history by defeating the enemies 11 and 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.889
 multiplayer 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.850
 only one player can choose one 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.060
 different robot 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.740
 player one stays with sicoob name 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.229
 says that there is a continuation 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.930
 made by playstation 1 with much more 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.570
 characters, but I have not played 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.450
 I want to pass away from the sporting been 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.000
 some big n style games prosuper ness 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.110
 and even a racing game but moreover 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.389
 almaty marf power rangers definition 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.030
 in it you do not control the rangers you 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.490
 controls the mega organs a story 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.919
 You choose the Thunder Mega Luck and the 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.289
 mega tiger lucky and goes defeating the 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.630
 enemies and other mega sorgi until you reach 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.030
 in the great villain the nord 7 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.430
 the gameplay is good asis part of 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.860
 characters are beautiful and brand trails 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.080
 It's great, this all makes the game. 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.610
 be very fun and still in the 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.220
 multiplayer where you can choose 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.830
 between four mega-fortunes and four billion 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.740
 fight your very good friend - for 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.849
 now next site history is a game 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.659
 produced by the date this m 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:22.419
 193 for using kits in 1994 went to 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:25.389
 overcome the Indian and in fact this game 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.529
 even has a certain reputation reputed to be a 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.119
 copy 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:30.639
 That's right the game was a copy 

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:32.559
 blatant street fighter 2 starting now 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.809
 control which also consists of a 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:36.580
 leverage these buttons but in time to 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:38.619
 play and the striking similarity between the 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.289
 characters and a coup 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:43.059
 good the letter with even the prosecution against 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.610
 sorry for plagiarism 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:48.279
 then the judges by copying and even that has 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.139
 the good elements a few examples 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.969
 this is the weaknesses 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.949
 every fighter a weak spot that 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:55.959
 when often hit the spot there 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.179
 in question begins to shine and so the 

00:05:55.959 --> 00:06:00.249
 fighter can get dizzy by movie 

00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:02.499
 the team takes to hit him more 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:04.449
 this is one of the few most news 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:06.929
 part is the breaking of a glance 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.929
 in these images 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.400
 each one then, well guys, enjoy the video 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.980
 you should see more informative videos from this 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.450
 genre and of course the game did also is 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.450
 that's when I went 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.930
 O
