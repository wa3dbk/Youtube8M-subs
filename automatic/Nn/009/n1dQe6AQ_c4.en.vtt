fantastic let's go a minute so the first
thing<00:00:47.030> we're<00:00:47.270> going<00:00:47.390> to<00:00:47.480> see<00:00:47.630> is<00:00:47.870> this<00:00:48.230> L<00:00:48.560> time

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
thing we're going to see is this L time

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.290 
thing we're going to see is this L time
you<00:00:48.950> trying<00:00:49.220> to<00:00:49.280> climb<00:00:49.460> up<00:00:49.610> this<00:00:49.730> very<00:00:49.970> steep

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
you trying to climb up this very steep

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.360 
you trying to climb up this very steep
hill<00:00:50.540> always<00:00:51.080> got<00:00:51.230> wheel<00:00:51.380> spin<00:00:51.620> there<00:00:51.830> yet

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
hill always got wheel spin there yet

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.560 
hill always got wheel spin there yet
basically<00:00:52.790> tried<00:00:53.060> to<00:00:53.090> get<00:00:53.270> up<00:00:53.360> there<00:00:53.450> in

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
basically tried to get up there in

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.600 
basically tried to get up there in
two-wheel<00:00:53.900> drive<00:00:54.200> which<00:00:54.830> is<00:00:55.040> hopeless<00:00:55.400> on<00:00:55.520> an

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
two-wheel drive which is hopeless on an

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.980 
two-wheel drive which is hopeless on an
incline<00:00:55.940> this<00:00:56.120> steep<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:56.570> we<00:00:56.660> will<00:00:56.720> go<00:00:56.780> into

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
incline this steep so we will go into

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.750 
incline this steep so we will go into
four-wheel<00:00:57.260> drive<00:00:57.620> low<00:00:57.860> range<00:00:58.130> as<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.550> see

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
four-wheel drive low range as you see

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.550 
four-wheel drive low range as you see
and<00:00:59.240> it<00:00:59.420> will<00:00:59.540> drive<00:00:59.720> straight<00:00:59.990> away<00:01:00.200> and<00:01:00.410> this

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
and it will drive straight away and this

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.110 
and it will drive straight away and this
is<00:01:00.710> typical<00:01:01.220> what<00:01:01.400> you<00:01:01.520> get<00:01:01.670> on<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:01.790> building

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
is typical what you get on a building

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.540 
is typical what you get on a building
site<00:01:02.360> absolutely<00:01:03.140> that<00:01:03.800> was<00:01:03.950> amazing<00:01:04.129> wasn't

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
site absolutely that was amazing wasn't

cruises<00:01:14.780> over<00:01:14.870> anything<00:01:15.200> doesn't<00:01:15.530> it<00:01:15.710> that's

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
cruises over anything doesn't it that's

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.680 
cruises over anything doesn't it that's
it<00:01:16.310> he'll<00:01:16.430> be<00:01:16.460> using<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.820> anti<00:01:17.060> stall<00:01:17.300> system

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
it he'll be using the anti stall system

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.880 
it he'll be using the anti stall system
on<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.900> engine<00:01:18.170> so<00:01:18.320> he<00:01:18.410> won't<00:01:18.590> need<00:01:18.710> to<00:01:18.770> use

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
on the engine so he won't need to use

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.620 
on the engine so he won't need to use
the<00:01:19.040> accelerator<00:01:19.610> at<00:01:19.760> all<00:01:19.940> it'll<00:01:20.300> just<00:01:20.330> keep

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
the accelerator at all it'll just keep

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.180 
the accelerator at all it'll just keep
ticking<00:01:20.990> along<00:01:21.170> which<00:01:21.380> makes<00:01:21.620> it<00:01:21.710> very<00:01:21.830> smooth

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
ticking along which makes it very smooth

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.590 
ticking along which makes it very smooth
when<00:01:22.400> your<00:01:22.520> off<00:01:22.580> road<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:22.820> very<00:01:23.090> safe<00:01:23.330> and

bit see if that was me I want to go

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.210 
bit see if that was me I want to go
really<00:01:44.750> fast<00:01:45.020> now<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.650> try<00:01:45.800> and<00:01:45.860> whit<00:01:46.040> brown

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
really fast now and try and whit brown

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.920 
really fast now and try and whit brown
bit<00:01:46.490> but<00:01:47.060> clearly<00:01:47.390> when<00:01:47.659> you're<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:47.870> a

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
bit but clearly when you're in a

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.600 
bit but clearly when you're in a
four-by-four<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.680> thing<00:01:48.830> is<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.100> slow<00:01:49.370> down

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
four-by-four the thing is to slow down

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.969 
four-by-four the thing is to slow down
this<00:01:50.330> is<00:01:50.570> basically<00:01:51.140> showing<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.650> that<00:01:51.860> the

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
this is basically showing you that the

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.800 
this is basically showing you that the
vehicle<00:01:52.100> is<00:01:52.310> very<00:01:52.370> stable<00:01:52.940> there's<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.510> fairly

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
vehicle is very stable there's a fairly

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.330 
vehicle is very stable there's a fairly
low<00:01:53.990> center<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.409> gravity<00:01:54.470> with<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.010> weight<00:01:55.159> of

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
low center of gravity with the weight of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.610 
low center of gravity with the weight of
the<00:01:55.430> transmission<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.120> the<00:01:56.150> axles<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.110> you

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
the transmission and the axles so you

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.340 
the transmission and the axles so you
can<00:01:57.860> negotiate<00:01:58.700> awkward<00:01:59.570> angles<00:01:59.930> without<00:02:00.229> the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
can negotiate awkward angles without the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.140 
can negotiate awkward angles without the
fear<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.740> vehicle<00:02:01.010> turning<00:02:01.280> over<00:02:01.370> as<00:02:01.940> you

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
fear of the vehicle turning over as you

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.730 
fear of the vehicle turning over as you
can<00:02:02.270> hear<00:02:02.330> there's<00:02:02.690> no<00:02:02.810> engine<00:02:02.990> revving<00:02:03.470> going

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
can hear there's no engine revving going

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.320 
can hear there's no engine revving going
on<00:02:03.830> it's<00:02:03.950> just<00:02:04.100> ticking<00:02:04.460> along<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.000> using<00:02:05.270> the

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
on it's just ticking along and using the

we've got a deep gully there to cross
over<00:02:24.700> but<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.120> can<00:02:25.270> see<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:25.959> goes

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
over but you can see that it just goes

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.480 
over but you can see that it just goes
across<00:02:26.319> with<00:02:26.590> no<00:02:26.709> problem<00:02:27.069> that's<00:02:27.220> all<00:02:27.340> head

with mitsuba she's active stability and
traction<00:02:36.160> control<00:02:36.430> yeah<00:02:36.910> that's<00:02:37.120> right<00:02:37.330> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
traction control yeah that's right and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.360 
traction control yeah that's right and
that's<00:02:37.990> where<00:02:38.260> it's<00:02:38.680> going<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.920> be<00:02:39.010> needed

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
that's where it's going to be needed

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.040 
that's where it's going to be needed
doing<00:02:39.820> this<00:02:39.940> absolutely<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.660> traction

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
doing this absolutely the traction

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.240 
doing this absolutely the traction
control<00:02:41.080> part<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.709> what<00:02:41.860> we're<00:02:41.980> looking<00:02:42.190> at

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
control part is what we're looking at

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.729 
control part is what we're looking at
here<00:02:42.310> we'll<00:02:42.940> see<00:02:43.120> as<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.050> front<00:02:44.230> wheel<00:02:44.380> lifts

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
here we'll see as the front wheel lifts

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.800 
here we'll see as the front wheel lifts
up<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.280> starts<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.730> slip<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.690> really

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
up it starts to slip so it's a really

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.229 
up it starts to slip so it's a really
slipping<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.620> brakes<00:02:47.920> are<00:02:48.130> applied

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
slipping the brakes are applied

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.940 
slipping the brakes are applied
automatically<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.480> break<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.080> wheel<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.739> stop

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
automatically to break the wheel to stop

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.920 
automatically to break the wheel to stop
it<00:02:51.070> spinning<00:02:51.340> that's<00:02:51.760> fantastic<00:02:51.940> isn't<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.630> so

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
it spinning that's fantastic isn't it so

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.990 
it spinning that's fantastic isn't it so
at<00:02:53.080> any<00:02:53.230> one<00:02:53.620> time<00:02:53.650> there's<00:02:54.220> drive<00:02:54.489> going<00:02:54.850> to

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
at any one time there's drive going to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.420 
at any one time there's drive going to
all<00:02:55.360> four<00:02:55.660> wheels<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.590> you're<00:02:56.769> never<00:02:56.950> losing

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
all four wheels so you're never losing

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.880 
all four wheels so you're never losing
grip<00:02:57.640> exactly<00:02:58.510> where<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.350> would<00:02:59.500> normally<00:02:59.530> in

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
grip exactly where you would normally in

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.830 
grip exactly where you would normally in
a<00:02:59.950> conventional<00:03:00.190> vehicle<00:03:00.610> without<00:03:00.850> VMA<00:03:01.480> s<00:03:01.510> TC

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
a conventional vehicle without VMA s TC

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.870 
a conventional vehicle without VMA s TC
it<00:03:02.320> would<00:03:02.440> lose<00:03:02.680> your<00:03:02.709> talk<00:03:03.489> through<00:03:03.760> the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
it would lose your talk through the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.310 
it would lose your talk through the
wheels<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.209> are<00:03:04.239> in<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.480> air<00:03:04.600> which<00:03:05.110> means

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
wheels that are in the air which means

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.930 
wheels that are in the air which means
the<00:03:05.440> drive<00:03:05.650> goes<00:03:05.920> through<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.400> differentials

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
the drive goes through the differentials

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.310 
the drive goes through the differentials
to<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.180> other<00:03:07.360> citrus<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.989> other<00:03:08.140> you

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
to the other citrus to the other you

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.660 
to the other citrus to the other you
know<00:03:08.410> one<00:03:08.620> thing<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.860> notice<00:03:09.220> with<00:03:09.370> all<00:03:09.519> of<00:03:09.640> that

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
know one thing I notice with all of that

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.310 
know one thing I notice with all of that
all<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.269> time<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.630> was<00:03:10.720> traveling<00:03:11.110> across

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
all the time it was traveling across

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.070 
all the time it was traveling across
this<00:03:11.530> which<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:11.920> really<00:03:12.300> aggressive<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.870> bed

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
this which is really aggressive the bed

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.930 
this which is really aggressive the bed
at<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.530> back<00:03:14.709> was<00:03:14.920> completely<00:03:15.430> flat<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:15.880> if

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
at the back was completely flat so if

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.220 
at the back was completely flat so if
there<00:03:16.090> was<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.269> load<00:03:16.510> in<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.720> back<00:03:16.840> is<00:03:17.049> no

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
there was a load in the back is no

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.870 
there was a load in the back is no
danger<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.829> it<00:03:17.950> rolling<00:03:18.310> out<00:03:18.430> or<00:03:18.519> falling<00:03:18.790> it

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
danger of it rolling out or falling it

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.640 
danger of it rolling out or falling it
exactly<00:03:19.239> very<00:03:19.510> stable<00:03:19.810> again<00:03:20.320> it's<00:03:20.530> the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
exactly very stable again it's the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.050 
exactly very stable again it's the
actual<00:03:20.799> travel<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.400> isn't<00:03:21.670> allowing<00:03:21.820> the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
actual travel that isn't allowing the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.640 
actual travel that isn't allowing the

vehicle to stay level very very good

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.290 
vehicle to stay level very very good
thank<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.160> very<00:03:24.310> much<00:03:24.430> Jason<00:03:24.820> no<00:03:25.209> prob
