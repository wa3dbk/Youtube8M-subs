these are all heavy things I think we

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.510 
these are all heavy things I think we
should<00:04:55.110> use<00:04:55.260> one<00:04:55.650> thing<00:04:55.889> to<00:04:56.070> lighten<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:56.430> up

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
should use one thing to lighten it up

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.490 
should use one thing to lighten it up
maybe<00:04:57.180> some<00:04:57.449> chopped<00:04:57.690> up<00:04:57.840> cherry<00:04:58.080> tomatoes

maybe some chopped up cherry tomatoes

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.409 
maybe some chopped up cherry tomatoes
