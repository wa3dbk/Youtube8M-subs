00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.760
 well I'm crying and I'm the minimanga 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.860
 because vision is good taught as 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.959
 download the map when they have to 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.900
 download this file that is called 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.750
 accept cheever 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.400
 and good as you download them seven 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.099
 files will look like what this is 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.800
 menu for example and I have that map in 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.140
 good I'm going to install another I have them 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.689
 in sd card in your case this will 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.939
 be receiving internal memory they give in 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.390
 now given that it's almost always where 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.970
 they are for example zip test here and you 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:41.320
 they give in extracting 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:44.260
 they go to the folder of the game 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.160
 and the game are accommodating and mike 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.850
 work and good this is to paste a 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.250
 wall to be 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:58.170
 as I have it I 'm not going to this one 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.170
 I'm not going to put it back 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.250
 good to replace 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.600
 and good they go to what it is to look for it 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.120
 Well I'll put this either by 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.720
 example this one and from there they're going to put 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.190
 extract good in this in sky background 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.190
 points and they will put you extract here 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.180
 and that is proof that what I already 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:36.049
 is making it already happening 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:40.210
 to a folder where when they open their 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.210
 minecraft can already have it there 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.630
 and well they go up and to check 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.630
 here is in the folder 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.840
 and well that would be all I hope that you 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.660
 it has become clear what is the tutorial 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.080
 and good if you have any other questions or 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.150
 things like that, they tell me and like I go to 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.370
 keep recording 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:11.229
 and I hope you have understood me well 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.229
 see you until next time 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.300
 no no
