00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.460
 if by now it is a fact that the fields are there 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.240
 hardened by the golden age of the launch 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.189
 of the it 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.779
 this does not mean that one cannot 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.119
 still make an excellent profit 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.010
 playing poker that the real country of 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.390
 bengodi for poker players has become the 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.160
 live cash game 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.210
 let's find out what they think about it 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.210
 savinelli andrea benelli 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.980
 my personal experience I believe the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.170
 live cash 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.690
 it is not that it has grown so much 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.670
 arrived this stationary people 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.070
 the only thing the online grinders do 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.560
 being more rolled they also advanced 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.670
 them to play maybe live cash games 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.200
 when they come to do tournaments because of 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.170
 we usually say that maybe those who shouted the 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.150
 no limit 200 items 400 at the beginning was 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.740
 a little reluctant to play no limits 2001 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.900
 limits thousand that there was live with the 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.310
 some time may have become 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.200
 more winners have started playing 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.060
 they live too so they got up because 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.010
 maybe the grinder and they started a 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.920
 also play the live roma all cash game 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.070
 which it seems remained little easier indeed 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.110
 perhaps you Shrunk some hearing 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.090
 why people losing to finish i 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.740
 so basically money is 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.810
 become more closed but I believe there is 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.970
 still very much value in playing 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.310
 definitely live cash game rather than 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.000
 online that now the level is sacred and if 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.280
 you are not an at least winning grinder on 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.350
 others say so we can define 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.880
 red card and I think it is not convenient 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.979
 already profitable to play in my opinion 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.420
 still you can play very well indeed 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.650
 no me when i go to travel 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.520
 game e 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.979
 lately I've done profit 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.180
 I'm glad I did n't find many 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.570
 many difficulties are some regular 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.840
 but in the end it can be useful 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.600
 they were good at regular cash 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.710
 game live as you know there are many more 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.080
 expenses because staying in hotels state 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.930
 a round planes show you a lot 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.379
 however expensive in the end in my opinion 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.709
 you can you can live live cash games then 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.170
 it depends I told you it depends sometimes on that 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.989
 circuits one presents ie at the end if 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.909
 go and take advantage of it in ept according to me 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.670
 there is not much profit raised at times 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:38.069
 I say barcelona then there were 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.719
 lots of tables, for example 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.939
 stretch they said was very hard and 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.510
 I have not been remain so it depends on a 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.510
 in other words
