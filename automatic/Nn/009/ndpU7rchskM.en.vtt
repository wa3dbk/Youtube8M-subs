00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:03.410
 and so hello everyone 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.740
 Viktor Ruban Spring 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.429
 by decree 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.909
 I reviewed heaps online up 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:12.569
 and 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:15.119
 saw how many students communicate 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.119
 what options exactly with a lawyer 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.539
 how would not repeat those words that are there 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.849
 said mongush erica pyramids and another 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.419
 if you look there 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.669
 UAH belly and clamped with this form 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.589
 program will certainly allow 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:31.789
 be this fate 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.280
 but don't just need that reactor 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.450
 In general, I decided that there is both my own and 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.960
 open some people in the eyes and even 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.300
 gn some layers welding 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.680
 in general, it's already pretty normal 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.000
 yo fund australia i 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.730
 however, some things such as 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.970
 let's say 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.170
 tons of shooting hovo two bullets 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 professor patron the farther he 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.410
 the Bolsheviks when and who no goal 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.210
 boost first 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.900
 and if the second one cartridge 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.900
 short with a gun here let's say attacks 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.260
 dollars a year both about 4 5 patron it 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.100
 about the same 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.729
 simple white foam large assortment 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.610
 romantic between the first and second patron 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.020
 in the video, it will look something like 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.820
 ordinary house as usual gave 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.710
 agreed not well what 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.940
 I offer you 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.610
 so for example as well as helicopters shoot but 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.030
 because no one of course we absolutely 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.950
 to another 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.260
 now he has shown willingness to farther 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.420
 distances 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.840
 shoot the songs you only need to head 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.799
 but it did not even happen but nobody 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.380
 almost always goal 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.740
 and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.180
 it is often said that there is no return 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.939
 because it is really a problem 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.610
 less tass 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.570
 than we when just dates 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.830
 click on two patricio patrons 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.950
 more returns 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.000
 he is 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.870
 I offer you Tuesday center by the way 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.640
 even weird even better than us at night 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.640
 I like the act of terrorism more 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.329
 Especially this long distance applies 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.059
 need to of course make a small stop 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:16.879
 because more 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.959
 four rounds needed 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.329
 there is a big jerk up 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.309
 but over long distances it 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.469
 perhaps the best reception which 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.889
 can be used styling 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.949
 because when the second third 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.949
 economic policy 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.939
 conflict 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.939
 but already companies that can still 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.169
 say about acad 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:43.259
 generally 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.219
 if also arrogant run 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.339
 and shoot names 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:49.509
 in the attack but she allowed about 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.509
 pistol analytics in general 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.889
 because it is true 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.929
 like this 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.229
 that is, time 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.109
 and departs 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.169
 do the same streltsova with 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.649
 the Kremlin 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:06.959
 yes dollars 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.569
 you yourself then in the example on the note even 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.149
 selective manat 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.999
 I do not regret when I choose and give two 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.999
 patron children generally up win 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:21.839
 than let's say that's how I got out 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.759
 because sometimes 1 3 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.759
 schoolchildren certainly pissed off 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:30.569
 alley 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.849
 many are not available to everyone there is a good 30 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:34.579
 days 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.879
 but on an invalid clone 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.889
 recall the first goal of the president 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.309
 wherever he fell as if 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:44.229
 I did not stop repeating the same 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.559
 money through the bank 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.829
 don't know there 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.959
 and so in general you can close the closest 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:52.849
 but 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.629
 pressing need to set goals topology 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.439
 Korean permissible 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.079
 exchange price on the first two patrons 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.669
 it is clear that the passengers who he 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.699
 I translate the scope in a month that is 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.699
 like that 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.120
 if I'm on the flight point but it's all body 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.930
 another called me 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.789
 most of 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.699
 the same as advisors for distant 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.829
 distances if 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.900
 omitting the news for example pressure head 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.770
 no encephalitis level 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.770
 tons but one cartridge will not fall 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:28.389
 in front 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.889
 that is, if 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.310
 Sergey eeS operator is right and left 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.969
 shooting you two rounds 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:36.490
 they get lost 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.189
 any possibilities 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:40.809
 because going out exactly there 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:42.939
 a strong blizzard of bullets certainly 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.939
 he will have a plus 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.320
 in the center of the capital of Tatarstan will be 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.610
 put up 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.430
 ibid 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.809
 on the fan 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:56.919
 but he is valuable china shoot easier if 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.849
 you still pay UAH 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.849
 better than 400 potter enterprises 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.349
 he should go on hands 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.550
 this is generally a great way to shoot 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.800
 and in principle it is real 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.289
 you will be talking at least two more to one 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.360
 in general, he is such a conclusion 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.430
 until 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.449
 I hope someone bad 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.520
 Kiev team did not help 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.020
 because it can only soon 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.610
 naturally 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.580
 but in general such are the cases 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.800
 schoolchildren additionally 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.809
 put something to your 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:38.780
 so I'm not my business 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.020
 the main goal thanks
