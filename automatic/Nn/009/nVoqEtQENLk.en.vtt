00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
all right so unfortunately this isn't

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.850

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
the new mac mini words I could just grab

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.580 
the new mac mini words I could just grab
an<00:01:28.010> hdmi<00:01:28.369> cable<00:01:28.780> plug<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:29.900> in<00:01:30.020> plug<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:30.470> into

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
an hdmi cable plug it in plug it into

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.530 
an hdmi cable plug it in plug it into
the<00:01:30.710> TV<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.280> you're<00:01:31.490> done<00:01:31.670> with<00:01:31.970> audio<00:01:32.299> and

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
the TV and you're done with audio and

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.780 
the TV and you're done with audio and
video<00:01:33.760> but<00:01:34.760> this<00:01:34.970> is<00:01:35.119> an<00:01:35.240> old<00:01:35.390> 2006<00:01:36.170> one<00:01:36.350> so

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
video but this is an old 2006 one so

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.890 
video but this is an old 2006 one so
what<00:01:37.790> we<00:01:37.880> got<00:01:38.030> for<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.330> is<00:01:38.600> a

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
what we got for that is a

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.020 
what we got for that is a
three-and-a-half<00:01:39.590> millimeter<00:01:39.860> jack<00:01:40.100> that

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
three-and-a-half millimeter jack that

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.230 
three-and-a-half millimeter jack that
converts<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.720> audio<00:01:42.080> into<00:01:42.470> left<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:42.890> right

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
converts the audio into left and right

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.530 
converts the audio into left and right
so<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.270> plug<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:44.659> in<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:46.270> we<00:01:47.270> hope<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:47.420> is

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
so I plug that in and we hope this is

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.000 
so I plug that in and we hope this is
about<00:01:47.720> 15<00:01:48.170> bucks<00:01:48.350> although<00:01:48.710> i'm<00:01:48.799> sure<00:01:48.830> you

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
about 15 bucks although i'm sure you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.289 
about 15 bucks although i'm sure you
could<00:01:49.100> probably<00:01:49.310> find<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:49.700> cheaper<00:01:50.090> if<00:01:50.270> you

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
could probably find it cheaper if you

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.929 
could probably find it cheaper if you
look<00:01:50.659> hard<00:01:50.960> enough<00:01:51.080> then<00:01:52.070> we<00:01:52.159> have<00:01:52.250> this<00:01:52.520> which

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
look hard enough then we have this which

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.289 
look hard enough then we have this which
is<00:01:53.270> apple's<00:01:54.049> little<00:01:54.490> first<00:01:55.490> party<00:01:55.880> video

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
is apple's little first party video

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.880 
is apple's little first party video
adapter<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:56.990> they<00:01:57.080> have<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.229> bunch<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.740> these

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
adapter and they have a bunch of these

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.600 
adapter and they have a bunch of these
but<00:01:58.070> this<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:58.369> DVI<00:01:59.180> to<00:01:59.650> VGA<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:00.740> s-video<00:02:01.189> and

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
but this is DVI to VGA and s-video and

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.990 
but this is DVI to VGA and s-video and
this<00:02:02.330> is<00:02:02.420> 20<00:02:02.689> bucks<00:02:03.549> so<00:02:04.549> we'll<00:02:04.700> just<00:02:04.850> pop<00:02:04.970> that

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
this is 20 bucks so we'll just pop that

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.920 
this is 20 bucks so we'll just pop that
into<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:05.479> DB

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
into the DB

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.650 
into the DB
so<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.920> reason<00:02:07.070> why<00:02:07.340> we<00:02:07.550> need<00:02:07.730> both<00:02:08.330> is

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
so the reason why we need both is

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.580 
so the reason why we need both is
because<00:02:09.259> DVI<00:02:10.160> only<00:02:10.490> has<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.960> video<00:02:11.960> it<00:02:12.440> only

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
because DVI only has a video it only

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.530 
because DVI only has a video it only
carries<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.040> video<00:02:13.250> signal<00:02:13.460> and<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.270> we<00:02:14.390> need

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
carries the video signal and so we need

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.830 
carries the video signal and so we need
to<00:02:14.810> plug<00:02:15.410> in<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.590> audio<00:02:15.860> as<00:02:15.980> well<00:02:16.600> in<00:02:17.600> addition

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
to plug in the audio as well in addition

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.600 
to plug in the audio as well in addition
to<00:02:18.050> that<00:02:18.260> you're<00:02:18.470> going<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.650> need<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.860> find<00:02:19.370> a

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
to that you're going to need to find a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.320 
to that you're going to need to find a
vga<00:02:20.570> cable<00:02:21.070> although<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.580> only<00:02:22.610> need<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.000> have

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
vga cable although you only need to have

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.350 
vga cable although you only need to have
the<00:02:23.660> yellow<00:02:24.520> because<00:02:25.520> we<00:02:25.640> already<00:02:25.760> have<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
the yellow because we already have the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.680 
the yellow because we already have the
audio<00:02:26.720> cables<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:29.000> just<00:02:29.270> plug<00:02:29.450> in<00:02:29.570> the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
audio cables and so I just plug in the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.460 
audio cables and so I just plug in the
video<00:02:31.120> then<00:02:32.120> you've<00:02:32.480> got<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.810> audio<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.440> the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
video then you've got the audio and the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:48.580 
video then you've got the audio and the
video<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.280> can<00:02:34.310> plug<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:40.280> works<00:02:47.590> for

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
video that you can plug in it works for

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.250 
video that you can plug in it works for
about<00:02:48.890> for<00:02:49.670> about<00:02:49.880> 40<00:02:50.270> bucks<00:02:50.300> depending<00:02:50.840> on

how you do it we're done alright so

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.420 
how you do it we're done alright so
before<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.500> get<00:02:57.650> going<00:02:57.680> as<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> media<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:58.340> if

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
before you get going as a media so if

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.560 
before you get going as a media so if
there<00:02:58.580> are<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.700> few<00:02:58.850> things<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.180> need<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.360> do

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
there are a few things you need to do

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.930 
there are a few things you need to do
first<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.530> all<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:00.650> setting<00:03:01.400> up<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.670> highest

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
first of all just setting up the highest

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.520 
first of all just setting up the highest
resolution<00:03:02.120> possible<00:03:02.450> now<00:03:02.930> this<00:03:03.110> isn't<00:03:03.260> HD

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
resolution possible now this isn't HD

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.120 
resolution possible now this isn't HD
and<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.550> can't<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.360> HD<00:03:05.989> with<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.770> vga

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
and and you can't have HD with the vga

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.940 
and and you can't have HD with the vga
yellow<00:03:07.580> video<00:03:07.940> signal<00:03:08.709> but<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:10.010> can<00:03:10.400> look<00:03:10.549> okay

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
yellow video signal but it can look okay

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.949 
yellow video signal but it can look okay
and<00:03:12.950> then<00:03:13.310> one<00:03:13.640> other<00:03:14.150> thing<00:03:14.390> that<00:03:14.420> would<00:03:14.840> be

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
and then one other thing that would be

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.090 
and then one other thing that would be
nice<00:03:15.110> is<00:03:15.290> if<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.500> just<00:03:15.530> set<00:03:15.830> it<00:03:15.860> up<00:03:16.010> to

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
nice is if you just set it up to

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.160 
nice is if you just set it up to
automatically<00:03:16.700> log<00:03:16.820> in<00:03:17.239> that<00:03:17.870> way<00:03:17.989> all<00:03:18.110> you

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
automatically log in that way all you

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.570 
automatically log in that way all you
have<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.320> do<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:18.470> turn<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.769> on<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.010> then<00:03:19.070> you

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
have to do is turn it on and then you

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.130 
have to do is turn it on and then you
have<00:03:19.700> your<00:03:19.730> media<00:03:20.120> ready<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.450> go<00:03:20.630> one<00:03:21.019> other

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
have your media ready to go one other

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.800 
have your media ready to go one other
thing<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.560> would<00:03:21.620> also<00:03:21.769> recommend<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.810> clearing

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
thing I would also recommend is clearing

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.360 
thing I would also recommend is clearing
up<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:23.959> hard<00:03:24.230> drive<00:03:24.440> you've<00:03:25.010> got<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.190> lot<00:03:25.340> of

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
up the hard drive you've got a lot of

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.670 
up the hard drive you've got a lot of
unnecessary<00:03:25.730> files<00:03:26.299> that<00:03:27.170> are<00:03:27.380> probably

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
unnecessary files that are probably

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.990 
unnecessary files that are probably
there<00:03:27.890> like<00:03:28.190> documents<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.850> old

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
there like documents and old

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.330 
there like documents and old
applications<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.870> stuff<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:31.280> should

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
applications and stuff and so you should

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.850 
applications and stuff and so you should
probably<00:03:31.790> just<00:03:32.200> again<00:03:33.200> also<00:03:33.560> concerning

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
probably just again also concerning

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.610 
probably just again also concerning
since<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.549> my<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.360> mini<00:03:35.570> is<00:03:35.810> has<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.290> smaller

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
since the my the mini is has a smaller

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.710 
since the my the mini is has a smaller
80<00:03:36.950> gig<00:03:37.220> hard<00:03:37.459> drive<00:03:37.549> which<00:03:37.970> was<00:03:38.209> sufficient

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
80 gig hard drive which was sufficient

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.600 
80 gig hard drive which was sufficient
for<00:03:38.959> years<00:03:39.650> ago<00:03:41.140> you're<00:03:42.140> just<00:03:42.489> deleting<00:03:43.489> all

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
for years ago you're just deleting all

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.860 
for years ago you're just deleting all
the<00:03:43.730> extra<00:03:44.090> stuff<00:03:44.120> that<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:44.450> don't<00:03:44.630> need

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
the extra stuff that you don't need

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.979 
the extra stuff that you don't need
would<00:03:45.530> be<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:46.130> bonus<00:03:46.580> plus<00:03:47.090> that<00:03:47.450> way<00:03:47.600> you<00:03:47.660> can

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
would be a bonus plus that way you can

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.199 
would be a bonus plus that way you can
fit<00:03:48.500> more<00:03:48.680> on<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.950> hard<00:03:49.100> drive<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.579> you<00:03:50.060> could

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
fit more on the hard drive and you could

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.240 
fit more on the hard drive and you could
just<00:03:50.390> go<00:03:50.840> out<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.200> like<00:03:51.380> best<00:03:51.620> buy<00:03:51.799> or<00:03:52.040> target

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
just go out to like best buy or target

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.030 
just go out to like best buy or target
or<00:03:52.579> staples<00:03:53.120> or<00:03:53.269> some<00:03:53.510> text<00:03:54.200> or<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.890> could

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
or staples or some text or and you could

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.460 
or staples or some text or and you could
get<00:03:55.190> like<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.340> one<00:03:55.610> terabyte<00:03:55.940> external<00:03:56.470> hard

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
get like a one terabyte external hard

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.430 
get like a one terabyte external hard
drive<00:03:57.650> for<00:03:57.799> probably<00:03:58.100> like<00:03:58.220> 80<00:03:58.489> or<00:03:58.670> 90<00:03:58.850> bucks

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
drive for probably like 80 or 90 bucks

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.069 
drive for probably like 80 or 90 bucks
not<00:04:00.440> necessary<00:04:00.980> but<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.630> terabyte<00:04:02.630> goes<00:04:02.840> a<00:04:02.870> long

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
not necessary but a terabyte goes a long

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.380 
not necessary but a terabyte goes a long
way<00:04:03.459> so<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:04.610> it's<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:04.790> lot<00:04:04.910> more<00:04:04.970> future<00:04:05.360> proof

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
way so and it's a lot more future proof

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.320 
way so and it's a lot more future proof
than<00:04:05.690> just<00:04:05.900> 80<00:04:06.079> gigabytes
