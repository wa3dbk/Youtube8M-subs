that<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> position<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.210> completely

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that the position was completely

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.100 
that the position was completely
unsalvageable<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.420> that's<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> anyway<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
unsalvageable so that's it anyway a

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.170 
unsalvageable so that's it anyway a
great<00:01:28.470> game<00:01:28.710> from<00:01:28.950> Magnus<00:01:29.400> who<00:01:29.579> proved<00:01:29.880> he's

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
still a force to be reckoned with even

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.819

when<00:01:32.220> he's<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:32.549> well<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.930> win<00:01:34.200> puts<00:01:34.439> him<00:01:34.680> in

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
when he's not well this win puts him in

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
five points each tomorrow is the last

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.719 
five points each tomorrow is the last
round<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.439> sure<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.979> great<00:01:53.280> finish

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
round and it's sure to be a great finish

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.670 
round and it's sure to be a great finish
as<00:01:53.939> Evan<00:01:54.479> Chuck<00:01:54.720> has<00:01:54.930> got<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> white<00:01:55.439> pieces

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
as Evan Chuck has got the white pieces

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.580 
as Evan Chuck has got the white pieces
against<00:01:56.460> Kramnik<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.630> game<00:01:57.869> could<00:01:58.170> decide

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
against Kramnik so the game could decide

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.280 
against Kramnik so the game could decide
the<00:01:58.920> winner<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> entire<00:01:59.579> tournament<00:02:00.290> this

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the winner of the entire tournament this

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.289 
the winner of the entire tournament this
she<00:02:01.530> may<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> harder<00:02:02.700> time<00:02:02.729> finishing

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
she may have a harder time finishing

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.350 
she may have a harder time finishing
well<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:04.320> he's<00:02:04.469> got<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> black<00:02:04.920> pieces

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
well because he's got the black pieces

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.660 
well because he's got the black pieces
against<00:02:06.360> Aronian

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
against Aronian

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.449 
against Aronian
so<00:02:08.569> we'll<00:02:08.720> see<00:02:08.869> how<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.020> goes<00:02:09.140> anyway<00:02:09.740> we've

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
so we'll see how it goes anyway we've

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.070 
so we'll see how it goes anyway we've
got<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.610> bit<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:10.849> time<00:02:11.000> left<00:02:11.060> now<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:11.900> may<00:02:12.050> as

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
got a bit of time left now so it may as

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.480 
got a bit of time left now so it may as
well<00:02:12.349> replay<00:02:13.069> this<00:02:13.310> game

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.370 

so<00:02:20.180> yeah<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.630> was<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> night<00:02:21.590> off<00:02:22.030> Sicilian

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.410 
so yeah it was a night off Sicilian
which<00:02:24.380> is<00:02:24.680> one<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.490> sharpest<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.270> most

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420
