00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.830
 as well 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.770
 do not 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.590
 it's very good 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.110
 and at 800 watts of power from 15 to 19 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.110
 of 15,000 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.750
 I always turn it on 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.240
 to make a cake of photographs and 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.140
 she does not know anything 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.140
 as fiber 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.230
 and add 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.280
 when people 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.520
 an average of eating it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.520
 Water 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.569
 very rich 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.140
 all right 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.460
 I do not know what to say 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.910
 good if placed well where 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.910
 function 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
 but 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.890
 but 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.930
 as processed foods 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.580
 ah 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.010
 and here has that use too 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.010
 if it is not placed well it does not work israel 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.730
 and that's for this straw 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.269
 how much does it cost to know 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.690
 but as if you were pulling them already 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.600
 you can not remove them 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.430
 already here I will go down 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.720
 that is well set since as 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.810
 we are seeing 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.440
 if it is not placed well in the other the best 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.440
 does not start 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.910
 in the case you want to make a vision 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.490
 static to the place that comes from a 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.940
 seen to give a perfect cut or 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.940
 if low 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.460
 here the secret so that everything comes out very 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.500
 beautiful 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.500
 so well placed 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.830
 topic 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.830
 Yeah come on 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.470
 says that the shells are all the 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.470
 food and new 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:07.400
 no no no 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.400
 regularly 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.270
 fair 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.960
 ah 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.230
 it's very fast 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.730
 decides that if I have it here I let 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.740
 make me so much movement is going to give 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.450
 perfect slice when the memory and ccoo 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.020
 local small came out a few parts 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.020
 thinner 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.650
 it is important that you place yourself not 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.650
 stay with a lot of movement for the night 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.189
 the conversation 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.169
 do not 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.450
 but they come here to give a 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.210
 Perfect cut has to be fine 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:27.170
 tightened so that the blade of the 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.170
 grease 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.200
 but no 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.940
 when they cooled off by casting the aids 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.230
 to others and can make a cut 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.230
 simply for you 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.880
 is the one that grows the other 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:26.439
 surely this we remove the leaves 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:29.610
 so that in the whole sheet but the other 

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:29.610
 for those books that give you 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.690
 and you are seeing that 

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:45.890
 and they already take up the list for the 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.890
 I'm here tonight 

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.420
 to throw it as they did
