00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
a fawn male as well and you can see

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.750 
a fawn male as well and you can see
pretty<00:02:18.870> much<00:02:19.140> all<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.650> them<00:02:19.770> have<00:02:20.040> some<00:02:20.400> type

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
pretty much all of them have some type

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.760 
pretty much all of them have some type
of<00:02:20.790> tankiness<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.500> was<00:02:22.590> really

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
of tankiness and that was really

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.400 
of tankiness and that was really
annoying<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.660> see<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.840> their<00:02:25.170> rise

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
annoying and you can see that their rise

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.990 
annoying and you can see that their rise
did<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.890> most<00:02:26.160> kills<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:28.310> each<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.970> know

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
did the most kills and each you know

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.780 
did the most kills and each you know
free<00:02:30.450> farming<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.190> we<00:02:32.190> can't<00:02:32.400> really<00:02:32.580> do<00:02:32.760> much

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
free farming and we can't really do much

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.820 
free farming and we can't really do much
but<00:02:33.240> because<00:02:33.570> we<00:02:33.720> had<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.840> stick<00:02:34.260> around<00:02:34.290> we

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
but because we had to stick around we

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.770 
but because we had to stick around we
got<00:02:34.950> some<00:02:35.130> really<00:02:35.250> good<00:02:35.400> kills<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.000> obviously

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
got some really good kills and obviously

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.360 
got some really good kills and obviously
we<00:02:36.870> didn't<00:02:37.050> get<00:02:37.110> any<00:02:37.260> gangs<00:02:37.470> from<00:02:37.590> twitch<00:02:37.950> no

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
we didn't get any gangs from twitch no

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.400 
we didn't get any gangs from twitch no
not<00:02:38.520> all<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.910> he<00:02:39.420> was<00:02:39.600> spending<00:02:39.960> most<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.320> his

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
not all and he was spending most of his

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.950 
not all and he was spending most of his
time<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.860> mid<00:02:41.160> trying<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.880> defend<00:02:42.270> against

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
time in the mid trying to defend against

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.470 
time in the mid trying to defend against
and<00:02:43.340> rise<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:44.640> then<00:02:44.820> going<00:02:45.060> back<00:02:45.210> into<00:02:45.390> the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
and rise but then going back into the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.590 
and rise but then going back into the
jungle<00:02:46.460> so<00:02:47.460> I<00:02:47.760> think<00:02:48.060> if<00:02:48.180> he<00:02:48.270> was<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.420> better

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
jungle so I think if he was a better

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.830 
jungle so I think if he was a better
player<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.520> stayed<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.760> mid<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.630> to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
player and stayed in the mid just to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.110 
player and stayed in the mid just to
deny<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.350> rise<00:02:52.740> all<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.310> free<00:02:53.550> farm<00:02:53.880> it

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
deny you rise all that free farm it

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.090 
deny you rise all that free farm it

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
good a laning phase was how good our

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.170 
good a laning phase was how good our
team<00:03:14.820> conf<00:03:15.150> was<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:16.020> some<00:03:16.260> extent<00:03:16.940> we<00:03:17.940> still

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
team conf was to some extent we still

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.640 
team conf was to some extent we still
could<00:03:18.420> not<00:03:18.450> win<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.140> reason<00:03:19.320> for<00:03:19.530> that

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
could not win and the reason for that

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.730 
could not win and the reason for that
was<00:03:19.770> simply<00:03:20.340> because<00:03:20.640> people<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:22.350> left<00:03:22.560> the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
was simply because people just left the

really<00:03:57.060> cool<00:03:57.420> actually<00:03:59.180> but<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.209> mean<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:00.750> is

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
really cool actually but I mean this is

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.250 
really cool actually but I mean this is
the<00:04:01.200> topic<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.530> want<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.800> ask<00:04:01.860> you<00:04:02.010> guys<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:03.260> do

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
the topic I want to ask you guys and do

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.400 
the topic I want to ask you guys and do
you<00:04:04.350> think<00:04:04.380> that<00:04:05.840> something<00:04:06.840> has<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:07.260> be<00:04:07.380> done

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
you think that something has to be done

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.120 
you think that something has to be done
and<00:04:07.770> what<00:04:08.010> could<00:04:08.280> be<00:04:08.340> done<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:10.680> combat

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
and what could be done and to combat

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.110 
and what could be done and to combat
this<00:04:11.310> because<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:13.050> happens<00:04:13.739> every<00:04:14.489> single<00:04:14.700> day

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
this because it happens every single day

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.690 
this because it happens every single day
and<00:04:15.420> today<00:04:16.049> alone<00:04:16.380> I've<00:04:16.650> played<00:04:16.890> about<00:04:17.070> 13

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
and today alone I've played about 13

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
and today alone I've played about 13
games<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.739> I'd<00:04:19.739> say<00:04:19.950> about<00:04:19.980> 10<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:20.790> then<00:04:21.210> 13

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
games and I'd say about 10 and then 13

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.700 
games and I'd say about 10 and then 13
games<00:04:22.020> someone<00:04:22.770> has<00:04:23.280> AF<00:04:23.580> kid<00:04:23.850> or<00:04:24.090> left<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:25.110> it

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
games someone has AF kid or left and it

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.780 
games someone has AF kid or left and it
seems<00:04:25.950> even<00:04:26.250> if<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.400> report

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
seems even if you report

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.420 
seems even if you report
nothing<00:04:27.600> really<00:04:28.110> seems<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.770> happen<00:04:28.980> which<00:04:29.400> is

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
nothing really seems to happen which is

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.050 
nothing really seems to happen which is
really<00:04:29.910> really<00:04:30.090> annoying<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:31.820> think<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.940> way

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
really really annoying I think the way

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.210 
really really annoying I think the way
to<00:04:33.120> come<00:04:33.450> by<00:04:33.600> it<00:04:33.660> really<00:04:34.170> Oh<00:04:34.350> realistically

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
to come by it really Oh realistically

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.570 
to come by it really Oh realistically
would<00:04:35.610> be<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.590> stop<00:04:37.590> them<00:04:37.830> from<00:04:37.860> actually

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
would be to stop them from actually

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.670 
would be to stop them from actually
joining<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.420> game<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.870> have<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.140> confirmation
