why<00:00:54.000> don't<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.300> join<00:00:54.540> me<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> boardroom

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
why don't you join me in the boardroom

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.110 
why don't you join me in the boardroom
you<00:00:55.380> could<00:00:55.560> even<00:00:55.800> deliver<00:00:56.460> my<00:00:56.610> address<00:00:56.880> if

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
you could even deliver my address if

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.510 
you could even deliver my address if
you'd<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.450> to<00:00:57.630> oh<00:00:57.750> no<00:00:58.200> sir<00:00:58.559> I'll<00:00:59.040> be<00:00:59.190> happy<00:00:59.399> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
tag along but I think the board needs to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.369 
tag along but I think the board needs to
hear<00:01:01.350> about<00:01:01.440> BPM<00:01:01.950> from<00:01:02.190> someone<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:02.610> your

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.440 

that<00:02:08.130> was<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.370> close<00:02:09.030> one

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that was a close one

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.240 
that was a close one
I<00:02:09.480> gotta<00:02:09.750> tell<00:02:09.960> you<00:02:10.050> until<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.710> pulled<00:02:10.980> out<00:02:11.100> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
I gotta tell you until I pulled out the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.920 
I gotta tell you until I pulled out the
old<00:02:11.310> Fink<00:02:11.820> alarm<00:02:12.090> ruse<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.480> really<00:02:12.690> thought<00:02:12.810> it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
old Fink alarm ruse I really thought it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.750 
old Fink alarm ruse I really thought it
was<00:02:12.990> in<00:02:13.110> trouble<00:02:13.230> there<00:02:13.500> but<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.340> think<00:02:14.670> they

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
was in trouble there but I think they

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.760 
was in trouble there but I think they
all<00:02:14.880> got<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> message<00:02:15.390> yep<00:02:15.960> this<00:02:16.080> old<00:02:16.290> BPM

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
all got the message yep this old BPM

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.530 
all got the message yep this old BPM
technology<00:02:17.400> thing<00:02:17.700> will<00:02:17.880> probably<00:02:17.970> just<00:02:18.330> blow

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
technology thing will probably just blow

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.210 
technology thing will probably just blow

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
panacea it's not going to suddenly make

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.140 
panacea it's not going to suddenly make
everything<00:03:38.500> all<00:03:38.770> better<00:03:38.800> but<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.760> will<00:03:39.880> show

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
everything all better but it will show

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.550 
everything all better but it will show
you<00:03:40.209> that<00:03:40.450> it<00:03:40.570> is<00:03:40.600> possible<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.200> learn<00:03:41.380> about

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
you that it is possible to learn about

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
truth sir and that's half the battle but

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.830 
truth sir and that's half the battle but
it's<00:03:47.650> like<00:03:47.800> 65<00:03:48.280> pages<00:03:48.700> long<00:03:48.940> breathe<00:03:49.480> head

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
it's like 65 pages long breathe head

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.930

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.910 
just breathe we're going to get through
this<00:03:52.090> together<00:03:52.270> it<00:03:52.989> will<00:03:53.110> be<00:03:53.170> an<00:03:53.350> investment

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
this together it will be an investment

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.920 
this together it will be an investment
but<00:03:54.400> in<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.610> end<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:55.209> will<00:03:55.300> be<00:03:55.450> better<00:03:55.600> for<00:03:55.870> it

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
but in the end you will be better for it
