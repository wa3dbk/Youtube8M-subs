00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.330 
is down right unbelievable and it's
called<00:00:14.880> content-aware<00:00:15.599> scaling<00:00:16.410> now<00:00:16.949> we<00:00:17.010> all

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
called content-aware scaling now we all

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.420 
called content-aware scaling now we all
remember<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.240> old<00:00:18.510> days<00:00:18.810> when<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.800> scaled<00:00:20.220> an

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
remember the old days when you scaled an

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.609 
remember the old days when you scaled an
image<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.060> see<00:00:21.300> here<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.470> would

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
image as you see here and it would

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.990 
image as you see here and it would
squeeze<00:00:23.130> everything<00:00:24.119> down<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:25.289> like<00:00:25.410> this

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
squeeze everything down just like this

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.009 
squeeze everything down just like this
that's<00:00:27.000> no<00:00:27.359> good<00:00:27.800> welcome<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.250> future

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the areas of the grass so what's going

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.350 
the areas of the grass so what's going
on<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.670> take<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.909> look<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.210> this

the areas between the golfers and

the areas between the golfers and
squeezes<00:01:23.220> those<00:01:23.460> areas<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.390> protects<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
golfers and if I do a vertical scale it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
golfers and if I do a vertical scale it

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
of course looks at the sky first and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.149 
of course looks at the sky first and
then<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.990> moves<00:01:31.200> down<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> grass<00:01:31.890> and

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
then it moves down to the grass and

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.450 
then it moves down to the grass and
again<00:01:32.490> protecting<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> golfers<00:01:33.740> now<00:01:34.740> when

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
squeezing the image and then slowly

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.080 
squeezing the image and then slowly
moving<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.860> start<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.190> blend<00:02:11.610> in

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
