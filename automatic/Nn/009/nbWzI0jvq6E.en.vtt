chiropractor and so I've received a lot

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.230 
chiropractor and so I've received a lot
of<00:00:26.170> chiropractic<00:00:26.800> work<00:00:27.010> and<00:00:27.310> care<00:00:27.520> throughout

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
of chiropractic work and care throughout

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.359 
of chiropractic work and care throughout
the<00:00:28.420> years<00:00:28.660> growing<00:00:29.020> up<00:00:29.170> and<00:00:29.710> wake<00:00:29.980> up<00:00:30.160> in<00:00:30.279> the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
the years growing up and wake up in the

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.149 
the years growing up and wake up in the
morning<00:00:30.730> and<00:00:31.090> adjusted<00:00:32.079> myself<00:00:32.439> crack<00:00:32.949> it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:33.159 
morning and adjusted myself crack it

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:35.639 
morning and adjusted myself crack it
because<00:00:33.550> it<00:00:34.420> would<00:00:34.539> get<00:00:34.690> so<00:00:34.870> tight<00:00:35.140> and<00:00:35.170> stiff

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
because it would get so tight and stiff

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.169 
because it would get so tight and stiff
and<00:00:35.949> I<00:00:36.159> would<00:00:36.309> have<00:00:36.429> to<00:00:36.579> release<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:36.999> pressure

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:37.179 
and I would have to release the pressure

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:40.200 
and I would have to release the pressure
and<00:00:37.719> so<00:00:38.229> I<00:00:38.649> would<00:00:38.710> end<00:00:39.129> up<00:00:39.370> adjusting<00:00:40.120> it

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
and so I would end up adjusting it

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.889 
and so I would end up adjusting it
myself<00:00:40.600> about<00:00:41.339> six<00:00:42.339> or<00:00:42.489> seven<00:00:42.670> times<00:00:42.850> a<00:00:43.149> day<00:00:43.300> on

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
myself about six or seven times a day on

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.719 
myself about six or seven times a day on
an<00:00:44.050> average<00:00:44.170> day<00:00:44.379> just<00:00:45.309> to<00:00:45.399> release<00:00:45.639> the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
an average day just to release the

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.189 
an average day just to release the
pressure<00:00:45.909> and<00:00:46.269> so<00:00:46.479> I<00:00:46.510> be<00:00:46.719> able<00:00:46.870> to<00:00:46.960> move<00:00:47.050> my

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
pressure and so I be able to move my

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.590 
pressure and so I be able to move my
neck<00:00:47.260> my<00:00:48.100> experience<00:00:48.699> with<00:00:48.969> functional
