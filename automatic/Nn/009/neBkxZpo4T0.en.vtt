00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:09.213
 Hello everyone, today brings you a video on how to use the shift key. 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:15.619
 So today we will explain the shift from basic to advanced. 

00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:19.734
 First let's take a look at the basic application of the shift key. 

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:25.928
 If you are a new gamer, start with the basics. 

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:29.132
 We will talk about its advanced applications later. 

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:34.331
 But before we start, let's talk about the usual ideas (hold shift when using mobile commands and/or skills/equipment) 

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.115
 Basically when you hold down shift 

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:39.332
 All the behavior you do will be sorted 

00:00:39.582 --> 00:00:47.950
 You can use it to do most of what you want to do (it can sort these actions every move will be marked with a green flag) 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.041
 (Let's see how we can use it to make an advantage) 

00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:56.581
 Let's take an example of a frequently used and useful example. 

00:00:56.756 --> 00:01:01.920
 Holding down shift while moving will not cause the transmission to abort unexpectedly 

00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:05.979
 But will move as soon as the transfer is complete 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.723
 It can also be used to pick up the Rune (the same principle is used when capturing the Rune) 

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:13.543
 So after moving to the rune you will move again without any delay. 

00:01:14.544 --> 00:01:23.352
 (Tell the messenger to take the bottle and hold down shift and use Q and E) 

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:31.675
 If you don't say some skill combinations that shift often uses, then you can't say that you are a shift strategy. 

00:01:31.828 --> 00:01:34.011
 For example, Sha Wang uses a jump knife. 

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:36.669
 In fact it is easy to use and very efficient 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.181
 Then I will talk about the basics here. 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.781
 Once you practice for a while, you will be very comfortable with it. 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.410
 Now we are moving to the advanced version of the second unit. 

00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:55.288
 You can use the shift key to help you shop (hold the shift key to set the move command twice so your hero can enter the store area and leave quickly) 

00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:57.664
 Especially in the sidewalk stores and mystery shops (once you enter the area you have to use the quick purchase to buy equipment) 

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:02.850
 This way, after entering the store, after purchasing the equipment, you can leave immediately. 

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:06.321
 This is the right time, but it is really useful. 

00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:14.857
 Here I will quickly give two examples. In this way, you can quickly find things to buy (using different space areas of the store to make purchases faster) 

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:25.826
 This example needs to be practiced before you play the game (shift-eat tree + move command can quickly pass through the woods) 

00:02:25.963 --> 00:02:31.192
 But it's really effective and it can scare the opponent and also allows you to effectively avoid the opponent. 

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:39.882
 (Using shift to match your understanding of the map can be better to dodge/chasing.) This example is similar to the previous example. It can make you more flexible on the map. 

00:02:40.078 --> 00:02:42.586
 You can also use this, but this issue is not a video that teaches you to avoid. 

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:45.357
 So more things need to be discovered by yourself. 

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:51.360
 Ok, GANK is really painful, but at least it proves that it is a good idea to use shift+ after the end of the singing skills. 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:03:02.999
 Here, after using the dismemberment, shift+ command immediately so that my hero starts chasing the enemy immediately after dismembering the skill so the enemy has no chance to escape my palm. 

00:03:05.494 --> 00:03:10.340
 Shift can be used in many situations, so use it creatively 

00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:27.353
 (Shifting a skill from the spring, almost perfect harassment / patching) Some heroes may use the shit transmission method. This is also a humming behavior. 

00:03:27.527 --> 00:03:33.440
 Because you still have a few seconds of base BUFF duration when you transfer from the spring 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.520
 So why not use this feature? 

00:03:42.174 --> 00:03:50.068
 (When using chanting skills, shift+ equipment and skills will be used immediately after singing) They will not cancel the animation, ie they will activate immediately after the TP is finished. 

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:53.025
 In general, goblin tinkers often use this. 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.153
 But you can also use it with any hero 

00:03:55.392 --> 00:04:01.829
 Once you use it very easily, you can use it with any skill or equipment. 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.787
 Did you notice that I finally attacked with a thermal missile? 

00:04:28.982 --> 00:04:33.551
 Because it contains some animation effects and the rocket's role is to cancel the animation (without canceling the animation) 

00:04:33.788 --> 00:04:39.426
 If you want to cancel the animation then you should pay attention to this 

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:48.340
 (Cancel the animation effect) 

00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:53.980
 The last thing to talk about in this video 

00:04:54.118 --> 00:04:59.363
 You can use the Force Staff to help you do this. This is a wonderful thing. 

00:04:59.961 --> 00:05:03.481
 Itâ€™s really hard to use this in a real game. 

00:05:03.623 --> 00:05:07.532
 But if you succeed, it will be quite powerful. 

00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:22.652
 Today's video guide is here. Thanks for watching! Translation: Translated by Vizhi Jiang
