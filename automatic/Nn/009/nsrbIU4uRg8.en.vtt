probably be like the 88 warm and the 88
shimmery<00:05:46.690> combined<00:05:47.110> because<00:05:47.470> they're<00:05:47.620> all

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
shimmery combined because they're all

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.469

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.020 
mania so they're all shimmery and really
really<00:05:52.630> divine<00:05:52.960> colors<00:05:53.430> but<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.580> color<00:05:54.820> range

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
really divine colors but the color range

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.810 
really divine colors but the color range
is<00:05:55.419> a<00:05:55.570> lot<00:05:55.960> warmer<00:05:56.260> than<00:05:56.470> any<00:05:56.979> average<00:05:57.190> palette

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820
