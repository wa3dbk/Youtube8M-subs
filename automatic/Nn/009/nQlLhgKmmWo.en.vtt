00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.130
 I'm recording it seems very good 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.750
 very good guys welcome to the first 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.840
 video tutorial that I do for the channel 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.340
 youtube I'm Juan means that as 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.020
 the third time I try to do the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.970
 tutorial has been this a joke 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.770
 because I just move windows and I do not 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.650
 I did not know and I have become 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.060
 nervous and I think I'm still according to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.879
 aol but anyway we are going to try to do 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.800
 the best possible and I'll show you the 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.050
 first tutorial that is going to be something 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.030
 simple to start and something that I 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.070
 question a lot of people is simply 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
 how to put a black and white photo of 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.370
 agreement there are many ways to put a 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 black and white photo I have mine 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.600
 another will have yours this is like everything in 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.059
 photography there are a thousand ways to do what 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.860
 You defend yourself and each his own I 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.330
 I'm just going to teach the way in 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 that I do it that works for me 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.420
 pretty good to start I'm going to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.299
 explain what people would do when they did not 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.850
 know what I did when I started it would be 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:03.769
 settings 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.540
 and black and white agree then 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.250
 we will have here a to choose by 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.590
 channels and such that a little what we're going to 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.240
 do then 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.520
 but basically we would get a 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.679
 grayscale that does not interest us 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.990
 for nothing here you see that I have before 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:20.530
 everything I've been doing but good 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.970
 We'd better let's start from scratch it 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.440
 black and white settings 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.090
 the problem with this first is 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.310
 which is a black and white that defines us 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.030
 photoshop and second that later if 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.440
 we want more advanced the retouching will return 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.880
 to change something black and white not 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.740
 we can do it directly from the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.310
 black and white layer we will have to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.500
 use other brushes we would already be 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.810
 losing quality in one way or another 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.590
 then we are not interested at all that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.050
 option what we are going to do is duplicate 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.790
 the layer now and we're going to put this 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.670
 black and white adjustment is worth it and we're going 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.290
 to leave here hidden 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.480
 so that later we can compare 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.890
 the black and white that I'm going to show you 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.930
 with the black and white that would make you 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.500
 photoshop in agreement then 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.480
 we go to the layer 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.730
 under the foundation 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.310
 we have our layer of agreement 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.069
 and we started and I photo and everything 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.650
 retouched I'm just going to apply the white 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.120
 and black then I go by fact that 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.560
 when you another country apply white and 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.540
 black you already have the picture in conformity 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.909
 you want to have the colors this back 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.230
 the first thing we have to do is layer 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:38.310
 New uniform color filling layer ok 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.370
 bringing Color 1 and the channel h 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.970
 see we have to put 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.190
 correspondingly or as it is said 0 0 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.700
 fifty 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.280
 ok we got a medium gray tone 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.250
 that we will put in tone mode 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.310
 we already have black and white basically 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.920
 what we have achieved with him 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.069
 Predefined black and white adjustment of 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.040
 photoshop 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.189
 the next step is the next step 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.170
 it would be a new layer adjustment layer 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.090
 contrast brightness and here starts to 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.189
 change the story once we have the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.319
 contrast brightness we have here the menu of 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.319
 fit me in my room and under 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.790
 properties I will not go up here 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.790
 perfect 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.719
 properties according then starting 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.530
 from this layer we can start playing 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:38.310
 for brightness 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.290
 and against 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.000
 and as I said before, the advantage that 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.250
 has this is that if I at some point 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.390
 I get tired of this or remove the layer or 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.010
 directly I come to the properties 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.010
 and I change everything I want 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.780
 agree so you can see the change that 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.209
 paste nothing more 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.209
 with a bit of adjustment 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.590
 I really like the high key 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.590
 pure whites 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.230
 and third we are going to put another layer 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.959
 new adjustment layer and we'll see you one of 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.519
 saturation tone 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.600
 very important tone layer 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.600
 saturation has to be 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:30.700
 above the original layer of the 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.430
 photo and below the tone layer 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.100
 gray and it would not work well for us 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.900
 the test that we get with layer comes out 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.760
 of saturation tone we have here the 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.460
 menus then here what we get 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.410
 is to work by colors if we want 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.270
 give light to the face just for example you 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.830
 we know that it has red and 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.320
 yellows what we would do would be to go to 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.500
 Red Channel 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.800
 and with luminosity we would give to the 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.800
 face 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.009
 there are two letters 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.789
 the same with any magenta shade that 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.789
 has the skin 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.920
 we are touching by colors and then 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.660
 so you can see all of us do if 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.820
 I put it over the layer of 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.160
 gray does not work for me if I can 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.510
 below it works, I would become 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.460
 crazy at the beginning when I learned this 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.770
 technique because he said he does not lower me 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.450
 well it's going to me it's not that I always like the 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.520
 saturation tone in the last layer that 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.130
 do you always stay above 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.840
 the gray and therefore it does not work let's go 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.780
 to see the comparison of what would be 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.669
 the predefined option of photoshop 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.620
 it would stay that way and the option that we have 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.990
 used we would be left of this 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.919
 way I think the change is pretty 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.919
 evident 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.130
 because I 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.770
 for some it was too burned to 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.680
 others will be fine that's already taste 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.560
 each one 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.240
 to me this is the way I like the most 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.720
 of making black and white you can 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.539
 completely customize how you want to 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.460
 let shine contrast saturation tone 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.740
 you have everything here you want to go back to 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.419
 color you just have to remove layers yo 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.520
 I think that in this way we have the 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.110
 maximum number of possible options already 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.480
 when creating high keys for 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:30.560
 example we put it super simple 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:33.400
 create the keys easily 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.400
 in this way 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.590
 and nothing guys that was the first 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.360
 personal tutorial video that is not super 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.580
 professional everything but I 'm not 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.560
 used to doing these things because 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.350
 as we go forward this will go 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.900
 much more fluid and explanations 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:59.410
 will be much clearer by now here you 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.030
 I leave my way to turn a photo into 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.650
 black and white meets many 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.350
 thanks for going through the channel if you 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.420
 like the tutorials you want me to do 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.000
 something special stop the comments 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.980
