00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
body so it will actually check to

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.999 
body so it will actually check to
backtrack<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.200> fit<00:02:02.380> in<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.500> engine<00:02:02.619> bay<00:02:02.979> and

the adjustments you make to the body

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.510 
the adjustments you make to the body
shape<00:02:05.259> will<00:02:05.679> hopefully<00:02:06.130> make<00:02:06.369> a<00:02:06.429> difference

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
shape will hopefully make a difference

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.820

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.590 
to that as well so we're trying to make
clearance<00:02:09.399> at<00:02:09.580> various<00:02:09.940> places<00:02:11.940> um<00:02:12.940> something

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
clearance at various places um something

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.500 
clearance at various places um something
that<00:02:13.630> we've<00:02:14.019> I've<00:02:15.010> been<00:02:15.310> working<00:02:16.060> on<00:02:16.150> new<00:02:16.269> car

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
that we've I've been working on new car

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.970 
that we've I've been working on new car
shaders<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.049> make<00:02:17.200> them<00:02:17.320> look<00:02:17.470> better<00:02:17.709> I

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
shaders to make them look better I

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.240 
shaders to make them look better I
wasn't<00:02:18.579> a<00:02:18.610> big<00:02:18.790> fan<00:02:18.820> of<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:20.799> way<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.100> old

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
wasn't a big fan of the way the old

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.620 
wasn't a big fan of the way the old
shaders<00:02:21.670> looks<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.060> was<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.299> something<00:02:22.570> a

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
shaders looks it was just something a

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.990 
shaders looks it was just something a
bit<00:02:22.780> off<00:02:22.870> about<00:02:22.900> them<00:02:23.640> spent<00:02:24.640> quite<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.820> bit<00:02:24.880> of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
bit off about them spent quite a bit of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.550 
bit off about them spent quite a bit of
time<00:02:25.150> improving<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.750> kind<00:02:25.989> of<00:02:26.049> using<00:02:26.410> an

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
time improving that kind of using an

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.500 
time improving that kind of using an
image<00:02:26.920> based<00:02:27.100> lighting<00:02:27.459> technique<00:02:28.090> kind<00:02:28.420> of

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
image based lighting technique kind of

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.410 
image based lighting technique kind of
similar<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:29.410> some<00:02:29.650> ways<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:30.190> what<00:02:30.760> Forza<00:02:31.269> 4

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
similar in some ways to what Forza 4

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.320 
similar in some ways to what Forza 4
uses<00:02:31.900> and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
uses and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.970 
uses and
who's<00:02:33.540> been<00:02:33.750> working<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:34.200> updating<00:02:34.560> our

few<00:02:38.580> details<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.240> were<00:02:39.330> missing<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.720> first

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
few details that were missing the first

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.930 
few details that were missing the first
time<00:02:40.140> around<00:02:40.320> but<00:02:40.560> they<00:02:41.190> won't<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.460> Pomodoro

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
time around but they won't the Pomodoro

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.790 
time around but they won't the Pomodoro
seems<00:02:42.240> now<00:02:42.510> they've<00:02:42.810> got<00:02:42.930> some<00:02:42.960> nice<00:02:43.200> strips

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
seems now they've got some nice strips

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.160 
seems now they've got some nice strips
of<00:02:43.980> trim<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:45.210> generally<00:02:45.540> tidying<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.050> up

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
of trim just generally tidying that up

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.890 
of trim just generally tidying that up
and<00:02:46.320> make<00:02:46.470> them<00:02:46.650> look<00:02:46.710> a<00:02:47.040> lot<00:02:47.310> better<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.900> were

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
and make them look a lot better and were

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.630 
and make them look a lot better and were

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
what's it look like a few more car

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.880 
what's it look like a few more car
bodies<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.280> fingers<00:03:02.550> just<00:03:02.670> tied<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:02.970> up<00:03:03.150> there

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
bodies and fingers just tied it up there

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.200 
bodies and fingers just tied it up there
now<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.950> side<00:03:05.190> for<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.400> rocket<00:03:05.850> hubs<00:03:06.030> on

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
now the side for that rocket hubs on

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.270 
now the side for that rocket hubs on
going<00:03:06.600> um<00:03:06.900> it'd<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.440> fantastic<00:03:07.590> if<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.070> have

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
going um it'd be fantastic if you have

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
the faith in us to preorder and every

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
the faith in us to preorder and every
bit<00:03:11.790> helps<00:03:12.740> pushing<00:03:13.740> us<00:03:13.860> forwards<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:15.330> we're

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
bit helps pushing us forwards and we're

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.140 
bit helps pushing us forwards and we're
also<00:03:16.130> basically<00:03:17.130> concentrate<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.790> lot<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.030> our

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
also basically concentrate a lot of our

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.640 
also basically concentrate a lot of our
efforts<00:03:18.450> on<00:03:18.690> trying<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.140> get<00:03:19.260> before<00:03:19.560> when

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
efforts on trying to get before when

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.580 
efforts on trying to get before when
you've<00:03:19.770> done<00:03:19.980> for<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.670> demo<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.750> hopefully

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
you've done for a demo so hopefully

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.290 
you've done for a demo so hopefully
we'll<00:03:22.800> be<00:03:22.950> able<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.280> get<00:03:23.520> that<00:03:23.700> out<00:03:23.760> soon
