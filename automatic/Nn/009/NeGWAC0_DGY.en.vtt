00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:13.320
 hello to all beautiful and ugly today and not 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.900
 I'm here tomorrow to show you how 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.869
 create an indestructible wall 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.699
 indeed it will be destroyed but it will be like 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.359
 a kind of nam and cyan that can 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.330
 regenerate yourself in this case 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.880
 rebuild what we need 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.850
 redstone obsidian repeaters blocks a 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.809
 case of normal dry pistons of lava e 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.690
 buckets of water 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.760
 after taking everything you need 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.980
 let's proceed with putting a piston for 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.640
 earth and make it around two towers in 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.640
 this way 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.379
 then very quickly 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.719
 we put the lava in a tower e 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.670
 in the other water so as to 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:03.199
 create a block of stone in front of the 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:06.200
 piston behind the piston we must indeed 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.810
 you have to create an intermittent with gods 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.289
 repeaters set to maximum tic e 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.700
 of the ariston accompanied by a torch 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.700
 do as I do and rest assured 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.770
 apparently it seems a foolish thing 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:23.840
 but in reality this contraption serves 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.560
 for many things with the red star on 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.560
 main kraft 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.240
 as you see now the piston will push in 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.490
 automatic as if it were owned i 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.040
 stone blocks that form 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.680
 love problem is here now 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.320
 we can also destroy that thing 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.420
 with the blocks and the sale above a 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.670
 certain point we stop the strip of 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.770
 stone with a block of obsidian and da 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.230
 we build them a tower that will be 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.970
 the height of the wall but remember that 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.970
 it must not be too high 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.590
 I know it will seem strange but we must 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:30.170
 stop the piston to create one 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:32.630
 pit two blocks wide in the strip 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.910
 at the piston we will put 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.910
 other disorders facing upwards 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.560
 then after closing the top part 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:50.450
 in the other strip we put gods 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:52.610
 repeaters turned this way to the 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.620
 their side we'll let them pass a thread 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.239
 I would say stone that will accompany them for 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.209
 the rest of their lives 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.370
 however, that wire must be connected to 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.010
 an intermittent as we had done 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.200
 previously and more we go to 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.200
 reactivate the forgotten beam 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.690
 now we can say that the wall is finished 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.940
 let's wait a few moments so that 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.700
 create yourself while we will be at 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.480
 look with popcorn in hand indeed 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.540
 in the mouth or for some of you where 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.520
 my work for today is finished vi 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.520
 I have to leave bye bye
