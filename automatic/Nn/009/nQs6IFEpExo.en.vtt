more times it's a good thing she's
backing<00:01:29.850> off<00:01:30.149> I<00:01:32.149> think<00:01:33.149> she<00:01:33.390> flattened<00:01:33.780> that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
backing off I think she flattened that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.830 
backing off I think she flattened that
one<00:01:34.140> out<00:01:34.320> June<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.030> little<00:01:39.299> bit<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> smiles

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
one out June and a little bit of smiles

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.649 
one out June and a little bit of smiles
for<00:01:40.170> her<00:01:40.289> also

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.539 

while<00:01:44.320> Michelle<00:01:44.469> always<00:01:44.799> feels<00:01:45.159> that<00:01:45.399> the

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
while Michelle always feels that the

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.130 
while Michelle always feels that the
morning<00:01:45.819> blocks<00:01:46.240> are<00:01:46.450> toughest<00:01:46.810> for<00:01:47.020> her

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
morning blocks are toughest for her

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.219 
morning blocks are toughest for her
because<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:48.490> condition<00:01:48.969> seems<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.329> be<00:01:49.420> wet

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
because the condition seems to be wet

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.919 
because the condition seems to be wet
dry<00:01:51.000> three<00:01:52.000> girls<00:01:52.210> have<00:01:52.329> already<00:01:52.479> bowled

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
dry three girls have already bowled

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.050 
dry three girls have already bowled
four<00:01:53.500> girls<00:01:53.770> have<00:01:53.859> already<00:01:54.039> bold<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:54.729> this<00:01:54.880> is

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
four girls have already bold so this is

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.240 
four girls have already bold so this is
almost<00:01:55.450> like<00:01:55.659> the<00:01:56.109> second<00:01:56.409> or<00:01:56.469> third<00:01:56.530> game<00:01:56.950> for

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
almost like the second or third game for

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.340 
almost like the second or third game for
her<00:01:57.369> so<00:01:58.000> she's<00:01:58.569> probably<00:01:58.719> gonna<00:01:58.959> have<00:01:59.109> a<00:01:59.170> nice

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
her so she's probably gonna have a nice

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:09.240 
her so she's probably gonna have a nice
look<00:02:03.420> still<00:02:04.420> standing
