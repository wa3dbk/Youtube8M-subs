00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.420 
watched before try to put some of that
together<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.310> then<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:22.090> lot<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.950> me<00:02:23.950> looking<00:02:24.280> in

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
together and then a lot of me looking in

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.400 
together and then a lot of me looking in
the<00:02:24.550> mirror<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.000> seeing<00:02:25.780> what<00:02:25.960> looked<00:02:26.170> cool

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
the mirror and seeing what looked cool

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:34.180 
the mirror and seeing what looked cool
to<00:02:26.590> me

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.470 

well<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.280> judges<00:02:35.640> was<00:02:35.790> actually<00:02:36.210> hard

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
well the judges was actually hard

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.060 
well the judges was actually hard
because<00:02:36.690> they<00:02:36.900> were<00:02:36.960> all<00:02:37.170> really<00:02:37.590> good<00:02:37.800> and

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
because they were all really good and

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.550 
because they were all really good and
very<00:02:38.130> entertaining<00:02:38.720> for<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.050> students<00:02:40.470> I

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
very entertaining for the students I

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.650 
very entertaining for the students I
think<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.920> gives<00:02:41.100> them<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> chance<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.820> see

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
think it gives them a chance to see

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.030 
think it gives them a chance to see
different<00:02:42.690> sides<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.440> people<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:43.950> they

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
different sides of people that they

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.190 
different sides of people that they
wouldn't<00:02:44.310> otherwise<00:02:44.430> say<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.780> know<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:45.960> have

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
wouldn't otherwise say you know you have

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.990 
wouldn't otherwise say you know you have
athletes<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.130> people<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.850> all<00:02:47.970> different

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
athletes and people of all different

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.360 
athletes and people of all different
backgrounds<00:02:48.540> up<00:02:49.140> here<00:02:49.380> making<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.190> fool
