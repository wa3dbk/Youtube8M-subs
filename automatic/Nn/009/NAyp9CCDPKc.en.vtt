00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.500
 I am an illustrator from Alberto Montt Chile 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.760
 People seem to start drawing from about 2 years old 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.540
 I have been drawing for a long time, like a second language 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.320
 I feel free when I do sketching 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.640
 I feel like I let my body open, open the valve and flush out everything 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.820
 I like to appear 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:48.040
 Suddenly when there is nothing, I really like the feeling that something comes out 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.300
 There was always a gray area between the two poles that started thinking about duality from some time, 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.880
 There is no pure good and bad 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.400
 So, my work often expresses satirical elements of things 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.300
 When I travel, I often like to observe people and listen to stories, and reflect them in my work 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.640
 I always carry a small sketchbook 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.900
 I like to go around imagination like a bottle waiting to be full of stories 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.380
 People have immense ability to make stories 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.740
 I like that kind of feeling full of stories packed 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.940
 You can change your view of things by drawing a picture 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.140
 All the characters of my work are projected myself 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.820
 There is a favorite self and a dislike self 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.840
 I can look at my life like that 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.520
 When I knew the world of digital painting I thought it was heaven 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.180
 It's a totally different experience than before and at the same time was scary similar 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.140
 What you use to convey your thoughts to others is called a "tool" 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.200
 That tool is important 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:27.740
 What I choose is a tool to communicate the ideas in my head to the computer the most organically 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.660
 That's exactly what Intuos Pro
