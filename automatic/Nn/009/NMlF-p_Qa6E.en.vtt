guys about a fat burning stack called

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.339 
guys about a fat burning stack called
ECA<00:00:06.200> you<00:00:07.200> stand<00:00:07.500> for<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.740> federal<00:00:08.929> C<00:00:09.929> stands<00:00:10.260> for

ECA you stand for a federal C stands for

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.570 
ECA you stand for a federal C stands for
caffeine<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.670> stands<00:00:12.000> for<00:00:12.090> aspirin<00:00:16.580> so

caffeine and a stands for aspirin so

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.630 
caffeine and a stands for aspirin so
what<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.970> ECA<00:00:18.359> stat<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.590> ECA<00:00:20.010> stack<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.580> a

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
what is the ECA stat the ECA stack is a

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.609 
what is the ECA stat the ECA stack is a
combination<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.449> three<00:00:21.810> legal<00:00:22.020> drugs<00:00:22.410> that

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
combination of three legal drugs that

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.470 
combination of three legal drugs that
will<00:00:22.769> help<00:00:22.949> stimulate<00:00:23.310> your<00:00:23.609> metabolism<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
will help stimulate your metabolism and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.359 
will help stimulate your metabolism and
help<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.019> burn<00:00:25.230> fat<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:25.740> your<00:00:25.859> cutting<00:00:26.070> phase

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
help you burn fat on your cutting phase

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.849 
help you burn fat on your cutting phase
out<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.269> three<00:00:27.539> drugs<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.109> most<00:00:28.289> powerful

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
out of the three drugs the most powerful

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.890 
out of the three drugs the most powerful
fat<00:00:29.130> burning<00:00:29.490> compound<00:00:29.939> would<00:00:30.119> definitely<00:00:30.720> be

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
fat burning compound would definitely be

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.780 
fat burning compound would definitely be
ephedrine<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.309> reason<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.759> that

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
ephedrine and the reason is that

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.880 
ephedrine and the reason is that
ephedrine<00:00:33.570> stimulates<00:00:34.050> your<00:00:34.170> three<00:00:34.559> beta

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
ephedrine stimulates your three beta

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.370 
ephedrine stimulates your three beta
receptors<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.610> your<00:00:35.640> body<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.809> beta<00:00:37.050> 1

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
receptors in your body the beta 1

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.920 
receptors in your body the beta 1
receptor<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.070> responsible<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:38.870> speeding<00:00:39.870> up

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
receptor is responsible for speeding up

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.459 
receptor is responsible for speeding up
heart<00:00:40.260> rate<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.649> increasing<00:00:41.040> lipolysis

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
heart rate and increasing lipolysis

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.529 
heart rate and increasing lipolysis
lipolysis<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.309> conversion<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.969> fat<00:00:45.210> cells

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
lipolysis is the conversion of fat cells

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.959 
lipolysis is the conversion of fat cells
for<00:00:45.780> energy<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.559> beta<00:00:46.800> 2<00:00:47.219> receptor<00:00:47.760> is

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
for energy the beta 2 receptor is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.940 
for energy the beta 2 receptor is
responsible<00:00:48.539> for<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.840> increase<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.620> vein

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
responsible for the increase in vein

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.990 
responsible for the increase in vein
size<00:00:50.280> or<00:00:51.140> vascular<00:00:52.140> dilation<00:00:52.610> what<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.789> does

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
size or vascular dilation what this does

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.520 
size or vascular dilation what this does
for<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.510> allows<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.260> utilize

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
for you is allows you to utilize

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.290 
for you is allows you to utilize
nutrients<00:00:56.309> better<00:00:56.489> by<00:00:56.699> increasing<00:00:57.270> blood

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
nutrients better by increasing blood

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.650 
nutrients better by increasing blood
flow<00:00:58.010> faster<00:00:59.010> fat<00:00:59.520> oxidization<00:01:00.480> with

flow faster fat oxidization with

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.020 
flow faster fat oxidization with
increased<00:01:01.050> blood<00:01:01.289> flow<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.030> increasing

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
increased blood flow and the increasing

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.060 
increased blood flow and the increasing
glycogen<00:01:03.539> storing<00:01:03.989> during<00:01:04.619> your<00:01:04.769> cutting

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
glycogen storing during your cutting

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.179 
glycogen storing during your cutting
phase<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.299> beta<00:01:06.450> 2<00:01:06.659> receptor<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.409> very

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
phase so the beta 2 receptor is very

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.420 
phase so the beta 2 receptor is very

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
beta 3 receptor is primarily responsible

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.039 
beta 3 receptor is primarily responsible
for<00:01:14.090> increasing<00:01:15.090> only<00:01:15.360> lipolysis

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
for increasing only lipolysis

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.770 
for increasing only lipolysis
as<00:01:16.229> stated<00:01:16.950> before<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:18.030> increase<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
as stated before this will increase the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.510 
as stated before this will increase the
amount<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.140> fat<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.799> converted<00:01:20.340> into

what<00:01:21.930> makes<00:01:22.140> EC<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.950> powerful<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.729> when

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
what makes EC a so powerful is that when

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.210 
what makes EC a so powerful is that when
ephedrine<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.869> combined<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.650> caffeine

ephedrine is combined with caffeine

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.160 
ephedrine is combined with caffeine
there<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> strong<00:01:27.299> thermogenic<00:01:27.930> effect

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
there is a strong thermogenic effect

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.050 
there is a strong thermogenic effect
that<00:01:28.650> allows<00:01:28.920> your<00:01:29.130> body's<00:01:29.460> core<00:01:30.000> temperature

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that allows your body's core temperature

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.080 
that allows your body's core temperature
to<00:01:30.600> raise<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.799> raising<00:01:32.430> core<00:01:32.610> temperature

to raise this raising core temperature

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.700 
to raise this raising core temperature
actually<00:01:33.509> allows<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.170> burn<00:01:34.470> more

on one week off cycle of ECA the reason

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.580 
on one week off cycle of ECA the reason
being<00:02:30.910> is<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.210> the<00:02:31.330> beta<00:02:31.660> receptors<00:02:32.260> will
