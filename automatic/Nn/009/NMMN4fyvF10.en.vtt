00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.910 

now<00:02:08.660> I<00:02:08.690> could<00:02:09.020> use<00:02:09.170> diminished<00:02:09.619> seventh

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
now I could use diminished seventh

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:26.660 
now I could use diminished seventh
chords<00:02:10.160> in<00:02:10.310> transition<00:02:10.850> if<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:11.030> want<00:02:11.270> to

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
see that so when I move between cords I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.510 
see that so when I move between cords I
can<00:02:33.930> use<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.110> as<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> transition<00:02:34.800> transition

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
can use that as a transition transition

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.300 
can use that as a transition transition
