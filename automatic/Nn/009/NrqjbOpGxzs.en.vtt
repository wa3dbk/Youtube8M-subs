00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.190
 today we will approve the sense of pleasure that 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.620
 the painted scenery you will need 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.759
 of acrylic paint or spray paint on the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.920
 color you want 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.960
 the vase object you want to try 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.890
 Extinct white enamel gloves and brush 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.460
 Starting, we'll get our 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.470
 object in the case using evil already the old 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.260
 I get my white enamel paint and 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.350
 I paint it all out of my jar 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.480
 transparent glass that is pinto 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.370
 todinha in reciprocating motion and then 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.770
 I place it for office now it comes 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.379
 spray in my case a golden one that is 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.020
 beautiful is a golden middle was the stir 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.129
 enough before using and I will apply 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.370
 gently move in short jets and 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.199
 up and down movements 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.210
 also turning my piece with my finger and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.149
 This wearing glove is not to have to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.119
 to dirty the hand or anything and not 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.950
 A lot of my moves tell black not to 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.360
 spot and not cumulative fifth the same 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.130
 I'm going to do something in this garden that I already 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.950
 I painted white only this time I go 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.229
 to use a spray paint in baby blue color 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.110
 I already a little try a little 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.759
 out and do the same in my garden 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.080
 in every move from top to bottom 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.850
 gently 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.430
 now I came back to you another way 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.860
 I have a jug here too. 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.659
 a glass I'll use an ink strip of 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.360
 acrylic crafts in the color you 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.909
 I want to and I'm going to dump some of this 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.920
 ink inside my jar this time of 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.890
 painted inside and has an effect 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.700
 very nice, it's really cool, it's very simple 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.220
 do 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.170
 I'm going to be a little bit of this ink and 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.960
 makes a spinning motion so that this 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.240
 ink begins to fall and begins to cover 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.759
 All my glass and I'm going to do it. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.460
 circular movements rotating my 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.829
 pitcher for the satire cover all my 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.299
 heard 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.979
 if you already have to, you can play 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.869
 a little more paint 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.030
 Ideally, you should leave a pitcher of 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.180
 another upside down and some like 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.930
 I'm half anxious I have I do 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.010
 this trick 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.780
 and stay up turning the bottle to make 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.319
 with which the ink that is 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.780
 end of the jar cover those places that 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.700
 have not been hit yet and let 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.700
 rest in the day for another 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.910
 And it looks like it was beautiful, I 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.530
 I put the little flowers of a charm 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.600
 total for my corner 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.760
 I hope you have enjoyed it. 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.190

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.060

 dough with knife
