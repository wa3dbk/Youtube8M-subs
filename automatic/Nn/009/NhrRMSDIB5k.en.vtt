featuring<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.900> suppression<00:00:16.439> effect<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.130> so

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
featuring the suppression effect and so

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.249 
featuring the suppression effect and so
they've<00:00:18.240> changed<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.630> lot<00:00:18.750> about<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:19.259 
they've changed a lot about the

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.940

suppression<00:00:19.590> effect<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:20.700> my<00:00:20.759> opinion<00:00:21.119> it's

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
suppression effect in my opinion it's

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.310 
suppression effect in my opinion it's
extremely<00:00:22.950> powerful<00:00:23.130> now<00:00:23.520> it's<00:00:23.910> way<00:00:24.180> too

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
extremely powerful now it's way too

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.080 
extremely powerful now it's way too

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
the bullet this will fly randomly go

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.720 
the bullet this will fly randomly go
anywhere<00:00:36.210> within<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.350> crosshairs<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.489> within

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
anywhere within the crosshairs so within

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.229 
anywhere within the crosshairs so within
my<00:00:39.239> hip<00:00:39.629> fire<00:00:39.899> my<00:00:40.230> normal<00:00:40.559> hipfire<00:00:40.890> spread<00:00:41.239> its

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
my hip fire my normal hipfire spread its

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.049 
my hip fire my normal hipfire spread its
same<00:00:42.539> like<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.589> wouldn't<00:00:44.219> even<00:00:44.429> use<00:00:44.460> my<00:00:44.609> scope

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
same like I wouldn't even use my scope

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.169 
same like I wouldn't even use my scope
Oh<00:00:45.300> another<00:00:46.260> key<00:00:46.559> factor<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.579> can<00:00:47.850> study

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
Oh another key factor is you can study

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:49.729 
Oh another key factor is you can study
your<00:00:48.300> scalp<00:00:48.719> while<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> suppression

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
your scalp while you have to suppression

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.520 
your scalp while you have to suppression
effect<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.339> you<00:00:50.519> so<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.539> also<00:00:51.929> checked<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.379> with

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
effect on you so I also checked it with

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.770 
effect on you so I also checked it with
the<00:00:52.739> low-power<00:00:53.280> scopes<00:00:53.730> right<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:54.629> i'm

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the low-power scopes right here i'm

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.139 
the low-power scopes right here i'm
using<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.260> red<00:00:55.409> outside<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.820> as<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.120> see

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
with Ricky oh if I have to suppression

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.280 
with Ricky oh if I have to suppression
effect<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.309> me<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:06.420> bullet<00:01:06.780> will<00:01:06.930> fly

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
effect on me the bullet will fly

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.130 
effect on me the bullet will fly
randomly<00:01:07.979> again<00:01:08.340> within<00:01:08.820> my<00:01:09.210> crossers<00:01:09.690> so

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
randomly again within my crossers so

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.030 
randomly again within my crossers so
it's<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> would<00:01:11.520> no<00:01:11.760> scope<00:01:12.120> and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
it's just like it would no scope and

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.370 
it's just like it would no scope and
yeah<00:01:14.040> that's<00:01:14.340> that's<00:01:15.150> really<00:01:15.450> hard<00:01:15.930> it's

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
yeah that's that's really hard it's

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.530 
yeah that's that's really hard it's
especially<00:01:16.950> for<00:01:17.460> snipers<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.120> makes<00:01:18.420> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
especially for snipers it makes it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.900 
especially for snipers it makes it
really<00:01:18.720> helped<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:19.070> once<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.250> shot<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
really helped because once your shot you

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.300 
really helped because once your shot you
have<00:01:21.060> really<00:01:21.480> hard<00:01:21.690> time<00:01:22.100> getting<00:01:23.100> these

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
have really hard time getting these

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.200 
have really hard time getting these
counter<00:01:23.760> shots<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:25.260> fighting<00:01:25.620> back<00:01:26.210> ok

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
counter shots or just fighting back ok

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.970 
counter shots or just fighting back ok
and<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:27.960> summarized<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.770> key

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
and now I have summarized the key

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.240 
and now I have summarized the key
features<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.730> the<00:01:30.270> suppression<00:01:30.600> effect<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
features of the suppression effect and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.090 
features of the suppression effect and
this<00:01:33.090> will<00:01:33.300> be<00:01:33.450> first<00:01:33.870> fold<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.470> increased

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
this will be first fold the increased

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.030 
this will be first fold the increased
hip<00:01:35.310> fire<00:01:35.520> spread<00:01:35.550> so<00:01:35.910> and<00:01:36.560> your<00:01:37.560> crosshairs

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
hip fire spread so and your crosshairs

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.700 
hip fire spread so and your crosshairs
will<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.580> further<00:01:38.970> apart<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.870> you<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:40.560> have

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
will be further apart and you will have

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.180 
will be further apart and you will have
a<00:01:40.770> lot<00:01:41.280> harder<00:01:41.520> time<00:01:41.960> just<00:01:42.960> shooting<00:01:43.800> people

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
a lot harder time just shooting people

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.580 
a lot harder time just shooting people
from<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.550> hip<00:01:44.700> another<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:46.110> important

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
from the hip another really important

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.070 
from the hip another really important
point<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.240> bullet<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.600> will<00:01:48.840> fly

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
point is that bullet just will fly

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.100 
point is that bullet just will fly
randomly<00:01:49.830> within<00:01:50.190> those<00:01:50.730> wire<00:01:51.330> crosshairs

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
randomly within those wire crosshairs

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.650 
randomly within those wire crosshairs
and<00:01:52.970> it<00:01:53.970> doesn't<00:01:54.210> matter<00:01:54.450> if<00:01:54.630> you're

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
and it doesn't matter if you're

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.960 
and it doesn't matter if you're
addressing<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.980> aiming<00:01:56.370> down<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.550> sights<00:01:56.640> or

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
addressing so aiming down the sights or

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.450 
addressing so aiming down the sights or
not<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.660> will<00:01:57.810> fly<00:01:58.020> randomly<00:01:58.560> within<00:01:58.980> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
not it just will fly randomly within the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.330 
not it just will fly randomly within the
crosshairs<00:01:59.940> so<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:01.080> last<00:02:01.500> thing<00:02:01.710> will<00:02:02.160> be

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
crosshairs so the last thing will be

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.910 
crosshairs so the last thing will be
empty<00:02:02.700> scope<00:02:03.330> can't<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:03.960> steady<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.560> if

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
empty scope can't be steady so you if

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.010 
empty scope can't be steady so you if
you're<00:02:05.100> using<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.520> high<00:02:05.820> power<00:02:06.150> scope<00:02:06.480> you

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
you're using a high power scope you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.990 
you're using a high power scope you
can't<00:02:07.260> hold<00:02:07.470> your<00:02:07.590> breath<00:02:07.830> which<00:02:08.580> makes<00:02:08.879> it

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
can't hold your breath which makes it

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.089 
can't hold your breath which makes it
even<00:02:09.119> harder<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.569> especially<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:10.649> snipers

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
even harder for especially for snipers

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.940 
even harder for especially for snipers
and<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:12.269> hit<00:02:12.420> their<00:02:12.540> targets<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.680> it's
