00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.060 
necessarily left-handed and right-handed
sometimes<00:01:17.970> I'll<00:01:18.270> use<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.990> left<00:01:19.259> kicking<00:01:19.710> tool

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
sometimes I'll use the left kicking tool

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.060 
sometimes I'll use the left kicking tool
in<00:01:20.670> my<00:01:21.000> left<00:01:21.210> hand<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.110> other<00:01:22.500> times<00:01:22.860> I'll<00:01:23.040> use

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
in my left hand but other times I'll use

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.890 
in my left hand but other times I'll use
the<00:01:23.400> left<00:01:23.610> kicking<00:01:23.909> tool<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.270> my<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:24.600> hand

the left kicking tool in my right hand

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
the left kicking tool in my right hand
and<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:25.830> determined<00:01:26.430> left<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and really is not determined left and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850 
and really is not determined left and
right<00:01:27.030> because<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.479> your<00:01:27.600> hand<00:01:27.869> use<00:01:28.140> simply

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
right because if your hand use simply

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.530 
right because if your hand use simply
because<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.430> way<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.759> ends<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.150> them<00:01:30.270> kick

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
because of the way the ends of them kick

I<00:01:30.780> carry<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.860> my<00:01:32.040> box<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.850> also<00:01:33.119> what

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
I carry in my box and this is also what

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.830 
I carry in my box and this is also what
the<00:01:33.420> dent<00:01:33.689> shop<00:01:33.900> supplies<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.500> carried<00:01:34.979> two

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
the dent shop supplies I carried two

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.690 
the dent shop supplies I carried two
longer<00:01:36.840> versions<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.770> believe<00:01:38.100> they're<00:01:38.310> 18

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
longer versions I believe they're 18

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.690 
longer versions I believe they're 18
inches<00:01:39.060> long<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.439> two<00:01:40.680> shorter<00:01:41.340> versions

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
inches long and the two shorter versions

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.090 
inches long and the two shorter versions
with<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> smaller<00:01:42.420> wire<00:01:42.840> which<00:01:43.530> are<00:01:43.710> roughly

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
with a smaller wire which are roughly

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.700 
with a smaller wire which are roughly
nine<00:01:44.340> inches<00:01:44.729> long<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.659> reason<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.380> is

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
nine inches long the reason for that is

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.380 
nine inches long the reason for that is
if<00:01:47.220> you're<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.610> through<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> hole<00:01:48.149> or<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
if you're going through a hole or a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.630 
if you're going through a hole or a
brace<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.049> panel<00:01:49.439> somewhere<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.310> need<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
brace in a panel somewhere you need to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.520 
brace in a panel somewhere you need to
sometimes<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:51.270> at<00:01:51.390> length<00:01:51.720> sometimes<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
sometimes be at length sometimes it's a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.590 
sometimes be at length sometimes it's a
bigger<00:01:52.740> hole<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.670> need<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> stronger<00:01:54.270> tool

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
bigger hole so you need a stronger tool

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.700 
bigger hole so you need a stronger tool
sometimes<00:01:55.140> you're<00:01:55.290> working<00:01:55.409> through<00:01:55.649> a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
sometimes you're working through a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.920 
sometimes you're working through a
smaller<00:01:56.009> hole<00:01:56.369> closer<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.750> need

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
smaller hole closer to you and you need

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.480 
smaller hole closer to you and you need
a<00:01:57.960> lighter<00:01:58.320> duty<00:01:58.740> tool<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.219> that

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
a lighter duty tool for that

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.200 
a lighter duty tool for that
and<00:01:59.579> the<00:02:00.360> other<00:02:00.509> two<00:02:00.780> tools<00:02:01.110> above<00:02:01.530> those

and the other two tools above those

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.580 
and the other two tools above those

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
definitely a hand push tool that nearly

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.530 
definitely a hand push tool that nearly
fits<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.070> their<00:02:05.219> hand<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.360> got<00:02:06.509> a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
with a round curve at the very end but

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.729 
with a round curve at the very end but
it's<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.310> straight<00:02:11.610> tool<00:02:11.939> as<00:02:12.180> my<00:02:12.329> point

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739

tad<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.840> revolutionary<00:02:25.709> tool<00:02:25.890> but<00:02:26.069> I'll<00:02:26.159> say

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
tad a revolutionary tool but I'll say

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.849 
tad a revolutionary tool but I'll say
ten<00:02:26.549> years<00:02:26.579> ago<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.439> revolutionary<00:02:28.439> tool<00:02:28.650> that

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
ten years ago a revolutionary tool that

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.890 
ten years ago a revolutionary tool that
came<00:02:29.010> out<00:02:29.189> which<00:02:29.310> was<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.609> whale<00:02:29.849> tail<00:02:30.299> it's

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900

called<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.470> whale<00:02:31.650> tail<00:02:31.980> because<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.370> simply

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
called the whale tail because it simply

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.360 
called the whale tail because it simply
shaped<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:33.329> a<00:02:33.359> whale's<00:02:33.720> tail<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.560> you're

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
able to put that in between braces where

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.559 
able to put that in between braces where
we<00:02:37.650> struggle<00:02:37.950> with<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.400> before<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.090> use

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
we struggle with that before and you use

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.839 
we struggle with that before and you use
it<00:02:39.599> in<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.840> twisting<00:02:40.290> motion<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:41.280> tool<00:02:41.609> is

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
it in a twisting motion that tool is

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.020 
it in a twisting motion that tool is
just<00:02:42.090> wonderful<00:02:42.659> so<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:43.430> basic<00:02:44.430> basic<00:02:45.000> basic
