with regards to the twin tips we
basically<00:00:20.680> we've<00:00:21.220> amp<00:00:21.520> the<00:00:21.789> entire

collection so last year we had five or

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.870 
collection so last year we had five or
six<00:00:25.150> models<00:00:25.480> this<00:00:26.289> year<00:00:26.560> we<00:00:29.010> animal<00:00:30.010> totally

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
six models this year we animal totally

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.509 
six models this year we animal totally
and<00:00:31.060> instead<00:00:31.750> of<00:00:31.810> adding<00:00:32.169> a<00:00:32.259> lot<00:00:32.379> of<00:00:32.529> models<00:00:32.829> we

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:33.519 
and instead of adding a lot of models we

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.049 
and instead of adding a lot of models we
went<00:00:33.789> from<00:00:34.199> one<00:00:35.199> to<00:00:35.530> three<00:00:35.559> models<00:00:36.339> and<00:00:36.609> each

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
went from one to three models and each

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.369 
went from one to three models and each
model<00:00:37.569> with<00:00:38.170> different<00:00:39.659> full<00:00:40.659> carbon<00:00:40.899> or<00:00:41.170> not

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
model with different full carbon or not

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.729 
model with different full carbon or not
full<00:00:41.649> carbon<00:00:41.920> or<00:00:42.280> secretly<00:00:42.699> yes<00:00:43.479> so<00:00:44.319> the

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
full carbon or secretly yes so the

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.729 
full carbon or secretly yes so the
biggest<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.699> biggest<00:00:45.929> thing<00:00:46.929> this<00:00:47.109> year<00:00:47.170> it's

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
biggest the biggest thing this year it's

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.629 
biggest the biggest thing this year it's
brand<00:00:48.280> new<00:00:48.399> technology<00:00:49.120> is<00:00:49.179> called<00:00:49.420> le<00:00:49.690> carré

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:50.639 
brand new technology is called le carré

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:53.520 
brand new technology is called le carré
where<00:00:51.639> I<00:00:51.999> don't<00:00:52.389> know<00:00:52.449> if<00:00:52.569> you<00:00:52.659> can<00:00:52.809> see<00:00:53.139> it<00:00:53.170> on

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
where I don't know if you can see it on

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.770 
where I don't know if you can see it on
the<00:00:54.159> video<00:00:54.359> but<00:00:55.359> uh<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:56.649> a<00:00:56.799> pretty<00:00:57.039> fancy

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the video but uh it's a pretty fancy

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.439 
the video but uh it's a pretty fancy
aware<00:00:58.780> where<00:00:59.559> an<00:01:00.159> inverted<00:01:00.639> on<00:01:00.760> this<00:01:00.999> end<00:01:01.269> so

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
aware where an inverted on this end so

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.910 
aware where an inverted on this end so
it's<00:01:01.600> inverted<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.409> high<00:01:02.679> on<00:01:03.100> both<00:01:03.909> hands<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
it's inverted and high on both hands and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.030 
it's inverted and high on both hands and
then<00:01:06.160> very<00:01:06.460> thin<00:01:06.820> like<00:01:07.180> more<00:01:07.450> like<00:01:07.570> a<00:01:07.600> typical

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
then very thin like more like a typical

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.360 
then very thin like more like a typical
thin<00:01:09.040> 20<00:01:09.580> player<00:01:09.820> on<00:01:10.170> inside<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.980> idea<00:01:12.280> is

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
thin 20 player on inside and the idea is

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.830 
thin 20 player on inside and the idea is
that<00:01:13.050> it<00:01:14.050> will<00:01:14.200> give<00:01:14.410> you<00:01:14.560> a<00:01:14.590> lot<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:14.980> stability

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
that it will give you a lot of stability

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.090 
that it will give you a lot of stability
not<00:01:16.840> not<00:01:17.440> in<00:01:17.710> not<00:01:18.130> splash<00:01:18.930> very<00:01:19.930> very<00:01:20.440> easy<00:01:20.710> to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
not not in not splash very very easy to

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.630 
not not in not splash very very easy to
chill<00:01:21.550> and<00:01:21.700> your<00:01:22.510> your<00:01:23.050> jump<00:01:23.380> using<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.430> wear

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
chill and your your jump using the wear

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.720 
chill and your your jump using the wear
on<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.850> outside<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.630> then<00:01:26.230> the<00:01:27.190> typical<00:01:27.550> well

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
on the outside and then the typical well

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.660 
on the outside and then the typical well
on<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:27.940> inside<00:01:28.330> like<00:01:28.840> at<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.050> center<00:01:29.670> where

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
on the inside like at the center where

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.640 
on the inside like at the center where
where<00:01:31.030> this<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:31.690> why<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:31.840> pop<00:01:32.140> it<00:01:32.350> so<00:01:32.470> if<00:01:32.590> you

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
where this is why you pop it so if you

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.010 
where this is why you pop it so if you
see<00:01:32.800> why<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:32.950> edge<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:34.240> can<00:01:34.390> load<00:01:34.570> really

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
see why you edge and you can load really

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.010 
see why you edge and you can load really
hard<00:01:35.260> so<00:01:36.010> that's<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.580> idea<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.030> chip<00:01:37.330> will

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
hard so that's the idea of the chip will

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.690 
hard so that's the idea of the chip will
remain<00:01:38.410> about<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.710> same<00:01:38.800> as<00:01:39.190> they<00:01:39.340> were<00:01:39.460> last

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
remain about the same as they were last

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.890 
remain about the same as they were last
year<00:01:40.000> so<00:01:40.870> that's<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.260> big<00:01:41.530> big<00:01:42.360> harbin<00:01:43.360> so

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
year so that's the big big harbin so

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.450 
year so that's the big big harbin so
this<00:01:44.110> one<00:01:44.350> is<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.590> flagship<00:01:45.010> this<00:01:45.250> is<00:01:45.370> the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
this one is the flagship this is the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.090 
this one is the flagship this is the
tracks<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:46.030> these<00:01:46.870> particular<00:01:47.440> version<00:01:47.770> is

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
tracks and these particular version is

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.140 
tracks and these particular version is
in<00:01:48.220> full<00:01:48.430> carbon<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:49.510> tracks<00:01:49.870> comes<00:01:50.290> also<00:01:51.150> in

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
in full carbon the tracks comes also in

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.690 
in full carbon the tracks comes also in
a<00:01:52.330> regular<00:01:52.780> non<00:01:53.409> through<00:01:53.800> carbon<00:01:54.070> version

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
a regular non through carbon version

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.570 
a regular non through carbon version
would<00:01:55.030> still<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.600> same<00:01:55.810> rail<00:01:56.080> exactly<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.280> we

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
would still the same rail exactly and we

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.770 
would still the same rail exactly and we
have<00:01:57.729> it<00:01:57.880> we<00:01:58.210> have<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.360> right<00:01:58.780> here

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
have it we have it right here

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.580 
have it we have it right here
so<00:02:00.530> basically<00:02:01.340> what<00:02:01.610> you<00:02:01.760> have<00:02:02.140> this<00:02:03.140> one<00:02:03.440> is

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
so basically what you have this one is

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.100 
so basically what you have this one is
the<00:02:03.710> full<00:02:03.920> carbon<00:02:04.190> version<00:02:04.760> and<00:02:04.940> this<00:02:05.720> one<00:02:05.990> is

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
the full carbon version and this one is

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.430 
the full carbon version and this one is
also<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.500> tracks<00:02:07.479> but<00:02:08.479> with<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.750> limbo<00:02:09.170> more

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
also the tracks but with a limbo more

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.430 
also the tracks but with a limbo more
flags<00:02:09.800> right<00:02:10.399> price<00:02:11.300> point<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:11.810> cheaper<00:02:12.290> as

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
flags right price point is cheaper as

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.190 
flags right price point is cheaper as
well<00:02:12.910> it's<00:02:13.910> basically<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.420> replacement<00:02:15.050> of<00:02:15.140> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
well it's basically a replacement of the
