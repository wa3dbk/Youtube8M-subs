find the stainless one there usually

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.869 
find the stainless one there usually
harder<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.670> find<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.110> cool<00:00:37.320> off

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
harder to find so it's a it's a cool off

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.340 
harder to find so it's a it's a cool off
it's<00:00:38.879> always<00:00:39.120> hard<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.450> call<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> two<00:00:40.200> hundred

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
it's always hard to call a two hundred

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.299 
it's always hard to call a two hundred
because<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:42.239> races<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:43.620> always<00:00:44.070> different

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
because the races is always different

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.250 
because the races is always different
every<00:00:44.640> year<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.879> mean<00:00:45.120> sometimes<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.690> see<00:00:45.870> races

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
that go right to the end and sometimes

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.510 
that go right to the end and sometimes
we<00:00:48.030> see<00:00:48.180> races<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:49.620> broken<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.309> I

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
across the stripe and it should be very

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760 
across the stripe and it should be very
entertaining<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.380> those<00:01:07.470> first
