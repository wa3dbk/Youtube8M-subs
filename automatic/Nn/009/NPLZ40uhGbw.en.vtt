00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
you can see my curls are still very

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.500 
you can see my curls are still very
defined<00:04:00.959> but<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.500> do<00:04:01.620> take<00:04:02.489> this<00:04:02.730> off<00:04:03.000> at<00:04:03.299> night

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
defined but I do take this off at night

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.110 
defined but I do take this off at night
so<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.170> don't<00:04:04.500> know<00:04:04.680> if<00:04:04.829> it<00:04:04.950> was<00:04:05.100> because<00:04:05.310> maybe

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
so I don't know if it was because maybe

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.440 
so I don't know if it was because maybe
she<00:04:07.109> was<00:04:07.260> sleeping<00:04:07.620> in<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.980> or<00:04:08.459> it<00:04:09.090> was<00:04:09.299> an

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
she was sleeping in it or it was an

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.420 
she was sleeping in it or it was an
ambien<00:04:09.750> title<00:04:10.170> property<00:04:10.350> I'm<00:04:10.950> not<00:04:11.220> really

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
ambien title property I'm not really

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.940 
ambien title property I'm not really
sure<00:04:11.819> so<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:12.180> can't<00:04:12.720> I<00:04:12.930> can't<00:04:13.200> actually<00:04:13.620> come<00:04:13.799> in

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
sure so I can't I can't actually come in

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.490 
sure so I can't I can't actually come in
what<00:04:14.220> she<00:04:14.370> was<00:04:14.489> actually<00:04:14.730> doing<00:04:15.060> but<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.200> take

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
what she was actually doing but I take

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.400 
what she was actually doing but I take
this<00:04:16.650> off<00:04:16.829> at<00:04:17.070> night<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.579> so<00:04:18.000> therefore<00:04:18.630> the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
this off at night and so therefore the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.629 
this off at night and so therefore the
curl<00:04:19.680> pattern<00:04:19.709> really<00:04:20.430> stays<00:04:20.760> in<00:04:21.120> if<00:04:22.639> it

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
curl pattern really stays in if it

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.159 
curl pattern really stays in if it
started<00:04:23.970> which<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.330> hasn't<00:04:24.510> started<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:25.020> look

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
started which it hasn't started to look

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.440 
started which it hasn't started to look
dry<00:04:25.440> or<00:04:25.470> anything<00:04:25.889> but<00:04:26.729> with<00:04:26.910> what<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.270> was

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
dry or anything but with what I was

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.060 
dry or anything but with what I was
saying<00:04:27.660> with<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.870> Moroccan<00:04:28.500> oil<00:04:28.650> in<00:04:28.950> the

saying with the Moroccan oil in the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.950 
saying with the Moroccan oil in the
leave-in<00:04:29.280> conditioner<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:30.210> actually<00:04:30.720> gives

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
leave-in conditioner it actually gives

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.050 
leave-in conditioner it actually gives
it<00:04:31.229> keeps<00:04:31.620> it<00:04:32.010> with<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.340> shine<00:04:32.639> look<00:04:32.850> and

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
it keeps it with that shine look and

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.679 
it keeps it with that shine look and
it's<00:04:34.370> if<00:04:35.370> you

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:36.689 
it's if you

expensive hair and now I would have to
say<00:04:52.079> this<00:04:52.559> hair<00:04:52.949> is<00:04:53.189> cheap<00:04:54.019> it's<00:04:55.019> very<00:04:55.469> easy<00:04:55.919> to

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
say this hair is cheap it's very easy to

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.699 
say this hair is cheap it's very easy to
maintain<00:04:57.389> like<00:04:57.899> I<00:04:57.989> said<00:04:58.169> I<00:04:58.199> hadn't<00:04:58.559> actually

00:04:58.699 --> 00:04:58.709 
maintain like I said I hadn't actually

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:00.769 
maintain like I said I hadn't actually
curl<00:04:59.279> for<00:04:59.489> here<00:04:59.669> so<00:05:00.089> I<00:05:00.149> don't<00:05:00.209> know<00:05:00.419> how<00:05:00.599> it

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:00.779 
curl for here so I don't know how it

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.379 
curl for here so I don't know how it
won't<00:05:01.049> actually<00:05:01.289> do<00:05:01.799> curl<00:05:02.339> and<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:02.999> don't<00:05:03.149> plan

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
won't actually do curl and I don't plan

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.209 
won't actually do curl and I don't plan
on<00:05:03.449> curling<00:05:03.989> hair<00:05:04.199> either<00:05:04.409> because<00:05:04.799> I<00:05:04.979> just

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
on curling hair either because I just

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:09.409 
on curling hair either because I just
wanted<00:05:05.579> a<00:05:05.789> wet<00:05:06.860> wave<00:05:07.860> type<00:05:08.339> look<00:05:08.639> and<00:05:08.909> this

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
wanted a wet wave type look and this

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.409 
wanted a wet wave type look and this
actually<00:05:10.079> does<00:05:10.289> that<00:05:10.319> well<00:05:10.889> for<00:05:11.219> me<00:05:11.419> I'm

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
actually does that well for me I'm

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.529 
actually does that well for me I'm
thinking<00:05:12.479> this<00:05:13.229> particular<00:05:14.219> hair<00:05:14.489> could<00:05:14.849> end

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
thinking this particular hair could end

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.089 
thinking this particular hair could end
up<00:05:15.749> less<00:05:15.989> than<00:05:16.019> a<00:05:16.379> really<00:05:16.589> really<00:05:16.889> long<00:05:17.069> time

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
up less than a really really long time

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.139 
up less than a really really long time
so<00:05:17.969> what<00:05:18.119> I'll<00:05:18.300> do<00:05:18.539> is<00:05:19.339> maybe<00:05:20.339> in<00:05:20.579> another<00:05:20.879> week

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:21.149 
so what I'll do is maybe in another week

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:23.209 
so what I'll do is maybe in another week
or<00:05:21.300> two<00:05:21.360> I<00:05:21.569> would<00:05:21.959> do<00:05:22.050> another<00:05:22.289> review<00:05:22.709> on<00:05:22.889> here

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
I wash it that's gonna be the test to

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.469 
I wash it that's gonna be the test to
see<00:05:43.379> how<00:05:43.499> it<00:05:43.679> holds<00:05:43.949> up<00:05:44.039> after<00:05:44.339> I<00:05:44.369> wash<00:05:44.639> it<00:05:44.669> but

see how it holds up after I wash it but

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.419 
see how it holds up after I wash it but
I<00:05:45.689> have<00:05:45.929> been<00:05:45.959> wetting<00:05:46.529> it<00:05:46.619> and<00:05:46.800> it<00:05:46.919> still<00:05:47.219> has

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:47.429 
I have been wetting it and it still has

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:48.829 
I have been wetting it and it still has
been<00:05:47.639> doing<00:05:47.849> really<00:05:47.999> good<00:05:48.119> and<00:05:48.329> I<00:05:48.419> think<00:05:48.659> I've

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:48.839 
been doing really good and I think I've

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.319 
been doing really good and I think I've
waited<00:05:49.019> maybe<00:05:49.379> I<00:05:49.860> want<00:05:50.519> to<00:05:50.610> say<00:05:50.729> maybe<00:05:50.879> three

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:51.329 
waited maybe I want to say maybe three

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:52.659 
waited maybe I want to say maybe three
four<00:05:51.569> times

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
four times

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.189 
four times
I've<00:05:53.669> waited<00:05:53.909> and<00:05:54.179> it<00:05:54.329> drives<00:05:54.569> really<00:05:54.719> really

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
I've waited and it drives really really

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.419 
I've waited and it drives really really
fast<00:05:55.409> so<00:05:57.019> what<00:05:58.019> I'll<00:05:58.199> do<00:05:58.379> is<00:05:58.589> at<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:59.009> bottom

00:05:59.419 --> 00:05:59.429 
fast so what I'll do is at the bottom

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:01.519 
fast so what I'll do is at the bottom
I'll<00:05:59.999> leave<00:06:00.389> everything<00:06:00.659> that<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.139> actually

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:01.529

States so I got the hair in maybe three

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.330 
States so I got the hair in maybe three
days<00:06:28.020> and<00:06:29.020> the<00:06:29.140> shippi<00:06:29.440> wasn't<00:06:29.800> bad<00:06:29.920> to<00:06:30.100> get<00:06:30.220> it
