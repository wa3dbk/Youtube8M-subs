00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.610 
them basic techniques and then they just
had<00:01:00.220> a<00:01:00.250> good<00:01:00.430> time<00:01:00.670> learning<00:01:01.300> some<00:01:01.630> some<00:01:02.470> new

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
had a good time learning some some new

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.040 
had a good time learning some some new
things<00:01:02.890> on<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.220> obstacles<00:01:03.700> and<00:01:03.960> think<00:01:04.960> they

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
things on the obstacles and think they

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.870 
things on the obstacles and think they
challenge<00:01:05.500> themselves<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:06.280> they'll

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
challenge themselves and they'll

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.360 
challenge themselves and they'll
probably<00:01:07.120> be<00:01:07.330> back<00:01:07.510> so<00:01:07.930> i<00:01:08.170> think<00:01:09.160> it<00:01:09.280> was

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
probably be back so i think it was

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:18.030 
probably be back so i think it was
worthwhile<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:10.560> they<00:01:11.560> had<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:11.710> good<00:01:11.860> time<00:01:17.040> it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
worthwhile and they had a good time it

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.040 
worthwhile and they had a good time it
