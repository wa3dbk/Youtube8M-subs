decision for me

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.020 
decision for me
music<00:01:11.060> I'm<00:01:11.179> fashioning<00:01:12.340> well<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:13.399> think<00:01:13.460> the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
music I'm fashioning well I think the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.080 
music I'm fashioning well I think the
relationship<00:01:14.570> we<00:01:14.660> both<00:01:14.899> like<00:01:15.200> they're<00:01:15.679> so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
relationship we both like they're so

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.060 
relationship we both like they're so
interlocked<00:01:17.090> really<00:01:17.600> so<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:18.679> can't<00:01:18.920> really

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
interlocked really so you can't really

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.609 
interlocked really so you can't really
do<00:01:19.280> one<00:01:19.460> without<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.909> other<00:01:19.940> in<00:01:20.360> my<00:01:20.420> mind<00:01:20.810> you

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
do one without the other in my mind you

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.100 
do one without the other in my mind you
know<00:01:21.649> I<00:01:21.979> think<00:01:22.610> modeling<00:01:23.119> for<00:01:23.509> me<00:01:23.630> if<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:23.899> didn't

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
know I think modeling for me if I didn't

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.800 
know I think modeling for me if I didn't
have<00:01:24.229> music<00:01:24.380> while<00:01:24.740> modeling

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
have music while modeling

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.319 
have music while modeling
able<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.079> do<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:27.130> if<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.430> with<00:01:27.820> music<00:01:28.180> I

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
able to do it and if I with music I

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.719 
able to do it and if I with music I
think<00:01:28.390> modeling<00:01:28.750> is<00:01:28.990> just<00:01:29.049> it<00:01:29.590> teaches<00:01:30.369> me<00:01:30.520> how

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
think modeling is just it teaches me how

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.420 
think modeling is just it teaches me how
to<00:01:30.880> perform<00:01:31.270> properly<00:01:31.540> so<00:01:32.079> like<00:01:33.070> they<00:01:33.250> both

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
to perform properly so like they both

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.230 
to perform properly so like they both
affect<00:01:33.820> each<00:01:33.939> other

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
affect each other

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.620 
affect each other
um<00:01:35.110> I<00:01:35.500> think<00:01:35.770> musically<00:01:36.399> when<00:01:36.670> kind<00:01:37.149> of<00:01:37.240> goes

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
um I think musically when kind of goes

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.240 
um I think musically when kind of goes
on<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.020> different<00:01:38.110> musically<00:01:38.710> it'll<00:01:38.950> affect

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
on and different musically it'll affect

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.670 
on and different musically it'll affect
how<00:01:39.399> I<00:01:39.430> dress<00:01:39.789> as<00:01:40.180> well<00:01:40.390> it's<00:01:41.110> kind<00:01:41.320> of<00:01:41.380> it's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
how I dress as well it's kind of it's

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.620 
how I dress as well it's kind of it's
always<00:01:41.830> been<00:01:42.100> an<00:01:42.369> expression<00:01:42.909> of<00:01:43.060> Who<00:01:43.210> I<00:01:43.270> am<00:01:43.360> at

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
always been an expression of Who I am at

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.810 
always been an expression of Who I am at
the<00:01:43.720> time<00:01:43.869> you<00:01:44.740> know<00:01:44.890> now<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.369> teenager

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
the time you know now the teenager

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.899 
the time you know now the teenager
playing<00:01:46.119> football<00:01:46.390> on<00:01:46.689> the<00:01:46.869> track<00:01:47.110> suits<00:01:47.350> and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
playing football on the track suits and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.779 
playing football on the track suits and
know<00:01:48.909> I'm<00:01:49.450> doing<00:01:49.780> music<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.259> I<00:01:50.789> think

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
know I'm doing music and I think

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.440 
know I'm doing music and I think
modeling<00:01:52.240> is<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.729> have<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:55.000> be<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.119> lot<00:01:55.299> more

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
modeling is a you have to be a lot more

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.060 
modeling is a you have to be a lot more
more<00:01:56.049> aware<00:01:56.380> of<00:01:56.530> yourself

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
more aware of yourself

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.330 
more aware of yourself
um<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:58.509> purely<00:01:59.140> physically<00:01:59.740> because<00:02:00.159> you

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
um just purely physically because you

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.889 
um just purely physically because you
don't<00:02:00.580> have<00:02:00.700> anything<00:02:00.940> else<00:02:01.209> to<00:02:01.330> back<00:02:01.539> you<00:02:01.720> up

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
don't have anything else to back you up

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.770 
don't have anything else to back you up
I<00:02:02.170> mean<00:02:02.830> where<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.340> music<00:02:04.060> if<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.360> can<00:02:04.539> sing

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
I mean where the music if you can sing

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.380 
I mean where the music if you can sing
you<00:02:05.110> can<00:02:05.289> perform<00:02:05.649> you<00:02:06.580> can<00:02:06.729> kind<00:02:06.939> of<00:02:07.030> get<00:02:07.179> away

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
you can perform you can kind of get away

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.300 
you can perform you can kind of get away
with<00:02:07.630> maybe<00:02:08.170> being<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.590> bit<00:02:08.709> more<00:02:08.890> cool<00:02:09.069> in<00:02:09.220> the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
with maybe being a bit more cool in the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.660 
with maybe being a bit more cool in the
body

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.710 

I<00:02:56.319> think<00:02:57.220> my<00:02:57.400> personal<00:02:57.640> style<00:02:58.090> was<00:02:58.390> kind<00:02:58.629> of

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
I think my personal style was kind of

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.050 
I think my personal style was kind of
had<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.830> explain<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.129> other<00:03:00.519> day<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:00.819> I<00:03:00.879> think

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
had to explain the other day and I think

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.750 
had to explain the other day and I think
I<00:03:01.150> said<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.540> was<00:03:01.659> on<00:03:01.810> polite<00:03:02.230> Punk<00:03:02.560> it's<00:03:03.519> kind

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
I said it was on polite Punk it's kind

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.869 
I said it was on polite Punk it's kind
of<00:03:03.849> you<00:03:04.000> know<00:03:04.030> very<00:03:04.470> proper<00:03:05.470> but<00:03:06.310> then<00:03:06.459> also<00:03:06.700> at

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
of you know very proper but then also at

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.789 
of you know very proper but then also at
the<00:03:06.970> same<00:03:07.120> time<00:03:07.180> its<00:03:07.540> neck<00:03:07.720> braces<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.440> boots

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
the same time its neck braces and boots

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.250 
the same time its neck braces and boots
so<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.220> think<00:03:09.430> all<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.819> Gavin<00:03:10.060> Watson's<00:03:10.480> and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
so I think all the Gavin Watson's and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.140 
so I think all the Gavin Watson's and
all<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.590> photography<00:03:12.250> stuff<00:03:12.430> he<00:03:12.640> did<00:03:12.819> of<00:03:12.940> his

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.110 
all the photography stuff he did of his
youth<00:03:13.379> as<00:03:14.379> really<00:03:14.590> inspired<00:03:14.950> me<00:03:15.190> like<00:03:15.370> with

youth as really inspired me like with
more<00:03:16.360> recent<00:03:16.629> stuff<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.200> then<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.530> think<00:03:18.129> if<00:03:18.250> I

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340
