00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.980
 [Music] 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.839
 [Music] 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.930
 I think that as a team it is made up of seven 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.200
 players nor by 11 for 25 30 players 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.690
 that year takes the campus and this idea does not 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.570
 and tomorrow will come tomorrow. 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.970
 who in the group and have to understand as 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.940
 was rendering in camera the team 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.059
 I was looking from the outside and I need 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.199
 change the line of results that arrive 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.940
 new players 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:56.160
 Of course you need to get acquainted. 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.489
 more and more of complementing 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.850
 players already implemented the word but 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.129
 is to tune in for more than knowing each other 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.200
 The lighter I need a time of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.030
 adapting it to it's natural we 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.000
 to get to the middle of the competition 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.550
 But that's what I always talk about with the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.530
 companions in the locker room the sacrifice 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.780
 He has his rewards. 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.149
 even because we are living this 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.729
 difficulty players who arrived nine 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.880
 it's the sacrifice has to be voted tomorrow 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.610
 delivery aggression and often 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.160
 game becomes difficult because you are 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.849
 able to fit the technical scheme 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.700
 no the tactic is in the field a player 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:41.610
 which has more quality nÃ© maximum height 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.119
 to love a move it is time to 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.849
 adapt the delivery a lot of work and take away 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.310
 the victories so with a victory have 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:52.080
 to be made by 1 to 0 and 6 to 0 with 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.520
 sacrifice has to be made 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.660
 and then we'll fit together let's go 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.099
 find in that identity a 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.759
 winning team and doing is that each 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.759
 stronger day 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.050
 it's time to start winning 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.120
 begins to show good results 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.040
 I think the player is impatient 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.740
 is impatient with this 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.130
 expansion and we need to win then 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.390
 tomorrow closed you do not have another one 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.010
 native is that thing going into the field 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.050
 determined to know that only one 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.800
 interesting result to note that 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.140
 It's going to be bad, it's going to be bad for us. 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.370
 then it is to win this game is between 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.780
 being important as dancing but has 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.880
 players we want players who 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.800
 opportunity with both faces when entering 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.380
 on the team that did not have this opportunity 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.820
 I think it's a game that we have to 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.490
 then having the head of the population 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.630
 knowing that he did not have the result 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.450
 respecting the glorious not to mention that 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.360
 thing told you 're respecting to win 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.330
 No one is talking, is not this the one? 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.470
 my ktm team won scoreless is 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.240
 week football we can talk 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.750
 nothing else that the child is creating a 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.300
 controversial law is not riverside apartment 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.830
 and our fans for just that I had to 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.570
 The team that we have, we have only 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.480
 to think even spoke in reference to the 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.730
 victory confirms system confirms 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.280
 debut the tactical work you saw 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.200
 now for the morning and well 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.700
 responsibility of all the most 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.500
 this for now too 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.780
 unfortunately the international is more 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.760
 near the relegation zone than the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.440
 Liberation Classification Zone 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.360
 so it can be said that it is a game of 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.380
 direct confrontation against the Portuguese 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.390
 not not see it that way is this true 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.780
 the first part of the test which was 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.270
 closer in the block below and from above 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.540
 but it is also true that it is a good 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.430
 results already playing up to play 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.200
 possibility of a two rounds and is 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.600
 on the top of the table at least 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.519
 those postulants to the top 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.470
 but before that is to make a good game and a 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.720
 good result and this is our idea in 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.030
 moment of tactical work - I observed 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.310
 who spoke much of the matter on the ball 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.850
 it is a compression reference and 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.770
 also the issue of pressure marking 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.120
 what changes thing 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.520
 we have to talk about this 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.680
 emphasized in the morning and is a 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.450
 is routinely placed totals 5 per 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.830
 a reference ball deck of the 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.170
 marking 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.550
 the mark in the sector where the ball is 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.739
 exit of the opponent's ball in front 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.750
 but the ball came in the back we 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.120
 young defenders ahead also has 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.750
 weather a line more or less this idea 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.750
 40 meters
