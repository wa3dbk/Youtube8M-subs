day<00:03:30.189> on<00:03:30.430> each<00:03:30.999> hand<00:03:31.469> learn<00:03:32.469> to<00:03:32.650> shoot<00:03:32.889> all<00:03:33.069> of

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
day on each hand learn to shoot all of

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.770 
day on each hand learn to shoot all of
these<00:03:33.430> shots<00:03:33.670> both<00:03:33.909> left-handed<00:03:34.420> and

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
these shots both left-handed and

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:44.110 
these shots both left-handed and
right-handed

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.760 

today<00:03:44.720> we're<00:03:44.840> going<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.020> talk<00:03:45.230> about<00:03:45.380> the

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
today we're going to talk about the

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.339 
today we're going to talk about the
layout<00:03:46.010> shot<00:03:46.520> at<00:03:46.700> two<00:03:46.849> meters<00:03:47.110> this<00:03:48.110> shot

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
layout shot at two meters this shot

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.589 
layout shot at two meters this shot
particularly<00:03:48.830> requires<00:03:49.520> you<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.880> really<00:03:50.180> step

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
particularly requires you to really step

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.809 
particularly requires you to really step
away<00:03:50.780> from<00:03:50.989> your<00:03:51.290> defender<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:52.489> create

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
away from your defender and create

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.210 
away from your defender and create
separation<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:53.780> finish<00:03:54.560> with<00:03:54.770> your<00:03:54.920> core

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
separation and finish with your core

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.600 
separation and finish with your core
again<00:03:56.209> as<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:57.140> ball<00:03:57.290> enters<00:03:57.530> I'm<00:03:58.040> going<00:03:58.550> to

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
again as the ball enters I'm going to

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.759 
again as the ball enters I'm going to
slide<00:03:58.880> underneath<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.660> ball<00:03:59.870> I'm<00:04:00.560> going<00:04:00.680> to

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
slide underneath the ball I'm going to

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.710 
slide underneath the ball I'm going to
use<00:04:00.860> a<00:04:00.890> breast<00:04:01.190> stroke<00:04:01.459> motion<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.209> then<00:04:02.630> I'm

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
use a breast stroke motion and then I'm

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.660 
use a breast stroke motion and then I'm
going<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:02.959> snap<00:04:03.290> over<00:04:03.650> my<00:04:03.800> hips<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.250> finish<00:04:04.519> the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
going to snap over my hips to finish the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.509 
going to snap over my hips to finish the
ball<00:04:04.849> trying<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:05.900> keep<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.260> ball<00:04:06.440> up<00:04:06.680> above<00:04:07.220> my

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
ball trying to keep the ball up above my

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.300 
ball trying to keep the ball up above my
head<00:04:07.730> so<00:04:08.030> that<00:04:08.180> I<00:04:08.209> don't<00:04:08.450> bring<00:04:08.630> my<00:04:08.690> arm

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
head so that I don't bring my arm

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.059 
head so that I don't bring my arm
towards<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.640> defender<00:04:11.830> keeping<00:04:12.830> the<00:04:12.920> ball

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
towards the defender keeping the ball

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.680 
towards the defender keeping the ball
back<00:04:13.280> as<00:04:13.489> far<00:04:13.730> as<00:04:13.849> possible<00:04:14.269> let's<00:04:14.450> take<00:04:14.630> a

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
back as far as possible let's take a

00:04:14.690 --> 00:05:06.559 
back as far as possible let's take a
look<00:04:14.870> at<00:04:14.989> a<00:04:15.019> few

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.249 

as<00:05:06.629> you<00:05:07.409> noticed<00:05:07.830> during<00:05:08.309> those<00:05:08.580> shots<00:05:08.909> I

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
as you noticed during those shots I

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.929 
as you noticed during those shots I
spread<00:05:10.259> out<00:05:10.379> the<00:05:10.529> angles<00:05:10.860> with<00:05:11.159> I'm<00:05:11.339> stepping

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:11.939 
spread out the angles with I'm stepping

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.659 
spread out the angles with I'm stepping
away<00:05:12.059> from<00:05:12.319> it's<00:05:13.319> important<00:05:13.860> how<00:05:14.249> you<00:05:14.279> step

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
away from it's important how you step

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.790 
away from it's important how you step
away<00:05:14.819> to<00:05:15.449> work<00:05:15.599> on<00:05:15.779> all<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.169> angles<00:05:16.589> of<00:05:16.709> the

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
away to work on all the angles of the

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.079 
away to work on all the angles of the
different<00:05:17.129> shots<00:05:17.309> based<00:05:17.639> on<00:05:17.849> where<00:05:17.999> the

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:18.089 
different shots based on where the

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:27.750 
different shots based on where the
defender<00:05:18.569> is<00:05:18.659> sitting

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.790 

flipping<00:05:28.760> the<00:05:28.850> ball<00:05:29.060> this<00:05:29.810> is<00:05:29.870> a<00:05:30.050> skill<00:05:30.470> that's

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
flipping the ball this is a skill that's

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.730 
flipping the ball this is a skill that's
not<00:05:31.100> often<00:05:31.550> taught<00:05:31.790> but<00:05:32.720> it's<00:05:33.320> really

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
not often taught but it's really

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.830 
not often taught but it's really
important<00:05:34.280> to<00:05:34.430> be<00:05:34.550> able<00:05:34.760> to<00:05:34.910> flip<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:35.390> ball<00:05:35.600> on

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
important to be able to flip the ball on

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.100 
important to be able to flip the ball on
the<00:05:36.200> opposite<00:05:36.740> side<00:05:36.950> of<00:05:36.980> your<00:05:37.310> opponent<00:05:38.210> or<00:05:38.330> at

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
the opposite side of your opponent or at

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.410 
the opposite side of your opponent or at
two<00:05:39.290> meters<00:05:39.440> back<00:05:39.890> out<00:05:40.130> you're<00:05:40.910> not<00:05:41.030> tapping

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
two meters back out you're not tapping

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.350 
two meters back out you're not tapping
it<00:05:41.720> out<00:05:41.840> we're<00:05:42.110> flipping<00:05:42.350> it<00:05:42.590> out<00:05:42.680> so<00:05:43.030> I'm<00:05:44.030> just

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
it out we're flipping it out so I'm just

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.000 
it out we're flipping it out so I'm just
flipping<00:05:44.600> with<00:05:44.780> my<00:05:45.140> wrists<00:05:45.500> a<00:05:45.650> little<00:05:45.860> bit

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
flipping with my wrists a little bit

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.970 
flipping with my wrists a little bit
underneath<00:05:46.390> and<00:05:47.390> then<00:05:48.230> I<00:05:48.320> also<00:05:48.470> want<00:05:48.680> to<00:05:48.710> be

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
underneath and then I also want to be

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.060 
underneath and then I also want to be
able<00:05:49.040> to<00:05:49.190> do<00:05:49.310> this<00:05:49.460> from<00:05:49.670> my<00:05:49.880> stomach

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
able to do this from my stomach

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.650 
able to do this from my stomach
quickly<00:05:52.070> often<00:05:52.460> just<00:05:52.670> grabbing<00:05:53.060> it<00:05:53.210> clipping

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
quickly often just grabbing it clipping

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.360 
quickly often just grabbing it clipping
it<00:05:53.780> with<00:05:53.900> my<00:05:54.050> fingers<00:05:54.470> so<00:05:54.500> if<00:05:54.770> we<00:05:54.890> watch<00:05:55.100> in

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
it with my fingers so if we watch in

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.030 
it with my fingers so if we watch in
slow<00:05:55.580> motion<00:05:55.970> I'm<00:05:56.750> just<00:05:57.290> turning<00:05:57.440> my<00:05:57.620> hand<00:05:57.920> a

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
slow motion I'm just turning my hand a

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.430 
slow motion I'm just turning my hand a
little<00:05:58.070> bit<00:05:58.490> to<00:05:58.790> give<00:05:58.940> myself<00:05:59.090> an<00:05:59.420> art<00:05:59.660> cue<00:05:59.930> and

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
little bit to give myself an art cue and

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.550 
little bit to give myself an art cue and
then<00:06:00.830> I'm<00:06:01.010> practicing<00:06:02.050> where<00:06:03.050> it<00:06:03.170> ends<00:06:03.470> up

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
then I'm practicing where it ends up

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.410 
then I'm practicing where it ends up
every<00:06:03.890> time<00:06:04.160> so<00:06:04.520> that<00:06:04.670> I<00:06:04.700> can<00:06:04.970> be<00:06:05.210> more

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
every time so that I can be more

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.660 
every time so that I can be more
accurate<00:06:06.020> with<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:06.920> flip<00:06:07.160> out<00:06:07.340> in<00:06:07.550> any

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
accurate with the flip out in any

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.200 
accurate with the flip out in any
situation<00:06:08.390> one<00:06:09.380> time

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.720 

the<00:06:12.960> natural<00:06:13.440> instinct<00:06:13.890> is<00:06:14.010> for<00:06:14.190> us<00:06:14.280> to<00:06:14.460> reach

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
the natural instinct is for us to reach

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.900 
the natural instinct is for us to reach
to<00:06:14.970> the<00:06:15.060> ball<00:06:15.270> if<00:06:16.110> wolf<00:06:16.950> was<00:06:17.130> coming<00:06:17.460> to<00:06:17.550> attack

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
to the ball if wolf was coming to attack

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.870 
to the ball if wolf was coming to attack
and<00:06:18.120> trying<00:06:18.300> to<00:06:18.360> get<00:06:18.480> the<00:06:18.600> ball<00:06:18.750> if<00:06:19.500> I<00:06:19.710> split

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.700 

this<00:06:25.420> is<00:06:25.540> really<00:06:25.780> important<00:06:26.290> when<00:06:26.350> a<00:06:26.410> drop

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
this is really important when a drop

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.340 
this is really important when a drop
comes<00:06:27.010> back<00:06:27.310> I'm<00:06:27.850> double<00:06:28.630> up<00:06:28.810> and<00:06:29.110> I'm

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
comes back I'm double up and I'm

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.410 
comes back I'm double up and I'm
snapping<00:06:29.860> the<00:06:29.950> ball<00:06:30.100> out<00:06:30.340> I<00:06:30.670> get<00:06:31.060> good<00:06:31.180> enough

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
snapping the ball out I get good enough

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.720
