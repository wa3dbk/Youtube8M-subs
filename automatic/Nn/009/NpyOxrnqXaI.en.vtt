00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.180
 good and alone with the mini camera 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.800
 then we are mentioning their 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.780
 lens is on the front so that 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.340
 can compare the size of the mini 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.610
 camera in my hands really very 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.570
 small if the lens is ready to 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.700
 capture scenes in movements and in high 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.490
 either a high - speed car of 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.690
 competition a helicopter a plane a 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.300
 radio control or doing high sports 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.460
 speed yes or to sign any 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.550
 type of situations in excellent quality 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.550
 well this mini camera also has the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.979
 particularity that can be selected 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.260
 on his side here on this side with 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:42.999
 we visit this visit now but 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.420
 It also has the function of power 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:50.139
 activate by voice if you see here 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.420
 we put where box says on and 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:54.399
 we leave it on we leave it in the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.589
 we can leave in a closed environment that 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.239
 in standby the battery lasts more than 48 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.059
 hours and the mini camera only 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.879
 will start filming if they listen to any 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.770
 noise in the place this is 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.479
 especially 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.840
 when you want to watch someone or 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:14.530
 watch someone in a place that does not enter 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.630
 nobody yes good let's try it 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.060
 we go on the one hand to turn it on 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.240
 how it works is very simple there 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.880
 we can not see the little light 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.439
 on we are going to point it to the side 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.759
 of the notebook that we have on my right 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.480
 that we can use to reproduce the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:38.100
 videos with just one click 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:41.130
 the reader does not go from being blue to green and 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 there is already filming hello hello hello hello 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.270
 hello hello hello let's put my hand through 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.980
 in front hello hello hi hello hello hello 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.020
 well good with that enough what 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.020
 we have also with just one click 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.590
 Dominican being so small we can 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.570
 put it inside a place 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.430
 we can camouflage it small 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.430
 we want if it's a mini camera that 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.319
 allows to be easily camouflaged and we go 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.380
 to briefly test activation by 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.380
 voice 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.069
 let's light it up well there we have it 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.049
 in watermelon 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.480
 and let's see before we activate it 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.240
 now when I start talking if the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.710
 camera starts recording alone 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.710
 then first we make silence 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.110
 hello hello hello hi hello 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.510
 hello hello is here and it was activated with my 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.760
 good voice 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.760
 we have also if we click 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.100
 is going to stop and there it is now for 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.410
 play them to play the videos 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.030
 that we just did we have the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.770
 notebook with the cable that we had 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.950
 shown earlier that is coming 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.100
 included we connect from one side to the mini 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.100
 usb 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.629
 and on the notebook and the usb cable 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.500
 with the camera already with the whole 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.870
 let's look for some angle 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.870
 there already recognizes me the device 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.020
 with any external memory 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.550
 we enter the folder we see the videos 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.590
 what are we going to do 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.590
 let's play the first 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.180

 and we're going to finally give the second 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.680

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:10.409
