00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
palette and this is the thing now it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.130 
palette and this is the thing now it
doesn't<00:01:30.210> do<00:01:30.570> much

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
doesn't do much

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.850 
doesn't do much
sometimes<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.119> it<00:01:33.119> talks<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:34.470> most<00:01:34.710> of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
sometimes it just it talks but most of

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.069

the<00:01:35.009> times<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.670> sits<00:01:35.939> there<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.390> think<00:01:36.720> it

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the times it just sits there I think it

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.490 
the times it just sits there I think it
meditates<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.040> gathers<00:01:38.189> chakra<00:01:39.500> that's

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
meditates and it gathers chakra that's

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.969 
meditates and it gathers chakra that's
that's<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> only<00:01:41.100> thing<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.579> does<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> yeah<00:01:43.680> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979

I<00:04:19.859> might<00:04:20.580> make<00:04:20.760> more<00:04:21.030> like<00:04:21.210> it<00:04:21.419> in<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.660> future
