this<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.399> version<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.579> I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
this is going to be the version that I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.500 
this is going to be the version that I
transposed<00:00:48.180> for<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> 4-string<00:00:49.440> bass<00:00:50.059> and<00:00:51.059> what

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
transposed for a 4-string bass and what

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.470 
transposed for a 4-string bass and what
I<00:00:51.539> do<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.960> hit<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> open<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.829> once<00:00:53.219> now<00:00:54.180> instead

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I do is hit the open a once now instead

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.450 
I do is hit the open a once now instead
of<00:00:54.539> using<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.020> open<00:00:55.440> ace<00:00:55.590> here<00:00:55.860> some<00:00:56.219> people

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
of using the open ace here some people

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.880 
of using the open ace here some people
use<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.789> fifth<00:00:57.300> fret<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> e-string<00:01:00.890> like

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
use the fifth fret of the e-string like

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.529 
use the fifth fret of the e-string like
that<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.760> think<00:01:02.910> that's<00:01:03.059> more<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.359> how<00:01:03.480> he

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that and I think that's more like how he

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.740 
that and I think that's more like how he
plays<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.989> -<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.729> like<00:01:05.729> using<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.330> open<00:01:06.630> A's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
plays it - but I like using the open A's

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.149 
plays it - but I like using the open A's
for<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.740> sounds

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
for this one just because it sounds

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.960 
for this one just because it sounds
really<00:01:08.369> nice<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> fourth<00:01:09.750> string<00:01:09.869> um<00:01:10.970> so

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
really nice on the fourth string um so

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.399 
really nice on the fourth string um so
you're<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.270> hit<00:01:12.420> an<00:01:12.570> opening<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.380> then

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
you're going to hit an opening and then

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.520 
you're going to hit an opening and then
you're<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> hit<00:01:14.340> four<00:01:14.670> open<00:01:15.090> a's<00:01:15.530> just

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
like that and then you're going to hit

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.800 
like that and then you're going to hit
the<00:01:19.020> third<00:01:19.259> fret<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> e-string<00:01:20.810> followed

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:11.800 
you hit one and then there's a pause and
then<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.220> -<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:10.670> here's<00:03:10.850> there's<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.510> way<00:03:11.780> I

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
then you - and here's there's the way I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.510 
then you - and here's there's the way I
was<00:03:12.049> playing

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
was playing

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.830 
was playing
I<00:03:15.370> think<00:03:16.370> that's<00:03:16.640> where<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.090> way<00:03:17.210> he<00:03:17.360> plays<00:03:17.570> it

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
I think that's where the way he plays it

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.190 
I think that's where the way he plays it
in<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:18.890> studio<00:03:19.190> version<00:03:19.720> that's<00:03:20.720> what<00:03:20.870> my<00:03:21.020> ear

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
in the studio version that's what my ear

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.230 
in the studio version that's what my ear
is<00:03:21.320> is<00:03:21.620> hearing<00:03:21.920> anyway<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:22.940> when<00:03:23.120> you're

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
is is hearing anyway so when you're

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.490 
is is hearing anyway so when you're
playing<00:03:23.420> this<00:03:23.660> it's<00:03:23.870> really<00:03:24.050> important

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
playing this it's really important

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.530 
playing this it's really important
especially<00:03:24.920> since<00:03:25.640> I'm<00:03:25.820> playing<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.150> opening

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
especially since I'm playing the opening

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.030 
especially since I'm playing the opening
here<00:03:26.810> if<00:03:27.200> you<00:03:27.290> want<00:03:27.440> if<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:27.620> want<00:03:27.770> to<00:03:27.830> play<00:03:27.950> it
