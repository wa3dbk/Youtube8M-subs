00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.560
 Yes 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.330
 present you a new one 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.080
 semi-automatic top phone 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.390
 spectator it's obvious from the race car 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.130
 manufacturers as from their main 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.340
 purpose of this production model 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.680
 training and harvesting protrusion weighing from 30 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.770
 up to 100 grams 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:46.370
 overall size width is 59 centimeters 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.480
 depth 65 places and 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.310
 130 cm power 075 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.310
 connects to a 380 volt outlet 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.710
 massive base of covered 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.960
 white powder enamel principle 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.750
 work is to divide a piece of dough 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.930
 placed on the molding plate on 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.299
 credit blanks equal magician molding 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.430
 plate made of high strength 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.600
 plastic safe when in contact with 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.600
 food 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.270
 as you see on molding plants 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.580
 there is a slight indentation in the aftermath 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.580
 it is in them that ours will be rounded 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:30.390
 test blanks will start using the grid 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.119
 on the gear lever 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.510
 made mixed purely having a balance 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:41.710
 and downward nature of their sector 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.979
 we make the knife 0 to share on the lid 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.090
 dough dividers set screw with scale 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.369
 the value of which corresponds to 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.100
 specific location of the test 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.590
 blanks and adjusts the distance between 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.220
 lowered plate and plastic 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.640
 base such as blanks weighing 50 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.119
 gram 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:09.899
 corresponds to the value of 5 set the sofa 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:09.899
 and fix the lock nut 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.060
 electromechanical control panel 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.930
 consists of analog switches to 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.700
 turning on the machine and buttons on and on 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:41.110
 turning off the unit rounding as well 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.829
 status indicators further we omit 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.570
 lever adjusting mechanism trees and 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:53.410
 move growling height adjustment 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:55.660
 our work centers as you see 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.440
 when we start moving the lever 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.040
 adjusting the height of the dough piece 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.170
 the top plate hits the screw height 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.530
 which corresponds to the established 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.549
 us a value of 5 or dough before preparation 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.549
 weighing 50 grams 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.980
 to start the rounding process 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.980
 including 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.590
