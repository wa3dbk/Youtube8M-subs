 students of the educational institution marshal sucre of sampués 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.190
 biology subject 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.309
 the research project developing creativity through the wiki 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.749
 effect of paint solvents on human health 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.720
 sampués capital artisanal of the sheets is a municipality with a 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.939
 approximate population of 42 thousand inhabitants whose origins are diverse 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.910
 because in recent years many people have been forced by the 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.739
 violence that Colombia lives 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.390
 these people live with the descendants of the zenú ethnic group that 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.699
 they have their settlement in the area their economy is based on three lines 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.059
 productive as are the artisanal agriculture and the wood industry 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.580
 artisanal activity is the one that generates the most employment and articulates the 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.880
 productive chains of wood, leather, vegetable fibers and others 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.840
 plant materials that are produced in the region 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.240
 It is as much the boom that the wood industry has had that the workshops 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.940
 they have multiplied demanding raw materials such as wood, paintings, fabrics and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.960
 ornaments to turn them into living room furniture 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.590
 bedroom and office 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.460
 hundreds of people depend on this work in a direct way or 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.030
 Indirect take their sustenance for what is considered the most productive sector 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.330
 in the coastal municipality during the production process of the products 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.710
 workers must use organic solvents 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.560
 paints and dyes that serve to give the product a colorful and aesthetic touch 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.880
 A visit to these workshops reveals a problem 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.380
 related to safety and risks to which the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.310
 workers in this sector 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.990
 a nissan draw paint swear and refine the products with volatile material from 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.570
 high toxicity for humans due to its mutagenic nature 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.829
 carcinogenic and irritant of the respiratory tract according to reports of 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.600
 investigations carried out in this field 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.610
 many of them are not registered with health promoting entities nor have they 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.859
 been trained in basic industrial safety procedures 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.840
 Therefore, studies are currently underway to evaluate the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.649
 state of the workers to have the memory deficit difficulty for 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.290
 concentrate depression irritability visuospatial skills and memory 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.290
 Verb mutant genes and diseases in families 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.959
 the findings have been shocking since conditions have been found 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.279
 related to the activity of solvents 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:28.849
 The solutions proposed by the group are the following first training 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.659
 and individual management of worker safety second training 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.089
 and group management through the owners of the workshops 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:41.179
 third training and integral management through the health office 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.099
 public municipal 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.129
 The solution chosen by the group is the third because it is an activity 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.419
 that involves many people and that their security can not be left in the hands of 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.200
 people who do not have the competence to secure a job with few 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.939
 occupational hazards 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.939
 The work plan to follow is as follows 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.529
 bring together the affected population and the owners of the workshops 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.009
 second, train them in industrial safety and sensitize them about 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:14.079
 risks that continue to work in this way the third review their 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.229
 affiliation to the health system 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:21.159
 collectively ensure the population committed to life insurance 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:26.089
 fifth to manage the necessary equipment and exercise in its use 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.829
 sex coordinate a system of permanent revision of work 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.209
 accomplished 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.879
 7º to adapt the ventilation of the workshops and the wineries of 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.399
 storage 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.919
 thanks to the collaboration of the workshop owners of the municipality of 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.519
 sampués for collaborating in this work
