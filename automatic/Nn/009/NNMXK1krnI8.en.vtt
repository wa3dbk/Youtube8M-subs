platform level thing yeah but I'd like
to<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> platform<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.930> build<00:01:22.259> up

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
to get a platform and kind of build up

on<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.250> instead<00:01:23.909> what's<00:01:24.240> nicer<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.720> do

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
on to it but instead what's nicer to do

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
on to it but instead what's nicer to do
is<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.070> go<00:01:26.220> through<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.640> inventory

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
is if you go through in your inventory

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.950 
is if you go through in your inventory
and<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.290> look<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.770> clear<00:01:29.220> cube<00:01:30.150> you'll

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and you look for a clear cube you'll

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.700 
and you look for a clear cube you'll
find<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.790> called<00:01:33.090> an<00:01:33.180> energy<00:01:33.540> well<00:01:33.750> if

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
find this it's called an energy well if

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.359 
find this it's called an energy well if
you<00:01:34.829> right<00:01:35.100> click<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.579> oh<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:37.229> see<00:01:37.530> it'll

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
you right click it oh you see it'll

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.200 
you right click it oh you see it'll
start<00:01:38.610> floating<00:01:38.880> up<00:01:40.159> so<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.400> base<00:01:41.939> now

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
start floating up so this is base now

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.950 
start floating up so this is base now
this<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> start<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.950> your<00:01:44.340> legacy<00:01:45.299> as<00:01:45.720> it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
this to the start of your legacy as it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.910 
this to the start of your legacy as it
were<00:01:46.640> okay<00:01:47.640> oh<00:01:48.119> wrong<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.439> yeah

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
were okay oh wrong on one so yeah

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.399 
were okay oh wrong on one so yeah
it's<00:01:50.520> probably<00:01:50.820> best<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.299> make<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> kind<00:01:52.320> of

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
it's probably best if you make a kind of

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.910 
it's probably best if you make a kind of
stairs<00:01:53.479> so<00:01:54.479> what<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.780> connect<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.409> from<00:01:55.649> ground

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
stairs so what I connect it from ground

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.050 
stairs so what I connect it from ground
to<00:01:56.130> ship<00:01:56.579> what<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.509> do<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.729> yeah<00:01:59.729> that's

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
