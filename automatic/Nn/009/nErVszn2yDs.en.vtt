00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.919
 bm application in the appstore we are 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.690

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.110
 already presented my small selection 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.839
 there was world cup or something else today 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.369
 the application of the sports show for free 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.750
 for iphone ipad that you should 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.539
 probably ten because of the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.160
 promised video highlights the world 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.600
 cup application we want to have a short one 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.279
 look at it in the video because the to 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.599
 one of the paid and owned 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.460
 as we find a very good impression 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.920
 this is the top left corner of the picture 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.390
 image when I use the states as before 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.309
 my completely closed the otherwise 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.329
 always look at the start screen 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.379
 then this is one of the application's 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.020
 a complete overview of all 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.180
 games are there and 12 very nice with 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.800
 Additional features in it we see here 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.090
 we have the current ones first 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.860
 games are there now the whole 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.930
 friendly games in front of the wm 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.489
 we can see which ones are coming 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.649
 can see us which played 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.000
 were and here you get the same 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.859
 times impressive as the making if we 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.020
 look at brazil panama 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.699
 or on tuesday the discharged 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.220
 event then we have here completely 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.720
 Good overview of who's for the gates 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.369
 has been responsible verdi 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.780
 when has his replacement 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.369
 who gave a red who a yellow 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.500
 has got card and can do the whole thing 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.290
 Here is a view of the times 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.939
 brazilian but also look at 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.420
 other teams switchen and then get 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.619
 because again the values ​​displayed 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.240
 apart from these individual play 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.159
 which we have in here below we have 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.659
 but the statistics see where that 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.189
 was carried out and so we have 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.930
 really well done as I think 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.369
 We have the opportunity I jump 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.869
 here again in the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.460
 to show the power of the table 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.250
 Of course only makes sense if that does me 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.390
 also in full trains runs down here 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.850
 gives button in germany 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.560
 then we only get the games of the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.119
 German national team displayed 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.649
 now here also in advance with the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.439
 corresponding friendly games and 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.970
 company germany cameroon for my sake 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.470
 we have the possibility of statistics 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.810
 to be displayed, too 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.060
 really only active when the wm 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.950
 started and in which he pats and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.579
 that is a very nice additional feature 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.439
 here 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.479
 there is once the option us the 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.159
 to let arena know that now 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.520
 who does not want me so 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.019
 But the calendar here is one 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.940
 a possibility of that can then namely 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.739
 say oh yes I want in any case 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.050
 Know Bank Lost vs. England plays 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.750
 and for my sake, El Salvador 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.019
 against Ivory Coast and can here 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.790
 above click save and then places 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.150
 he me the two selected 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.620
 play as calendar dates off that was 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.390
 a very good option is not available in 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.160
 many applications and maybe 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.690
 still a good addition to the push 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.780
 Messages you turn on 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.290
 if there are gates then that is in 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.549
 large and total gbm demarcation been 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.650
 we can show it here again 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.970
 let there it is divided into 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.519
 eighth-finals and so on and so forth 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.110
 we are not yet and get it because of it 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.670
 lasts no info yet but 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.980
 which is an application believes the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.959
 cost eur 80 cents or so belongs to 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.190
 the better and the one too 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.989
 the number is also reduced 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.810
 Many people try results therefore 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.250
 still with news and look here you can 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.319
 you still show that and any 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.549
 in the dish and me 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.950
 think it's just fine if you just 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.390
 the games have the calendars 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.900
 exhibition can look at it 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.489
 can 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.769
 who somehow scored the goal and 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.100
 I like who was sent off 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.850
 Well 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.850
