00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.769
 Well I'll tell you today we're launching 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.210
 is the first device based on 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.429
 blanquerÃ­as with a screen of 5 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.709
 inches and a battery that can us 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.140
 support up to 25 hours the mixed process 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.880
 besides that we are launching it to 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.670
 Mexico market since a version of 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.710
 software 10.2 that among the benefits that 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.960
 offers us is a much renewed software 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.080
 more efficient and much more agile than 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.939
 learn faster from the continuous use of 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.340
 your habits 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.940
 there is a dual-core processor of 1.7 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.130
 graphic part of 95 adcor then for 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.130
 all the part of multimedia games is a 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.530
 much more agile device besides that 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.410
 we have two gigs in ram 16gb of memory 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.500
 flash that we can grow it up to 80 with 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.590
 an SD memory of 64 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.030
 the hdmi output obviously and with this 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.920
 team we are already offering a better 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.260
 glaucoma experience 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.109
 brings a way in which you can put the 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.509
 phone as they connect on devices 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.700
 peripherals through the output of 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.350
 loading port and use your 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.479
 device in a much more way 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.700
 easy the antenna for tech is a 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.350
 blackberry technology z-30 is the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.860
 first team in which we are not 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.049
 incorporating that allows us to be in 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.480
 low signal coverage conditions 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.860
 the antenna opens to the maximum suspends 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.200
 so that we never stay 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.780
 incommunicado there are fewer and more cut 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.670
 and there is never the bad quality of 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.790
 sound and in full conditions 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.450
 coverage what allows us is under the 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.670
 contraction of the antenna 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.550
 good the battery is a greater amperage and 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.140
 is a 25-hour mixed use between the 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.520
 time you leave the phone in the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.850
 desk while you are working 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.340
 while you are driving you can have 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 the first thing is housing that allows us 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.350
 answer the duel any 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.350
 notification without needing 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.929
 with instant notifications that 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.180
 come from your emails 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.560
 coming from your social networks like 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.049
 that appear on the top of the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.140
 screen and there the doors without any 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.510
 problem with a touch the birds in addition to 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.019
 that we continue to specialize all the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.389
 multimedia part both history maker 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.280
 they had other stories and then we 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.469
 allow to deliver a better quality of 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.569
 better video quality photos like the one 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.689

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.900
 and on top of that good new 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.900
 Applications 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.890

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.599
