on<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> Amoskeag<00:00:18.119> northern<00:00:18.630> recently<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.500> was

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
on the Amoskeag northern recently I was

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.470 
on the Amoskeag northern recently I was
able<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:19.980> finish<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.460> main<00:00:20.670> line<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.119> with

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
able to finish the main line and with

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.700 
able to finish the main line and with
that<00:00:21.689> being<00:00:21.869> done<00:00:22.140> it's<00:00:22.260> time<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.560> start

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
that being done it's time to start

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.140 
that being done it's time to start

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
and decoders to the layout so that it

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.200 
and decoders to the layout so that it
can<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.220> run<00:00:26.430> using<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.820> railroad<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
can be run using the railroad and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.450 
can be run using the railroad and

Valley Depot which makes a decoder that
actually<00:00:37.350> uses<00:00:37.710> model<00:00:38.040> airplane<00:00:38.399> servos<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180

throw<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.050> switches<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.620> decided<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.700> check

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
throw the switches I decided to check

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.090 
throw the switches I decided to check
them<00:00:42.030> out<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.540> ordered<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> couple<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.649> use

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
them out and I ordered a couple to use

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.799 
them out and I ordered a couple to use
them<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.579> layout<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.420> I've<00:00:45.539> decided

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
them here on the layout and I've decided

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.090 
them here on the layout and I've decided
it's<00:00:46.170> gonna<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.440> something<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.829> I'm<00:00:47.010> going

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
it's gonna be something that I'm going

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.979 
it's gonna be something that I'm going
to<00:00:47.160> use<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.670> turnouts<00:00:48.059> basically

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
to use on all the turnouts basically

then if you want to get the mounts for

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.499 
then if you want to get the mounts for
them<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.890> chose<00:01:32.189> -<00:01:32.460> those<00:01:33.000> are<00:01:33.180> initial

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
them like I chose - those are initial

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.780 
them like I chose - those are initial
two<00:01:33.630> dollars<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.079> fifty<00:01:34.200> cents<00:01:34.560> apiece<00:01:34.790> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
two dollars and fifty cents apiece the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.249 
two dollars and fifty cents apiece the
mounts<00:01:36.090> allow<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.360> service<00:01:36.689> would<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.110> pop

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
mounts allow the service would just pop

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.719 
mounts allow the service would just pop
right<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.100> there's<00:01:38.250> double-sided

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
right in and then there's double-sided

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.950 
right in and then there's double-sided
tape<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.329> sticks<00:01:39.540> right<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
tape it just sticks right to the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.260 
tape it just sticks right to the
underneath<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.560> your<00:01:40.950> bench<00:01:41.189> work

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
underneath of your bench work

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.600 
underneath of your bench work
I<00:01:42.299> was<00:01:42.810> concerned<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> Taurus<00:01:44.189> machines

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
I was concerned with the Taurus machines

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.310 
I was concerned with the Taurus machines
that<00:01:45.000> their<00:01:45.299> weight<00:01:45.570> would<00:01:45.869> probably

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
that their weight would probably

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.679 
that their weight would probably
eventually<00:01:46.530> work<00:01:47.100> their<00:01:47.280> way<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.030> pull

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
eventually work their way out and pull

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.929 
eventually work their way out and pull
themselves<00:01:48.869> out<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.500> foam<00:01:49.759> bench<00:01:50.759> work

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
themselves out of the foam bench work

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.120 
themselves out of the foam bench work
that<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.119> use<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.720> layout<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.920> these

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
that I use here on the layout with these

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.670 
that I use here on the layout with these
are<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.549> lightweight<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.899> sticky<00:01:55.200> tape<00:01:55.350> holds

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
are so lightweight the sticky tape holds

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.319 
are so lightweight the sticky tape holds
them<00:01:55.799> up<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.189> comes<00:01:56.369> with<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> couple<00:01:56.729> screws<00:01:57.060> if

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
them up it comes with a couple screws if

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.389 
them up it comes with a couple screws if
you<00:01:57.450> need<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.750> use<00:01:57.930> them<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.070> found<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
you need to use them but I found the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.940 
you need to use them but I found the
sticky<00:01:59.729> tape<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> be<00:02:00.240> firm<00:02:00.509> enough<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:01.049> did<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
sticky tape to be firm enough I did the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.980 
sticky tape to be firm enough I did the
put<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.700> two<00:02:02.909> screws<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.390> there<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.840> kind

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
put the two screws in there just to kind

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.590 
put the two screws in there just to kind
of<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:04.579> if<00:02:05.579> there's<00:02:05.820> any<00:02:05.939> twisting<00:02:06.390> action

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
of see if if there's any twisting action

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.119 
of see if if there's any twisting action
that<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.020> would<00:02:07.110> kind<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.320> keep<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.649> down<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that it would kind of keep that down to

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.249 
that it would kind of keep that down to
a<00:02:08.160> minimum<00:02:08.459> I'll<00:02:09.420> take<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.629> look<00:02:09.780> at<00:02:09.959> one<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
a minimum I'll take a look at one of the

that are out there you have the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.770 
that are out there you have the
traditional<00:02:35.730> method<00:02:36.120> like<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.480> would<00:02:36.630> use

with<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.050> tortoise<00:02:37.440> kind<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> fulcrum

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
with the tortoise kind of like a fulcrum

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.450 
with the tortoise kind of like a fulcrum
and<00:02:38.850> then<00:02:39.660> how<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.080> have<00:02:40.500> mine<00:02:40.770> installed<00:02:41.190> here

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
and then how I have mine installed here

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.660 
and then how I have mine installed here
is<00:02:41.670> using<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.510> crank<00:02:43.250> basically<00:02:44.250> what<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.400> did<00:02:44.520> is

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
is using a crank basically what I did is

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.440 
is using a crank basically what I did is
I<00:02:44.910> bought<00:02:45.060> some<00:02:45.390> K&amp;S<00:02:46.430> 1/16<00:02:47.430> inch<00:02:47.670> brass<00:02:47.910> tubing

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
I bought some K&amp;S 1/16 inch brass tubing

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.500 
I bought some K&amp;S 1/16 inch brass tubing
which<00:02:49.050> runs<00:02:49.380> down<00:02:49.680> through<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:50.220> foam<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
which runs down through the foam on the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.900 
which runs down through the foam on the
layout<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:51.990> then<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.800> rod<00:02:53.010> comes<00:02:53.400> up<00:02:53.580> through

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
layout and then the rod comes up through

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.660 
layout and then the rod comes up through
it<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.270> put<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.110> couple<00:02:55.350> 90-degree<00:02:56.220> bends<00:02:56.520> at<00:02:56.640> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
it I put a couple 90-degree bends at the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.610 
it I put a couple 90-degree bends at the
top<00:02:56.940> where<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.300> can<00:02:57.360> see<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.720> hooks<00:02:57.930> into<00:02:58.140> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
top where you can see it hooks into the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.280 
top where you can see it hooks into the
switch<00:02:59.160> rod<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.820> then<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.540> goes<00:03:00.720> down<00:03:00.960> through

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
switch rod and then it goes down through

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.110 
switch rod and then it goes down through
the<00:03:01.440> -<00:03:01.590> through<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.190> bench<00:03:02.370> work<00:03:02.610> down<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.880> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
the - through the bench work down to the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.060 
the - through the bench work down to the
servo<00:03:03.480> where<00:03:03.660> there's<00:03:03.840> two<00:03:03.990> other<00:03:04.200> 90-degree

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.790 
servo where there's two other 90-degree
bends<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.990> give<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.350> little<00:03:07.530> bit<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.740> a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
bends and to give it a little bit of a

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.830 
bends and to give it a little bit of a
twisting<00:03:08.220> action<00:03:08.400> for<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.910> arm<00:03:09.090> on<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.450> servo

I<00:03:23.490> think<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.090> moves<00:03:24.300> pretty<00:03:24.480> smooth<00:03:24.930> and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
I think it moves pretty smooth and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.550 
I think it moves pretty smooth and
pretty<00:03:25.770> lit<00:03:26.010> realistically<00:03:26.730> at<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.090> speed

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
pretty lit realistically at that speed

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.980 
pretty lit realistically at that speed
I'll<00:03:28.560> show<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:28.920> here<00:03:29.130> what<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.370> looks<00:03:29.520> like

quiet there's an auto fine feature on

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.580 
quiet there's an auto fine feature on
the<00:03:53.220> decoder<00:03:53.580> which<00:03:53.850> allows<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.510> move<00:03:55.260> the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
the decoder which allows it to move the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.240 
the decoder which allows it to move the
switch<00:03:55.920> rod<00:03:56.130> back<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.670> forth<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:58.260> find<00:03:58.680> out

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
switch rod back and forth to find out

basically<00:04:02.460> there's<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.700> jumper<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.270> you<00:04:03.360> move

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
basically there's a jumper that you move

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.360 
basically there's a jumper that you move
from<00:04:03.720> pits<00:04:04.020> two<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:04.500> three<00:04:04.710> you<00:04:04.950> move<00:04:05.130> it<00:04:05.250> to

from pits two and three you move it to

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.890 
from pits two and three you move it to
two<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.730> one<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.210> automatically<00:04:06.780> goes

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900

two and one and it automatically goes
back<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:07.590> forth<00:04:07.620> finding<00:04:08.160> on<00:04:08.250> how<00:04:08.460> far<00:04:08.700> it

take a look and I'll show you how to set

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.000 
take a look and I'll show you how to set
up<00:04:28.920> down<00:04:29.190> there<00:04:30.140> so<00:04:31.140> this<00:04:31.410> is<00:04:31.470> how<00:04:31.710> its<00:04:31.830> set<00:04:31.980> up

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
up down there so this is how its set up

underneath<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.640> bench<00:04:32.790> work<00:04:33.060> as<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.390> can<00:04:33.510> see

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
underneath the bench work as you can see

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.000 
underneath the bench work as you can see
it's<00:04:33.900> just<00:04:34.140> bare<00:04:34.440> foam

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
it's just bare foam

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.950 
it's just bare foam
I<00:04:35.040> have<00:04:35.400> crossmembers<00:04:36.210> about<00:04:36.510> every<00:04:36.780> two<00:04:36.930> to

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
I have crossmembers about every two to

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.500 
I have crossmembers about every two to
three<00:04:37.260> feet<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.770> support<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.460> foam<00:04:38.700> but<00:04:39.330> other

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
three feet to support the foam but other

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.270 
three feet to support the foam but other
than<00:04:39.600> that<00:04:39.720> that's<00:04:40.050> pretty<00:04:40.320> much<00:04:40.470> it

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
than that that's pretty much it

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.920 
than that that's pretty much it
you<00:04:41.580> can<00:04:41.700> see<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.940> two<00:04:42.090> screws<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.690> left

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
you can see the two screws to the left

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.810 
you can see the two screws to the left
or<00:04:43.080> right<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.440> added<00:04:43.830> those<00:04:43.980> just<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.370> keep<00:04:44.520> that

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
or right I added those just to keep that

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.080 
or right I added those just to keep that
mount<00:04:45.420> from<00:04:45.690> twisting<00:04:46.170> just<00:04:46.380> in<00:04:46.950> case<00:04:47.160> but

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
mount from twisting just in case but

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.670 
mount from twisting just in case but
like<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.330> said<00:04:48.450> before<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:48.930> mount<00:04:49.140> comes<00:04:49.410> with

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
like I said before the mount comes with

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.010 
like I said before the mount comes with
double<00:04:50.340> sided<00:04:50.550> tape<00:04:50.700> and<00:04:51.120> that<00:04:51.630> held<00:04:51.870> it

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
double sided tape and that held it

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.750 
double sided tape and that held it
pretty<00:04:52.230> well<00:04:52.380> on<00:04:52.620> there<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:53.370> can<00:04:53.490> see<00:04:53.670> the

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
pretty well on there you can see the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.340 
pretty well on there you can see the
brass<00:04:54.000> tubing<00:04:54.450> coming<00:04:54.780> down<00:04:54.960> through<00:04:55.260> the

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
brass tubing coming down through the

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.820 
brass tubing coming down through the
mount<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.770> then<00:04:56.490> switch<00:04:57.420> throw<00:04:57.750> rod<00:04:57.960> comes

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
mount and then switch throw rod comes

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.430 
mount and then switch throw rod comes
down<00:04:59.100> makes<00:04:59.880> two<00:05:00.090> 90-degree<00:05:00.630> bends<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.200> then

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
down makes two 90-degree bends and then

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.300 
down makes two 90-degree bends and then
it<00:05:01.590> goes<00:05:01.770> into<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:03.780> arm<00:05:04.410> for<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.920> servo

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
it goes into the the arm for the servo

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.080 
it goes into the the arm for the servo
so<00:05:06.030> that<00:05:06.240> you<00:05:06.330> can<00:05:06.890> throw<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:07.980> points<00:05:08.340> and

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
so that you can throw the points and

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:29.230 
so that you can throw the points and
I'll<00:05:09.180> show<00:05:09.330> you<00:05:09.390> how<00:05:09.570> it<00:05:09.660> works<00:05:09.870> down<00:05:10.110> here

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.080 

works<00:05:30.240> pretty<00:05:30.509> smooth<00:05:30.750> as<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.259> can<00:05:31.470> see

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
works pretty smooth as you can see

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.999 
works pretty smooth as you can see
towards<00:05:33.090> where<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.389> meets<00:05:33.569> the<00:05:33.780> stock<00:05:34.650> rails

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.580 
towards where it meets the stock rails
the<00:05:35.550> servo<00:05:36.120> is<00:05:36.150> moving<00:05:36.659> just<00:05:36.690> a<00:05:36.990> little<00:05:37.020> bit<00:05:37.379> on

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
the servo is moving just a little bit on

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.249 
the servo is moving just a little bit on
both<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:38.099> throne<00:05:38.550> and<00:05:38.849> the<00:05:39.449> closed<00:05:39.720> commands

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
both the throne and the closed commands

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.700 
both the throne and the closed commands
I<00:05:40.440> don't<00:05:41.159> think<00:05:41.460> that<00:05:42.020> this<00:05:43.020> one<00:05:43.229> is<00:05:43.259> fitting

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
I don't think that this one is fitting

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.499 
I don't think that this one is fitting
all<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:44.039> well<00:05:44.220> in<00:05:44.520> that<00:05:44.759> bracket<00:05:45.300> so<00:05:45.419> I'm

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
all that well in that bracket so I'm

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:46.640 
all that well in that bracket so I'm
probably<00:05:45.659> going<00:05:45.870> to<00:05:45.960> have<00:05:46.050> to<00:05:46.080> take<00:05:46.289> it<00:05:46.349> out

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
probably going to have to take it out

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.890 
probably going to have to take it out
and<00:05:46.860> just<00:05:46.919> take<00:05:47.759> a<00:05:47.789> look<00:05:48.030> at<00:05:48.240> to<00:05:48.419> see<00:05:48.629> that

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
and just take a look at to see that

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.559 
and just take a look at to see that
there's<00:05:49.080> nothing<00:05:49.490> keeping<00:05:50.490> it<00:05:50.789> from<00:05:51.000> seating

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
there's nothing keeping it from seating

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.930 
there's nothing keeping it from seating
properly<00:05:52.080> and<00:05:52.530> also<00:05:52.680> most<00:05:53.400> likely<00:05:53.729> we'll<00:05:53.849> also

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
properly and also most likely we'll also

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.309 
properly and also most likely we'll also
have<00:05:54.270> to<00:05:54.479> add<00:05:54.960> some<00:05:55.970> temporary<00:05:56.970> adhesive<00:05:57.449> just

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 
have to add some temporary adhesive just

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.890 
have to add some temporary adhesive just
to<00:05:58.409> kind<00:05:58.590> of<00:05:58.680> keep<00:05:58.830> it<00:05:59.039> from<00:05:59.220> shifting<00:05:59.580> around

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
to kind of keep it from shifting around

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.689 
to kind of keep it from shifting around
the<00:06:00.900> other<00:06:01.050> servo<00:06:01.530> it<00:06:01.740> fits<00:06:02.009> in<00:06:02.159> perfectly<00:06:02.580> it

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
the other servo it fits in perfectly it

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.100 
the other servo it fits in perfectly it
doesn't<00:06:02.970> move<00:06:03.030> around<00:06:03.150> so<00:06:03.509> I<00:06:03.539> think<00:06:03.659> this<00:06:03.930> one

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
doesn't move around so I think this one

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.600 
doesn't move around so I think this one
just<00:06:04.139> had<00:06:04.409> some<00:06:04.620> flash<00:06:04.919> or<00:06:05.159> something<00:06:05.460> that

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
just had some flash or something that

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
just had some flash or something that
I'm<00:06:05.699> going<00:06:05.819> to<00:06:05.880> have<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.030> go<00:06:06.180> in<00:06:06.330> and<00:06:06.449> take<00:06:06.599> a

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
I'm going to have to go in and take a

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:16.879 
I'm going to have to go in and take a
look<00:06:06.900> at
