with recon line is that we really want
to<00:00:17.310> challenge<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:17.940> sort<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.240> traditional

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
to challenge it's sort of traditional

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.320 
to challenge it's sort of traditional
thinking<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.470> our<00:00:19.740> end<00:00:19.980> users<00:00:20.430> both<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.180> their

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
thinking of our end users both in their

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.750 
thinking of our end users both in their
training<00:00:21.720> applications<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.830> their<00:00:23.250> tactical

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
training applications and their tactical

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.179 
training applications and their tactical
applications<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> new<00:00:25.680> series<00:00:25.920> of

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
applications so we have a new series of

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.179 
applications so we have a new series of
trainers<00:00:26.730> three<00:00:27.599> colors<00:00:27.960> black<00:00:28.349> shadow<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
kind of in the uniform look and then

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.350 
kind of in the uniform look and then
this<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.130> little<00:00:35.489> bit<00:00:35.700> more<00:00:35.850> contrast

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
this one is a little bit more contrast

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.600 
this one is a little bit more contrast
the<00:00:37.260> idea<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> coloring<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.460> this

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the idea with the coloring is that this

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.819 
the idea with the coloring is that this
is<00:00:38.760> all<00:00:38.910> sort<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.300> working<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:39.960> multicam

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
is all sort of working with multicam

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.860 
is all sort of working with multicam
color<00:00:41.190> palette<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.760> absolutely<00:00:42.360> camera

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
color palette so absolutely camera

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.049 
color palette so absolutely camera
compatible<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.460> take<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.760> through<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
compatible but if I take you through the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.869 
compatible but if I take you through the
features<00:00:45.829> really<00:00:46.829> there's<00:00:47.039> kind<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.430> bunch

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
features really there's kind of a bunch

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.400 
features really there's kind of a bunch
of<00:00:48.000> aspects<00:00:48.450> going<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.260> it's

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
of aspects going on here but it's

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.020 
of aspects going on here but it's
playing<00:00:49.739> off<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.250> minimalist<00:00:50.789> running

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
California construction so it's meant to

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.370 
California construction so it's meant to
be<00:02:33.100> used<00:02:33.540> sockless<00:02:34.540> if<00:02:34.690> you'd<00:02:34.870> like<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.350> you

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380
