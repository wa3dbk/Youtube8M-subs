00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
mountain bikes we build bikes here from

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.590 
mountain bikes we build bikes here from
tubing<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> steel<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.800> titanium<00:00:17.600> comes

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.550 
tubing out of steel and titanium comes
in<00:00:18.779> here<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.260> get<00:00:19.880> machines<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.289> do<00:00:22.289> real

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
in here and we get machines and do real

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.109 
in here and we get machines and do real
accurate<00:00:22.949> fit<00:00:23.160> up<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.550> joints<00:00:23.880> here<00:00:24.029> you

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
accurate fit up to the joints here you

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.670 
accurate fit up to the joints here you
can<00:00:24.269> see<00:00:24.449> all<00:00:24.570> these<00:00:24.689> two<00:00:24.869> here<00:00:25.199> been<00:00:25.380> prepped

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
can see all these two here been prepped

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:35.310 
can see all these two here been prepped
to<00:00:25.859> do<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> run<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> bike

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.450 

so<00:00:36.320> here<00:00:36.500> we've<00:00:36.620> got<00:00:36.740> our<00:00:36.800> dolmen<00:00:37.160> machine

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
so here we've got our dolmen machine

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.250 
so here we've got our dolmen machine
that<00:00:37.940> I'm<00:00:38.060> in<00:00:38.240> the<00:00:38.330> process<00:00:38.480> of<00:00:38.870> setting<00:00:39.020> up

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
that I'm in the process of setting up

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.380 
that I'm in the process of setting up
here<00:00:43.240> we<00:00:44.240> spin<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.140> tube<00:00:45.320> down<00:00:46.060> to<00:00:47.060> a<00:00:47.120> point

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
here we spin the tube down to a point

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.650 
here we spin the tube down to a point
and<00:00:47.600> then<00:00:48.350> put<00:00:48.530> a<00:00:48.560> notch<00:00:48.770> in<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.240> so<00:00:50.240> we<00:00:50.330> can<00:00:50.480> fit

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
and then put a notch in it so we can fit

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.900 
and then put a notch in it so we can fit
the<00:00:50.690> dropout<00:00:51.140> in<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:51.560> have<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.220> light<00:00:52.430> strong

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
the dropout in and have a light strong

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.170 
the dropout in and have a light strong
joint<00:00:53.710> when<00:00:54.710> you're<00:00:54.860> accelerating<00:00:55.430> or<00:00:55.970> when

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
joint when you're accelerating or when

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.330 
joint when you're accelerating or when
you're<00:00:56.330> sprinting<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:57.350> get<00:00:57.530> better<00:00:57.739> energy

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
you're sprinting you get better energy

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.950 
you're sprinting you get better energy

tubes<00:01:16.850> going<00:01:17.150> on<00:01:17.240> here<00:01:17.510> for<00:01:17.540> our<00:01:17.750> titanium

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
tubes going on here for our titanium

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.350 
tubes going on here for our titanium
models<00:01:18.740> that<00:01:19.280> help<00:01:19.400> build<00:01:19.670> in<00:01:19.850> more<00:01:20.030> stiffness

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
models that help build in more stiffness

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.060 
models that help build in more stiffness
in<00:01:20.869> titanium<00:01:21.229> it's<00:01:21.500> not<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.650> different

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
in titanium it's not a different

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.100 
in titanium it's not a different
material<00:01:22.160> is<00:01:22.550> steel<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:23.570> we<00:01:23.690> get<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.869> lot<00:01:24.050> more

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
material is steel so we get a lot more

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.590 
material is steel so we get a lot more
stiffness<00:01:24.890> out<00:01:24.979> of<00:01:25.100> titanium<00:01:25.610> by<00:01:25.729> beefing<00:01:26.540> it

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
stiffness out of titanium by beefing it

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:58.940 
stiffness out of titanium by beefing it
up

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.440 

and<00:01:59.950> this<00:02:00.100> is<00:02:00.220> our<00:02:00.340> first<00:02:00.550> tech<00:02:00.850> frame<00:02:01.150> in<00:02:01.360> this

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
and this is our first tech frame in this

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.330 
and this is our first tech frame in this

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
check to make sure that what we set up

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.570 
check to make sure that what we set up
is<00:02:06.909> what<00:02:07.090> we<00:02:07.210> wanted<00:02:07.479> people<00:02:08.250> call<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.429> ask

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
is what we wanted people call and ask

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.390 
is what we wanted people call and ask
this<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.000> weight<00:02:10.179> loss<00:02:10.209> clinic
