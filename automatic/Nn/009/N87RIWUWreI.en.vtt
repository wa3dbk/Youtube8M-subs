00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.450
 just company 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.200
 I 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.200
 of university 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.600
 if a pair of final 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.090
 in fact that a parish had gone but 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.520
 they wanted to do it with mass there 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.950
 parish secretary of the round is not 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.110
 can but because it cannot be done with mass 6 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.020
 council recommends doing so always with 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.080
 mass cannot be held because more than 20 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.809
 minutes you can not but why why there 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.710
 they are also the shifts and we want the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.530
 put parades two shifts and get married 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.050
 with the mass they had to pay two 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.769
 shifts this is a sin of scandal 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.830
 when those who are in the temple are 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.559
 priests lay secretary but they have 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.379
 to manage in the temple the pastoral care of 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.470
 temple become businessmen people yes 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.710
 scandalizes and we are responsible for 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.570
 this also laymen and all because if 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.270
 I see that in my parish it is done 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.060
 this I must have the courage to say 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 in the face of the stage and people suffer with 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.670
 the bait merlot the curious the people of 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.850
 god knows how to forgive his priests have one 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.580
 weakness slips on a sin but knows 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.790
 forgive but are things that the people of 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.910
 god cannot forgive an attacked priest 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.450
 to the money is a priest who abuses the 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.480
 people do not come to forgive and do it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.270
 scandal when the temple to the house of god 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.490
 becomes a business case with that 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.400
 marriage they rented he asked but 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.680
 because jesus has it with the money he has it 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.300
 with money because redemption is 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.460
 gratuitous the gratuitousness of God he comes to 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.340
 bring us the total gratuitousness of love 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.790
 of god and when the church asked them 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.680
 they become a far east and it is said that it is not 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.799
 it is so free to salvation 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.630
 and for this that Jesus takes the whip 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.330
 in hand to do this ritual of 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.940
 purification of the temple today one 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.959
 liturgy celebrates the presentation of the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.900
 madonna at the temple 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.659
 the girl from a simple woman like 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.870
 anna a few moments the madonna enters 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:25.430
 that she teaches us all to all 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.680
 parish priests to all those we have 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.680
 pastoral responsibility to maintain 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.290
 clean the temple to receive with love 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.849
 those who come as each of them 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.849
 were the Madonna
