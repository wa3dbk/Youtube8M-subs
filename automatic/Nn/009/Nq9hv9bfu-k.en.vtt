00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 Subaru of Naa of belonging wrapped Hello Sagamihara par 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.420
 The ball introduced this time was newly released by the integrator 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.650
 Code black special 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:18.490
 I would like to introduce Black sp in this edition. 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:24.760
 First of all, it's a layout child 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:27.420
 The thing 1/2 in buffer 31 Those who pp 6 inch masu bias from the pin 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:33.000
 It is set 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:36.180
 Special of the first code black as the latest code series 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.810
 Edition version is now on sale 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:48.060
 This time, the basic spec is exactly the same as code black though 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:54.750
 It is slightly by changing the balance of the compounding amount 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:57.420
 The ball is characterized by a very sharp back end reaction than the original code black 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.899
 I think it's good 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.939
 It's a bit earlier than this code red 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.020
 That cover stock is a pearl material and this is a hybrid so code 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.860
 Unpleasant Ya is more of bed 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:16.510
 To a strong as a state in the oil 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:22.600
 Although correspondence in a wide range of good conditions was possible 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:26.170
 This time towards the sp is the basic of the base is of medium center and say either in the pearl 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 I think it is a ball 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.370
 It became a ball that I like the most in You're Well quite a code series in the I 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.350
 I am 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.100
 It was immediately or code black launched a code red, but here 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.670
 After all the ball 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:49.680
 It is strong because the very You're much stronger and the back-end of the reaction 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.890
 Because it is a ball that can throw in a totally different image, code 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.880
 Black and this action 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:01.450
 Can be used in combination with powder dore and behavioral black sp 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.450
 I think that these two types will give you a solid lineup . 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.520
 Pretty backend is strong 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:14.770
 If you run out too much, that's too late 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.080
 We recommend sanding, such as a 4000 number or in lathe 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.069
 And 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.430
 This time 4 a 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:25.629
 It is the layout of the action red to compare 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:31.379
 Pink pp 6 inches Bye wow in a 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:31.379
 I'm going to throw a pin 3 per inch 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.420
 Ah ah Aan
