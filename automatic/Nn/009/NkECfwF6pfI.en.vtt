it's<00:00:01.660> back<00:00:01.900> here<00:00:01.930> and<00:00:02.470> today<00:00:02.740> I<00:00:02.770> have<00:00:02.950> a<00:00:03.429> glitch

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:03.730 
it's back here and today I have a glitch

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.970 
it's back here and today I have a glitch
for<00:00:04.029> you<00:00:04.240> on<00:00:04.480> transit<00:00:05.350> so<00:00:05.500> what<00:00:05.650> you<00:00:05.740> want<00:00:05.920> to

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:05.980 
for you on transit so what you want to

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.280 
for you on transit so what you want to
do<00:00:06.070> is<00:00:06.280> come<00:00:06.610> to<00:00:06.760> the<00:00:06.850> power<00:00:07.030> with<00:00:07.360> a<00:00:07.390> infinite

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290 
do is come to the power with a infinite

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.740 
do is come to the power with a infinite
turbine<00:00:09.100> then<00:00:09.760> you<00:00:09.880> want<00:00:10.120> to<00:00:10.180> place<00:00:10.480> the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
turbine then you want to place the

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.570 
turbine then you want to place the
turbine<00:00:11.200> by<00:00:11.590> the<00:00:12.309> power<00:00:13.000> room<00:00:13.530> where<00:00:14.550> you<00:00:15.550> have

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
turbine by the power room where you have

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.480 
turbine by the power room where you have
to<00:00:15.940> for<00:00:16.209> pack-a-punch<00:00:16.720> and<00:00:17.199> this<00:00:18.190> will

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
to for pack-a-punch and this will

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.430 
to for pack-a-punch and this will
permanently<00:00:18.970> open<00:00:19.660> pack<00:00:19.869> a<00:00:19.900> punch<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.720> as<00:00:23.080> long

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.440 
permanently open pack a punch so as long

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.230 
permanently open pack a punch so as long
as<00:00:23.650> you<00:00:23.830> don't<00:00:24.100> pick<00:00:24.310> up<00:00:24.400> another<00:00:24.699> turbine

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
as you don't pick up another turbine

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.320 
as you don't pick up another turbine
then<00:00:26.199> you<00:00:26.680> should<00:00:26.920> be<00:00:27.070> good<00:00:27.100> by<00:00:27.670> the<00:00:27.730> way<00:00:27.850> you

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
then you should be good by the way you

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.509 
then you should be good by the way you
do<00:00:28.750> not<00:00:28.990> have<00:00:29.289> to<00:00:29.439> throw<00:00:29.650> a<00:00:29.680> grenade<00:00:30.070> at<00:00:30.279> your

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
do not have to throw a grenade at your

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.580 
do not have to throw a grenade at your
infinite<00:00:31.090> turbine<00:00:31.480> if<00:00:31.720> you<00:00:31.900> know<00:00:32.199> that<00:00:32.439> it's

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
infinite turbine if you know that it's

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.530 
infinite turbine if you know that it's
already<00:00:33.390> invincible<00:00:34.390> or<00:00:34.600> infinite<00:00:36.329> but<00:00:37.329> I<00:00:37.360> do

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
already invincible or infinite but I do

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.410 
already invincible or infinite but I do
just<00:00:38.050> to<00:00:38.260> make<00:00:38.290> sure<00:00:38.710> because<00:00:39.040> it's<00:00:39.760> always

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
just to make sure because it's always

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.479 
just to make sure because it's always
good<00:00:40.780> just<00:00:40.809> to<00:00:41.260> double<00:00:41.559> check<00:00:41.590> because<00:00:42.010> you

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
good just to double check because you

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.370 
good just to double check because you
don't<00:00:43.030> want<00:00:43.149> to<00:00:43.239> be<00:00:43.329> wrong<00:00:43.600> and<00:00:43.960> be<00:00:44.050> like<00:00:44.200> oh

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
don't want to be wrong and be like oh

5 rounds into it um so this is just
showing<00:00:52.450> you<00:00:52.750> guys<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:54.480> place<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.629> turbine<00:00:56.050> now

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
showing you guys I place the turbine now

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.790 
showing you guys I place the turbine now
I<00:00:56.379> go<00:00:56.680> all<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.100> way<00:00:57.129> to<00:00:57.760> town<00:00:58.719> which<00:00:59.199> takes<00:00:59.620> a

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
I go all the way to town which takes a

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.709 
I go all the way to town which takes a
little<00:00:59.949> bit<00:01:00.160> by<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:00.969> way<00:01:01.090> if<00:01:01.180> you<00:01:01.300> guys<00:01:01.420> want

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
little bit by the way if you guys want

little bit by the way if you guys want
to<00:01:01.809> actually<00:01:01.930> see<00:01:02.350> inside<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.890> fog<00:01:03.129> go<00:01:03.789> ahead

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
to actually see inside the fog go ahead

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.889 
to actually see inside the fog go ahead
and<00:01:05.100> look<00:01:06.100> through<00:01:06.340> my<00:01:06.459> videos<00:01:06.819> you<00:01:07.509> should<00:01:07.539> be

and look through my videos you should be
able<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.109> just<00:01:08.409> type<00:01:08.649> no<00:01:08.950> fog<00:01:09.279> glitch<00:01:09.670> and

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
able to just type no fog glitch and

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.190 
able to just type no fog glitch and
you'll<00:01:11.259> find<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:12.329> also<00:01:13.329> if<00:01:13.810> you<00:01:13.929> don't<00:01:14.049> know

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
you'll find it also if you don't know

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.989 
you'll find it also if you don't know
how<00:01:14.289> to<00:01:14.409> do<00:01:14.529> the<00:01:14.649> infinite<00:01:15.130> turbine<00:01:15.490> glitch<00:01:15.789> or

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:15.999 
how to do the infinite turbine glitch or

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:19.649 
how to do the infinite turbine glitch or
the<00:01:16.119> invincible<00:01:16.630> turbine<00:01:17.020> glitch<00:01:17.319> that<00:01:18.659> video

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
the invincible turbine glitch that video

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.690 
the invincible turbine glitch that video
will<00:01:19.899> be<00:01:19.929> in<00:01:20.109> the<00:01:20.259> description<00:01:21.899> and<00:01:22.899> so<00:01:23.289> yeah

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
will be in the description and so yeah

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.510 
will be in the description and so yeah
so<00:01:24.700> once<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:25.509> get<00:01:25.749> to<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:26.380> power<00:01:26.560> you'll

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
so once you get to the power you'll

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.419 
so once you get to the power you'll
notice<00:01:27.939> that<00:01:28.179> it<00:01:28.359> opens<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.139> then<00:01:30.099> it<00:01:30.249> just

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
notice that it opens and then it just

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.969 
notice that it opens and then it just
stays<00:01:30.639> open<00:01:30.849> like<00:01:31.599> I<00:01:31.719> sit<00:01:31.959> here<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.499> I'm

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
stays open like I sit here and I'm

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.959 
stays open like I sit here and I'm
fast-forwarding<00:01:33.639> at<00:01:34.299> times<00:01:34.630> 6<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:35.729> by<00:01:36.729> now<00:01:36.909> it

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
fast-forwarding at times 6 and by now it

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.789 
fast-forwarding at times 6 and by now it
should<00:01:37.090> have<00:01:37.299> opened<00:01:37.659> and<00:01:37.810> closed<00:01:38.079> at<00:01:38.349> least<00:01:38.380> a

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
should have opened and closed at least a

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.699 
should have opened and closed at least a
few<00:01:38.950> times<00:01:39.249> because<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:40.719> turbine<00:01:41.200> will<00:01:41.439> shut

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
few times because the turbine will shut

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:43.919 
few times because the turbine will shut
down<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:41.950> then<00:01:42.340> turn<00:01:42.669> back<00:01:42.700> on<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.539> shut<00:01:43.749> down

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
down and then turn back on and shut down

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.409 
down and then turn back on and shut down
and<00:01:44.259> turn<00:01:44.439> back<00:01:44.619> on<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.700> as<00:01:45.849> you<00:01:45.999> notice<00:01:46.299> with

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:46.419 
and turn back on but as you notice with

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:48.449 
and turn back on but as you notice with
this<00:01:46.599> it<00:01:46.840> always<00:01:47.109> stays<00:01:47.590> open<00:01:47.979> so<00:01:48.219> it<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:48.399> a

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
this it always stays open so it is a

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.309 
this it always stays open so it is a
really<00:01:49.090> good<00:01:49.270> glitch<00:01:49.539> for<00:01:49.719> you<00:01:49.840> guys<00:01:49.989> to<00:01:50.200> do
