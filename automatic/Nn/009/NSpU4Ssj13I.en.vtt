00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
hit before you get this eight but you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.020

depending<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:28.080> you're<00:01:28.259> playing

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
depending on what you're playing

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.370 
depending on what you're playing
depending<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.630> what<00:01:30.750> you're<00:01:30.869> playing<00:01:31.020> at<00:01:31.290> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
depending on what you're playing at you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.810 
depending on what you're playing at you
might<00:01:31.560> only<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:31.920> four<00:01:32.220> or<00:01:32.250> five<00:01:32.340> notes

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
might only have like four or five notes

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.929 
might only have like four or five notes
before<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.509> hit<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.439> actual<00:01:35.070> man<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.790> know

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
before you hit the actual man you know

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.760 
before you hit the actual man you know
that<00:01:35.970> you're<00:01:36.210> trying<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.540> hit<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:37.320> dramatic

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that you're trying to hit for dramatic

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.469 
that you're trying to hit for dramatic
effect<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.280> basically<00:01:38.670> you're<00:01:38.850> building<00:01:39.060> up

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
effect so basically you're building up

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.420 
effect so basically you're building up
to<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> note<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.740> once<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.040> get<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
to the note and once you get to the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.219 
to the note and once you get to the
notes<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.729> kind<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.210> make<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> sound<00:01:42.869> so

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
notes you kind of just make it sound so

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.260 
notes you kind of just make it sound so
think<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:47.149> is<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.390> simple<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.960> could<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.380> it

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
think so is that simple you could do it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.139 
think so is that simple you could do it
you<00:01:51.270> could<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:52.399> safe<00:01:53.399> around<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.759> depending

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
you could do it safe around so depending

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.450 
you could do it safe around so depending
on<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.420> key<00:01:54.600> you're<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.710> could<00:01:55.829> do<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.250> in

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
on what key you're in you could do it in

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.940 
on what key you're in you could do it in
that<00:01:56.700> key<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.689> might<00:01:57.899> be<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.140> new<00:01:58.920> concept

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
that key and this might be a new concept

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.940 
that key and this might be a new concept
for<00:01:59.729> some<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.149> guys<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.750> if<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.590> are

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.959 
for some of you guys but if you are
playing<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:02.790> instance<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.990> key<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.229> G

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
playing for instance in the key of G

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.240 
playing for instance in the key of G
when<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> key<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.329> concert<00:02:06.899> B<00:02:07.079> flat<00:02:07.380> G<00:02:07.680> for

when the key of concert B flat G for

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.420 
when the key of concert B flat G for
alto<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:09.660> would<00:02:09.810> start<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.289> G<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.280> would

can<00:03:40.310> chromatically<00:03:41.060> with<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.850> basically

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
can chromatically with and basically

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.500 
can chromatically with and basically
find<00:03:51.709> as<00:03:51.980> many<00:03:52.190> half<00:03:52.579> of<00:03:52.760> steps<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.299> whole

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
find as many half of steps and whole

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.449 
find as many half of steps and whole
steps<00:03:53.540> between<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.890> note<00:03:55.100> that<00:03:55.280> you're

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
steps between the note that you're

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.210 
steps between the note that you're
trying<00:03:55.670> to<00:03:55.760> get<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.510> ascend<00:03:57.410> up<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:57.769> it

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
trying to get to and ascend up to it

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.979 
trying to get to and ascend up to it
depending<00:03:58.430> on<00:03:58.850> it<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.150> you're<00:03:59.540> gonna<00:03:59.660> send

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
depending on it and you're gonna send

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.920 
depending on it and you're gonna send
down<00:04:00.200> this<00:04:00.709> can<00:04:00.920> go<00:04:01.040> either<00:04:01.280> way

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
down this can go either way

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.870 
down this can go either way
you<00:04:02.930> can<00:04:03.140> add<00:04:03.350> dynamics<00:04:04.070> you<00:04:04.250> can<00:04:04.400> have<00:04:04.549> fun

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
you can add dynamics you can have fun

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:12.370 
you can add dynamics you can have fun
with<00:04:05.090> this<00:04:05.269> so<00:04:06.019> basically<00:04:09.850> you<00:04:10.850> see<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.810> can

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
with this so basically you see you can

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.580 
with this so basically you see you can
go<00:04:13.340> from<00:04:13.609> forte<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.510> piano

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.939 

in<00:04:19.579> put<00:04:19.820> a<00:04:19.850> vibrato<00:04:20.269> on<00:04:20.630> there<00:04:20.870> you<00:04:21.380> know<00:04:21.410> it's

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
in put a vibrato on there you know it's

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.650

another<00:04:32.690> tutorial<00:04:33.110> on<00:04:33.320> how<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.470> do<00:04:33.770> but<00:04:34.400> you

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
another tutorial on how to do but you

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:43.480 
another tutorial on how to do but you
can<00:04:34.699> go<00:04:39.850> and<00:04:40.850> that<00:04:41.690> really<00:04:42.139> is<00:04:42.410> all<00:04:42.680> of<00:04:42.979> the

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
can go and that really is all of the

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.879 
can go and that really is all of the
principles<00:04:44.060> put<00:04:44.210> together<00:04:44.389> but<00:04:45.169> generally

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
principles put together but generally

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.530 
principles put together but generally
what<00:04:46.070> you're<00:04:46.250> doing<00:04:46.639> is<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:46.880> glitz

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
what you're doing is a glitz

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.150 
what you're doing is a glitz
so<00:04:47.810> people<00:04:47.960> gonna<00:04:48.169> be<00:04:48.260> like<00:04:48.410> oh<00:04:48.590> that's<00:04:48.979> nice

so people gonna be like oh that's nice
bliss<00:04:49.550> well<00:04:50.510> actually<00:04:50.750> that<00:04:51.050> was<00:04:51.199> a<00:04:51.229> bend<00:04:51.590> a

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
bliss well actually that was a bend a

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.659 
bliss well actually that was a bend a
vibrato<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:53.120> chromatic<00:04:53.690> glass<00:04:53.840> down<00:04:54.669> but

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
vibrato and a chromatic glass down but

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.490 
vibrato and a chromatic glass down but
all<00:04:56.240> they<00:04:56.570> really<00:04:56.870> worry<00:04:57.169> about<00:04:57.320> is<00:04:57.440> the

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
all they really worry about is the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.250 
all they really worry about is the
glitch<00:04:57.770> because<00:04:58.130> that's<00:04:58.370> what<00:04:58.669> is<00:04:59.090> the

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
glitch because that's what is the

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.080 
glitch because that's what is the
general<00:05:00.260> gist<00:05:00.620> of<00:05:00.800> what<00:05:00.979> they<00:05:01.130> hear<00:05:01.430> they

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
general gist of what they hear they

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.670 
general gist of what they hear they
don't<00:05:02.270> hear<00:05:02.539> the<00:05:02.570> bend<00:05:03.020> they<00:05:03.260> just<00:05:03.470> know<00:05:03.650> that

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
don't hear the bend they just know that

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.529 
don't hear the bend they just know that
the<00:05:04.190> principle<00:05:04.639> thing<00:05:04.789> that<00:05:04.940> you're<00:05:05.090> doing<00:05:05.389> is

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
the principle thing that you're doing is

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.810 
the principle thing that you're doing is
going<00:05:05.780> down<00:05:06.139> or<00:05:06.410> going<00:05:06.650> up<00:05:07.220> depending<00:05:07.550> on<00:05:07.699> how

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
going down or going up depending on how

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.320 
going down or going up depending on how
your<00:05:08.000> glisten<00:05:08.590> so<00:05:09.590> let's<00:05:09.800> review<00:05:10.180> we<00:05:11.180> can

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
your glisten so let's review we can

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.580 
your glisten so let's review we can
Gliss<00:05:11.600> up<00:05:11.810> or<00:05:11.990> down<00:05:12.280> right<00:05:13.280> make<00:05:14.150> sure<00:05:14.389> we<00:05:14.630> we

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
Gliss up or down right make sure we we

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.469 
Gliss up or down right make sure we we
can<00:05:15.740> win<00:05:15.919> glycerin<00:05:16.340> for<00:05:16.460> Mattox<00:05:16.850> we<00:05:17.300> can<00:05:17.419> you
