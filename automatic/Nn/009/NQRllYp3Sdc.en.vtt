 case that is not negligible so 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.769
 there hop we see my city so the goal 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.439
 it is to recover a maximum of money 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.029
 that we do here to be able to buy 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.470

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.260
 that they have who are they are recovered 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.820
 as you go, so of course you 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.410
 have no specific place of the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.440
 city ​​simply the central you 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.820

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.950
 training you have the valley but 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.090
 here you are near all the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.550
 places you can find 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.879
 in the series so the yes that mark I 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.379
 dig me ch'ti burger the characters 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.239
 recurring also quite from the series 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.100

 sports fronts the third part of the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.710
 nuclear city so here I have to ask 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.200
 where there are rigidities to write a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.549
 manifestation so there simply 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.640
 that he's doing it I'm going 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.640
 pass at the same time to the trick 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.090
 he must find before the mayor 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.010
 where I put to the mayor especially that actually 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.720
