00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.220
 Josephine wants inspiration in this video 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.349
 I show you how to make this little one 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.929
 acker makes you need 36 countries 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.020
 and a colored one up here so 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.439
 a total of 37 36 in the main color and 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.050
 an extra and your board what you 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.439
 set so that all pins parallel 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.310
 and additional regional then it can 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.750
 already go 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:37.230
 he starts on your he invited all the pins 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:39.989
 parallel sets so that you always 20 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.810
 takes rubbers and in the middle once in 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.690
 fall direction the rubbers spared 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.530
 yet a second time 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.530
 and 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.010
 a third time 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.270
 then come on rubbers 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.640
 arms go to the side and to the other 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.240
 no matter what you do 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.160
 first to the left or right no matter 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.590
 In any case , the whole is over it 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.000
 then look like this 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:23.190
 and then it goes down 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.190
 four times 12 in total 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.420
 3 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.700
 and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.700
 times 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.940
 so 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.370
 then it goes down to the side 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.490
 but diagonally upwards and to 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.490
 page 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.430
 and a second time also oblique obituary 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.520
 that's how these two dots look 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.619
 I will now additionally 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.420
 extend 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:14.500
 I always take a profit for that 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:19.390
 Develop it three times around a crochet hook 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.390
 and then I take two more rubbers 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:36.200
 and roll the rubber on it and would 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:40.269
 this extension then to one of 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.269
 and pins like here for example 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.420
 give both sides about it 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.170
 so here is the end of the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.560
 so the same here again for the 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.560
 page 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.510
 it is also easier on the whole 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.000
 finger picks you have that way 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.780
 directly more space in it and the whole 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.920
 then I have that over now 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.200
 extended here already 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.800
 I do the same for jews now 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.459
 also 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:46.349
 for each of these two points one 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:48.739
 rubber take two rubbers without over it 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.739
 pull 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.510
 the decrease of the near 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.569
 and feel too 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.600
 that also applies at the same time is conclusion 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.800
 I need to be relaxed down here 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.350
 do more on it 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.840
 the whole is finished and we 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.840
 held together by these rubbers 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:36.170
 so that comes here now sees the whole 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:39.890
 so now i start with the menu 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.420
 I start in one of the endpoints here 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:46.560
 it does not matter which side you go to 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:58.830
 first refuses without the rubbers out and 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:05:02.610
 give them a go down here 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.330
 the cow is through and here 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.330
 to give up 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:16.319
 then I'll get the bottom one down here 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.319
 look out where they are I have them 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:43.960
 and then just the whole row up to 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:46.500
 this point where the poor leave there 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.500
 me now 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.949
 the rubbers from the sides and give them 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.949
 also in the middle 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.580
 It's a bit easier when you do that 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:06.349
 a little bit to the side counts as well 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.030
 here in the middle give everything down 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.460
 to press 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.909
 and now I'll get those too 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.909
 still low 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.170
 These ones 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:40.640
 felt that pull a lot of pressure 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:44.600
 on it and then just now after him 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:48.400
 Always reject everything so now everything is 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:53.840
 in love the whole looks like this now 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:57.640
 and i take my last rubber and 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.640
 pull it once through the front 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:13.610
 through it by itself 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:15.530
 and i can do the whole team the whole way 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.970
 looks like in the end so I hope the 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.340
