00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 we were able to test in detail the 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.600
 freebox min 4 4 running android tv 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.639
 first step of our mini series of 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.170
 videos the one to which all 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.410
 freenautes will be confronted one day 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.580
 the first boxing launch 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.890
 immediately the freebox logo appears 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.609
 then android loading logo 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.230
 the intervention of the user is 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.920
 required for synchronization of the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.500
 remote control 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.789
 this step is completely modeled on 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.650
 that of the freebox revolution 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.300
 it requires these two keys closely 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.940
 simultaneously a few seconds for that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.800
 the atheist commands be apprehended on 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.750
 process then continues with a 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.879
 software developed by free 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.399
 who deals in particular with the whole 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.760
 TV management then boxing 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.760
 restarts 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.280
 after a charming greeting 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.329
 melody one goes to the configuration the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.860
 choice of language is a novelty 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.739
 since we can now opt for 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.120
 English in addition to French 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.710
 google identification is a step 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.399
 optional that you can choose 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.049
 ignore 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.790
 but then you will not have access to 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.380
 google services including 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.070
 download applications on the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.170
 flat store besides the method 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.420
 classic authentication asking 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.460
 to enter his password you can 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.770
 use your pc or smartphone 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.820
 connected to the same network the freebox for 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:30.170
 you authenticate much more 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:32.509
 quickly you will have to validate the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.450
 terms of use and rules 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.009
 Google Privacy Policy 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.380
 this time no way to escape 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.360
 finally you can choose whether the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.110
 applications will have access to your 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.869
 geographical location where we are 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.520
 it's over the menu appears in everything and 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.030
 for everything on a fiber connection 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.610
 optical 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.819
 it only took us five minutes 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.739
 to initialize boxing in adsl because of 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.750
 updates this will probably be a 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:01.129
 little longer is all for this 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.200
 first video we give you an appointment 

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:05.660
 in the sequel where we will explore any 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.819
 the free part of boxing television 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.000
 the recordings and the vod between 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.000
 other
