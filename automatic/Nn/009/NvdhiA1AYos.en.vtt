00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.280
 hello youtube friends good since not 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.520
 I made a video according to these dates 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.070
 I told myself why not do one and that is that 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.080
 few days left for Christmas and good 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.059
 the Christmas that I had is very different 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.820
 to which I see today for example 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.790
 before the children asked for toys and now 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.360
 they ask for cellular tablets computers 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.400
 among them laptops like that were not before or 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.739
 at least the ones that I have seen but 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.350
 Well, it's not the children's fault but 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.630
 the internet at least one xbox or 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.270
 playstation age passable since it was for 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.220
 play but well I had a Christmas 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.590
 very good to see the gifts 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.220
 magically they appear in the tree 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.790
 Christmas 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.770
 xdddd but of course sooner or later I would know 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.619
 the truth about where they came the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.570
 gifts one night I decided to wait for 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.250
 santa claus and I saw the gifts already 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.440
 placed in the pine 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.660
 strange thing since it was not less than 10 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.060
 minutes that I went to bed but good 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.890
 I just gave him the following year 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.290
 I asked my parents who said 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.140
 the gifts and they told me that they 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.270
 obviously I was surprised because I 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.210
 it was the children who seriously believed in 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.490
 santa claus but good and afterwards my 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.580
 parents were giving me things according 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.880
 at my age as clothes they have always 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.770
 They told me and they keep telling me 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.890
 when we buy the money and if not 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.990
 because I do not quite understand that sentence and 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.330
 that my parents had to pay other 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.850
 things and good I had like two Christmases 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.130
 without gifts but good I did not sad myself 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.500
 a lot since my parents told me what 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.200
 material comes and goes but the family just 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.510
 we have it once and that's true already 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.090
 that we do not know until when will we have 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.280

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.530
