00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
do the course and and and I once you go

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.410 
do the course and and and I once you go
that<00:02:41.740> way<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.040> cannot<00:02:42.460> go<00:02:42.700> into<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.120> Spanish

that way you cannot go into the Spanish

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.940 
that way you cannot go into the Spanish
a<00:02:43.510> failure<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:43.930> try<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.470> same<00:02:44.500> thing

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
a failure and try to do the same thing

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.640 
a failure and try to do the same thing
so<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.150> cannot<00:02:46.360> compare<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.900> really<00:02:47.230> but<00:02:47.440> I

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
so so I cannot compare it really but I

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.460 
so so I cannot compare it really but I
