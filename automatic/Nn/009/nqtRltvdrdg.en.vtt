00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 You think I woke up like this. 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.890
 with this amazing guy whose skin is not right 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.870
 Not a woman except in the novel wakes up. 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.370
 with beautiful skin that way I want 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.500
 show you how to make this skin 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.269
 in an easy and fast way to process 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.379
 all the days of his life and it seemed 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.379
 so the beautiful coordinator 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.120
 I'll start with a bikini is a 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.650
 new product category that will 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.360
 replace all those products that 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.020
 Do you spend every day to make your 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.970
 skin 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.640
 so the next one we do first 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.470
 moisturizer and sunscreen base 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.660
 all this to make your skin beautiful and 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.489
 we started here then the idea is to use 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.470
 bikini to prepare the skin all 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.090
 days to people who do not have time a 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.190
 incredible skin very fast 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.440
 this is the bikini, choose a color for me 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.449
 of course I'd rather always use in the center 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.879
 of the face first because in general where 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.739
 has more woman meets coloration has 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.720
 all red noses of a boat and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.200
 another one you can work on 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.780
 O with it so that deposits more 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.040
 product and is already helping corrective 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.619
 is the next step 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.880
 try using that finger or the one in the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.290
 applying time that arises is 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.600
 so much strength 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.760
 the idea is to drag but not take 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.130
 completely the product you have to go 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.659
 slowly and gently for those who have the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.659
 very heavy hand would recommend a brush 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.990
 the goal comes in is not all 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.670
 world that needs but I always believe 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.130
 that I have committed and dignity because you 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.679
 with a much better face than starting from 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.640
 inner corner of the eyes here 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.319
 this is banking on tapping the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.979
 blush and I do not want it to look like this 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.479
 blush 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.179
 you can have multiple colors but it's cool 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.789
 always orange and pink to look like 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.380
 the natural robot and I'll wear it high up 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.000
 of the apples and will chuckle like that 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.310
 You will find where the buchecha 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.549
 get up and limit this snack 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.080
 as if it were a natural robot mask 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.030
 lashes for me is a key item 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.039
 makeup after clear skin 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.230
 but he gives a finish left everything 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.630
 more feminine and more beautiful I chose the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.329
 with a definition mask that with 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.430
 this look more natural but flash it goes 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.700
 let the lashes well apart and more 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.140
 cleaner than a full- face mask 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.390
 when you make a hair brush and 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.970
 does not pull down with the mask 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.290
 Eyelashes the same thing you pull the eyelashes 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:37.750
 Up to complete the look. 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.750
 I will now button to choose a tone nude 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.370
 the superstar is the lipstick that does not come out 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.470
 dies and does not stain 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.420
 Can you pass and calm wait? 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.209
 ceccato doing now 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.709
 following pass a palm that is 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.069
 another side of the lipstick gives extra comfort 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.940
 along the day 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.060
 It's not just the step-by-step makeup 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.650
 focused on beautiful fresh skin and 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.239
