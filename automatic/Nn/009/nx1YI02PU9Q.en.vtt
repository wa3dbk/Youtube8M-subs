this<00:02:45.480> day<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:47.420> University<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.510> Miami<00:02:48.750> lost

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
this day and University of Miami lost

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.560 
this day and University of Miami lost
about<00:02:49.290> 30<00:02:49.920> plus<00:02:50.280> scholarships<00:02:51.060> over<00:02:51.300> three

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
about 30 plus scholarships over three

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.090 
about 30 plus scholarships over three
years<00:02:52.430> lost<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.670> bowl<00:02:54.180> game<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:55.650> think<00:02:55.920> they

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
years lost a bowl game I think they

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.290 
years lost a bowl game I think they
actually<00:02:56.600> relinquished<00:02:57.600> one<00:02:57.870> as<00:02:58.050> well<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:59.300> and

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
actually relinquished one as well so and

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.530 
actually relinquished one as well so and
I<00:03:01.290> think<00:03:01.350> this<00:03:01.710> is<00:03:02.130> much<00:03:02.730> more<00:03:02.970> severe<00:03:03.360> than

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
I think this is much more severe than

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.090 
I think this is much more severe than
that<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:04.110> think<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:06.120> evidence<00:03:06.590> if<00:03:07.590> it

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
that I think the the the evidence if it

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.450 
that I think the the the evidence if it
bears<00:03:08.460> out<00:03:08.730> if<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.060> can<00:03:09.150> be<00:03:09.300> proven<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:11.220> much

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
bears out if it can be proven is much

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.480 
bears out if it can be proven is much
more<00:03:11.610> devastating<00:03:12.270> than<00:03:12.300> anything<00:03:12.870> they<00:03:13.140> had

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
more devastating than anything they had

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.950 
more devastating than anything they had
at<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:14.670> time<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.780> literally<00:03:16.290> took<00:03:16.820> the

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
at the time and it literally took the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.220 
at the time and it literally took the
university<00:03:19.580> years<00:03:20.580> years<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.840> was<00:03:21.930> almost

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
university years years and it was almost

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.740 
university years years and it was almost
a<00:03:22.680> miracle

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
a miracle

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.120
