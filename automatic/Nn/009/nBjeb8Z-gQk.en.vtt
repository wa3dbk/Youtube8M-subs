00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.630
 My name is Jorge Cervelli and I belong to the mobile company Tri which is dedicated 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.629
 transplant large specimens 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.599
 It also has to be 14 years old in the market, we have approximately 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.589
 about 7 thousand 500 transplanted specimens 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:20.789
 what we have 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:21.909
 a team 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.390
 consisting of four mechanical shovels 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.769
 ii our transplant is done mechanically, not villages 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:29.269
 conventional systems 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.730
 what allows us to ensure the success of the transplant we are achieving 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.110
 through a team 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.200
 10 is handled mechanically consisting of four blades 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.819
 generates a bread of two meters 20 in diameter 

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:43.840
 with the 70 depth 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.500
 extracting a bread since 1750 ethical 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.000
 This allows us 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.740
 handle large specimens 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.560
 they also create a work like this that we are in at this moment that will expire 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.610
 we are recovering old trees 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.260
 if they were inside the trace of the gulf and we are going to reimplantar 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.500
 in places where p 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.920
 the work has fallen and they were in need of extracting from that copy it is 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.520
 that's not advancing the afforestation year kick out hh 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
 dates between 20 and 30 years 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.800
 following 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.550
 the machine in the stake out of the trees to be placed start the 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.630
 excavation 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.909
 With which 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.240
 that extracts the bread as said before 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.799
 and this leaving a deposit of 1 70 by two meters 20 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.269
 manolo 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.269
 one 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:45.279
 that much we wanted to the place where he had to remove the plant what 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:49.269
 we deposit in that place the copy is waiting to be implanted 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.859
 I wanted to give up 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.859
 again horned 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.279
 the machine plants it 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:43.609
 prior to that 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.809
 There is a step that is the placement of 250 liters of water 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.809
 it is a seat irrigation inside the well 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.809
 a hobby comes in before hormones 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.889
 once that is achieved, the bread is placed 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.599
 inside the post what does 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.519
 what the whole radicular system 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.789
 with the highest representatives of hormones 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:09.059
 this allows to ensure 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:12.059
 a total compliance in the whole root system force 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:14.050
 keeping him 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.620
 every time we take a copy north by a dog of photosynthesis 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.419
 from the same plant 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.900
 for the purposes of avoiding cementing perspiration may 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.479
 this allows us to better assure the transplant 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.720
 then the reins to avoid the movement of the winds i end 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:34.969
 with the placement of a basin to continue receiving 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.919
 the next and subsequent this 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.919
 that's why diego state 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.319
 once the basin is finished 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.949
 is finished to continue with the following steps that will follow the 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.639
 new seat irrigation 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.580
 to the effect that the water that hypercor has been the bottom of the 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.629
 tank is still meters from the depth train 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.629
 to keep the roots always with one 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.210
 In addition to offering the transplant large specimens 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.499
 we have provision of large specimens among which we have 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:14.739
 with palms this magnitude as cc ni canariensis indo botÃ­a ya tadic 

00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:16.080
 washingtonias 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.120
 and other species and specimens we wanted to thank the people of 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.860
 pile up 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.499
 for now the allowed 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:24.930
 show the development of this work 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.620
 Any doubt can communicate on our page that stipulates double 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:32.179
 moving tri point with one more point
