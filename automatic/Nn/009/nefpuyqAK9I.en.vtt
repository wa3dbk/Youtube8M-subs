00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.539
 and well we are here in new york in the 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.860
 presentation of the new engine or the motorcycle x 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:18.349
 the first product developed to root 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.259
 of the purchase made by google motorola 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:24.500
 yes almost two years 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:27.200
 this is the moto x so much was speculated 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.090
 There were so many pictures on the net and good 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.880
 yes, yes, yes, what does not 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.030
 did to maybe this is the version in 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.620
 white here is the black version the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.500
 same team of course with some 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.610
 interesting features 4.7 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.530
 inches the glass gorilla screen 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.660
 obviously functions especially 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:54.310
 designed by Motorola for this team 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:59.350
 for example the recognition of the voice 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.350
 uses a processor is not software 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.760
 it's not by software your processor is 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.060
 find and work all the time 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.430
 consuming very little battery and good 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.009
 with him I can tell the phone to 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.009
 see if you listen to me or what journal 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.120
 he did not recognize me right now but hey there's 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.260
 to train him a bit the ok cultad 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.370
 what he is going to do is awaken the 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.930
 phone is going to let's say activate a side 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.570
 so you can do what you do there 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.430
 you want to ask him things to throw 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.260
 applications and so on there is a 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.720
 very interesting feature that is 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.820
 by following your phone here 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.650
 does not have the flipped the people of 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.100
 Motorola did studies of how many people 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.630
 how many times he turned on and off his 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.610
 phone every day they do that 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.680
 like 60 I think they fell short 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.390
 but good if you just want to see 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.970
 the play or you want girls and some came 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.780
 message or something you want to flip it over and 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.100
 when turning it turns on that part of the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.410
 screen nothing else everyone else 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.300
 pixels do not touch them just turn on 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.219
 what you need in such a way that another 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.479
 time 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.920
 but good another feature 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.990
 interesting that motorola 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.060
 he decided because he asked a lot of people 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.360
 I want what I used the most on the phone 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.580
 besides talking and message to the camera 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.910
 how to turn on the camera quickly without 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.540
 have to squeeze anything good like this you grab 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.130
 I had the phone you give two turns and 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.430
 automatically I felt that a 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.910
 vibration and what happened is that it 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.710
 I turned on the camera and I take the phone 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.920
 I play anywhere 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.110
 and take the picture 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.420
 the other time I have the phone 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.220
 I want to take a picture quickly no no 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.950
 he pressed no button he just grabbed 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.530
 phone water well and felt the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.050
 vibration went on the camera touched on 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.710
 any part of the screen focuses and 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.710
 Take the picture 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.930
 if I take a video obviously I'm going 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.750
 here to video and you start recording is already 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.160
 recording video of the fall 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.160
 so minimum of pronouns 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.520
 we'll wait for them to lend us one 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.660
 to do the repro of the fall as it 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.240
 should 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.720
 as is customary to these two versions 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.510
 initials of the amount x in black color in 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.430
 white color share of course the 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.890
 same characteristics nothing else changes 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.810
 the color of fall because there are many people 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.180
 well missing a little but good 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.910
 finally the team is seen 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.020
 the size 4.7 inches which is a size 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.640
 pretty usable with just one hand i 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.190
 not that we already have five inches 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.650
 they are more inches it is not comfortable to use them 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.780
 with one hand and there already depends on 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.610
 obviously the client supposed 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.680
 good and the size of your hands 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.410
 it also depends a lot doing that more 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.270
 it accommodates interesting interesting the 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.610
 characteristics some of the first 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.400
 characteristics we know of this that is 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.560
 on the bike x the new phone at 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.799
 Motorola's flagship phone 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.030
 now the google part an accessory 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.910
 additional is taking out engine 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.280
 with this phone is the two speakers 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.739
 public software youtube claims that 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.150
 develop hardware and in particular by 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.400
 hearing aid functions 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.290
 these are bluetooth but they have the 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.050
 feature that you can connect 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.620
 several devices up to five 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.980
 phones to make your party there or 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.370
 your world lens to the dj that we carry inside 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.500
 then you can connect several equipment 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.210
 Simultaneously they do not play simultaneously 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.460
 but simply make a row, touch one 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.440
 Then the double hit is the 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.610
 horns that taking out also like 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.410
 accessory here in the market 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.200
 American surely this will change 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.060
 of course from country to country and also 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.010
 another interesting accessory are two 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.770
 hearing aids are are let's say size 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.290
 complete that they completely discover the 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.710
 ear and other hearing aids are those that 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:14.720
 they know generically as from pacifier they are 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:18.080
 these three hearing aid accessories 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.650
 complete or of the cap then those of 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.940
 pacifier and the wireless kitchens and for 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.070
 There they mentioned a while ago that 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.810
 presentation that of course to see everything 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.940
 type of cases and additional bacteria 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.430
 everything you normally find in 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.020
 the products or on the smartphones of 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.990
 high and good range we are here in new 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.550
 york in this launch event here 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.940
 precisely in the big apple where 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.160
 they decided to launch this motorcycle x 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.100
 it will arrive when it arrives that is the 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.020
 question that of course I know that a lot 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.850
 People are made when they reach others 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.730
 Latin American countries when it reaches 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.490
 mexico to whom usa is calculated at the end 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.980
 August or early September that 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.990
 which is without any official statement 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.330
 from nobody to me it occurs to me that it's going to 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.440
 get for example in Mexico as a 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.020
 end of September I think 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.560
 but before but good of course here 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.560
 in 10 point com we will have totally 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.560
 informed
