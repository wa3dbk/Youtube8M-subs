00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
they just needed us to program it this

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.029 
they just needed us to program it this
one<00:00:19.350> works<00:00:20.000> as<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.210> see<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:22.619> little<00:00:22.859> security

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
one works as you see the little security

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.750 
one works as you see the little security
light<00:00:23.310> goes<00:00:23.970> right<00:00:24.210> out<00:00:25.730> and<00:00:27.380> this<00:00:28.380> one<00:00:28.760> will

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
light goes right out and this one will

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.530 
light goes right out and this one will
make<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.090> security<00:00:30.480> light<00:00:30.630> flash<00:00:35.270> that<00:00:36.270> tells

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
make the security light flash that tells

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.700 
make the security light flash that tells
me<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.960> key<00:00:37.170> right<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.590> now

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
me that this key right here is now

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.700 
me that this key right here is now
program<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.460> few<00:00:38.670> minutes<00:00:38.940> we'll

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
program so in a few minutes we'll

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.170 
program so in a few minutes we'll
program<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.860> thing<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.219> show<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.460> both

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
program this thing and show you both

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.600 
program this thing and show you both
keys<00:00:42.649> programmed

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.700 

we're<00:00:49.610> back<00:00:49.760> at<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.000> shutter<00:00:50.530> we<00:00:51.530> just

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
we're back at the shutter we just

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.930 
we're back at the shutter we just
finished<00:00:51.830> getting<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.130> keys<00:00:52.310> program<00:00:52.760> that's

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
finished getting the keys program that's

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.720 
finished getting the keys program that's
about<00:00:53.030> 45<00:00:53.480> minutes<00:00:54.020> to<00:00:54.080> an<00:00:54.110> hour<00:00:54.320> later<00:00:54.730> the

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
about 45 minutes to an hour later the

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.310 
about 45 minutes to an hour later the
hardest<00:00:56.150> thing<00:00:56.330> about<00:00:56.360> these<00:00:56.810> reason<00:00:57.230> we

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
hardest thing about these reason we

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.630 
hardest thing about these reason we
charge<00:00:57.560> a<00:00:57.680> lot<00:00:57.770> of<00:00:57.830> money<00:00:57.950> to<00:00:58.130> program<00:00:58.489> these

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
charge a lot of money to program these

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.210 
charge a lot of money to program these
sometimes<00:00:59.380> because<00:01:00.380> on<00:01:00.530> these<00:01:00.680> cause<00:01:00.890> we<00:01:01.070> got

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
sometimes because on these cause we got

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.800 
sometimes because on these cause we got
to<00:01:01.250> pull<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.520> secret<00:01:02.000> code<00:01:02.239> out<00:01:02.570> of<00:01:02.600> the

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
to pull a secret code out of the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.479 
to pull a secret code out of the
ignition<00:01:03.050> I<00:01:03.470> mean<00:01:03.739> not<00:01:03.860> taking<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.190> out<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.430> the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
ignition I mean not taking it out of the

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.750 
ignition I mean not taking it out of the
ECU<00:01:05.059> that<00:01:05.300> allows<00:01:06.050> us<00:01:06.080> to<00:01:06.320> program<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.160> not

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
ECU that allows us to program and not

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.360 
ECU that allows us to program and not
everybody<00:01:08.180> has<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.450> software<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:09.050> can<00:01:09.370> free

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
everybody has the software that can free

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.940 
everybody has the software that can free
to<00:01:10.430> pull<00:01:10.729> that<00:01:10.880> code<00:01:11.170> but<00:01:12.170> she's<00:01:12.470> like<00:01:12.620> before

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
to pull that code but she's like before

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.300 
to pull that code but she's like before
this<00:01:13.130> is<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.369> new<00:01:13.520> key

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
this is the new key

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.040 
this is the new key
pretty<00:01:16.310> light<00:01:16.490> goes<00:01:17.240> right<00:01:17.479> out<00:01:18.940> and<00:01:20.050> of

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
pretty light goes right out and of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.170 
pretty light goes right out and of
course<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.440> original<00:01:21.560> Stillman<00:01:25.180> actually

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
course the original Stillman actually

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.910 
course the original Stillman actually
this<00:01:26.330> car<00:01:26.509> I<00:01:26.540> had<00:01:26.720> three-cheese<00:01:27.200> program<00:01:27.649> we

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
this car I had three-cheese program we

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.770 
this car I had three-cheese program we
erased<00:01:28.250> them<00:01:28.490> put<00:01:29.000> them<00:01:29.090> back<00:01:29.240> in<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:29.660> these

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
erased them put them back in so these

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.050 
erased them put them back in so these
are<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.050> only<00:01:30.229> two<00:01:30.500> keys<00:01:30.740> now<00:01:30.979> to<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.340> car<00:01:31.550> so

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
are the only two keys now to the car so

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.450 
are the only two keys now to the car so
we<00:01:32.180> have<00:01:32.300> that<00:01:32.450> ability<00:01:32.690> to<00:01:33.130> somebody<00:01:34.130> has<00:01:34.280> one
