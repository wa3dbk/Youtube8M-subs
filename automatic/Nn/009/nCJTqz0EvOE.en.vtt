00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
fashioned ball which is let's

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.580 
fashioned ball which is let's
adjust<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.630> water<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> back<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.500> the

adjust the water in the back of the
toilet<00:00:25.769> tank<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.609> may<00:00:26.760> actually<00:00:26.939> see<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
toilet tank you may actually see a

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.560 
toilet tank you may actually see a
variety<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:29.099> float<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.820> looks<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.300> this

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
variety of a float that looks like this

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.080 
variety of a float that looks like this
this<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.900> much<00:00:31.380> more<00:00:31.619> common<00:00:31.949> now<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.669> it's

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
this is much more common now and it's

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.990 
this is much more common now and it's
much<00:00:33.480> easier<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:34.050> adjust<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:35.250> old-fashioned

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
much easier to adjust the old-fashioned

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.030 
much easier to adjust the old-fashioned
ball<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:38.149> rod<00:00:39.149> basically<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.649> don't<00:00:40.860> have

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
ball and rod basically if you don't have

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.340 
ball and rod basically if you don't have
a<00:00:41.070> new<00:00:41.280> one<00:00:41.489> whom<00:00:41.670> had<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.000> bend<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.809> fix

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
a new one whom had to bend it to fix

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.290 
a new one whom had to bend it to fix
that<00:00:43.590> which<00:00:43.890> actually<00:00:44.190> didn't<00:00:44.850> work<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that which actually didn't work in the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000 
that which actually didn't work in the
long<00:00:45.480> run<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.289> pressure<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
long run because the pressure of the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.310 
long run because the pressure of the
water<00:00:47.280> would<00:00:47.820> lift<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.510> ball<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:49.020> higher<00:00:49.289> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
water would lift that ball up higher and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.709 
water would lift that ball up higher and
then<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.039> six<00:00:50.280> months<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.760> water<00:00:50.969> would<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.600> at

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
then in six months the water would be at

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.150 
then in six months the water would be at
a<00:00:51.750> higher<00:00:51.989> level<00:00:52.050> than<00:00:52.440> what<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.770> was<00:00:52.800> before

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
a higher level than what it was before

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.520 
a higher level than what it was before
you<00:00:53.460> repaired<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.000> these<00:00:54.570> new<00:00:54.840> ones<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
you repaired it these new ones have a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.090 
you repaired it these new ones have a
little<00:00:55.860> seat<00:00:56.070> clamp<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:57.230> pinch<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> c-clamp

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
little seat clamp you pinch the c-clamp

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.299 
little seat clamp you pinch the c-clamp
and<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.879> move<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.660> up<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.260> pole<00:01:01.469> or<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
and you move it up the pole or down the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.740 
and you move it up the pole or down the
pole<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:03.059> harder<00:01:03.329> when<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.690> in

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
pole a little harder when it's not in

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.310 
pole a little harder when it's not in
the<00:01:03.989> toilet<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.949> adjust<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.519> by<00:01:05.670> bending

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
the toilet but you adjust it by bending

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.770 
the toilet but you adjust it by bending
this<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.650> pushing<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.729> down<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.540> lower

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
this and pushing it down that will lower

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.200 
this and pushing it down that will lower
the<00:01:10.049> water<00:01:10.200> level<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.040> that's<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:12.060> you'd

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the water level and that's all you'd

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.210 
the water level and that's all you'd
have<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.260> particular<00:01:13.530> type<00:01:14.189> of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
have to do with this particular type of

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.910 
have to do with this particular type of
float<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.960> ghost<00:01:16.290> flush<00:01:16.680> that

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
float if you have that ghost flush that

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620
