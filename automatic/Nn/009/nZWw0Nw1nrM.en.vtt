00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:04.720 
hey guys I'm a fish guy here I was

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.780 
hey guys I'm a fish guy here I was
reviewing<00:00:04.930> some<00:00:05.440> of<00:00:05.590> the<00:00:05.740> Facebook<00:00:06.220> questions

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 
reviewing some of the Facebook questions

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.609 
reviewing some of the Facebook questions
and<00:00:07.299> some<00:00:07.690> of<00:00:07.720> the<00:00:07.839> YouTube<00:00:08.139> channels

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:08.619 
and some of the YouTube channels

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.539 
and some of the YouTube channels
questions<00:00:09.190> and<00:00:10.949> comments<00:00:11.949> that<00:00:12.039> I<00:00:12.099> got<00:00:12.280> and<00:00:12.519> a

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:12.549 
questions and comments that I got and a

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:13.739 
questions and comments that I got and a
lot<00:00:12.730> of<00:00:12.759> people<00:00:12.999> were<00:00:13.089> wondering<00:00:13.360> how<00:00:13.539> this

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:13.749 
lot of people were wondering how this

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.770 
lot of people were wondering how this
actually<00:00:13.929> works<00:00:14.459> this<00:00:15.459> right<00:00:15.669> here<00:00:15.849> is<00:00:15.940> a<00:00:15.969> dual

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
actually works this right here is a dual

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.280 
actually works this right here is a dual
sponge<00:00:17.230> filter<00:00:17.650> so<00:00:18.640> it's<00:00:18.790> going<00:00:19.030> to<00:00:19.240> be<00:00:19.450> pretty

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
sponge filter so it's going to be pretty

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.170 
sponge filter so it's going to be pretty
much<00:00:20.380> twice<00:00:20.830> as<00:00:21.010> powerful<00:00:21.190> as<00:00:21.700> a<00:00:21.730> normal

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
much twice as powerful as a normal

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.570 
much twice as powerful as a normal
sponge<00:00:22.360> filter<00:00:22.840> a<00:00:23.080> lot<00:00:23.830> of<00:00:23.950> people<00:00:24.190> use<00:00:24.370> these

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
sponge filter a lot of people use these

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.080 
sponge filter a lot of people use these
on<00:00:24.760> shrimp<00:00:25.150> setups<00:00:25.960> fry<00:00:26.710> setups<00:00:27.220> I<00:00:27.550> just<00:00:27.910> use

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
on shrimp setups fry setups I just use

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.230 
on shrimp setups fry setups I just use
it<00:00:28.120> normal<00:00:28.600> tank<00:00:28.780> setups<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.490> it's<00:00:30.940> actually

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
it normal tank setups and it's actually

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.779 
it normal tank setups and it's actually
quite<00:00:31.450> easy<00:00:31.480> to<00:00:31.930> use<00:00:32.140> really<00:00:32.460> how<00:00:33.460> it<00:00:33.579> works

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
quite easy to use really how it works

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.079 
quite easy to use really how it works
basically<00:00:34.059> is<00:00:35.159> right<00:00:36.159> here<00:00:36.399> you've<00:00:36.550> got<00:00:36.760> holes

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:37.089 
basically is right here you've got holes

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:43.979 
basically is right here you've got holes
underneath<00:00:38.050> each<00:00:39.149> sponge<00:00:42.539> what<00:00:43.539> that's<00:00:43.749> going

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
underneath each sponge what that's going

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.739 
underneath each sponge what that's going
to<00:00:44.079> do<00:00:44.339> is<00:00:45.339> you're<00:00:46.059> going<00:00:46.149> to<00:00:46.210> hook<00:00:46.420> an<00:00:46.569> air

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:46.749 
to do is you're going to hook an air

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:49.279 
to do is you're going to hook an air
line<00:00:47.079> right<00:00:47.920> up<00:00:48.069> to<00:00:48.249> this<00:00:48.399> nozzle<00:00:48.640> right<00:00:49.089> here

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
line right up to this nozzle right here

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.959 
line right up to this nozzle right here
that's<00:00:50.289> going<00:00:50.469> to<00:00:50.589> blow<00:00:50.829> bubbles<00:00:51.159> which<00:00:51.760> then

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
that's going to blow bubbles which then

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.180 
that's going to blow bubbles which then
creates<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.420> suction<00:00:52.719> that<00:00:53.199> sucks<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.649> water

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
creates a suction that sucks the water

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.879 
creates a suction that sucks the water
debris<00:00:55.050> everything<00:00:56.050> like<00:00:56.229> that<00:00:56.260> into<00:00:56.800> the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:56.889 
debris everything like that into the

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.579 
debris everything like that into the
actual<00:00:57.039> sponge<00:00:57.519> filters<00:00:58.139> we're<00:00:59.139> kind<00:00:59.409> of<00:00:59.469> like

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
actual sponge filters we're kind of like

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.189 
actual sponge filters we're kind of like
a<00:00:59.649> Python<00:00:59.889> almost<00:01:00.429> but<00:01:00.609> just<00:01:00.819> with<00:01:00.940> air<00:01:01.199> so

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
a Python almost but just with air so

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.840 
a Python almost but just with air so
like<00:01:02.589> I<00:01:02.620> said<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:02.889> hook<00:01:03.129> it<00:01:03.249> up<00:01:03.370> right<00:01:03.489> here

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
like I said you hook it up right here

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.430 
like I said you hook it up right here
it's<00:01:04.120> going<00:01:04.270> to<00:01:04.360> blow<00:01:04.540> bubbles<00:01:04.780> down<00:01:05.110> and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
it's going to blow bubbles down and

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.300 
it's going to blow bubbles down and
actually<00:01:05.710> create<00:01:05.980> a<00:01:06.010> suction<00:01:06.700> or<00:01:06.990> siphoning

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
actually create a suction or siphoning

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.490 
actually create a suction or siphoning
that<00:01:09.310> takes<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.730> debris<00:01:10.030> up<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.300> these<00:01:10.500> what's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
that takes the debris up to these what's

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.260 
that takes the debris up to these what's
nice<00:01:11.740> is<00:01:12.010> you<00:01:12.130> can<00:01:12.280> get<00:01:12.370> a<00:01:12.430> lot<00:01:12.610> of<00:01:12.640> beneficial

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
nice is you can get a lot of beneficial

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.060 
nice is you can get a lot of beneficial
bacteria<00:01:13.360> growth<00:01:14.050> on<00:01:14.230> these<00:01:14.410> if<00:01:14.620> you<00:01:14.740> want<00:01:14.920> to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
bacteria growth on these if you want to

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.540 
bacteria growth on these if you want to
put<00:01:15.540> one<00:01:16.540> of<00:01:16.660> these<00:01:16.720> into<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.110> new<00:01:17.710> tank<00:01:17.980> it<00:01:18.310> can

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
put one of these into a new tank it can

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.430 
put one of these into a new tank it can
actually<00:01:18.670> become<00:01:19.120> established<00:01:19.930> a<00:01:20.290> lot

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
actually become established a lot

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.950 
actually become established a lot
quicker<00:01:20.680> than<00:01:20.860> what<00:01:21.160> a<00:01:21.190> normal<00:01:21.690> setup<00:01:22.690> and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
quicker than what a normal setup and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.230 
quicker than what a normal setup and
cycling<00:01:23.410> goes<00:01:23.680> through<00:01:24.070> but<00:01:24.850> what's<00:01:25.030> going<00:01:25.180> to

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
cycling goes through but what's going to

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.790 
cycling goes through but what's going to
happen<00:01:25.540> is<00:01:25.630> once<00:01:25.870> the<00:01:25.990> air<00:01:26.140> goes<00:01:26.380> down<00:01:26.410> here

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
happen is once the air goes down here

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.590 
happen is once the air goes down here
creates<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.310> siphon<00:01:27.760> it's<00:01:27.910> going<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.120> blow<00:01:28.360> out

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
creates a siphon it's going to blow out

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.660 
creates a siphon it's going to blow out
this<00:01:28.900> tube<00:01:29.290> right<00:01:29.500> here<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:30.220> what<00:01:30.400> I<00:01:30.430> like

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
this tube right here and what I like

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.250 
this tube right here and what I like
about<00:01:30.820> these<00:01:31.120> verses<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.840> normal<00:01:32.110> sponge

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
about these verses and normal sponge

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.230 
about these verses and normal sponge
filters<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:32.890> actually<00:01:33.190> can<00:01:33.310> move<00:01:33.580> these<00:01:33.850> to

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
filters you actually can move these to

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.260 
filters you actually can move these to
create<00:01:34.690> a<00:01:34.870> current<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.550> can<00:01:36.850> actually

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
create a current so you can actually

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.480 
create a current so you can actually
move<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.690> water<00:01:37.950> whereas<00:01:38.950> normal<00:01:39.310> sponge

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
move the water whereas normal sponge

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.250 
move the water whereas normal sponge
filters<00:01:39.970> are<00:01:40.120> actually<00:01:40.420> missing<00:01:40.630> this<00:01:40.990> and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
filters are actually missing this and

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.290 
filters are actually missing this and
just<00:01:41.440> pretty<00:01:41.650> much<00:01:41.830> blow<00:01:42.130> water<00:01:42.430> or<00:01:42.880> blow<00:01:43.150> the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
just pretty much blow water or blow the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.930 
just pretty much blow water or blow the
air<00:01:43.450> up<00:01:43.660> to<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.930> top<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.470> whatever<00:01:45.130> mixture

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
air up to the top and whatever mixture

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.450 
air up to the top and whatever mixture
you<00:01:46.690> can<00:01:46.720> get<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.410> create<00:01:47.770> some<00:01:48.070> kind<00:01:48.280> of

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
you can get to create some kind of

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.400 
you can get to create some kind of
current<00:01:48.790> is<00:01:48.910> just<00:01:49.240> based<00:01:49.450> off<00:01:49.690> that<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:50.230> these

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
current is just based off that so these

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.050 
current is just based off that so these
are<00:01:50.620> kind<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:50.980> a<00:01:51.130> little<00:01:51.340> bit<00:01:51.460> nicer<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:51.880> an

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
are kind of a little bit nicer of an

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.060 
are kind of a little bit nicer of an
upgrade<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.630> can<00:01:53.110> actually<00:01:53.380> build<00:01:53.770> your<00:01:54.040> own

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
upgrade you can actually build your own

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.050 
upgrade you can actually build your own
if<00:01:54.550> you<00:01:54.700> get<00:01:54.910> a<00:01:56.250> regular<00:01:57.250> sponge<00:01:57.490> filter<00:01:57.970> you

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
if you get a regular sponge filter you

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.870 
if you get a regular sponge filter you
can<00:01:58.210> get<00:01:58.330> a<00:01:58.360> piece<00:01:58.570> of<00:01:58.600> elbow<00:01:58.960> joint<00:01:59.290> and<00:01:59.500> just

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
can get a piece of elbow joint and just

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.370 
can get a piece of elbow joint and just
drill<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.909> small<00:02:01.210> hole<00:02:01.390> just<00:02:01.990> enough<00:02:02.200> for<00:02:02.350> the

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
drill a small hole just enough for the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.490 
drill a small hole just enough for the
air<00:02:02.560> line<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.920> go<00:02:03.070> down<00:02:03.370> into<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.500> down

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
air line to go down into it and down

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.160 
air line to go down into it and down
into<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.860> actual<00:02:06.310> air<00:02:06.940> stone<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.510> that<00:02:08.019> way

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
into the actual air stone and that way

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.859 
into the actual air stone and that way
it<00:02:08.289> creates<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.740> siphon<00:02:09.460> still<00:02:09.940> for<00:02:10.450> this<00:02:10.600> and

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
it creates a siphon still for this and

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.830 
it creates a siphon still for this and
still<00:02:11.500> pushes<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:11.980> out<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.340> elbow<00:02:12.610> joint

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
still pushes it out the elbow joint

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.509 
still pushes it out the elbow joint
so<00:02:14.290> like<00:02:14.409> I<00:02:14.469> said<00:02:14.650> these<00:02:14.739> aren't<00:02:14.950> real<00:02:15.129> hard<00:02:15.340> to

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
so like I said these aren't real hard to

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.989 
so like I said these aren't real hard to
set<00:02:15.790> up<00:02:15.939> just<00:02:16.180> airline<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.379> an<00:02:17.469> air<00:02:17.590> pump<00:02:17.999> you

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:18.999 
set up just airline and an air pump you

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.729 
set up just airline and an air pump you
do<00:02:19.180> want<00:02:19.359> to<00:02:19.450> check<00:02:19.629> valve<00:02:19.959> for<00:02:20.170> these<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:20.650> in

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
do want to check valve for these just in

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.119 
do want to check valve for these just in
case<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.310> power<00:02:21.999> outage<00:02:22.269> or<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:23.049> unplug<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.829> so

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
case a power outage or you unplug it so

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.009 
case a power outage or you unplug it so
that<00:02:24.249> the<00:02:24.340> water<00:02:24.459> doesn't<00:02:25.090> siphon<00:02:25.629> back<00:02:25.780> into

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
that the water doesn't siphon back into

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.599 
that the water doesn't siphon back into
your<00:02:26.109> air<00:02:26.260> pump<00:02:26.590> that's<00:02:26.859> really<00:02:27.189> important<00:02:27.549> to

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
your air pump that's really important to

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.509 
your air pump that's really important to
get<00:02:27.730> these<00:02:27.849> check<00:02:28.150> valves<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:29.400> actually<00:02:30.400> what

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
get these check valves I actually what

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.649 
get these check valves I actually what
I'll<00:02:30.609> show<00:02:30.819> you<00:02:30.879> next<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.359> it<00:02:31.540> working<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:33.659> so

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
I'll show you next is it working so I so

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.209 
I'll show you next is it working so I so
here's<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.989> sponge<00:02:35.290> filter<00:02:35.650> actually<00:02:35.799> set<00:02:36.189> up

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:36.219 
here's the sponge filter actually set up

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.300 
here's the sponge filter actually set up
and<00:02:36.579> like<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.730> said<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:38.560> air<00:02:38.709> line<00:02:38.950> goes<00:02:39.189> right

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
and like I said the air line goes right

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.509 
and like I said the air line goes right
into<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.030> nozzle<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.560> as<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.069> can<00:02:42.159> see<00:02:42.400> it's

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
into that nozzle and as you can see it's

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.539 
into that nozzle and as you can see it's
blowing<00:02:42.909> right<00:02:43.060> out<00:02:44.189> debris<00:02:45.189> is<00:02:45.310> getting

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
blowing right out debris is getting

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.770 
blowing right out debris is getting
sucked<00:02:45.790> into<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.239> actual<00:02:46.540> filter<00:02:46.930> sponges<00:02:48.780> so

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
sucked into the actual filter sponges so

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.319 
sucked into the actual filter sponges so
it's<00:02:49.930> perfect<00:02:50.439> for<00:02:50.469> a<00:02:50.590> little<00:02:50.829> setup
