trailer all the way down which raises

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.999 
trailer all the way down which raises
the<00:01:21.060> back<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.600> boat<00:01:21.780> alright<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.979> next

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
step is since the back is high is to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
step is since the back is high is to
make<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> support<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.869> hold<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.740> as

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
make a support to hold the back just as

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.740 
make a support to hold the back just as
high<00:01:29.130> because<00:01:30.030> what<00:01:30.270> we're<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.540> do

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
high because what we're going to do

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.569 
high because what we're going to do
remember<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.409> crank<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.070> front<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.430> boat

now it's going to go underneath it's
under<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> back<00:01:51.119> we're<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.570> start

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
under the back we're going to start

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.740 
under the back we're going to start
raising<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> front<00:01:52.970> all<00:01:53.970> right<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.299> raised<00:01:54.540> up

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
raising the front all right we raised up

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.469 
raising the front all right we raised up
the<00:01:54.780> front<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.380> now<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:57.240> it's

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the front and now you can see that it's

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.020 
the front and now you can see that it's
off<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> pads<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.670> could<00:01:59.850> see

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
off of the pads and you could see

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.789 
off of the pads and you could see
daylight<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.689> our<00:02:00.990> few<00:02:01.200> inches<00:02:01.380> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
daylight we have our few inches and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.260 
daylight we have our few inches and
hopefully<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> trailer<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.759> pull<00:02:02.939> out<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
hopefully the trailer can pull out that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.620 
hopefully the trailer can pull out that
way

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
way

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.810 
way
we<00:02:04.259> took<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.469> stick<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.979> took<00:02:05.159> out<00:02:05.340> some<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
we took a stick and took out some of the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.820 
we took a stick and took out some of the
slack

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
slack

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.240 
slack
and<00:02:07.370> now<00:02:07.640> we're<00:02:07.850> going<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.030> lower<00:02:08.210> it<00:02:08.360> again

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
and now we're going to lower it again

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.190 
and now we're going to lower it again
and<00:02:10.250> as<00:02:10.729> we<00:02:10.880> lower<00:02:11.090> it<00:02:11.270> it<00:02:11.420> should<00:02:11.720> come<00:02:11.900> right

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
and as we lower it it should come right

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.280 
and as we lower it it should come right
off<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.590> trailer<00:02:13.240> go<00:02:14.240> ahead<00:02:14.450> see<00:02:14.930> if<00:02:14.960> it<00:02:15.110> pulls

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
off the trailer go ahead see if it pulls

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.250 
off the trailer go ahead see if it pulls
out<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:16.550> did<00:02:16.760> slip<00:02:16.940> out<00:02:17.150> after<00:02:17.570> all<00:02:17.600> we<00:02:18.230> just

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
out it did slip out after all we just

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.160 
out it did slip out after all we just
had<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:19.160> front<00:02:19.340> was<00:02:19.550> too<00:02:19.730> low<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.210> there's

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
had a the front was too low and there's

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.040 
had a the front was too low and there's
the<00:02:21.380> boat<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:22.070> back<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.870> hanging<00:02:23.870> from

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
the boat on the back and hanging from

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.770 
the boat on the back and hanging from
the<00:02:24.200> tree<00:02:25.300> all<00:02:26.300> right

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
the tree all right

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.830 
the tree all right
we<00:02:27.680> built<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.040> box<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.700> take<00:02:29.270> off<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.570> pressure

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
we built a box to take off the pressure

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.410 
we built a box to take off the pressure
so<00:02:30.140> it's<00:02:30.290> not<00:02:30.440> hanging<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:31.850> unwound<00:02:32.270> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
so it's not hanging and we unwound the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.770 
so it's not hanging and we unwound the
wou<00:02:32.630> rope<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:34.150> now<00:02:35.150> we're<00:02:35.300> going<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.450> work<00:02:35.600> on

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780
