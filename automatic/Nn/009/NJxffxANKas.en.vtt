00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
yeah we have a plane flying over right

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.400 
yeah we have a plane flying over right
now<00:00:08.160> but<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:09.030> apologize<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:10.020> too<00:00:10.340> this<00:00:11.340> is

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
now but I apologize for that too this is

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.650 
now but I apologize for that too this is
our<00:00:13.410> game<00:00:13.709> trail<00:00:14.040> now<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.400> made<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.629> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
our game trail now I made this this is a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.779 
our game trail now I made this this is a
perfect<00:00:16.260> example<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.160> one<00:00:17.340> would<00:00:17.580> look

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
perfect example of what one would look

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.070 
perfect example of what one would look
like<00:00:18.030> it'll<00:00:18.900> look<00:00:19.170> highly<00:00:19.800> used<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:21.030> the<00:00:21.840> dirt

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
like it'll look highly used the the dirt

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.929 
like it'll look highly used the the dirt
and<00:00:22.320> debris<00:00:22.890> will<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.340> moved<00:00:23.550> out<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> way

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and debris will be moved out of the way

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.740 
and debris will be moved out of the way
so<00:00:24.929> it<00:00:25.259> would<00:00:25.410> make<00:00:26.090> essentially<00:00:27.090> an<00:00:27.330> animal

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
so it would make essentially an animal

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.700 
so it would make essentially an animal
highway<00:00:29.420> here<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.589> goes

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
highway here you can see that it goes

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.840 
highway here you can see that it goes
all<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.009> way<00:00:32.189> through<00:00:32.310> and<00:00:32.900> I<00:00:33.900> have<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.850> perfect

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
all the way through and I have a perfect

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.600 
all the way through and I have a perfect
spot<00:00:35.970> to<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> bottleneck<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.039> force

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
spot to make like a bottleneck to force

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.040 
spot to make like a bottleneck to force
the<00:00:38.820> little<00:00:39.059> guy<00:00:39.620> into<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> Conibear<00:00:41.989> now<00:00:42.989> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the little guy into a Conibear now I

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.220 
the little guy into a Conibear now I
didn't<00:00:43.350> want<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.590> actually<00:00:44.809> disturb<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:46.020> real

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
didn't want to actually disturb a real

game<00:00:46.590> trail<00:00:47.180> these<00:00:48.180> animals<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> desert

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
game trail these animals in the desert

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.680 
game trail these animals in the desert
use<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.699> get<00:00:51.180> back<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.629> forth

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
use that so they can get back and forth

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.260 
use that so they can get back and forth
from<00:00:52.320> food<00:00:52.770> sources<00:00:53.039> water<00:00:53.609> sources<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
from food sources water sources and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.750 
from food sources water sources and
things<00:00:54.359> like<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.100> being<00:00:56.309> said

things like that so with that being said

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.639 
things like that so with that being said
I<00:00:57.090> wanted<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.690> mock<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.760> set<00:00:59.760> one<00:00:59.969> up<00:01:00.149> to

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
I wanted to mock one and set one up to

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.950 
I wanted to mock one and set one up to
explain<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.039> show<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.340> without<00:01:02.960> disturbing

the natural habitat and causing the
animals<00:01:06.480> to<00:01:06.720> go<00:01:07.110> somewhere<00:01:07.560> else<00:01:07.710> that's

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
animals to go somewhere else that's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.490 
animals to go somewhere else that's
their<00:01:09.030> home<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.600> don't<00:01:10.170> want<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.619> disturb<00:01:10.920> it

these are more humane than the old
foothold<00:01:23.640> traps<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.420> would<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.960> hold<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
foothold traps that would just hold the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.920 
foothold traps that would just hold the
animal<00:01:25.650> there<00:01:25.829> and<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.329> to<00:01:27.360> show<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.750> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
possible now to set this it's fairly

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.819 
possible now to set this it's fairly
straightforward<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.289> simple

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
straightforward and simple

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.940 
straightforward and simple
you<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.729> your<00:02:05.909> spring<00:02:06.390> which<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.649> Conibear

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
you have your spring which the Conibear

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.670 
you have your spring which the Conibear
110<00:02:08.580> has<00:02:08.789> 110<00:02:09.420> pounds<00:02:09.780> per<00:02:09.930> square<00:02:09.960> inch<00:02:10.259> of

110 has 110 pounds per square inch of
pressure<00:02:11.390> when<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.480> closes

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
pressure when it closes

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.340 
pressure when it closes
basically<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.510> squeeze<00:02:15.870> your<00:02:16.140> your<00:02:16.800> spring

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
basically just squeeze your your spring

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.180 
basically just squeeze your your spring
that's<00:02:19.350> gonna<00:02:19.590> bring<00:02:19.800> your<00:02:20.040> your<00:02:20.700> trigger<00:02:22.190> and

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
that's gonna bring your your trigger and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.230 
that's gonna bring your your trigger and
your<00:02:24.180> lock<00:02:24.420> together<00:02:25.910> just<00:02:26.910> lay<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.150> across

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
your lock together just lay it across

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.230 
your lock together just lay it across
just<00:02:27.720> like<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:29.520> make<00:02:29.700> sure<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.030> catches

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
just like so and make sure it catches

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.470 
just like so and make sure it catches
now<00:02:31.230> what<00:02:31.380> I'll<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.860> I'll<00:02:32.040> hold<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
now what I'll do is I'll hold on to the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.610 
now what I'll do is I'll hold on to the
spring<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:34.650> when<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.160> let<00:02:35.430> go<00:02:36.620> to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
spring just like so when I let go to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.500 
spring just like so when I let go to
make<00:02:37.800> sure<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.460> it's<00:02:38.640> not<00:02:38.760> going<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.060> snap<00:02:39.300> me

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
make sure that it's not going to snap me

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.000 
make sure that it's not going to snap me
now<00:02:39.660> larger<00:02:40.110> ones<00:02:40.290> are<00:02:40.380> gonna<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.650> two<00:02:40.860> of

now larger ones are gonna have two of

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.000 
now larger ones are gonna have two of
these<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.460> need<00:02:41.640> tools<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.650> be<00:02:43.650> able<00:02:43.740> to

these and you need tools to be able to

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.180 
these and you need tools to be able to
set<00:02:44.250> them<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:45.050> they<00:02:46.050> have<00:02:46.230> safety<00:02:46.710> locks<00:02:46.950> to

I've taken my chain and I've staked it

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.620 
I've taken my chain and I've staked it
here<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.550> really<00:02:59.970> deep<00:03:00.300> this<00:03:00.510> is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
here and this is in really deep this is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.300 
here and this is in really deep this is
a<00:03:00.660> pretty<00:03:00.930> long<00:03:01.140> stick<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.770> reason<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.130> want

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
a pretty long stick the reason you want

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.420 
a pretty long stick the reason you want
this<00:03:02.460> in<00:03:02.670> deep<00:03:02.990> to<00:03:03.990> hold<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.380> in<00:03:04.590> place<00:03:04.770> is

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
this in deep to hold that in place is

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.750 
this in deep to hold that in place is
just<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.060> case<00:03:06.890> something<00:03:07.890> else<00:03:08.190> comes<00:03:08.490> along

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
just in case something else comes along

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.820 
just in case something else comes along
and<00:03:08.910> grabs<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.780> critter<00:03:10.050> that's<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.620> in

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
and grabs the critter that's in the in

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.670 
and grabs the critter that's in the in
the<00:03:11.040> trap<00:03:11.510> he<00:03:12.510> can't<00:03:12.690> run<00:03:12.840> off<00:03:13.020> with<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.380> this

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
the trap he can't run off with it this

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.980 
the trap he can't run off with it this
one<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.490> one<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:15.090> one<00:03:15.150> are<00:03:15.510> here<00:03:15.840> to

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
one this one and this one are here to

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.930 
one this one and this one are here to
help<00:03:16.140> stabilize<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:17.070> trap<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.520> hold<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.850> in

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
help stabilize the trap and hold it in

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.170 
help stabilize the trap and hold it in
place<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:19.610> when<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.730> critter<00:03:20.940> goes

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
place so that when the critter goes

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.699 
place so that when the critter goes
through<00:03:21.480> he<00:03:21.600> doesn't<00:03:21.720> knock<00:03:22.050> it<00:03:22.230> over<00:03:22.350> and

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
through he doesn't knock it over and

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.180 
through he doesn't knock it over and
it'll<00:03:23.400> effectively<00:03:24.360> shut<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.470> kill<00:03:25.770> it<00:03:25.890> you

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
it'll effectively shut and kill it you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.370 
it'll effectively shut and kill it you
can<00:03:26.280> also<00:03:26.430> see<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.209> still<00:03:27.480> open<00:03:27.750> here

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
can also see that it's still open here

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.760 
can also see that it's still open here
here<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.490> as<00:03:30.090> well<00:03:30.270> as<00:03:30.480> here<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.440> what<00:03:31.650> I'm

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
here and as well as here so what I'm

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:56.140 
here and as well as here so what I'm
gonna<00:03:31.890> do<00:03:32.130> is<00:03:32.280> I'm<00:03:32.400> gonna<00:03:32.520> fence<00:03:32.880> this<00:03:33.090> in

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.000 

now<00:03:57.150> if<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.420> want<00:03:57.689> to<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.260> can<00:03:58.409> actually<00:03:58.590> add

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
now if you want to you can actually add

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.729 
now if you want to you can actually add
a<00:03:59.040> funnel<00:03:59.640> or<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.450> bottleneck<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.230> comes<00:04:01.560> out

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
a funnel or a bottleneck that comes out

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.729 
a funnel or a bottleneck that comes out
this<00:04:01.950> way<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:05.599> this<00:04:06.599> way<00:04:06.870> as<00:04:07.019> well<00:04:07.049> but<00:04:07.319> it's

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
this way and this way as well but it's

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.990 
this way and this way as well but it's
not<00:04:07.829> entirely<00:04:08.400> necessary<00:04:10.459> so<00:04:11.459> basically

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
not entirely necessary so basically

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.339 
not entirely necessary so basically
what's<00:04:12.239> gonna<00:04:12.329> happen<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:12.930> when<00:04:13.049> he<00:04:13.139> comes

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
what's gonna happen is when he comes

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.039 
what's gonna happen is when he comes
through<00:04:13.439> either<00:04:13.859> way<00:04:14.569> he's<00:04:15.569> gonna<00:04:15.750> see<00:04:16.019> all

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
through either way he's gonna see all

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.050 
through either way he's gonna see all
this<00:04:16.350> debris<00:04:16.859> in<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.160> way<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.549> it's<00:04:17.880> gonna

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
this debris in the way and it's gonna

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.819 
this debris in the way and it's gonna
discourage<00:04:18.509> him<00:04:18.750> from<00:04:18.780> going<00:04:19.079> around<00:04:19.320> your

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
discourage him from going around your

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.680 
discourage him from going around your
top<00:04:20.130> barriers<00:04:20.669> gonna<00:04:20.880> discourage<00:04:21.509> him<00:04:21.660> from

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
top barriers gonna discourage him from

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.529 
top barriers gonna discourage him from
going<00:04:21.959> over<00:04:22.500> because<00:04:23.370> basically<00:04:23.729> animals<00:04:24.449> are

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
going over because basically animals are

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.650 
going over because basically animals are
gonna<00:04:25.280> use<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.550> easiest<00:04:27.000> possible<00:04:27.330> way

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
gonna use the easiest possible way

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.350 
gonna use the easiest possible way
they're<00:04:28.050> just<00:04:28.080> like<00:04:28.500> us<00:04:28.940> now<00:04:29.940> when<00:04:30.090> he<00:04:30.180> comes

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
they're just like us now when he comes

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.390 
they're just like us now when he comes
through<00:04:30.539> he's<00:04:31.050> gonna<00:04:31.169> hit<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.440> trigger<00:04:34.400> then

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
through he's gonna hit the trigger then

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.240 
through he's gonna hit the trigger then
he's<00:04:35.520> caught<00:04:35.789> and<00:04:36.449> it<00:04:37.380> doesn't<00:04:37.740> matter<00:04:37.979> if

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
he's caught and it doesn't matter if

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.040 
he's caught and it doesn't matter if
this<00:04:38.460> stuff<00:04:38.729> starts<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.210> fall<00:04:39.419> over<00:04:39.780> at<00:04:39.900> that

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
this stuff starts to fall over at that

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.469 
this stuff starts to fall over at that
point<00:04:40.320> because<00:04:41.009> he's<00:04:41.250> done<00:04:44.090> man<00:04:45.090> there<00:04:45.360> is

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
point because he's done man there is

00:04:45.479 --> 00:05:02.930 
point because he's done man there is
some<00:04:45.660> pressure<00:04:45.960> on<00:04:46.110> those<00:04:46.410> jobs

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.880 

okay<00:05:03.940> now<00:05:04.120> these<00:05:04.300> are<00:05:04.510> my<00:05:04.660> traps<00:05:05.050> I<00:05:05.350> have<00:05:05.530> ten

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
okay now these are my traps I have ten
