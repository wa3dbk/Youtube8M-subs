00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
water you can get helicopter which is

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.159 
water you can get helicopter which is
easy<00:00:29.279> since<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.819> does<00:00:30.029> float<00:00:30.659> to<00:00:30.839> the<00:00:30.869> bottom

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
easy since it does float to the bottom

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.319 
easy since it does float to the bottom
really<00:00:31.439> fast<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.520> car<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.270> do

really fast you can get a car you can do

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.420 
really fast you can get a car you can do
it<00:00:33.420> basically<00:00:33.750> any<00:00:33.989> way<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> helicopter

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it basically any way but the helicopter

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.740 
it basically any way but the helicopter
is<00:00:35.460> probably<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> most<00:00:36.030> efficient<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.660> you

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
is probably the most efficient so you

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.230
