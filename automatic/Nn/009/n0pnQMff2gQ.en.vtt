to<00:00:36.680> obviously<00:00:37.680> was<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> tow<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:38.580> we<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.720> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
to obviously was a tow but we have to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.869 
to obviously was a tow but we have to
have<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.199> car<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.860> as<00:00:41.010> well<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.550> guess

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
have the car to do it as well so I guess

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.540 
have the car to do it as well so I guess
it<00:00:42.360> wasn't<00:00:42.630> bad<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.370> obviously<00:00:44.370> not

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
it wasn't bad but obviously not

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.420 
it wasn't bad but obviously not
realistic<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.810> think<00:00:46.739> way<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.280> was<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
realistic but I think way it was a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.950 
realistic but I think way it was a
productive<00:00:47.670> day<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.390> watching<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:48.809> weather
