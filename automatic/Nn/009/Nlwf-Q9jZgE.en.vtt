00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.999
 and hello guys how are I, and I'm 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.549
 in minecraft and this time I bring you a 

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:09.830
 tutorial very fast that where 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.740
 we will learn how to make a human cannon 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.299
 good what we need is obsidian 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.070
 dynamite reddish stone and a button 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.450
 The first thing we have to do is a 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.440
 5 x 5 square 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.030
 well in square 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.030
 of 5 fast 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.300
 OK 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.710
 so then we put subsidizing around 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.710
 in this way 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.670
 we put obsidian here in the middle 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.649
 and we remove these blocks that are here 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.629
 and instead of this obsidian we have 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.210
 we say, instead of this, that 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:59.800
 we have obsidian 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.040
 well and we put it here in the middle 12 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.750
 obsidian and ready 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.379
 now we just need to fill it with 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.350
 dynamite 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.579
 well all around and around the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.579
 dynamite we put reddish stone 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.399
 and a button and it's ready this we 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.369
 can serve to reach high places 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.789
 or just for fun and good we're going to 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.789
 prove it 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.479
 well sometimes you can get a little more 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.299
 If you do this, I recommend that you 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.100
 have an iron armor of or of 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.280
 diamond and preferably it's 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.140
 delighted if they can not get to die anymore 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.399
 be it for the lieutenant or for the impact of 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.590
 the fall and well that is necessary that 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.960
 that should be in survival but 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.500
 that since if they are in creative no no 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.330
 it will work for them because since they do not 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.939
 can harm the planet 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.979
 well I would not throw it up so 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.909
 If you want to try it but it's not going to 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.349
 function 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.090
 and well this is all very fast must of 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.489
 be in the center and when you activate it 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.220
 in jumping so that it does not get higher 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.370
 it may be that sometimes it does not work 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.800
 but even if they have several stack of 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.090
 dynamite well ni 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.090
 does not matter 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.190
 good a utility that can do you 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.290
 for this canyon they can use it as 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.690
 fast lift like this to get to a 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.800
 very high place very quickly 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.620
 good 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.460
 we just activate it I hope it works 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.460
 we jump 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.610
 and ready good has not reached you 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.730
 I recommend doing it a bit higher for 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.410
 that they always arrive since here the fact 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.750
 up to mere above the lighthouse as it is 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.819
 very high because it can not work well 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.260
 good sometimes if it works but sometimes 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.340
 do not 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.829
 well this is this has been everything yes I think 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.640
 that I have not left anything nothing that 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:15.599
 explain well I'm Jim and see you 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.599
 then goodbye 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.890
 and this one I forgot I recommend you 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.660
 if they do not do it in a cave or 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.330
 underground or if there are constructions 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.430
 around because this can happen 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.030
 As you can see, they are destroying from below but 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.959
 above does not 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.959
 It's a funny thing 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.550
 I must also mention that I already have 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.910
 50 asus and good 51 and well that puts me 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.810
 very happy thank you all for each 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.280
 day we are growing a little more good 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.380
 Thank you 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.380
 until another goodbye
