00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
firstly the most important things that

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.560 
firstly the most important things that
the<00:00:55.400> Bates<00:00:55.610> drilled<00:00:55.940> out<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.120> put<00:00:56.360> caulking

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
the Bates drilled out and put caulking

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.470 
the Bates drilled out and put caulking
right<00:00:57.230> to<00:00:58.129> balance<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.550> right<00:00:58.580> out<00:00:58.850> with<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.059> KD

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
right to balance it right out with a KD

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.210 
right to balance it right out with a KD
rig<00:00:59.690> it's<00:00:59.839> really<00:01:00.080> important<00:01:00.500> that<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.680> bait

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
rig it's really important that the bait

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.000 
rig it's really important that the bait
is<00:01:01.430> balanced<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.420> hook<00:01:02.659> is<00:01:03.260> heavy<00:01:03.650> in<00:01:03.920> the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
is balanced so the hook is heavy in the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.040 
is balanced so the hook is heavy in the
face<00:01:04.159> okay<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.850> bait<00:01:05.030> is<00:01:05.210> weightless<00:01:05.449> yep

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
face okay so the bait is weightless yep

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.690 
face okay so the bait is weightless yep
and<00:01:06.200> then<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.830> hook<00:01:06.979> is<00:01:07.130> heavy<00:01:07.310> because<00:01:07.460> if

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
and then the hook is heavy because if

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.040 
and then the hook is heavy because if
you<00:01:07.820> just<00:01:07.970> had<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.120> bottom<00:01:08.390> bite<00:01:08.540> on<00:01:08.690> that<00:01:08.840> sort

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
you just had a bottom bite on that sort

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.210 
you just had a bottom bite on that sort
of<00:01:09.080> rig<00:01:09.229> it<00:01:09.350> wouldn't<00:01:09.560> work<00:01:09.710> with<00:01:09.920> it<00:01:10.010> not<00:01:10.100> as

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
of rig it wouldn't work with it not as

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.530 
of rig it wouldn't work with it not as
well<00:01:10.370> now<00:01:10.550> I'm<00:01:10.640> sure<00:01:10.790> it's<00:01:11.090> still<00:01:11.210> catching

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
well now I'm sure it's still catching

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.640 
well now I'm sure it's still catching
because<00:01:11.690> it's<00:01:11.840> going<00:01:12.020> into<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.290> mouth<00:01:12.440> it

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
because it's going into the mouth it

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.320 
because it's going into the mouth it
didn't<00:01:12.950> work<00:01:13.070> perfectly<00:01:13.550> sir<00:01:13.790> right<00:01:14.060> okay<00:01:14.300> and

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
didn't work perfectly sir right okay and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.690 
didn't work perfectly sir right okay and
why'd<00:01:14.659> you<00:01:14.810> put<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.110> in<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:15.979> side<00:01:16.280> of<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.550> pie

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
why'd you put it in that side of the pie

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.030 
why'd you put it in that side of the pie
rather<00:01:17.120> than<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.560> top<00:01:18.560> part<00:01:18.799> of<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:18.920> bike

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
rather than the top part of the bike

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.740 
rather than the top part of the bike
with<00:01:19.190> a<00:01:19.250> hair<00:01:19.430> tie<00:01:19.460> think<00:01:20.030> when<00:01:20.210> debates<00:01:20.510> that

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
with a hair tie think when debates that

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.360 
with a hair tie think when debates that
side<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.229> will<00:01:21.350> sit<00:01:21.590> actually<00:01:21.920> like<00:01:22.070> that<00:01:22.280> on

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
side it will sit actually like that on

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.370 
side it will sit actually like that on
the<00:01:22.460> bottom<00:01:22.790> with<00:01:23.330> right<00:01:23.570> all<00:01:23.750> cut<00:01:23.960> this<00:01:24.170> it's

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
the bottom with right all cut this it's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.080 
the bottom with right all cut this it's
a<00:01:24.409> little<00:01:24.620> bit<00:01:24.710> weird<00:01:24.890> right<00:01:25.130> but<00:01:25.670> when<00:01:26.000> it

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
a little bit weird right but when it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.640 
a little bit weird right but when it
goes<00:01:26.180> in<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.450> fish's<00:01:26.720> mouth<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.110> corks<00:01:27.440> going

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
goes in the fish's mouth the corks going

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.890 
goes in the fish's mouth the corks going
to<00:01:27.710> want<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:27.920> go<00:01:28.010> in<00:01:28.130> first<00:01:28.400> which<00:01:28.820> makes<00:01:29.630> the

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
to want to go in first which makes the

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.779 
to want to go in first which makes the
hook<00:01:30.440> going<00:01:30.710> quicker<00:01:31.130> than<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.399> would<00:01:31.549> do<00:01:31.670> if

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
hook going quicker than it would do if

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.090 
strip back on on the soft coat with hook
link<00:01:54.229> there<00:01:54.469> yeah

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
link there yeah

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.310 
link there yeah
dude<00:01:55.759> why'd<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.090> ideally<00:01:56.299> put<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:56.630> strip

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
dude why'd you ideally put that strip

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.440 
dude why'd you ideally put that strip
that<00:01:57.469> because<00:01:58.130> I'm<00:01:58.189> so<00:01:58.399> paranoid<00:01:58.609> at<00:01:58.939> angles<00:01:59.329> I

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
that because I'm so paranoid at angles I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.060 
that because I'm so paranoid at angles I
want<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.170> least<00:02:00.380> amount<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.710> Tanks<00:02:00.979> as

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
want the least amount of Tanks as

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.950 
want the least amount of Tanks as
possible<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.789> think<00:02:02.149> if<00:02:02.299> a<00:02:02.359> fish<00:02:02.539> blows<00:02:02.750> that

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
possible so I think if a fish blows that

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.639 
possible so I think if a fish blows that
out

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
out

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.319 
out
it<00:02:04.100> doesn't<00:02:04.369> hook<00:02:04.429> it<00:02:04.579> first<00:02:04.759> time<00:02:05.060> then

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
it doesn't hook it first time then

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.710 
it doesn't hook it first time then
that's<00:02:06.049> not<00:02:06.259> gonna<00:02:06.409> it's<00:02:06.920> not<00:02:07.149> now<00:02:08.149> right<00:02:08.420> okay

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
that's not gonna it's not now right okay

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.010 
that's not gonna it's not now right okay
cool

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
cool

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.350 
cool
and<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.800> reasonably<00:02:10.550> long<00:02:10.700> hooking<00:02:11.090> that's<00:02:11.240> not

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
and a reasonably long hooking that's not

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.760

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
it's just the LED heat in the bottom it

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.130 
it's just the LED heat in the bottom it
gives<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:28.940> an<00:02:29.030> idea<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.330> date<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.720> way<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.930> is

gives you an idea a date the way it is

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.600 
gives you an idea a date the way it is
that's<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.590> most<00:02:30.740> important<00:02:31.190> thing<00:02:31.220> about<00:02:31.370> my

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
that's the most important thing about my

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.740 
that's the most important thing about my
fishing<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:31.970> think<00:02:32.150> he's<00:02:32.240> filling<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.600> lid

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
fishing I think he's filling the lid

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.780 
fishing I think he's filling the lid
down<00:02:32.930> right<00:02:33.380> if<00:02:33.890> I'm<00:02:34.069> not<00:02:34.160> happy<00:02:34.370> with<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:34.640> job

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
down right if I'm not happy with the job

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.830 
down right if I'm not happy with the job
they're<00:02:34.910> not<00:02:35.000> really<00:02:35.150> in<00:02:35.390> that's<00:02:35.750> why

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
they're not really in that's why

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.180 
they're not really in that's why
sometimes<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.350> cost<00:02:36.530> three<00:02:36.710> or<00:02:36.800> four<00:02:36.950> times

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
sometimes it cost three or four times

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.190 
sometimes it cost three or four times
right

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
right

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.600 
right
yeah<00:02:39.200> something<00:02:39.620> we<00:02:39.710> all<00:02:39.800> do<00:02:40.010> as<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.190> matter<00:02:40.400> of

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
yeah something we all do as a matter of

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.430 
yeah something we all do as a matter of
you<00:02:41.270> don't<00:02:41.450> see<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.630> lot<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.870> other<00:02:42.050> people

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
you don't see a lot of other people

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.200 
you don't see a lot of other people
donate<00:02:42.800> it's<00:02:43.400> really<00:02:43.640> important<00:02:43.940> thing<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.090> do

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
donate it's really important thing to do

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.660 
donate it's really important thing to do
I<00:02:44.270> think<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.380> then<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.740> simple<00:02:46.310> lead<00:02:46.460> clip

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
I think that and then a simple lead clip

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.490 
I think that and then a simple lead clip
system<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.450> you've<00:02:47.570> got<00:02:47.720> tubing<00:02:48.140> on<00:02:48.260> there

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
system and you've got tubing on there

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.680 
system and you've got tubing on there
rather<00:02:49.340> than<00:02:49.610> any<00:02:49.760> sort<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.030> safe<00:02:50.240> sound<00:02:50.510> lead

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
rather than any sort of safe sound lead

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.750 
rather than any sort of safe sound lead
or<00:02:50.870> anything<00:02:51.080> anyway<00:02:51.560> tend<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.280> use<00:02:52.370> tube<00:02:52.610> when

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
or anything anyway tend to use tube when

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.250 
or anything anyway tend to use tube when
I'm<00:02:52.880> fishing<00:02:53.060> further<00:02:53.420> out<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.930> we've<00:02:54.080> seen

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
I'm fishing further out and we've seen

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.450 
I'm fishing further out and we've seen
good<00:02:54.350> baits<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.860> just<00:02:55.070> don't<00:02:55.220> get<00:02:55.340> any

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
good baits you just don't get any

works<00:03:16.310> on<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.460> same<00:03:16.610> principles<00:03:17.060> for<00:03:17.240> the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
works on the same principles for the

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.630 
works on the same principles for the
mother<00:03:17.690> Brian<00:03:18.470> this<00:03:18.800> just<00:03:19.070> allows<00:03:19.190> me<00:03:19.340> to

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
mother Brian this just allows me to

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.949 
mother Brian this just allows me to
balance<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:20.030> even<00:03:20.240> more<00:03:20.360> but<00:03:20.540> I<00:03:20.630> can<00:03:20.780> put<00:03:20.900> the

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
balance it even more but I can put the

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.510 
balance it even more but I can put the
court<00:03:21.140> born<00:03:21.320> first<00:03:21.560> put<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.250> in<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.400> water

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
court born first put it in the water

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.400 
court born first put it in the water
then<00:03:23.090> trim<00:03:23.360> it<00:03:23.420> down<00:03:23.480> into<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:24.050> just<00:03:24.080> sinks

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
then trim it down into it just sinks

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.680 
then trim it down into it just sinks
