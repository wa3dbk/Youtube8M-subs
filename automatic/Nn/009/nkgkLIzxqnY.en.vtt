comfortable that as well thing I realize
is<00:02:58.990> not<00:02:59.680> just<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.010> caliber<00:03:00.460> and<00:03:00.820> not<00:03:01.030> just<00:03:01.270> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
is not just a caliber and not just the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.660 
is not just a caliber and not just the
ease<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.960> maintenance<00:03:02.350> but<00:03:03.070> also<00:03:03.220> weight

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
ease of maintenance but also weight

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.430 
ease of maintenance but also weight
weight<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.210> major<00:03:04.540> factor<00:03:04.900> especially

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
weight is a major factor especially

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.800 
weight is a major factor especially
after<00:03:06.010> four<00:03:06.250> hours<00:03:06.280> with<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.330> rifle<00:03:07.510> on<00:03:07.750> your

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
is let's make it light enough to be

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.020 
is let's make it light enough to be
practical<00:03:12.280> but<00:03:12.370> let's<00:03:12.550> not<00:03:12.700> give<00:03:12.910> up

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
practical but let's not give up
