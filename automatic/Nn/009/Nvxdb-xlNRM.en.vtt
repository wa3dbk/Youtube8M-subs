security<00:00:12.929> camera<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.920> very<00:00:14.340> similar<00:00:14.880> to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
security camera this is very similar to

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.670 
security camera this is very similar to
their<00:00:15.210> time-lapse<00:00:15.870> camera<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.529> looked

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
their time-lapse camera that we looked

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.439 
their time-lapse camera that we looked
at<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> few<00:00:17.010> weeks<00:00:17.190> ago<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:18.090> kind<00:00:18.330> of

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
at a few weeks ago but it's kind of

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.870 
at a few weeks ago but it's kind of
tuned<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.430> detecting<00:00:20.430> things<00:00:20.640> that

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
tuned in for detecting things that

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.970 
tuned in for detecting things that
happen<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.359> front<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.020> it's<00:00:22.500> got<00:00:22.650> some

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
happen in front of it and it's got some

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.890 
happen in front of it and it's got some
decent<00:00:23.130> low-light<00:00:23.699> sensitivity<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.630> no

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
decent low-light sensitivity but no

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.509 
decent low-light sensitivity but no
night-vision<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.800> just<00:00:26.010> be<00:00:26.099> aware<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.340> that

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
night-vision so just be aware of that

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.000 
night-vision so just be aware of that
coming<00:00:26.820> into<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.599> runs<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:28.199> two<00:00:28.560> D

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
coming into it it runs on two D

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.250 
coming into it it runs on two D
batteries<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.210> battery<00:00:30.570> life<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:31.019> so

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
batteries and the battery life is so

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.560 
batteries and the battery life is so
efficient<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.460> it'll<00:00:32.969> probably<00:00:33.000> go

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
efficient on this that it'll probably go

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.240 
efficient on this that it'll probably go
for<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> couple<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.230> weeks<00:00:34.290> before<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.980> need<00:00:35.130> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
for a couple of weeks before you need to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.950 
for a couple of weeks before you need to
swap<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.640> batteries<00:00:36.059> out<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.540> nice<00:00:36.719> is

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
swap the batteries out so it's nice is

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.810 
swap the batteries out so it's nice is
that<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.380> set<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.250> up<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.610> if<00:00:38.700> you're

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that you can set this up and if you're

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.700 
that you can set this up and if you're
waiting<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.149> something<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.570> happen<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.530> can

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
waiting for something to happen you can

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.290 
waiting for something to happen you can
not<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.190> really<00:00:41.399> worry<00:00:41.460> about<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:42.210> out

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
not have to really worry about going out

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.670 
not have to really worry about going out
and<00:00:42.329> checking<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.780> batteries<00:00:43.140> every<00:00:43.379> morning

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
and checking the batteries every morning

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.470 
and checking the batteries every morning
because<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.340> than<00:00:44.430> likely<00:00:44.489> they'll<00:00:45.239> still

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
because more than likely they'll still

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.819 
because more than likely they'll still
be<00:00:45.600> fine<00:00:45.809> I've<00:00:45.989> been<00:00:46.079> using<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.379> off<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.770> on

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
be fine I've been using this off and on

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.680 
be fine I've been using this off and on
for<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.100> better<00:00:47.280> part<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.730> week<00:00:47.760> now<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.450> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
for the better part of a week now and I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.479 
for the better part of a week now and I
still<00:00:48.960> haven't<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.379> even<00:00:50.070> scratched<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
still haven't really even scratched the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.830 
still haven't really even scratched the
surface<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.000> battery<00:00:51.239> indicator<00:00:51.539> is

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
surface so the battery indicator is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.330 
surface so the battery indicator is
still<00:00:52.020> showing<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.500> think<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:52.920> still<00:00:53.070> showing

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
still showing I think it's still showing

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.160 
still showing I think it's still showing
completely<00:00:53.820> full<00:00:54.030> at<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> moment<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
completely full at the moment you have a

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.840 
completely full at the moment you have a
little<00:00:55.469> motion<00:00:55.860> detector<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.699> will

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
little motion detector here that will

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.639 
little motion detector here that will
detect<00:00:57.420> motion<00:00:57.719> events<00:00:58.170> when<00:00:58.289> something

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
detect motion events when something

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.229 
detect motion events when something
walks<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.039> front<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> camera<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.940> can

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
walks in front of the camera and you can

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.849 
walks in front of the camera and you can
have<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.719> different<00:01:01.109> things<00:01:01.140> depending<00:01:01.379> on

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
have it do different things depending on

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.740 
have it do different things depending on
how<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.430> configured<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.359> comes<00:01:03.570> with

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
how you have it configured it comes with

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.420 
how you have it configured it comes with
two<00:01:03.899> mounting<00:01:04.350> options<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:04.949> got<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> strap

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
two mounting options it's got a strap

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.429 
two mounting options it's got a strap
here<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.970> tying<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.600> around<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.930> tree<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
here for tying it around a tree or a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.350 
here for tying it around a tree or a
post<00:01:07.740> or<00:01:07.920> something<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.909> also<00:01:09.060> has

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
post or something like that it also has

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.760 
post or something like that it also has
a<00:01:09.390> little<00:01:09.630> mounting<00:01:10.080> bracket<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.619> can

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
a little mounting bracket that you can

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.590 
a little mounting bracket that you can
install<00:01:11.100> somewhere<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> plugs<00:01:12.420> into

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
install somewhere and then it plugs into

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.690 
install somewhere and then it plugs into
the<00:01:12.840> tripod<00:01:13.229> mount<00:01:13.500> at<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.890> bottom<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.549> can

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the tripod mount at the bottom you can

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
the tripod mount at the bottom you can
also<00:01:14.760> use<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> padlock<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.960> secure<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
also use a padlock to secure the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.469 
also use a padlock to secure the
electronics<00:01:17.130> from<00:01:17.189> being<00:01:17.430> open<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.210> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
electronics from being open so as you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.390 
electronics from being open so as you
can<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> clamp<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.220> put<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
can see on the clamp here you can put a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.130 
can see on the clamp here you can put a
lock<00:01:20.880> right<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.720> course<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.020> could

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
lock right in there of course you could

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.570 
lock right in there of course you could
probably<00:01:22.290> force<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.799> open<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.490> you

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
probably force it open with if you

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.580 
probably force it open with if you
really<00:01:23.880> wanted<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.720> it'll<00:01:25.350> make<00:01:25.439> it

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
really wanted to but it'll make it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.039 
really wanted to but it'll make it
easier<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.070> least<00:01:26.130> four<00:01:26.549> or<00:01:26.850> harder<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
easier at least four or harder for you

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.149 
easier at least four or harder for you
know<00:01:28.140> someone<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.439> looking<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> quick

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
know someone just looking for a quick

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.370 
know someone just looking for a quick
swipe<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.939> memory<00:01:30.180> card<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.200> so

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
swipe of the memory card to get at it so

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.069 
swipe of the memory card to get at it so
inside<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.579> weatherproof<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.689> got<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> nice

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
inside it's weatherproof it's got a nice

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289 
inside it's weatherproof it's got a nice
gasket<00:01:34.979> around<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.369> electronics<00:01:35.970> here<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
gasket around the electronics here and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.300 
gasket around the electronics here and
this<00:01:36.390> seals<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.840> really<00:01:37.170> tight<00:01:37.409> as<00:01:37.619> well<00:01:38.189> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
this seals up really tight as well you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.429 
this seals up really tight as well you
can<00:01:38.430> hear<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.670> really<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.060> snap<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.409> I

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
can hear that really just snap in so I

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.200 
can hear that really just snap in so I
think<00:01:40.560> it'll<00:01:40.860> survive<00:01:41.189> pretty<00:01:41.460> well<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:41.909> in

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
think it'll survive pretty well out in

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.480 
think it'll survive pretty well out in
weather<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:43.170> runs<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.500> an<00:01:43.649> SD<00:01:43.950> card<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
weather it runs on an SD card what it

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.780 
weather it runs on an SD card what it
does<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> records<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.840> AVI<00:01:46.770> video<00:01:47.250> files

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
does is it records to AVI video files

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.520 
does is it records to AVI video files
and<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> time-lapse<00:01:48.899> camera<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.350> looked

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and like the time-lapse camera we looked

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.649 
and like the time-lapse camera we looked
at<00:01:49.680> before<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.250> it'll<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.450> set

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
at before what it'll do is you can set

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.179 
at before what it'll do is you can set
it<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.840> record<00:01:51.990> at<00:01:52.350> an<00:01:52.470> interval<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.100> can

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
it to record at an interval so you can

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.700 
it to record at an interval so you can
say<00:01:53.369> capture<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.850> frame<00:01:54.090> maybe<00:01:54.720> every<00:01:55.110> 5<00:01:55.350> or<00:01:55.560> 10

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
say capture a frame maybe every 5 or 10

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.399 
say capture a frame maybe every 5 or 10
seconds<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.570> continually<00:01:57.570> write<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
seconds and continually write to that a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.170 
seconds and continually write to that a
file<00:01:58.890> all<00:01:59.159> night<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.700> what<00:01:59.820> it'll<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.149> is

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
file all night and what it'll do is

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.780 
file all night and what it'll do is
either<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.110> exclusively<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.670> can

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
either do that exclusively or you can

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.429 
either do that exclusively or you can
run<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.240> hybrid<00:02:03.689> mode<00:02:03.869> where<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.229> just

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
run it in a hybrid mode where it just

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.230 
run it in a hybrid mode where it just
does<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> frame<00:02:05.130> every<00:02:05.250> 5<00:02:05.520> or<00:02:05.700> 10<00:02:05.820> seconds

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
does like a frame every 5 or 10 seconds

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.550 
does like a frame every 5 or 10 seconds
and<00:02:06.360> then<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.689> detects<00:02:07.079> some<00:02:07.259> motion

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
and then if it detects some motion

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.229 
and then if it detects some motion
events<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:07.979> will<00:02:08.039> continually<00:02:08.580> take<00:02:08.879> pictures

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
events it will continually take pictures

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.839 
events it will continually take pictures
until<00:02:09.479> those<00:02:10.229> motion<00:02:10.679> events<00:02:11.129> cease<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
until those motion events cease you

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.790 
until those motion events cease you
could<00:02:12.000> also<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.300> have<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.780> run<00:02:13.020> at

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
could also just have it run at

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.620 
could also just have it run at
in<00:02:13.830> motion<00:02:14.250> mode<00:02:14.490> only<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.390> will<00:02:15.480> only

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
in motion mode only so that it will only

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.600 
in motion mode only so that it will only
turn<00:02:15.930> itself<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.650> record<00:02:16.950> something<00:02:17.220> if

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
turn itself on and record something if

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.370 
turn itself on and record something if
something<00:02:18.210> crosses<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:18.720> front<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.050> camera

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
something crosses in front of the camera

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.570 
something crosses in front of the camera
so<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.560> have<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.680> couple<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.040> different<00:02:20.370> modes

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
so you have a couple of different modes

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.190 
so you have a couple of different modes
there<00:02:20.820> I'm<00:02:21.330> just<00:02:21.540> going<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.720> briefly<00:02:21.840> run

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
there I'm just going to briefly run

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.330 
there I'm just going to briefly run
through<00:02:22.500> some<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.860> features<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
through some of the features of the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.310 
through some of the features of the
camera<00:02:23.490> right<00:02:24.180> now<00:02:24.300> it's<00:02:24.510> set<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.840> hybrid<00:02:25.290> mode

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
camera right now it's set in hybrid mode

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.930 
camera right now it's set in hybrid mode
and<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.100> means<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.490> going<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.700> take<00:02:26.910> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
and that means it's going to take a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.820 
and that means it's going to take a
picture<00:02:27.180> every<00:02:27.600> 10<00:02:27.780> seconds<00:02:28.230> regardless<00:02:28.680> of

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
picture every 10 seconds regardless of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.220 
picture every 10 seconds regardless of
what<00:02:29.070> this<00:02:29.250> sees<00:02:29.520> but<00:02:30.270> will<00:02:30.390> also<00:02:30.570> take<00:02:30.900> more

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
what this sees but will also take more

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.660 
what this sees but will also take more
if<00:02:31.500> something<00:02:31.860> happens<00:02:32.220> now<00:02:32.370> one<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
if something happens now one of the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.740 
if something happens now one of the
things<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.000> noticed<00:02:33.300> with<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.720> that

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
things that I noticed with it is that

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.720 
things that I noticed with it is that
you<00:02:34.200> see<00:02:34.350> where<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.620> says<00:02:34.650> weight<00:02:35.130> PIR

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
you see where it says weight PIR

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.460 
you see where it says weight PIR
basically<00:02:36.210> it's<00:02:36.360> waiting<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:36.990> sensor<00:02:37.440> I

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
basically it's waiting on this sensor I

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.440 
basically it's waiting on this sensor I
guess<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.860> get<00:02:38.040> heated<00:02:38.340> up<00:02:38.550> or<00:02:38.700> calibrated<00:02:39.330> or

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
guess to get heated up or calibrated or

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.240 
guess to get heated up or calibrated or
something<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.020> what<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.380> found<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:40.920> you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
something and what I found is that you

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.100 
something and what I found is that you
have<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.580> wait<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.820> really<00:02:42.180> long<00:02:42.330> time<00:02:42.750> for<00:02:42.810> that

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
have to wait a really long time for that

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.110 
have to wait a really long time for that
weight<00:02:43.320> PIR<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.950> go<00:02:44.070> away<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.880> can't

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
weight PIR to go away and you can't

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.460 
weight PIR to go away and you can't
really<00:02:45.240> start<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.750> camera<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.350> know

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
really start the camera you know

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.960 
really start the camera you know
recording<00:02:47.040> or<00:02:47.130> getting<00:02:47.280> ready<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.640> record

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
recording or getting ready to record

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.880 
recording or getting ready to record
until<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.900> message<00:02:49.260> goes<00:02:49.440> away<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:49.740> you

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
until that message goes away so you

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.200 
until that message goes away so you
kinda<00:02:50.070> have<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.220> hang<00:02:50.430> around<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.850> wait<00:02:50.970> for

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
kinda have to hang around and wait for

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.360 
kinda have to hang around and wait for
that<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.360> happen<00:02:51.860> then<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:52.920> have<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.070> go<00:02:53.190> back

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
that to happen then you have to go back

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.400 
that to happen then you have to go back
and<00:02:53.610> hit<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.820> OK<00:02:54.120> button<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.690> begin<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
and hit the OK button to begin the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
whatever it's going to do so I'm just

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.650 
whatever it's going to do so I'm just
going<00:02:59.460> to<00:02:59.550> briefly<00:02:59.700> step<00:03:00.030> through<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.300> couple

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
going to briefly step through a couple

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.240 
going to briefly step through a couple
of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.990> things<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.440> found<00:03:01.980> interesting

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
of the things that I found interesting

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.610 
of the things that I found interesting
within<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.480> menu<00:03:03.660> system<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.200> first<00:03:04.320> is<00:03:04.530> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
within the menu system the first is the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.590 
within the menu system the first is the
capture<00:03:05.010> mode<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.520> set<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.850> work

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
capture mode so you can set it to work

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.940 
capture mode so you can set it to work
in<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.840> hybrid<00:03:07.200> mode<00:03:07.410> where<00:03:07.710> you<00:03:07.920> can

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
in that hybrid mode where you can

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.340 
in that hybrid mode where you can
records<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.760> time-lapse<00:03:09.600> video<00:03:09.750> plus<00:03:10.170> any

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
records a time-lapse video plus any

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.020 
records a time-lapse video plus any
motion<00:03:10.710> events<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.130> occur<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.760> can<00:03:11.790> also

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
motion events that occur you can also

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.760 
motion events that occur you can also
have<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.330> just<00:03:12.660> do<00:03:12.810> motion<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.440> it'll<00:03:13.680> only

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
have a just do motion so it'll only

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.290 
have a just do motion so it'll only
record<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.370> something<00:03:14.550> trips<00:03:14.940> off<00:03:15.090> that

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
record of something trips off that

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.850 
record of something trips off that
sensor<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.900> then<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.290> can<00:03:16.410> do<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.530> time<00:03:16.830> lapse

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
sensor and then you can do a time lapse

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.560 
sensor and then you can do a time lapse
mode<00:03:17.310> where<00:03:17.520> it<00:03:17.610> doesn't<00:03:17.850> use<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.000> sensor<00:03:18.450> at

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
mode where it doesn't use the sensor at

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.300 
mode where it doesn't use the sensor at
all<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.050> records<00:03:19.440> all<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.770> time<00:03:19.800> so

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
all and just records all the time so

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.180 
all and just records all the time so
we'll<00:03:20.459> switch<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.150> back<00:03:21.330> into<00:03:21.959> hybrid<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:23.040> can

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
we'll switch it back into hybrid you can

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.590 
we'll switch it back into hybrid you can
also<00:03:23.340> set<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.270> know<00:03:24.360> again

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
also set it so that if you know again

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.940 
also set it so that if you know again
the<00:03:24.690> batteries<00:03:25.050> on<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.380> lasts<00:03:25.680> forever

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
the batteries on this lasts forever

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.430 
the batteries on this lasts forever
literally<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.720> chances<00:03:28.080> are<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.290> might

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
literally so the chances are you might

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.979 
literally so the chances are you might
over<00:03:28.800> over<00:03:29.280> fill<00:03:29.670> up<00:03:29.760> your<00:03:29.790> card<00:03:30.180> over<00:03:30.360> time<00:03:30.690> so

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
over over fill up your card over time so

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.620 
over over fill up your card over time so
what<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:31.860> do<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.250> erase<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.850> old<00:03:32.880> files<00:03:33.360> on

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
what it can do is erase the old files on

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.840 
what it can do is erase the old files on
the<00:03:33.750> card<00:03:34.020> to<00:03:34.590> make<00:03:34.739> room<00:03:35.010> for<00:03:35.040> new<00:03:35.430> ones<00:03:35.459> and

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
the card to make room for new ones and

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.040 
the card to make room for new ones and
that's<00:03:36.000> helpful<00:03:36.360> if<00:03:36.600> you're<00:03:36.720> waiting<00:03:36.900> for

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
that's helpful if you're waiting for

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.540 
that's helpful if you're waiting for
something<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.470> happen<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:38.010> didn't<00:03:38.280> happen

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
something to happen that didn't happen

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.620 
something to happen that didn't happen
you<00:03:38.640> don't<00:03:38.760> have<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:38.910> keep<00:03:39.030> going<00:03:39.180> out<00:03:39.450> and

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
you don't have to keep going out and

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.229 
you don't have to keep going out and
erasing<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.650> card<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.070> will<00:03:41.160> basically<00:03:41.850> erase

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
erasing the card it will basically erase

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.300 
erasing the card it will basically erase
the<00:03:42.450> old<00:03:42.630> files<00:03:42.989> for<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.530> as<00:03:43.709> time<00:03:43.950> goes<00:03:44.160> on

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
the old files for you as time goes on

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.400 
the old files for you as time goes on
you<00:03:44.550> can<00:03:44.940> also<00:03:45.060> set<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.570> do<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.720> timer<00:03:46.080> so

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
you can also set it to do a timer so

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.199 
you can also set it to do a timer so
that<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:47.070> doesn't<00:03:47.400> do<00:03:47.520> anything<00:03:47.790> perhaps

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
that it doesn't do anything perhaps

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.220 
that it doesn't do anything perhaps
during<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.600> day<00:03:48.750> when<00:03:48.930> there's<00:03:49.080> people

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
during the day when there's people

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.680 
during the day when there's people
around<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:49.709> maybe<00:03:49.830> you<00:03:50.010> set<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.489> start<00:03:51.090> its

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
around so maybe you set it to start its

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.690 
around so maybe you set it to start its
recording<00:03:52.230> function<00:03:52.739> around<00:03:52.920> 5:00<00:03:53.220> p.m.<00:03:53.459> when

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
recording function around 5:00 p.m. when

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.000 
recording function around 5:00 p.m. when
everybody<00:03:54.030> leaves<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.600> then<00:03:54.690> turns<00:03:55.380> off<00:03:55.650> at<00:03:55.830> 8

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
everybody leaves and then turns off at 8

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.590 
everybody leaves and then turns off at 8
a.m.<00:03:56.130> when<00:03:56.430> everyone<00:03:56.700> comes<00:03:56.850> back<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.360> so<00:03:57.570> you

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
a.m. when everyone comes back in so you

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.479 
a.m. when everyone comes back in so you
can<00:03:57.840> have<00:03:58.200> some<00:03:58.380> flexibility<00:03:58.920> there<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.310> not

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
can have some flexibility there to not

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.030 
can have some flexibility there to not
waste<00:04:00.090> battery<00:04:00.480> or<00:04:00.690> recording<00:04:01.230> time<00:04:01.410> there's

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
waste battery or recording time there's

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.770 
waste battery or recording time there's
a<00:04:02.100> playback<00:04:02.400> rate<00:04:02.700> here<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:02.970> recommend<00:04:03.150> always

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
a playback rate here I recommend always

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.270 
a playback rate here I recommend always
running<00:04:04.050> this<00:04:04.140> in<00:04:04.320> 30<00:04:04.530> frames<00:04:04.800> per<00:04:04.890> second

running this in 30 frames per second

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.220 
running this in 30 frames per second
because<00:04:05.370> that's<00:04:05.520> what<00:04:05.760> most<00:04:05.880> video<00:04:06.239> systems

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
because that's what most video systems

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.699 
because that's what most video systems
like<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.709> playback<00:04:08.130> at<00:04:08.340> at<00:04:08.459> least<00:04:08.600> YouTube<00:04:09.709> for

the best setting you can have it put a

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.960 
the best setting you can have it put a
time<00:04:19.799> stamp<00:04:20.070> on<00:04:20.190> there<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.489> can<00:04:20.609> also<00:04:20.760> disable

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
time stamp on there you can also disable

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.570 
time stamp on there you can also disable
the<00:04:21.480> little<00:04:22.169> LED<00:04:22.560> light<00:04:22.590> here<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.039> blinks

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
the little LED light here that blinks

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.490 
the little LED light here that blinks
when<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.940> motion<00:04:24.360> detector<00:04:24.840> is<00:04:25.020> sensing

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
when the motion detector is sensing

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.140 
when the motion detector is sensing
something<00:04:25.860> happening<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:26.640> let's<00:04:26.669> take<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> look

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
something happening so let's take a look

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.800 
something happening so let's take a look
at<00:04:27.330> some<00:04:27.570> in

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
at some in

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.659 
at some in
samples<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.590> left<00:04:28.950> this<00:04:29.070> out<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.490> yard

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
samples and I left this out in the yard

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.340 
samples and I left this out in the yard
overnight<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.450> as<00:04:30.690> you<00:04:30.810> can<00:04:30.930> see<00:04:31.080> when<00:04:31.260> the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
overnight and as you can see when the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.960 
overnight and as you can see when the
sun<00:04:31.530> went<00:04:31.710> down<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.130> it<00:04:32.190> got<00:04:32.310> really<00:04:32.490> dark<00:04:32.730> out

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
sun went down and it got really dark out

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.690 
sun went down and it got really dark out
it<00:04:33.120> saw<00:04:33.300> nothing<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:34.110> was<00:04:34.260> totally<00:04:34.800> dark<00:04:34.980> but

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
it saw nothing it was totally dark but

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.340 
it saw nothing it was totally dark but
as<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.970> Sun<00:04:36.150> came<00:04:36.330> up<00:04:36.389> obviously<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:37.050> started

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
as the Sun came up obviously it started

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.110 
as the Sun came up obviously it started
seeing<00:04:37.590> more<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:38.010> problem<00:04:38.370> though<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.730> that

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
seeing more the problem though is that

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.970 
seeing more the problem though is that
the<00:04:39.210> colors<00:04:39.570> are<00:04:39.600> completely<00:04:40.350> off<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.919> I'm

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
the colors are completely off and I'm

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.070 
the colors are completely off and I'm
told<00:04:41.220> that's<00:04:41.460> because<00:04:41.880> they've<00:04:42.600> tuned<00:04:42.930> the

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
told that's because they've tuned the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.960 
told that's because they've tuned the
camera<00:04:43.410> to<00:04:43.500> be<00:04:43.620> very<00:04:43.830> sensitive<00:04:44.310> in<00:04:44.520> low-light

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
camera to be very sensitive in low-light

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.940 
camera to be very sensitive in low-light
conditions<00:04:45.000> where<00:04:45.750> it<00:04:45.960> has<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.350> little<00:04:46.500> bit<00:04:46.860> of

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
conditions where it has a little bit of

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.500 
conditions where it has a little bit of
ambient<00:04:47.400> light<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.580> work<00:04:47.880> with<00:04:48.120> it'll<00:04:48.330> see

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
ambient light to work with it'll see

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.330 
ambient light to work with it'll see
something<00:04:49.050> but<00:04:49.290> it<00:04:49.680> doesn't<00:04:49.710> have<00:04:50.130> night

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
something but it doesn't have night

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.100 
something but it doesn't have night
visions<00:04:50.760> so<00:04:50.910> there's<00:04:51.060> no<00:04:51.240> way<00:04:51.419> for<00:04:51.690> it<00:04:51.960> to

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
visions so there's no way for it to

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.780 
visions so there's no way for it to
really<00:04:52.260> see<00:04:52.530> anything<00:04:53.040> in<00:04:53.160> complete<00:04:53.460> darkness

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
really see anything in complete darkness

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.129 
really see anything in complete darkness
a<00:04:53.970> lot<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.240> other<00:04:54.360> cameras<00:04:54.780> I've<00:04:54.930> looked

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
a lot of the other cameras I've looked

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.510 
a lot of the other cameras I've looked
at<00:04:55.290> security<00:04:55.440> cameras<00:04:55.980> that<00:04:56.100> I've<00:04:56.190> looked<00:04:56.310> at

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
at security cameras that I've looked at

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.330 
at security cameras that I've looked at
have<00:04:57.270> those<00:04:57.510> little<00:04:57.780> infrared<00:04:58.410> flashlights

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
have those little infrared flashlights

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.920 
have those little infrared flashlights
on<00:04:59.490> them<00:04:59.639> that<00:04:59.700> nobody<00:04:59.850> can<00:05:00.180> see<00:05:00.419> but<00:05:00.720> at<00:05:00.810> least

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
on them that nobody can see but at least

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.780 
on them that nobody can see but at least
it<00:05:01.229> can<00:05:01.590> illuminate<00:05:02.040> for<00:05:02.310> a<00:05:02.370> night<00:05:02.580> vision

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
it can illuminate for a night vision

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.040 
it can illuminate for a night vision
sensor<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.450> again<00:05:03.630> this<00:05:03.720> is<00:05:03.870> not<00:05:03.990> a

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
sensor and again this is not a

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.050 
sensor and again this is not a
night-vision<00:05:04.350> camera<00:05:05.100> what<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.520> did<00:05:05.729> do<00:05:05.910> though

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
night-vision camera what I did do though

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.790 
night-vision camera what I did do though
is<00:05:06.210> I<00:05:06.300> tested<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.840> darkest<00:05:07.229> spot<00:05:07.440> in<00:05:07.560> my<00:05:07.650> house

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
is I tested the darkest spot in my house

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.560 
is I tested the darkest spot in my house
during<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.250> day<00:05:08.370> which<00:05:08.550> is<00:05:08.580> where<00:05:08.940> my<00:05:09.360> closet

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
during the day which is where my closet

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.750 
during the day which is where my closet
where<00:05:09.870> my<00:05:09.960> dog<00:05:10.169> was<00:05:10.410> resting<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:10.950> I<00:05:11.040> closed

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
where my dog was resting and I closed

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.100 
where my dog was resting and I closed
all<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:11.970> doors<00:05:12.270> up<00:05:12.450> left<00:05:12.630> a<00:05:12.690> little<00:05:12.900> bit<00:05:13.020> of

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
all the doors up left a little bit of

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.629 
all the doors up left a little bit of
ambient<00:05:13.500> light<00:05:13.530> coming<00:05:13.979> in<00:05:14.070> as<00:05:14.190> you<00:05:14.310> can<00:05:14.460> see

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
ambient light coming in as you can see

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.460 
ambient light coming in as you can see
it<00:05:15.270> actually<00:05:15.510> took<00:05:15.600> a<00:05:15.720> pretty<00:05:15.930> decent<00:05:16.290> image

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
it actually took a pretty decent image

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.770 
it actually took a pretty decent image
the<00:05:16.680> closet<00:05:17.130> to<00:05:17.250> your<00:05:17.520> my<00:05:17.850> eyes<00:05:18.000> looks<00:05:18.389> a<00:05:18.540> lot

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
the closet to your my eyes looks a lot

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.870 
the closet to your my eyes looks a lot
darker<00:05:19.050> than<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.860> image<00:05:20.160> sample<00:05:20.550> that<00:05:20.669> came

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
darker than the image sample that came

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.909 
darker than the image sample that came
out<00:05:21.060> of<00:05:21.210> here<00:05:21.450> so<00:05:21.720> I<00:05:21.900> think<00:05:22.500> if<00:05:22.590> you've<00:05:22.710> got

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
out of here so I think if you've got

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.379 
out of here so I think if you've got
like<00:05:23.040> a<00:05:23.100> porch<00:05:23.430> light<00:05:23.490> on<00:05:23.790> or<00:05:23.940> something<00:05:24.270> in

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
like a porch light on or something in

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.030 
like a porch light on or something in
the<00:05:24.450> area<00:05:24.750> that<00:05:24.870> you're<00:05:24.990> monitoring<00:05:25.770> it'll

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
the area that you're monitoring it'll

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.440 
the area that you're monitoring it'll
work<00:05:26.190> pretty<00:05:26.430> well<00:05:26.669> I<00:05:26.880> think<00:05:27.090> where<00:05:27.360> this

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
work pretty well I think where this

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.570 
work pretty well I think where this
camera<00:05:27.810> can<00:05:27.960> be<00:05:27.990> useful<00:05:28.530> is<00:05:28.740> if<00:05:29.220> you<00:05:29.340> have<00:05:29.550> a

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
camera can be useful is if you have a

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.580 
camera can be useful is if you have a
few<00:05:30.030> areas<00:05:30.450> that<00:05:30.600> you<00:05:31.020> might<00:05:31.169> want<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.410> take<00:05:31.530> a

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
few areas that you might want to take a

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.260 
few areas that you might want to take a
closer<00:05:31.860> look<00:05:32.130> at<00:05:32.340> for<00:05:32.490> an<00:05:32.580> extended<00:05:32.970> period<00:05:33.090> of

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
closer look at for an extended period of

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.850 
closer look at for an extended period of
time<00:05:33.360> you<00:05:33.660> can<00:05:33.750> kind<00:05:33.930> of<00:05:33.990> set<00:05:34.200> it<00:05:34.320> up<00:05:34.410> out<00:05:34.590> there

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
time you can kind of set it up out there

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.620 
time you can kind of set it up out there
leave<00:05:35.430> it<00:05:35.610> not<00:05:35.850> really<00:05:36.060> have<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.240> check<00:05:36.419> on<00:05:36.600> it

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
leave it not really have to check on it

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.330 
leave it not really have to check on it
all<00:05:36.810> that<00:05:36.930> often<00:05:37.140> you<00:05:37.380> have<00:05:37.530> to<00:05:37.560> run<00:05:37.740> wires<00:05:37.979> to

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
all that often you have to run wires to

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.219 
all that often you have to run wires to
get<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.580> camera<00:05:38.880> hooked<00:05:39.090> up<00:05:39.270> and<00:05:39.930> it's<00:05:40.080> really

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
get the camera hooked up and it's really

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:41.990 
get the camera hooked up and it's really
nice<00:05:40.530> of<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:40.800> batteries<00:05:41.220> on<00:05:41.340> this<00:05:41.520> last<00:05:41.789> as

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
nice of the batteries on this last as

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.640 
nice of the batteries on this last as
long<00:05:42.180> as<00:05:42.240> it<00:05:42.479> does<00:05:42.870> I<00:05:43.020> haven't<00:05:43.260> really<00:05:43.440> seen

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
long as it does I haven't really seen

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.800 
long as it does I haven't really seen
even<00:05:44.490> like<00:05:44.610> those<00:05:44.760> game<00:05:45.000> cameras<00:05:45.419> just<00:05:45.630> don't

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
even like those game cameras just don't

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.529 
even like those game cameras just don't
seem<00:05:46.020> to<00:05:46.050> last<00:05:46.289> as<00:05:46.560> long<00:05:46.710> as<00:05:46.789> this<00:05:47.789> one<00:05:48.060> does<00:05:48.270> if

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
seem to last as long as this one does if

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:49.909 
seem to last as long as this one does if
it<00:05:48.660> had<00:05:48.840> night<00:05:49.110> vision<00:05:49.140> it<00:05:49.620> would<00:05:49.710> be<00:05:49.800> an

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
it had night vision it would be an

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.800 
it had night vision it would be an
awesome<00:05:50.160> security<00:05:50.820> camera<00:05:51.120> I<00:05:51.240> hope<00:05:51.479> that<00:05:51.660> they

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
awesome security camera I hope that they

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.990 
awesome security camera I hope that they
make<00:05:52.500> one<00:05:52.740> in<00:05:52.830> the<00:05:52.919> future<00:05:53.070> that<00:05:53.400> does<00:05:53.640> because

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
make one in the future that does because

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.730 
make one in the future that does because
without<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.600> night<00:05:54.750> vision<00:05:55.020> capability<00:05:55.590> it's

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
without the night vision capability it's

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.529 
without the night vision capability it's
it's<00:05:56.430> not<00:05:56.669> going<00:05:56.820> to<00:05:56.880> be<00:05:57.000> as<00:05:57.180> useful

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
it's not going to be as useful

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.930 
it's not going to be as useful
especially<00:05:57.840> for<00:05:58.229> security<00:05:59.010> environments<00:05:59.700> but

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
especially for security environments but

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.740 
especially for security environments but
that<00:06:00.479> is<00:06:00.780> the<00:06:01.020> Brinell<00:06:01.530> mac<00:06:01.919> 200<00:06:02.760> and<00:06:03.060> this<00:06:03.510> is

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
that is the Brinell mac 200 and this is

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.580 
that is the Brinell mac 200 and this is
