00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.069 
opposed to last year when I was with two
21<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.280> suppose<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.790> terms<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.540> pre-seasons

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
21 so I suppose in terms of pre-seasons

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.770 
21 so I suppose in terms of pre-seasons
been<00:02:01.350> different

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.810 

that's<00:02:05.860> easy<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:07.010> get<00:02:07.130> yourself<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.400> roommate

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820
