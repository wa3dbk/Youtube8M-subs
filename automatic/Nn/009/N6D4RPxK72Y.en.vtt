buff that actually has a pretty big

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.589 
buff that actually has a pretty big
effect<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.700> i<00:00:11.820> honestly<00:00:11.969> think<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.420> this

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
effect and i honestly think that this

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.450 
effect and i honestly think that this
thing<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.960> now<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.170> best<00:00:13.620> aggressive<00:00:14.250> or<00:00:14.429> like

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
thing is now the best aggressive or like

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.310 
thing is now the best aggressive or like
kind<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.759> rush<00:00:15.330> ii<00:00:15.360> weapon<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> game

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
kind of rush ii weapon in the game

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.320 
kind of rush ii weapon in the game
because<00:00:16.920> its<00:00:17.070> reaction<00:00:17.580> time<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> time<00:00:18.180> it

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
because its reaction time the time it

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.000 
because its reaction time the time it
takes<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.840> go<00:00:18.990> from<00:00:19.199> sprinting<00:00:19.830> or

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
takes for you to go from sprinting or

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.890 
takes for you to go from sprinting or
from<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.460> know<00:00:20.550> kind<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.789> walking<00:00:21.060> around<00:00:21.300> to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
from you know kind of walking around to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.630 
from you know kind of walking around to
shooting<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:22.439> quicker<00:00:22.740> than<00:00:22.830> anything<00:00:23.340> else

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
shooting it's quicker than anything else

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.939 
shooting it's quicker than anything else

in the game any other SMG any shotguns
everything<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:26.880> it's

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
everything like that it's just it's

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.089 
everything like that it's just it's
absolutely<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.170> world<00:00:28.230> now<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.920> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
absolutely out of this world now so a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.460 
absolutely out of this world now so a
with<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.760> recent<00:00:30.150> patch<00:00:30.359> what<00:00:30.929> they<00:00:31.080> did<00:00:31.260> is

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
with the recent patch what they did is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.290 
with the recent patch what they did is
to<00:00:31.590> reduce<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.099> aim<00:00:32.279> down<00:00:32.520> sight<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> Vepr

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
to reduce the aim down sight on the Vepr

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.750 
to reduce the aim down sight on the Vepr
from<00:00:33.690> 250<00:00:34.380> milliseconds<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.280> 200

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
from 250 milliseconds to 200

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.490 
from 250 milliseconds to 200
milliseconds<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.420> pretty<00:00:36.870> much<00:00:37.020> made<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.380> in

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
milliseconds and pretty much made it in

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.470 
milliseconds and pretty much made it in
line<00:00:37.860> with<00:00:37.890> all<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.460> other<00:00:38.610> SMGs<00:00:39.090> every<00:00:39.390> other

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
line with all the other SMGs every other

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.750 
line with all the other SMGs every other
SMG<00:00:39.930> apart<00:00:40.290> from<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> Ripper<00:00:40.860> has<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> 200

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
SMG apart from the Ripper has a 200

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.610 
SMG apart from the Ripper has a 200
millisecond<00:00:42.210> aim-down-sight<00:00:42.809> time<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
millisecond aim-down-sight time so the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.500 
millisecond aim-down-sight time so the
question<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.070> how<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.120> much<00:00:45.300> better

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
question is how is it that much better

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.869 
question is how is it that much better
if<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:45.930> even<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.469> yes<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.770> jeez<00:00:46.920> well<00:00:47.190> where

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
if it's even with yes in jeez well where

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.000 
if it's even with yes in jeez well where
the<00:00:48.059> Vepr<00:00:48.239> really<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:48.930> shines<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.530> its

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
the Vepr really really shines is its

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.819 
the Vepr really really shines is its
sprint<00:00:50.670> out<00:00:50.850> time<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.050> sprint<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.559> time

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
sprint out time so the sprint out time

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.500 
sprint out time so the sprint out time
is<00:00:53.070> how<00:00:53.280> long<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.670> takes<00:00:53.910> for<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.360> from

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
is how long it takes for you to go from

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.959 
is how long it takes for you to go from
a<00:00:54.660> full<00:00:54.930> sprint<00:00:55.379> into<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.610> ready<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
a full sprint into you know ready to

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.160 
a full sprint into you know ready to
shoot<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.360> know<00:00:57.420> there's<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.690> little<00:00:57.840> delay

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
shoot you know there's that little delay

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.209 
shoot you know there's that little delay
time<00:00:58.410> or<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.620> kind<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> stop

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
time or you kind of have to stop

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.590 
time or you kind of have to stop
sprinting<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.699> bring<00:00:59.879> up<00:01:00.000> your<00:01:00.030> gun<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.480> then

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
sprinting you bring up your gun and then

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.369 
sprinting you bring up your gun and then
you<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.840> start<00:01:01.050> shooting

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you can start shooting

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.200 
you can start shooting
well<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.859> printout<00:01:02.280> time<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> Vepr<00:01:02.940> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
well this printout time on the Vepr is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.299 
well this printout time on the Vepr is
by<00:01:03.480> far<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.840> best<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.680> game<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.040> got<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
by far the best in the game it's got a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:05.920 
by far the best in the game it's got a
point

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
point

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.950 
point
1/2<00:01:06.930> second<00:01:07.530> sprint<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.070> time<00:01:08.369> which<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.479> just

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
1/2 second sprint out time which is just

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.719 
1/2 second sprint out time which is just
absolutely<00:01:10.140> nuts<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.100> average<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.700> all

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
absolutely nuts like the average for all

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.020 
absolutely nuts like the average for all
the<00:01:11.970> other<00:01:12.119> SMGs<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:13.250> 0.26<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.700> literally

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the other SMGs is 0.26 so it's literally

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.870 
the other SMGs is 0.26 so it's literally
twice<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.869> fast<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.890> average<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
twice as fast as the average for the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.390 
twice as fast as the average for the
other<00:01:18.030> SMGs<00:01:18.689> which<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> very<00:01:19.560> very<00:01:19.979> big<00:01:20.280> deal

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
other SMGs which is a very very big deal

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.530 
other SMGs which is a very very big deal
I<00:01:20.460> mean<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.759> about<00:01:20.939> what<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.270> when<00:01:21.420> you

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
I mean think about what you get when you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.510 
I mean think about what you get when you
get<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> first<00:01:21.960> shot<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.350> somebody<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:23.460> do

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
get the first shot on somebody what do

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.950 
get the first shot on somebody what do
you<00:01:23.610> do<00:01:23.820> well<00:01:24.060> first<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.600> you're<00:01:24.750> putting

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
you do well first of all you're putting

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.030 
you do well first of all you're putting
more<00:01:25.110> bullets<00:01:25.439> into<00:01:25.650> him<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
more bullets into him so you have a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.499 
more bullets into him so you have a
better<00:01:26.189> chance<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.610> killing<00:01:26.790> them<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.360> then

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
better chance of killing them but then

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.969 
better chance of killing them but then
on<00:01:27.600> top<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.110> you're<00:01:28.500> turning<00:01:28.829> their

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
on top of that you're turning their

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.590 
on top of that you're turning their
screen<00:01:29.340> red<00:01:29.579> which<00:01:29.790> sometimes<00:01:30.210> makes<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.540> hard

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
screen red which sometimes makes it hard

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.060 
screen red which sometimes makes it hard
for<00:01:30.840> them<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.049> see<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.439> well<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.950> you're

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
for them to see you as well as you're

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.679 
for them to see you as well as you're
making<00:01:32.159> their<00:01:32.430> gun<00:01:32.610> kick<00:01:32.880> when<00:01:33.090> they<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.420> hit

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
making their gun kick when they get hit

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.090 
making their gun kick when they get hit
their<00:01:33.930> guns<00:01:34.110> gonna<00:01:34.259> kick<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.860> air<00:01:34.979> it's

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
their guns gonna kick up in the air it's

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.679 
their guns gonna kick up in the air it's
going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> recoil<00:01:35.579> more<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.479> gonna

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
going to recoil more and that's gonna

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.060 
going to recoil more and that's gonna
make<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.990> harder<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.290> them<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.680> shots<00:01:37.890> on

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
make it harder for them to get shots on

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.319 
make it harder for them to get shots on
target<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.640> mean<00:01:38.850> there<00:01:38.939> are<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.090> these

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
target so I mean there are all these

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.760 
target so I mean there are all these
little<00:01:39.570> things<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.259> getting<00:01:40.500> first

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
little things that you getting first

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.410 
little things that you getting first
shot<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.340> helps<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.210> really

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
shot really helps you out and it really

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.330 
shot really helps you out and it really
kind<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.770> dramatically<00:01:43.770> increases<00:01:44.220> your

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
kind of dramatically increases your

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.800 
kind of dramatically increases your
chances<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.790> winning<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.180> gunfight<00:01:45.630> no

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
chances of winning that gunfight no

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.230 
chances of winning that gunfight no
matter<00:01:45.990> what<00:01:46.290> gun<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.250> let's<00:01:48.030> take<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
matter what gun you have so let's take a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.609 
matter what gun you have so let's take a
comparison<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:48.960> we're<00:01:49.079> gonna<00:01:49.170> look<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
comparison here we're gonna look at the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.560 
comparison here we're gonna look at the
vapor<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> mtar<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> mtar<00:01:51.450> is

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
vapor and then the mtar it's the mtar is

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.450 
vapor and then the mtar it's the mtar is
the<00:01:51.720> second<00:01:52.110> fastest<00:01:52.530> printout<00:01:52.829> time<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
the second fastest printout time of the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.810 
the second fastest printout time of the
SMGs<00:01:54.030> at<00:01:54.320> 0.2<00:01:55.320> seconds<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.369> we're<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.579> make

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
SMGs at 0.2 seconds and we're gonna make

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.429 
SMGs at 0.2 seconds and we're gonna make
it<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.240> they<00:01:57.360> both<00:01:57.570> start<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> kind<00:01:58.409> of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
it so that they both start the kind of

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.800 
it so that they both start the kind of
like<00:01:58.590> stop<00:01:58.979> sprinting<00:01:59.430> ats<00:02:00.390> kind<00:02:00.750> of

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
like stop sprinting ats kind of

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.719 
like stop sprinting ats kind of
animation<00:02:01.259> at<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> exact<00:02:02.100> same<00:02:02.310> time<00:02:02.579> so

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
animation at the exact same time so

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.340 
animation at the exact same time so
let's<00:02:02.880> check<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:03.240> peppers<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
let's check it out here peppers on the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.660 
let's check it out here peppers on the
left<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.710> chars<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.250> right<00:02:05.399> they're<00:02:05.549> gonna

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
left in chars on the right they're gonna

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.219 
left in chars on the right they're gonna
stop<00:02:05.939> sprinting<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.509> aim-down-sight<00:02:07.049> at<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
stop sprinting and aim-down-sight at the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.990 
stop sprinting and aim-down-sight at the
same<00:02:07.409> time<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.310> gonna<00:02:08.399> see<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.789> Vepr

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
same time and as you gonna see the Vepr

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.510 
same time and as you gonna see the Vepr
is<00:02:09.360> gonna<00:02:09.810> start<00:02:10.080> shooting<00:02:10.349> way<00:02:10.800> before<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
is gonna start shooting way before the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.760 
is gonna start shooting way before the
inte<00:02:11.700> R<00:02:11.940> does<00:02:12.180> and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
inte R does and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.220 
inte R does and
is<00:02:12.980> where<00:02:13.280> this<00:02:13.460> thing<00:02:13.730> truly<00:02:14.420> shines<00:02:14.930> now

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
is where this thing truly shines now

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.870 
is where this thing truly shines now
like<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.590> could<00:02:15.980> be<00:02:16.100> in<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:16.430> many<00:02:16.580> situations

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
like you could be in so many situations

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.490 
like you could be in so many situations
where<00:02:17.510> even<00:02:17.720> if<00:02:17.810> they<00:02:17.930> have<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.050> more<00:02:18.290> powerful

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
where even if they have a more powerful

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.040 
where even if they have a more powerful
gun<00:02:18.770> or<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.700> know<00:02:19.820> even<00:02:20.120> if<00:02:20.300> they<00:02:20.510> react<00:02:20.900> a

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
gun or you know even if they react a

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.390 
gun or you know even if they react a
little<00:02:21.170> bit<00:02:21.380> quicker<00:02:21.560> than<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:21.860> do<00:02:22.010> because

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
little bit quicker than you do because

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.520 
little bit quicker than you do because
the<00:02:22.880> pepper<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.690> much<00:02:23.960> quicker<00:02:24.230> at

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
the pepper is so much quicker at

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.320 
the pepper is so much quicker at
stopping<00:02:24.890> sprinting<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:25.640> aiming<00:02:25.940> down<00:02:26.030> sight

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
stopping sprinting and aiming down sight

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.190 
stopping sprinting and aiming down sight
and<00:02:26.480> things<00:02:26.660> like<00:02:26.780> that

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
and things like that

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.080 
and things like that
you're<00:02:27.530> gonna<00:02:27.650> take<00:02:27.920> them<00:02:28.070> out<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.430> lot<00:02:28.850> more

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
you're gonna take them out a lot more

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.370 
you're gonna take them out a lot more
easily<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:29.750> thing<00:02:29.960> is<00:02:30.080> just<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.290> know

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
easily so this thing is just you know

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.650 
easily so this thing is just you know
it's<00:02:30.860> insane<00:02:31.370> I've<00:02:31.640> been<00:02:31.790> using<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.150> lot<00:02:32.180> over

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
it's insane I've been using a lot over

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.300 
it's insane I've been using a lot over
the<00:02:32.750> past<00:02:32.930> couple<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.290> days<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.620> it's<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:34.250> a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
the past couple of days and it's just a

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.010 
the past couple of days and it's just a
ton<00:02:34.520> of<00:02:34.550> fun<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.880> use<00:02:35.060> like<00:02:35.360> I<00:02:35.390> mean<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:35.930> a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
ton of fun to use like I mean it's a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.930 
ton of fun to use like I mean it's a
class<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.500> specializes<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.550> running

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
class that specializes and running

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.000 
class that specializes and running
around<00:02:38.030> like<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.480> maniac<00:02:38.750> getting<00:02:39.680> right<00:02:39.890> in

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
around like a maniac getting right in

around like a maniac getting right in
the<00:02:40.100> enemy's<00:02:40.370> face<00:02:40.580> now<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:40.820> don't<00:02:41.060> want<00:02:41.210> to

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
the enemy's face now you don't want to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.670 
the enemy's face now you don't want to
stick<00:02:41.540> back<00:02:41.780> buying<00:02:42.050> cover<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.500> getting

of weeks ago but oh my more recent
favorite<00:03:13.580> classes<00:03:13.940> I<00:03:14.000> like<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.270> use<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.600> the

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
favorite classes I like to use is the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.780 
favorite classes I like to use is the
leopard<00:03:15.500> with<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.650> muzzle<00:03:15.980> brake<00:03:16.280> grip<00:03:16.610> and

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
leopard with the muzzle brake grip and

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.910 
leopard with the muzzle brake grip and
rapid<00:03:17.209> fire<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:17.420> usually<00:03:17.930> don't<00:03:18.140> use<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.709> third

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
rapid fire I usually don't use the third

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
rapid fire I usually don't use the third
attachment<00:03:19.220> perk<00:03:19.580> to<00:03:19.700> have<00:03:19.790> three

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
attachment perk to have three

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.090 
attachment perk to have three
attachments<00:03:20.480> but<00:03:20.900> muzzle<00:03:21.560> brake<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.800> great<00:03:22.010> on

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
attachments but muzzle brake is great on

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.770 
attachments but muzzle brake is great on
this<00:03:22.190> thing<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.490> extend<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.850> range<00:03:23.030> grip<00:03:23.630> is

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
this thing to extend the range grip is

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.240 
this thing to extend the range grip is
good<00:03:23.959> because<00:03:24.230> sometimes<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.770> can<00:03:24.800> recoil

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
good because sometimes it can recoil

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.010 
good because sometimes it can recoil
quite<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.459> bit<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:25.760> then<00:03:26.120> also<00:03:26.150> rapid<00:03:26.750> fire<00:03:26.900> is

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
quite a bit and then also rapid fire is

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.240 
quite a bit and then also rapid fire is
great<00:03:27.200> because<00:03:27.380> you're<00:03:27.530> putting<00:03:27.650> more<00:03:27.950> shots

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
great because you're putting more shots

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.410 
great because you're putting more shots
downrange<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:28.970> be<00:03:29.060> killing<00:03:29.270> more<00:03:29.390> people

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
downrange and to be killing more people

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.630 
downrange and to be killing more people
and<00:03:30.230> then<00:03:30.350> as<00:03:30.500> for<00:03:30.709> perks<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:31.160> course<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.550> know

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
and then as for perks of course you know

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.070 
and then as for perks of course you know
you<00:03:31.700> need<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.120> extra<00:03:32.420> attachment<00:03:32.870> curtain

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
you need the extra attachment curtain

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.390
