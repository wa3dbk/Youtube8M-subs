ten the only major faults with this game
is<00:06:15.979> they<00:06:16.099> can<00:06:16.250> get

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
is they can get

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.999 
is they can get
repetitive<00:06:17.889> very<00:06:18.889> very<00:06:19.639> quickly<00:06:20.979> the<00:06:21.979> game

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009 
repetitive very very quickly the game

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.920 
repetitive very very quickly the game
would<00:06:22.279> be<00:06:22.309> really<00:06:22.849> nice<00:06:23.059> but<00:06:23.449> the

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
would be really nice but the

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.839 
would be really nice but the
single-player<00:06:24.379> is<00:06:24.620> basically<00:06:25.129> the<00:06:25.370> exact

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
single-player is basically the exact

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.909 
single-player is basically the exact
same<00:06:26.089> game<00:06:26.479> with<00:06:26.749> slightly<00:06:27.319> advanced

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 
same game with slightly advanced

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.040 
same game with slightly advanced
strategies<00:06:28.520> as<00:06:28.759> you<00:06:28.909> go<00:06:29.089> on<00:06:29.270> and<00:06:29.479> face<00:06:29.599> tougher

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050

enemies<00:06:30.169> and<00:06:30.740> the<00:06:31.699> multiplayer<00:06:32.240> is<00:06:32.419> pretty

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
enemies and the multiplayer is pretty

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.170 
enemies and the multiplayer is pretty
much<00:06:33.169> similar<00:06:33.589> to<00:06:33.830> the<00:06:34.099> single-player<00:06:34.550> unless

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
much similar to the single-player unless

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.879 
much similar to the single-player unless
you're<00:06:35.360> playing<00:06:35.509> advanced<00:06:36.110> in<00:06:36.259> which<00:06:36.650> case

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
you're playing advanced in which case

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.360 
you're playing advanced in which case
it's<00:06:37.069> a<00:06:37.129> lot<00:06:37.249> more<00:06:37.400> fun<00:06:38.379> the<00:06:39.379> bots<00:06:39.620> have<00:06:39.889> a<00:06:39.919> fine

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
it's a lot more fun the bots have a fine

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.999 
it's a lot more fun the bots have a fine
level<00:06:40.759> of<00:06:41.029> AI<00:06:41.270> they're<00:06:41.900> not<00:06:42.110> overpowering

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
level of AI they're not overpowering

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.219 
level of AI they're not overpowering
unless<00:06:43.729> you<00:06:43.939> set<00:06:44.210> them<00:06:44.330> to<00:06:44.509> me<00:06:44.599> but<00:06:45.080> it's

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
unless you set them to me but it's

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.140 
unless you set them to me but it's
really<00:06:45.469> more<00:06:45.740> fun<00:06:46.069> to<00:06:46.219> have<00:06:46.339> multiple<00:06:46.849> real

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
really more fun to have multiple real

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.809 
really more fun to have multiple real
players<00:06:47.599> of<00:06:47.900> multiplayer<00:06:48.430> thus<00:06:49.430> in

conclusion if you already own this game

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:55.119 
conclusion if you already own this game
get<00:06:52.909> it<00:06:53.029> out<00:06:53.180> try<00:06:53.719> it<00:06:53.749> you<00:06:54.259> might<00:06:54.319> like<00:06:54.469> it<00:06:54.680> if

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:55.129 
get it out try it you might like it if

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:57.070 
get it out try it you might like it if
you<00:06:55.610> don't<00:06:55.819> own<00:06:56.059> this<00:06:56.240> game<00:06:56.479> I<00:06:56.659> wouldn't

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
you don't own this game I wouldn't

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.420 
you don't own this game I wouldn't
really<00:06:57.199> suggest<00:06:57.469> going<00:06:58.039> out<00:06:58.279> and

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
really suggest going out and

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.610 
really suggest going out and
specifically<00:06:59.029> purchasing<00:06:59.629> it<00:06:59.779> it<00:07:00.319> probably

specifically purchasing it it probably

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.499 
specifically purchasing it it probably
won't<00:07:00.800> be<00:07:00.860> that<00:07:00.949> expensive<00:07:01.639> but<00:07:01.849> there's

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:02.509 
won't be that expensive but there's

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:04.389 
won't be that expensive but there's
probably<00:07:03.050> better<00:07:03.409> releases<00:07:03.860> of<00:07:03.979> ballmount

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:04.399 
probably better releases of ballmount

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:07.179 
probably better releases of ballmount
