looking<00:03:15.440> for<00:03:15.920> most<00:03:16.280> often<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:17.510> it's<00:03:18.200> not

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
looking for most often so it's not

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.140 
looking for most often so it's not
necessarily<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.400> things<00:03:19.670> I'll<00:03:19.850> be<00:03:19.880> using

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
necessarily the things I'll be using

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.470 
necessarily the things I'll be using
every<00:03:20.510> day<00:03:20.780> but<00:03:21.200> it's<00:03:21.500> things<00:03:21.830> that<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.490> do

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
every day but it's things that I do

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.740 
every day but it's things that I do
often<00:03:23.750> use<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.940> sometimes<00:03:25.940> can't<00:03:26.390> find

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
often use and sometimes can't find

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.250 
often use and sometimes can't find

somebody commented it asked me if those

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.450 
somebody commented it asked me if those
tools<00:03:53.750> are<00:03:53.990> actually<00:03:54.200> ones<00:03:54.740> to<00:03:54.920> use<00:03:55.100> most

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
tools are actually ones to use most

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.600 
tools are actually ones to use most
because<00:03:56.390> look<00:03:56.900> how<00:03:57.020> trusty<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.710> size<00:03:57.980> that

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
because look how trusty the size that

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.030 
because look how trusty the size that
you're<00:03:58.760> going<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:58.970> put<00:03:59.150> up<00:03:59.270> there<00:04:00.040> actually

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
you're going to put up there actually

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.370 
you're going to put up there actually
these<00:04:01.340> three<00:04:01.730> saws<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.480> you<00:04:02.600> see<00:04:02.810> here<00:04:03.080> our

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
these three saws that you see here our

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.860 
these three saws that you see here our
future<00:04:03.980> projects<00:04:04.520> I'm<00:04:04.760> going<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:05.030> kind<00:04:05.720> of

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
future projects I'm going to kind of

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.860 
future projects I'm going to kind of
rebuild<00:04:06.680> them<00:04:07.280> you<00:04:07.730> know<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.090> handles<00:04:08.570> on

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.290 
rebuild them you know the handles on
both<00:04:09.290> of<00:04:09.560> these<00:04:09.680> are<00:04:09.980> broken<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:11.030> I'll<00:04:11.090> be

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
both of these are broken so I'll be

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.360 
both of these are broken so I'll be
redoing<00:04:11.630> those<00:04:11.900> polishing<00:04:12.860> up<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.130> blade

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
redoing those polishing up the blade

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.880

sharpening<00:04:14.210> and<00:04:14.510> all<00:04:14.600> that<00:04:14.840> stuff<00:04:15.170> I<00:04:15.410> don't

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
sharpening and all that stuff I don't

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.890 
sharpening and all that stuff I don't
know<00:04:16.010> if<00:04:16.100> I'll<00:04:16.220> make<00:04:16.250> videos<00:04:16.460> of<00:04:17.090> them<00:04:17.299> but<00:04:17.870> I

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
know if I'll make videos of them but I

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.680 
know if I'll make videos of them but I
will<00:04:18.170> definitely<00:04:18.799> do<00:04:19.070> website<00:04:19.850> articles<00:04:20.359> for

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
will definitely do website articles for

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.870 
will definitely do website articles for
them<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.290> in<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.620> comments<00:04:22.100> how<00:04:22.250> do<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.610> think

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
let me know if you think it's not going

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.100 
let me know if you think it's not going
to<00:04:25.040> be<00:04:25.190> able<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.400> stick<00:04:25.700> to<00:04:25.850> this<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.270> really<00:04:26.930> do

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
to be able to stick to this I really do

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.450 
to be able to stick to this I really do
believe<00:04:27.350> that<00:04:27.410> I<00:04:27.590> will<00:04:27.860> buy<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:28.610> never<00:04:28.940> know

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
believe that I will buy you never know

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.790 
believe that I will buy you never know
one<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.900> advantages<00:04:32.900> to<00:04:32.960> this<00:04:33.320> kind<00:04:33.650> of

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
one of the advantages to this kind of

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.480 
one of the advantages to this kind of
thing<00:04:34.070> is<00:04:34.370> that<00:04:34.640> every<00:04:35.420> tool<00:04:35.900> has<00:04:36.350> a<00:04:36.490> specific

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
thing is that every tool has a specific

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.140 
thing is that every tool has a specific
place<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:37.790> it<00:04:38.210> goes<00:04:38.420> here<00:04:38.930> on<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.170> board<00:04:39.410> and

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
place that it goes here on the board and

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.060 
place that it goes here on the board and
you'll<00:04:41.150> immediately<00:04:41.570> see<00:04:42.170> if<00:04:42.590> something's

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
you'll immediately see if something's

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.959 
you'll immediately see if something's
missing

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:43.969 
missing

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:45.549 
missing
I'm<00:04:44.059> going<00:04:44.239> to<00:04:44.299> put<00:04:44.389> it<00:04:44.479> back<00:04:44.689> so<00:04:45.259> you<00:04:45.349> take

00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:45.559 
I'm going to put it back so you take

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:48.459 
I'm going to put it back so you take
something<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:46.069> use<00:04:46.459> it<00:04:46.699> and<00:04:46.939> you<00:04:47.839> put<00:04:48.169> it<00:04:48.259> back

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:48.469 
something you use it and you put it back

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:51.639 
something you use it and you put it back
now<00:04:49.599> like<00:04:50.599> I<00:04:50.749> said<00:04:50.809> I<00:04:51.019> don't<00:04:51.169> know<00:04:51.319> if<00:04:51.349> I'll<00:04:51.529> be

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:51.649 
now like I said I don't know if I'll be

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:53.319 
now like I said I don't know if I'll be
able<00:04:51.739> to<00:04:51.889> stick<00:04:52.099> with<00:04:52.309> it<00:04:52.489> but<00:04:52.729> I'm<00:04:52.849> going<00:04:53.089> to

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:53.329 
able to stick with it but I'm going to

00:04:53.329 --> 00:04:56.649 
able to stick with it but I'm going to
try<00:04:53.949> well<00:04:54.949> that's<00:04:55.279> it<00:04:55.519> for<00:04:55.669> this<00:04:55.819> one<00:04:56.059> I<00:04:56.360> hope
