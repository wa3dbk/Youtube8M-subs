and I needed to set up a quick shelter

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.200 
and I needed to set up a quick shelter
this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.100> would<00:00:38.280> most<00:00:38.610> likely<00:00:38.850> go

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
this is the one I would most likely go

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.229 
this is the one I would most likely go
with<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:40.129> little<00:00:41.129> bit<00:00:41.250> depending<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.879> weather

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
with a little bit depending on weather

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.229 
with a little bit depending on weather
conditions<00:00:43.370> but<00:00:44.370> Ruiz<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.930> said<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> same

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
conditions but Ruiz like I said the same

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:55.970 
conditions but Ruiz like I said the same
stuff<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:50.960> we<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.199> used<00:00:52.530> 10<00:00:53.100> feet<00:00:54.980> of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
stuff that we just used 10 feet of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.029 
stuff that we just used 10 feet of
bright<00:00:56.370> orange<00:00:56.879> paracord<00:00:57.590> we<00:00:58.590> reuse<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> same

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
bright orange paracord we reuse the same

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.650 
bright orange paracord we reuse the same
tree<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:01.070> just<00:01:02.070> took<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.640> down<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.270> decided

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
tree I just took it down and I decided

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:16.110 
tree I just took it down and I decided
to<00:01:03.809> go<00:01:03.930> ahead<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.290> show<00:01:05.360> one<00:01:06.360> more

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.440 

what<00:01:16.750> we're<00:01:16.900> going<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.110> do<00:01:17.260> differently<00:01:17.940> is

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.470 

instead<00:01:22.450> of<00:01:22.630> pull<00:01:22.930> this<00:01:23.200> out<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:25.360> a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
instead of pull this out to just a

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:34.730 
instead of pull this out to just a
lean-to<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:26.050> type<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:28.180> going<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.420> take<00:01:28.630> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.930 

so<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.800> pull<00:01:36.070> it<00:01:36.160> out<00:01:36.250> like<00:01:36.490> we<00:01:36.640> did<00:01:36.670> in<00:01:36.910> the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
it underneath that barrier that I have

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.520 
it underneath that barrier that I have
to<00:04:35.440> lay<00:04:35.620> on<00:04:36.389> if<00:04:37.389> I<00:04:37.510> had<00:04:37.660> dry<00:04:37.900> leaves<00:04:38.139> i<00:04:38.380> could

to lay on if I had dry leaves i could

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.439 
to lay on if I had dry leaves i could
use<00:04:38.680> dry<00:04:38.889> leaves<00:04:39.070> if<00:04:39.460> it's<00:04:39.639> not<00:04:39.820> cold<00:04:40.090> too<00:04:40.270> wet

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
use dry leaves if it's not cold too wet

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.000 
use dry leaves if it's not cold too wet
out<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:40.900> don't<00:04:41.229> really<00:04:41.380> have<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.710> worry<00:04:41.740> about

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
out I don't really have to worry about

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.440 
out I don't really have to worry about
it<00:04:42.370> just<00:04:42.400> gives<00:04:42.669> me<00:04:42.760> a<00:04:43.500> barrier<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.560> lay<00:04:44.889> on<00:04:45.070> it

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
it just gives me a barrier to lay on it

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.480 
it just gives me a barrier to lay on it
and<00:04:46.450> again<00:04:47.110> this<00:04:47.290> is<00:04:47.470> a<00:04:48.810> six-by-eight<00:04:49.810> tarp

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490
