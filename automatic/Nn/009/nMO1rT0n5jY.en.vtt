00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello today i will show you how 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:11.759
 install free cms version 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:16.230
 shock and show you how to set it up already 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:21.140
 installed engine we go further by 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.140
 paths and shop in clouds 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:31.560
 and edit the settings file config.php 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:34.680
 since there are comments highlighted here 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.830
 in green I don't think it will 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.780
 difficult to build 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.440
 Currently we are interested in connecting 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.970
 database 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.870
 it is at the bottom of this file 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.840
 here everything is commented out everything is clear 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.750
 I think 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.720
 everyone will be able to set up saving this 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:02.630
 file and fill the entire contents of the folder 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:06.020
 all contents of the folder to your site 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.470
 through any convenient client or through 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.060
 archive 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.900
 and after you have filled you see 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.780
 Here is such as this is free 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.510
 version it does not work as a separate cms 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.830
 there is no registration form there is no form 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:29.060
 setting a password and it works 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.030
 just like a script online job shop 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.590
 of 1 store you can see by 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:41.380
 link shop but the truth I have now 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:44.030
 everything is set up as knocks error 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.600
 connection-based data we need 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:53.390
 import files into folder from the countryside 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:56.450
 install import 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.420
 all the files in a row and after you 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.350
 did the import you should appear 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:08.030
 these are the tables you can check 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:11.240
 for the correctness of your actions and what 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:16.270
 they will pop up no spike after 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.270
 this you reload the page and 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:30.580
 we can see such pieces 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:34.210
 8 click registration we see that 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.860
 registration is not through our site 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.340
 not through our website 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.410
 and through some third-party resource link 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.410
 you can change the config.php file 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.310
 but 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.450
 but here it is enough to search here in general 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.520
 There are quite a few useful things. 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.200
 of things 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.660
 if you want to work 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.180
 This script as a separate cms can be 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.540
 buy commercial version for 30 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:14.950
 dollars and then you will have something 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.950
 like hands 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:31.010
 the working version of this cms full cms you 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:34.099
 can see on the site hands it is worth it 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.860
 30 dollars I have already said and buy you 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:40.670
 can its official developer on 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:44.290
 whale fish though you can supply 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.500
 free creak as an online shope 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:52.420
 or additional fashion 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:58.239
 another minus to this script is 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.239
 that you cannot automatically replenish your account 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.960
 you can even read the need 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.790
 contact the administrator and after 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:12.900
 how the player wants to replenish his account 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:16.930
 you will need to change the column 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.810
 the mana value of a mana column for some 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.120
 certain player 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.360
 I think this is the main disadvantage and therefore 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.660
 I do not advise you to install this 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.120
 script cms 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:35.620
 it will be easier to install anti shock 2 or 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:40.500
 or buy for $ 30 full 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.500
 version on this i 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.379
 I finish the tutorial
