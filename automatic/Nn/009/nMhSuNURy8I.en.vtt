awesome<00:01:49.180> looking<00:01:49.810> band<00:01:50.229> now<00:01:50.740> my<00:01:50.890> only<00:01:51.070> gripe

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
awesome looking band now my only gripe

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.800 
awesome looking band now my only gripe
with<00:01:51.430> this<00:01:51.610> band<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.119> there's<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.509> lot<00:01:52.689> of

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
with this band is that there's a lot of

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.420 
with this band is that there's a lot of
white<00:01:53.049> that<00:01:53.320> shows<00:01:53.560> through<00:01:53.829> and<00:01:54.040> doesn't

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
white that shows through and doesn't

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.459 
white that shows through and doesn't
create<00:01:54.729> a<00:01:54.850> super<00:01:55.149> uniform<00:01:55.659> or<00:01:55.869> clean<00:01:56.170> look

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
create a super uniform or clean look

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.440 
create a super uniform or clean look
with<00:01:56.680> my<00:01:56.829> band<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.610> know<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:57.729> have<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:57.939> black<00:01:58.240> and

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
with my band you know I have a black and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.730 
with my band you know I have a black and
blue<00:01:58.570> theme<00:01:58.780> going<00:01:58.990> on<00:01:59.200> but<00:01:59.469> then<00:01:59.560> there's

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
blue theme going on but then there's

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.529 
blue theme going on but then there's
white<00:02:00.009> sticking<00:02:00.430> out<00:02:00.549> everywhere<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:01.420> I<00:02:01.509> just

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
white sticking out everywhere and I just

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.330 
white sticking out everywhere and I just
really<00:02:01.960> don't<00:02:02.110> like<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.439> I<00:02:02.770> wish<00:02:02.979> they<00:02:03.159> could

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
really don't like that I wish they could

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.520 
really don't like that I wish they could
have<00:02:03.430> made<00:02:03.549> it<00:02:03.700> black<00:02:03.909> or<00:02:04.299> maybe<00:02:04.840> allow<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.289> to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
have made it black or maybe allow you to

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.200 
have made it black or maybe allow you to
choose<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.130> color<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.670> sides<00:02:06.939> or

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
choose the color of the sides or

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.970 
choose the color of the sides or
something<00:02:07.479> like<00:02:07.570> that<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:08.050> just<00:02:08.620> don't<00:02:08.800> like

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
something like that I just don't like

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.350 
something like that I just don't like
how<00:02:09.190> much<00:02:09.310> white<00:02:09.640> is<00:02:09.820> showing<00:02:10.150> through

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
how much white is showing through

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.730 
how much white is showing through
because<00:02:10.600> it<00:02:10.720> really<00:02:10.930> just<00:02:11.080> doesn't<00:02:11.470> create<00:02:11.680> a

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
because it really just doesn't create a

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.840 
because it really just doesn't create a
uniform<00:02:12.310> look<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:12.880> my<00:02:13.060> opinion

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
uniform look and in my opinion

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.420 
uniform look and in my opinion
that<00:02:14.000> kind<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.810> bothers<00:02:15.020> me<00:02:15.380> but<00:02:15.920> at<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.400> end

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
that kind of bothers me but at the end

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.820 
that kind of bothers me but at the end
of<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.670> day<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:17.150> can<00:02:18.080> live<00:02:18.230> with<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.680> I

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
of the day I can live with it so I

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.350 
of the day I can live with it so I
really<00:02:19.070> like<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.430> band<00:02:19.670> it's<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:20.000> great<00:02:20.210> way

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
really like this band it's a great way

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.700 
really like this band it's a great way
to<00:02:20.390> customize<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.960> and<00:02:21.350> give<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.500> your<00:02:21.620> own

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
to customize it and give it your own

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.530 
to customize it and give it your own
option<00:02:22.280> something<00:02:22.490> unique<00:02:22.910> something<00:02:23.270> that

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
option something unique something that

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.600 
option something unique something that
is<00:02:23.930> very<00:02:24.170> similar<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.710> Apple<00:02:25.040> watch<00:02:25.190> sport

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
is very similar to the Apple watch sport

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.250 
is very similar to the Apple watch sport
band<00:02:25.820> but<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.150> course<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.660> can<00:02:26.810> make<00:02:26.960> it<00:02:27.110> look

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260
