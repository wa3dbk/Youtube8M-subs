00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
what I expected but I did realize that I

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.370 
what I expected but I did realize that I
was<00:03:26.650> doing<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.040> braids<00:03:27.280> longer<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.260> some<00:03:29.260> of

was doing the braids longer and some of

was doing the braids longer and some of
them<00:03:29.560> are<00:03:31.079> thinner<00:03:32.079> than<00:03:32.470> others<00:03:32.890> at<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.610> back

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
them are thinner than others at the back

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.729 
them are thinner than others at the back
of<00:03:33.819> course<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.660> was<00:03:34.900> able<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.110> get<00:03:35.230> away<00:03:35.380> with

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
of course I was able to get away with

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.620 
of course I was able to get away with
doing<00:03:35.920> them<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.160> little<00:03:36.640> bigger<00:03:36.790> than<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.180> top

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
doing them a little bigger than the top

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.430 
doing them a little bigger than the top
but<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:40.540> this<00:03:40.690> is<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:41.140> again<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:42.010> used<00:03:43.200> at<00:03:44.200> first

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
but so this is it again I used at first

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.289 
but so this is it again I used at first
I<00:03:44.590> said<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:44.980> was<00:03:45.160> going<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.519> have<00:03:46.030> three

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
I said that I was going to have three

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.089 
I said that I was going to have three
different<00:03:46.420> colors<00:03:46.930> but<00:03:47.230> I<00:03:47.260> ended<00:03:47.680> up<00:03:47.890> using

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
different colors but I ended up using

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.500 
different colors but I ended up using
just<00:03:48.400> two<00:03:48.519> different<00:03:48.610> colors<00:03:49.000> because<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.329> just

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
just two different colors because I just

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.140 
just two different colors because I just
didn't<00:03:49.780> like<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:49.959> way<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:51.459> lighter<00:03:51.700> color

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
didn't like the way the lighter color

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.979 
didn't like the way the lighter color
looks<00:03:53.760> against<00:03:54.760> my<00:03:54.940> black<00:03:55.180> hair<00:03:55.450> which<00:03:55.690> is<00:03:55.720> too

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
looks against my black hair which is too

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.720 
looks against my black hair which is too
big<00:03:56.139> of<00:03:56.319> a<00:03:56.410> contrast<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.100> I<00:03:57.130> just<00:03:57.340> didn't<00:03:57.579> like

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
big of a contrast and I just didn't like

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.789 
big of a contrast and I just didn't like

on and at the bottom it was just a

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.300 
on and at the bottom it was just a
regular<00:04:33.599> mix<00:04:34.650> 1:30<00:04:37.560> mixed<00:04:38.560> with<00:04:38.710> one<00:04:38.889> beat<00:04:39.099> but

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310

totally took the other hair back big

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.990 
totally took the other hair back big
hair<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.270> was<00:04:52.450> on<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:53.800> lighter<00:04:54.070> color<00:04:54.460> it

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
hair that was on the lighter color it

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.339 
hair that was on the lighter color it
was<00:04:55.120> just<00:04:55.270> no<00:04:55.419> way<00:04:55.450> that<00:04:55.630> was<00:04:55.960> going<00:04:56.139> to<00:04:56.200> work

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
was just no way that was going to work

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.080 
was just no way that was going to work
because<00:04:56.830> I<00:04:57.070> just<00:04:57.280> hated<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.789> way<00:04:57.880> that

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
because I just hated the way that

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.330 
because I just hated the way that
contrast<00:04:58.599> looking<00:04:59.409> against<00:04:59.620> my<00:04:59.770> black<00:05:00.010> hair

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
contrast looking against my black hair

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.620 
contrast looking against my black hair
but

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.690 

this<00:05:04.630> is<00:05:04.840> what<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.230> looks<00:05:05.530> like

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
this is what it looks like

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:14.880 
this is what it looks like
I<00:05:09.210> actually<00:05:11.250> also<00:05:12.540> curl<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:13.750> ends<00:05:14.410> with<00:05:14.650> hot

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
I actually also curl the ends with hot

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.450 
I actually also curl the ends with hot
water<00:05:15.160> I<00:05:15.960> feel<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.080> used<00:05:17.350> 5<00:05:17.650> sponge<00:05:18.070> rollers

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
water I feel I used 5 sponge rollers

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.700 
water I feel I used 5 sponge rollers
actually<00:05:18.970> and<00:05:19.270> at<00:05:19.780> first<00:05:19.930> it<00:05:20.110> was<00:05:20.230> a<00:05:20.260> whole<00:05:20.530> lot

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
actually and at first it was a whole lot

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.500 
actually and at first it was a whole lot
earlier<00:05:20.740> than<00:05:21.430> this<00:05:21.730> but<00:05:21.970> I<00:05:22.030> like<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.390> way

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
earlier than this but I like the way

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.270 
earlier than this but I like the way
this<00:05:22.690> looks<00:05:23.050> now<00:05:23.260> is<00:05:23.530> it<00:05:23.800> looks<00:05:24.010> a<00:05:24.100> whole<00:05:24.250> lot

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
this looks now is it looks a whole lot

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.430 
this looks now is it looks a whole lot
more<00:05:24.550> relaxed<00:05:25.240> which<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:28.600> ends<00:05:29.050> I<00:05:29.200> don't

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
more relaxed which the ends I don't

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.570 
more relaxed which the ends I don't
understand<00:05:29.830> like<00:05:30.010> they're<00:05:30.190> really<00:05:30.430> really

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
understand like they're really really

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.220 
understand like they're really really
curly<00:05:31.090> look<00:05:31.810> I<00:05:31.960> just<00:05:31.990> want<00:05:32.350> it<00:05:32.410> to<00:05:32.470> look<00:05:32.800> a

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
thing as long as I can just because it

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.440 
thing as long as I can just because it
just<00:06:25.120> took<00:06:25.330> forever<00:06:25.660> but<00:06:27.270> hopefully<00:06:28.270> I<00:06:28.330> can

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
just took forever but hopefully I can

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
just took forever but hopefully I can
keep<00:06:28.780> it<00:06:28.870> in<00:06:28.990> for<00:06:29.110> about<00:06:29.320> 4<00:06:29.590> months<00:06:31.290> again<00:06:32.290> it's

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
keep it in for about 4 months again it's

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.170 
keep it in for about 4 months again it's
not<00:06:32.620> really<00:06:32.680> tight<00:06:33.190> so<00:06:33.520> that's<00:06:33.729> why<00:06:33.880> I<00:06:33.940> had<00:06:34.150> it

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
not really tight so that's why I had it

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.510 
not really tight so that's why I had it
up<00:06:34.450> I<00:06:34.720> just<00:06:34.960> really<00:06:35.620> can't<00:06:35.770> braid<00:06:36.070> that<00:06:36.310> tight

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
up I just really can't braid that tight

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.659 
up I just really can't braid that tight
and<00:06:36.850> tell<00:06:37.000> you<00:06:37.120> the<00:06:37.210> truth<00:06:37.919> as<00:06:38.919> far<00:06:38.979> as<00:06:39.310> I<00:06:39.400> tries

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
and tell you the truth as far as I tries

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:42.060 
and tell you the truth as far as I tries
it's<00:06:40.300> not<00:06:40.540> really<00:06:41.020> tight<00:06:41.260> but<00:06:41.560> anyway<00:06:41.860> that's

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
it's not really tight but anyway that's

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.469 
it's not really tight but anyway that's
a<00:06:42.160> good<00:06:42.280> thing<00:06:42.490> just<00:06:42.520> because<00:06:42.970> I<00:06:43.060> still<00:06:43.270> have
