00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello very good to all as they are 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.370
 been to his friend jota ss and in this 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.129
 new video I bring you what comes 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.240
 being some tips to start 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:14.160
 well in the last time or a few tips 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.250
 to take them into account from 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.230
 her so that they are better every time in 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.820
 its last and good this let's start 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.280
 do not want to be so long because I have 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.830
 several things I have I have several things 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.989
 thought to tell you then now 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:37.410
 let's start the first thing would be this 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.570
 sorry do not underestimate the rival usually 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.489
 we see on the screen before the game 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.560
 the rival team with a value less than 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:49.360
 our and we think 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.340
 This is me, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going to 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.760
 win 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.930
 and the time comes that 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.460
 we shit it and so the monkey charge does not 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.259
 we play nothing well although our team 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:09.250
 be the best already in that match and 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.409
 then we complain we complain and the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.200
 we complain a lot that with back I can 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:18.159
 win this team we are angry like this 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.630
 that any of those things and that then 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.330
 also tell them then in the future 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.290
 there is a 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.010
 a tiny probability that there is 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.980
 the handicap and then you can not 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.530
 underestimate and if you have to get 10 goals 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.380
 they are put in order not to lose confidence 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.020
 and good if you are also winning the 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.300
 Second advice would be if you are winning not 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.690
 you already stupid because if this one 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.030
 there are not many times that already has 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.090
 happened to me also that happens to the second 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.370
 60 minute time winning 3 to 0 and I start 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.480
 to advance silly moves and make goals 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:03.870
 pretty so to speak until in a 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.600
 of gray hair because they attack you and you go 3 to 1 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.250
 then another entry to the bar area 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.940
 criminal and you go a 3 to 2 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.540
 one minute 80 for example they pay you and 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.310
 good this one closed a scream so that 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.730
 you go to eat more egg 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.610
 they put the third and three to three 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.410
 90 minutes 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.270
 and well, that's another thing, this is not going 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.170
 to be up to it because many times 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.030
 it happens to us that we do them and therefore not 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.330
 we have to continue playing as we are 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.120
 doing as we are returning 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.950
 and good another would be the morality the moral is 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.250
 very important because you have to buy it 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.770
 and apply it short in mind the cards 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.480
 of morale team talks plus 30 and 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.330
 keep playing is with love over 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.900
 of 80 I think this is essential since 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.049
 It has been key to get out of 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.909
 of bad spells this would be the way 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.790
 also the same as morality there is 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:07.069
 be applying them constantly have 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.110
 always some that live in the bank 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.160
 so that substitutions in the middle 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.980
 match for those who are more tired 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.260
 the way we see it play in Spain 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.170
 Most players play in 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.870
 calm football and touch England the 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.910
 fut users go to sack and without thinking 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.400
 much in strategy but take advantage 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.590
 the game boxes then this is why 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.140
 than to play the most 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.380
 productive uncomfortable for tribal the 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.720
 passive when you say it when you touch 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.520
 you have to take advantage of the errors this 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.980
 it is offered to you 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.630
 and also well this much and do not use 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.250
 the wrong ones because we were running and 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.470
 the player is running 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.330
 then press a little bit and you can see that 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.510
 it reaches loose it is used by the other 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:58.129
 player with the l1 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:01.560
 and well so what k jumped over does not throw the 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.660
 towel never throws in the towel then why 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.760
 and I have come out of a comeback of three 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.950
 goals or if you put yourself you can do what 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.120
 you can improve a lot because 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.780
 who has not happened to make a 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.230
 historical comeback the incredible truth 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.230
 to me 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.580
 Yes happened to me the truth thrashed 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.560
 when the time is running out and already 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.840
 is here in the match 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.669
 do not overwhelm yourself that is if you go 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.580
 losing not going crazy you have to go 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.530
 with calm looking for spaces the 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.250
 goal is a matter of time or is it 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.540
 to arrive then it has calmed down if yes 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.720
 you are going to do all this 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:49.500
 and good another one would be 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.000
 what we do not do but not want 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.830
 make our favorite game is a 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.870
 hero for example me sometimes that I 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.210
 sent with sincere because good the one of 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.640
 Mexico I respect that I say let's get 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.230
 conditions not to play high that 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.670
 with other players because there are many 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.260
 that even with ronaldo Christian what 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.920
 they have and want misses from the band in 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.510
 diagonal or score goal and well that's not what 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.009
 correct because in one of those you the 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.830
 remove and 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:17.330
 and well they take you by surprise and then the 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.919
 volcano the bowl and you get angry for that 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.139
 for what you did, no passes to 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.409
 someone else that's why he has 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.989
 passed many times 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:29.659
 and good also does it delay to the ground 

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:31.580
 to the fools that are going to you since 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:34.399
 they won the bullfight and you are swept yes 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.589
 in one of those you can get red and 

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:42.150
 you're wrong the truth can not do 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:44.639
 so many of salva arribas a la idito 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.770
 finished the play 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.259
 if so, it has many probabilities 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.289
 to leave the match with the goal 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:54.449
 unbeaten in the truth and if you have and if 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.249
 take advantage of this I do not know some of the 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.979
 yours 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:00.149
 the table the second defense never leave 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.269
 held down 

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:05.489
 neither the x to defend and propose them 

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:07.880
 press at a distance of two steps 

00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:10.460
 of the defending player 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.230
 almost always works great for 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.569
 those who like to face the 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.550
 defenses 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.770
 important tips also about 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.169
 send a run to the partner with the area 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.490
 1 good is not to use much the pass with the 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:27.000
 r1 since if you do it in defense 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.560
 the defense of thinking that the between your 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.820
 sail is here if you lose it to the rival 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.610
 you have a much easier counter-attack 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.080
 it's no no you have to do that because you 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.260
 can take you off guard and that there's the 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.260
 goal 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.290
 what conclusion do we have good then everything 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.360
 the above is improvable but this is 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.169
 to use them with some experience already 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.389
