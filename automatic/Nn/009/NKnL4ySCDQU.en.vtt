00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:36.390
 hi hello wanted to record a message for 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.570
 you to help you settle into your 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.370
 first night I actually worked 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.470
 in that office before you I am 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.410
 ending my last week now as 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.690
 you can see so yes it can be a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.400
 little overwhelming but I'm here to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.190
 tell you that there is nothing of what 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.320
 worry will continue well so let's 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.680
 focus on getting your spend your 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.199
 first week ok let's see first 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.629
 there is an introductory greeting from the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.540
 company that I 'm supposed to read a 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.220
 kind of legal thing you know 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.200
 Welcome to artist facebook a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.480
 magical place for children and adults 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.180
 equally where fantasy and 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.920
 fun come to life is not overcome 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.140
 this money is not responsible for 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.880
 damage to property two people at 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.680
 discover the damage or death of the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.630
 employee a person report 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.729
 disappeared will be presented within 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.370
 90 days before the property and 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.280
 facilities have been cleaned what has 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.010
 BLA bla 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.680
 this may sound bad I know but there's no 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.690
 to worry about the characters 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.000
 animatronics here can be a bit 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.090
 brief talk during the night but the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.280
 I blame them not if I was forced to 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.619
 sing the same stupid songs 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.659
 for 20 years and I never had a bath 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.360
 they would probably also be popular 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.159
 so remember these characters have 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.930
 a special place in the hearts of 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.270
 children and we have to show them a 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.040
 little respect really ok 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.130
 so keep in mind the people who 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.110
 they have to digress a little they leave 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.209
 a kind of free mode at night 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.860
 it's something about your trees being 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.560
 block if you connect during 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.360
 too much time they used to spend 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.660
 during the day also but then 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.760
 it happened the bite of 87 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.410
 it's amazing how the human body can 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.180
 live without the frontal lobe you know 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.850
 now with regard to your safety the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.550
 only real risk like surveillance here 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.680
 If there is, it is the fact that 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.840
 these people who see you 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.180
 after hours maybe not you 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.920
 will recognize as a person or 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.380
 just see you as a skeleton of 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.350
 metal without his suit and since it goes against 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.810
 of the rules to update to pixar 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.460
 they're probably going to try to put in 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.190
 the strength inside a suit 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.740
 satisfy 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.020
 it would not be so bad if the frets 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.810
 they were full of cable beams and 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.819
 especially animatronic devices 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.370
 in the facial area 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.620
 so you could imagine having the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.389
 head pressed hard into 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.999
 one could cause a little discomfort 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:15.129
 and death the only parts of you that 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:17.049
 would see the light again would be your eyes and 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.659
 your teeth when they were fired 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.670
 from the front of the mask it 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.250
 them where they say those things when 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.549
 signatures but good the first day of doing 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.319
 a breeze I will chat with you tomorrow 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.459
 Check the cameras do not forget to close 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.629
 the door only when it's absolutely 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.730
 necessary 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.730
 However
