 who goes on a mop ever the a4 christmas 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.660
 and the top I read that she is sublime 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.210
 but the fumes the same 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.650
 she is sublime that it is I did it 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.070

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.170
 but no, but she is very very beautiful 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.220

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.950
 arm but you see the place you have 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.600
 behind is not at all conceding 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.010
 the mother at the back you when you 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.020
 drive me through my cameras but 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.750
 cows go well this is a 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.280
 car is a generous car 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.900
 yes it's evening I do not understand wendy 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.860
 in my beast but because 10 is 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.510
 because we do not want a child but we 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.800
 do not care I'll be able to ask for lima 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:10.709
 of children no but they say we're going 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:16.170
 sell to ad it's true but it's 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.340
 true but you leave no minister but 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.700
 it's true they said we're going there 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.870
 return to names but to water 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:32.220
 but the gones if you hear us 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:35.150
 do not want kids on Thursday this is a 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.150
 mistake but you're right 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.490
 it counts between the third day you have 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:53.520
 discovered the massage function a super 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.270
 crate celebrates tells story for all 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.640
 The final word 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.020
 this leadership story leads 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.340
 the evolution you had in three days 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.870
 what you discovered is what you 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.020
 accounts the year it annoyed me a lot 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.520
 one voice - last night at 23 hours 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.260
 23h to midnight I still looked 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.750
 all the websites to find out what 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.160
 that they think they have had 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.270
 finally I read some papers but 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.990
 advised to go into 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.990
 neutral mode 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.239
 and must you so much is jacques 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.650
 chevallier yeah looking on 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.650
 high point to addicts 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.250
 sensibly he had the same feeling 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.930
 that what it really is in art we have 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.940
 seen must explain out of stuff the 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.980
 direction is a little biting yeah 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.330
 finally that there was a friend that they 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.630
 were obliged to admitted type of 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.630
 correction 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.110
 sometimes even important especially 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.139
 when there is wind and and had the 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.229
 feeling that wayne a brief say you 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.490
 lack of serenity behind the wheel and him 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.919
 explain very well and you say 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.949
 that actually setting and is 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.680
 subject to criticism is the best 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.009
 compromise the camera 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.360
 so many 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.979
 the best compromise is actually 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.199
 when you are sure neutral in the 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.159
 car configuration you see 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:10.680
 tutus sport hardened suspensions 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.689
 but the direction she stays she stays 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.460
 still a little complicated and he does 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.879
 would treat comfort well then there for the 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.899
 blow it's way too soft everywhere 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:21.800
 floriane etc that's what you feel 

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:21.800
 because I was the grain 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.790
 so after that it's still a car 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.790
 which is very flexible 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.480
 but at least this side support more rare 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.920
 must also say the usual you 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.969
 finally the better than before third 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.199
 see now so here is 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.320
 but also fitting that it's more 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.470
 closed 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.510
 and no but jacky actually he 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.460
 talk about the progress made stopping 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.580
 the midday depreciation can this poem of 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.060
 co2 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.060
 two directions 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.090
 main witnesses subscribe to 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.680
 youtube dear little observers me 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.520
 I can not get that art then start 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.520
 the matrix 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:37.780
 yeah so the case is in the station 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:40.800
 Service you have m yes I ask you 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.800
