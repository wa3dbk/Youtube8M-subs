definitely<00:00:50.039> clarifies<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.270> mean<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.690> see

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
definitely clarifies I mean you can see

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.049 
definitely clarifies I mean you can see
how<00:00:51.960> much<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.289> needed<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.770> use<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.699> my<00:00:53.820> whole

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
how much I needed to use for my whole

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.720 
how much I needed to use for my whole
can<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.680> used<00:00:56.010> about<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.399> fifth

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
can you see that so I used about a fifth

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.220 
can you see that so I used about a fifth
of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> bottle<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.719> an<00:00:57.809> 11<00:00:58.109> ounce

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
of the bottle and it's an 11 ounce

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.260 
of the bottle and it's an 11 ounce
bottle<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.800> probably<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.190> five<00:00:59.399> clarifying

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
bottle so I probably get five clarifying

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.479 
bottle so I probably get five clarifying
washes<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.770> not<00:01:01.949> bad<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.370> eight

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
washes out of this so not bad for eight

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.680 
washes out of this so not bad for eight
dollars<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.969> mean<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.210> super<00:01:03.359> expensive

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
dollars I mean it's super expensive

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.679 
dollars I mean it's super expensive
still<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:04.739> you're<00:01:05.339> into<00:01:05.700> cheaper<00:01:06.030> shampoos

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
still if you're into cheaper shampoos

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.500 
still if you're into cheaper shampoos
but<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.409> bad<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:08.030> definitely<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
but it's not bad I definitely think that

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.600 
but it's not bad I definitely think that
this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> good<00:01:10.350> clarifying<00:01:11.070> shampoo<00:01:11.400> now
