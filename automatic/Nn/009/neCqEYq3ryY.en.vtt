00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 training we draw a site from scratch photoshop 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.779
 classes number three put huskies 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.420
 subscribe to the channel and move 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.980
 further and so now we will exhibit 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.769
 height guides 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.660
 and let's start with our hat and the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.300
 qualities etxt written 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.080
 the height of the cap is 150 pixels therefore 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.080
 we hover the mouse on the guide and pull 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.929
 from here exactly 150 pixels down so 150 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.540
 so here is great and immediately let's 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.000
 Well, do not forget about the fact that we have everywhere 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.280
 indents are therefore immediately set below 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.350
 50 pixel indentation pull another 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.010
 guide rail and 155 50 is 200 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.530
 so here is fine so the following is 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.719
 subscription unit and its height will be 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.129
 exactly three hundred and forty pixels so 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.160
 again pull the guide here we have 200 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:06.630
 200 plus 340 equals 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:10.020
 so 540 and pull on 540 so here it is 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.610
 immediately indent again 50 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.040
 540 plus 50 590 pixels is fine so 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.659
 next moment this line is 400 pixels 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.180
 what do I mean by the line 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.939
 these are our columns of points that is, they see 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.140
 divided into columns and settings so here 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.240
 line height is exactly 400 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.310
 pixels so let's have her here and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.159
 prescribe 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:42.720
 so again pull the guide 590 + 400 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.759
 it's 990 pixels pulling 990 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.110
 then immediately take another 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.049
 guide and set the indent again 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.049
 50 pixels is 1040 and then again 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.600
 400 pixels is the height of our string that is 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:06.570
 two lines do not forget goes on anka 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:12.230
 1040 out of 400 1440 1440 here and again 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.410
 indent 50 pixels two three four 5 so 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.210
 1440 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.170
 50 1490 remarkably as follows 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.170
 us list 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.630
 what is the list here see this here 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.230
 here is a list of records that I did 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.080
 and the height of this list is 360 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:36.630
 so let us expose him too well 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:41.610
 we go down we put so and so stop 1490 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:49.290
 plus 360 it turns the needles closer and they 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:51.830
 count 1790 1850 so 1850 pixels 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.400
 so here let me still check 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.480
 cheek and 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.670
 to 360 exactly fine and the last is 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.580
 basement basement height 100 pixels 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.610
 we see that by design we have a little bit to 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.740
 The end does not reach here 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.930
 list because we have a sidebar 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.900
 longer than the content so there will be 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.210
 big indent well, okay so 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.220
 basement 100 pixels and 100 pixels we 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.740
 measure already below us 2 100 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.400
 It turns out it is necessary from 2 100 minus 100 this 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.860
 2000 exactly two thousand and exactly 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.470
 it turns out we have marked our entire 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.080
 see the site let's reduce it to 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.900
 I climbed into the woods everywhere 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.040
 screen and here you are our content 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.040
 here is our sidebar 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.650
 here is our first as well here is our cell with 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.680
 articles here is a block of advertising here 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.780
 here is a list of articles here is our 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.900
 cap there logos and so on here 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.900
 sidebar and here is the basement below 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.060
 homesteads a little far to here stretches well 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.239
 one more moment let's our basement 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.020
 also to surrender indentation here 150 pixels 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.310
 so now 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:10.020
 Opanki specification 150 of 50 we have here 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:14.010
 two thousand we pull up to 1950 so too 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.620
 small scale so struck 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:22.049
 pour in dozens i will slightly increase it 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:24.570
 and let's 1950 and here I do not praise yes e-mine 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.340
 so even more scale 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.080
 trample what you can change on contour 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.590
 plus keystroke either here 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.700
 see expose it here 50 percent 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:40.770
 scale so let me again it all 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:43.050
 I will do 1950 and so we see here now 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.940
 fully ready for our site 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.160
 and under it will already be under this 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.330
 guides to draw one site 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.040
 enjoyment 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.040
 we will understand it now
