00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.369 
up there with the ak-74 I think the
ak-74<00:00:53.879> from<00:00:54.420> black<00:00:54.629> ops<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> little<00:00:55.289> bit

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
ak-74 from black ops is a little bit

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.410 
ak-74 from black ops is a little bit
longer<00:00:55.590> than<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.550> type<00:00:56.730> 95<00:00:57.030> one

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
I put so much effort into getting this

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.399

what I do next I don't know if I said
this<00:04:25.500> already<00:04:25.620> but<00:04:25.979> I'm<00:04:26.130> leaning<00:04:26.490> towards<00:04:26.760> the

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
this already but I'm leaning towards the

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.680 
this already but I'm leaning towards the
LMGs

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
LMGs

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.110 
LMGs
just<00:04:28.590> because<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:29.010> won't<00:04:29.100> hotly<00:04:29.610> requested

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
just because that won't hotly requested

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.720 
just because that won't hotly requested
very<00:04:30.510> very<00:04:31.260> hotly<00:04:31.650> requested<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.400> that<00:04:32.550> one<00:04:32.700> I

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
very very hotly requested and that one I

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.060 
very very hotly requested and that one I
think<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.330> could<00:04:33.390> have<00:04:33.570> some<00:04:33.780> fun<00:04:33.930> doing<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.440> lot

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
think I could have some fun doing a lot

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.490 
think I could have some fun doing a lot
of<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.280> LMGs<00:04:35.640> I<00:04:35.670> ended<00:04:36.540> up<00:04:36.660> liking<00:04:36.990> them<00:04:37.320> I've

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
of the LMGs I ended up liking them I've

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.960 
of the LMGs I ended up liking them I've
already<00:04:37.680> started<00:04:37.980> experimenting<00:04:38.400> with<00:04:38.730> them

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
already started experimenting with them

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.370 
already started experimenting with them
but<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.120> just<00:04:39.240> haven't<00:04:39.420> done<00:04:39.630> any<00:04:39.840> recording
