00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:04.080
 it does not seem easy but in practice it is extremely complicated 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.389
 the designers solved the problem with a strange hybrid 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.129
 the v22 delights variable 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.250
 after many and exhaustive tests with the prototype 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.260
 is about to enter service with the marines of the United States go 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.230
 difference of the jarillero it is a plane propelled by the ts not of a 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.820
 plane with jet engine who so basically needs the same 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.110
 contribution of fuel when it is suspended that when it flies as a 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.500
 Track of watter 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.030
 the aircraft is designed to transport troops and material to the front 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.620
 battle 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.000
 from aaa 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.470
 access is through a very wide ramp we like to allow a 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.500
 Easy access to the cabin to board and disembark up to 24 soldiers 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.560
 They are 9 thousand kilos of material 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.900
 It is very easy to get in and out of the plane 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.150
 not even 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.740
 by rival taking off in the propellers they raise v22 as if it were a 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 helicopter 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.810
 as the plane is gaining speed the engines tilt 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.460
 gradually move forward and function as conventional elites 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.170
 when it flies forward the rooms provide the plane with 1 percent of 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.170
 its support 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.890
 with a maximum speed of 490 kilometers per hour 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.070
 the v22 can fly faster and go farther than any the ico 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.120
 this enormous advance in vertical flight has been possible thanks to the invasions 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.570
 military 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 but these machines have other applications 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.560
 the luxury design 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.720
 22 has been modified to convert it into 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.230
 in a civilian nine-passenger plane that can transform the idea of 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.230
 displacement between cities 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.269
 this plane could take off and land in the heart of the cities and it would be 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.269
 faster than a helicopter 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.380
 it is even possible 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.620
 that in the future vertical landing and takeoff technology 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.620
 revolutionize also the utilitarian vehicles 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.939
 the doctor pol grinder has designed a vertical takeoff flying car 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:55.549
 of birds in the current world we have a huge untapped land this is the 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.829
 space that if above us is great is used while heaps 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.829
 of people are trapped on the ground traffic jams are 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.309
 people have been dreaming of flying cars for years 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.699
 the doctor grind began to realize his dream 40 years ago 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.590
 has developed several prototypes and has shown that the basic concept 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.079
 to use the flying car of the future of the doctor molero will not be necessary 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.949
 learn to fly 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.949
 the computers will be piloting for you 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:41.559
 no club plays pilot but its partners people get on board they injured the 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.439
 destination and the vehicle will take you there 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.930
 can wake up vertically from the garden of your house and then posed your 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.930
 aerodynamic or advance grandfather 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:55.609
 with personal vehicles so people can get to work in a few 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:56.559
 minutes 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:59.849
 the flying cars will end the traffic jams 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:09.439
 the onboard computers will be in communication with GPS satellites for 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.729
 avoid collisions in the air 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.079
 the flying cars 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.079
 will travel on electronic space highways 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.150
 During the last 50 years there have been dozens of attempts to create 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.210
 the perfect vertical takeoff and landing plane 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.210
 the holy grail of aeronautical design 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.509
 practically its effective 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.079
 would stop vertical takeoff
