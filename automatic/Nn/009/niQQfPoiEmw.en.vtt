I<00:00:05.130> reduced<00:00:06.130> the<00:00:06.250> entrance<00:00:06.640> down<00:00:07.650> to<00:00:08.650> well<00:00:09.550> and

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
I reduced the entrance down to well and

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.940 
I reduced the entrance down to well and
in<00:00:10.150> this<00:00:10.330> case<00:00:10.570> is<00:00:10.720> when<00:00:10.870> I<00:00:10.900> first<00:00:11.530> started<00:00:11.830> out

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
in this case is when I first started out

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.709 
in this case is when I first started out
I<00:00:12.009> put<00:00:12.639> it<00:00:12.759> going<00:00:12.910> for<00:00:13.120> but<00:00:13.240> I'm<00:00:13.389> going<00:00:13.509> to<00:00:13.570> have

I put it going for but I'm going to have

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.360 
I put it going for but I'm going to have
it<00:00:13.839> about<00:00:14.019> six<00:00:14.290> inches<00:00:14.410> they're<00:00:14.980> only<00:00:15.249> a

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
it about six inches they're only a

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.430 
it about six inches they're only a
quarter<00:00:15.669> inch<00:00:15.849> high<00:00:16.030> so<00:00:16.840> they<00:00:17.080> don't<00:00:17.260> take

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
quarter inch high so they don't take

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.170 
quarter inch high so they don't take
very<00:00:17.470> many<00:00:17.800> guard<00:00:18.100> base<00:00:18.280> the<00:00:18.610> guard<00:00:18.820> to<00:00:18.910> injure

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
very many guard base the guard to injure

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.670 
very many guard base the guard to injure
and<00:00:19.270> I<00:00:19.300> put<00:00:19.480> a<00:00:19.510> big<00:00:19.720> landing<00:00:20.020> board<00:00:20.260> there<00:00:20.440> so

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
and I put a big landing board there so

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.310 
and I put a big landing board there so
they<00:00:20.800> can<00:00:20.950> land<00:00:21.730> on<00:00:21.940> it<00:00:22.060> go<00:00:22.240> in<00:00:22.390> heavily<00:00:23.140> and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
they can land on it go in heavily and

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.980 
they can land on it go in heavily and
with<00:00:23.950> the<00:00:24.640> funnels<00:00:25.000> on<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.240> side<00:00:25.450> funnels<00:00:25.900> the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
with the funnels on the side funnels the

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.420 
with the funnels on the side funnels the
bees<00:00:26.170> right<00:00:26.410> to<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:26.650> open<00:00:26.950> so<00:00:27.100> they<00:00:27.220> don't

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
bees right to the open so they don't

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.820 
bees right to the open so they don't
lose<00:00:27.550> no<00:00:27.790> time<00:00:27.820> getting<00:00:28.390> in<00:00:28.540> and<00:00:29.140> you<00:00:29.350> look<00:00:29.590> so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
lose no time getting in and you look so

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.990 
lose no time getting in and you look so
you<00:00:29.920> see<00:00:30.190> how<00:00:30.340> they're<00:00:30.520> bringing<00:00:30.610> in<00:00:30.880> this

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
you see how they're bringing in this

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.639 
you see how they're bringing in this
stuff<00:00:31.210> they're<00:00:31.390> bringing<00:00:31.660> it<00:00:31.780> in<00:00:31.960> and<00:00:32.140> they're

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
stuff they're bringing it in and they're

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.970 
stuff they're bringing it in and they're
going<00:00:32.829> in<00:00:32.950> real<00:00:33.250> good<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.989> that<00:00:35.649> there<00:00:35.890> is

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
going in real good and so that there is

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.829 
going in real good and so that there is
one<00:00:36.010> of<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.339> things<00:00:36.640> that's<00:00:36.850> benefits<00:00:37.629> that's

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
one of the things that's benefits that's

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.540 
one of the things that's benefits that's
why<00:00:38.019> I<00:00:38.079> had<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:38.350> put<00:00:38.530> a<00:00:38.589> screen<00:00:38.829> world<00:00:39.070> talk

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
why I had to put a screen world talk

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.660 
why I had to put a screen world talk
because<00:00:40.329> that<00:00:40.510> hold<00:00:40.749> is<00:00:40.899> too<00:00:41.050> small<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:42.100> high

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
because that hold is too small and high

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.189 
because that hold is too small and high
it<00:00:42.730> gets<00:00:42.940> too<00:00:43.179> hot<00:00:43.420> so<00:00:44.199> what<00:00:44.710> I<00:00:44.739> do<00:00:44.859> I<00:00:46.019> take<00:00:47.019> and

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
it gets too hot so what I do I take and

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.160 
it gets too hot so what I do I take and
put<00:00:47.350> this<00:00:47.469> free<00:00:47.710> war<00:00:47.980> on<00:00:48.159> top<00:00:48.429> and<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.989> this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
put this free war on top and on this

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.660 
put this free war on top and on this
free<00:00:50.409> world<00:00:50.679> on<00:00:50.800> top<00:00:51.039> it<00:00:51.819> has<00:00:51.879> four<00:00:52.480> four<00:00:53.019> holes

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
free world on top it has four four holes

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.669 
free world on top it has four four holes
see<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.789> bees<00:00:54.940> can't<00:00:55.269> get<00:00:55.420> out<00:00:55.569> bugs<00:00:56.379> can't

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
see the bees can't get out bugs can't

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.849 
see the bees can't get out bugs can't
get<00:00:56.859> in<00:00:57.069> and<00:00:57.280> so<00:00:57.999> the<00:00:58.749> air<00:00:58.960> comes<00:00:59.379> out<00:00:59.559> these

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
get in and so the air comes out these

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.319 
get in and so the air comes out these
but<00:01:00.159> of<00:01:00.309> course<00:01:00.489> want<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.760> put<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:00.999> top<00:01:01.149> on

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
but of course want to put the top on

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.879 
but of course want to put the top on
earth<00:01:01.569> that<00:01:01.780> seals<00:01:02.109> the<00:01:02.229> whole<00:01:02.469> thing<00:01:02.710> off

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:02.889 
earth that seals the whole thing off

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.799 
earth that seals the whole thing off
that<00:01:03.280> leaves<00:01:03.519> only<00:01:03.789> this<00:01:04.030> little<00:01:04.239> bitty<00:01:04.510> holes

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
that leaves only this little bitty holes

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.260 
that leaves only this little bitty holes
holes<00:01:05.379> hole<00:01:05.680> right<00:01:05.890> here<00:01:05.950> one<00:01:06.909> little<00:01:07.150> hole

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
holes hole right here one little hole

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.450 
holes hole right here one little hole
the<00:01:07.689> air<00:01:07.899> can<00:01:08.140> come<00:01:08.290> out<00:01:08.469> sits<00:01:09.130> just<00:01:09.280> like<00:01:09.430> a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
the air can come out sits just like a

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.090 
the air can come out sits just like a
stovepipe<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.840> air<00:01:11.320> comes<00:01:11.740> from<00:01:11.860> in<00:01:12.009> the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
stovepipe the air comes from in the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.770 
stovepipe the air comes from in the
bottom<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.759> comes<00:01:12.969> right<00:01:13.090> out<00:01:13.149> it<00:01:13.420> hits<00:01:13.630> the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
bottom and comes right out it hits the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.709 
bottom and comes right out it hits the
bees<00:01:13.990> ventilate<00:01:14.710> because<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.399> bees<00:01:15.719> take

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
bees ventilate because the bees take

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.010 
bees ventilate because the bees take
about<00:01:16.960> two<00:01:17.290> or<00:01:17.500> three<00:01:17.530> gallons<00:01:17.860> of<00:01:18.689> nectar<00:01:19.689> fan

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
about two or three gallons of nectar fan

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.260 
about two or three gallons of nectar fan
it<00:01:20.170> down<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.500> one<00:01:20.649> gallon<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.070> honey<00:01:21.310> so<00:01:21.789> all

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
it down to one gallon the honey so all

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.330 
it down to one gallon the honey so all
of<00:01:22.509> that<00:01:22.539> air<00:01:23.140> has<00:01:23.380> got<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.710> come<00:01:23.799> out<00:01:23.950> so<00:01:24.189> it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
of that air has got to come out so it

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.870 
of that air has got to come out so it
helps<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.700> bees<00:01:25.710> ventilate<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.890> honey<00:01:27.100> so

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
helps the bees ventilate the honey so

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.029 
helps the bees ventilate the honey so
that<00:01:28.450> there<00:01:28.659> is<00:01:28.750> one<00:01:28.930> of<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.110> reasons<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:29.560> I

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
that there is one of the reasons that I

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.230 
that there is one of the reasons that I
put<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.369> screen<00:01:30.579> war<00:01:30.789> on<00:01:30.939> there<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.149> that

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
put the screen war on there and that

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.569 
put the screen war on there and that
does<00:01:31.450> for<00:01:31.719> the<00:01:31.810> summertime<00:01:32.079> stuff<00:01:32.770> now<00:01:33.280> later

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
does for the summertime stuff now later

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.599 
does for the summertime stuff now later
on<00:01:33.670> I'll<00:01:33.909> show<00:01:33.939> you<00:01:34.329> what<00:01:35.320> I've<00:01:36.219> got<00:01:36.280> another

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
on I'll show you what I've got another

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.279 
on I'll show you what I've got another
box<00:01:36.850> with<00:01:37.090> two<00:01:37.329> holes<00:01:37.539> that<00:01:37.780> I<00:01:37.930> put<00:01:38.079> a<00:01:38.109> fruit

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
box with two holes that I put a fruit

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.139 
box with two holes that I put a fruit
jar<00:01:38.530> on<00:01:38.619> here<00:01:38.859> in<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:38.979> empty<00:01:39.280> box<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.789> I<00:01:39.880> feed

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
jar on here in the empty box and I feed

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.969 
jar on here in the empty box and I feed
my<00:01:40.299> bees<00:01:40.509> from<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.840> top<00:01:41.049> so<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.680> robbers

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
my bees from the top so the robbers

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.920 
my bees from the top so the robbers
can't<00:01:42.250> get<00:01:42.369> in<00:01:42.490> there<00:01:42.700> they<00:01:43.570> can't<00:01:43.810> get

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930
