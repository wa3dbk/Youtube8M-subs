00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:03.770 

by<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.490> way<00:00:02.700> some<00:00:02.939> other<00:00:03.120> things<00:00:03.389> for<00:00:03.659> these

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
by the way some other things for these

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.130 
by the way some other things for these
have<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.650> do<00:00:04.799> with<00:00:04.830> spin<00:00:05.690> number<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:06.960> these

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
have to do with spin number that these

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.799 
have to do with spin number that these
represent<00:00:07.319> positive<00:00:08.280> 1/2<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.940> negative<00:00:08.970> 1/2

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
represent positive 1/2 and negative 1/2

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.620 
represent positive 1/2 and negative 1/2
spins<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:11.099> what<00:00:11.250> would<00:00:11.370> be<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.639> overall<00:00:11.849> spin

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
spins so what would be the overall spin

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.060 
spins so what would be the overall spin
for<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.290> compound<00:00:15.020> well<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.230> overall<00:00:16.470> spin

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
for this compound well the overall spin

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.470 
for this compound well the overall spin
here<00:00:18.080> positive<00:00:19.080> what<00:00:20.210> yeah<00:00:21.210> positive<00:00:21.750> what

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
here positive what yeah positive what

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.359 
here positive what yeah positive what
positive<00:00:24.480> 1/2<00:00:24.810> these<00:00:25.350> two<00:00:25.560> spins<00:00:25.830> will<00:00:25.980> cancel

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
positive 1/2 these two spins will cancel

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.609 
positive 1/2 these two spins will cancel
and<00:00:27.029> these<00:00:27.240> these<00:00:27.449> good<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.810> cancel<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
and these these good so cancel and the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.290 
and these these good so cancel and the
only<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.949> doesn't<00:00:29.130> cancel<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.789> positive

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
only one it doesn't cancel this positive

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.600 
only one it doesn't cancel this positive
1/2<00:00:30.920> although<00:00:31.920> again<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.399> arbitrary

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
1/2 although again it's really arbitrary

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.370 
1/2 although again it's really arbitrary
did<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.149> screw<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.870> could<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.230> as<00:00:34.350> well

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
did I screw this up I could just as well

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.260 
did I screw this up I could just as well
have<00:00:34.530> drawn<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.890> down<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.340> said<00:00:35.520> maybe<00:00:35.790> 1/2

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
have drawn it down and said maybe 1/2

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.850 
have drawn it down and said maybe 1/2
but<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> key<00:00:37.079> thing<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.590> will<00:00:37.739> have

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
but the key thing is that this will have

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:53.689 
but the key thing is that this will have
a<00:00:37.920> 1/2<00:00:38.340> spin<00:00:51.140> that's<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.350> arbitrary<00:00:52.860> because

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
a 1/2 spin that's just arbitrary because

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.760 
a 1/2 spin that's just arbitrary because
you<00:00:54.149> could<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:54.660> I've<00:00:55.260> been<00:00:55.500> drawing

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
you could just as I've been drawing

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
you could just as I've been drawing
things<00:00:56.070> where<00:00:56.280> first<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.000> positive<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
things where first I put in positive and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.750 
things where first I put in positive and
it's<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> negative<00:00:58.559> that's<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.370> our<00:00:59.460> after

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it's a negative that's really our after

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.250 
it's a negative that's really our after
all<00:00:59.850> whether<00:01:00.210> something<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.600> sitting<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.109> or

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
all whether something is sitting up or

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.750 
all whether something is sitting up or
down<00:01:01.410> kinda<00:01:01.739> depends<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.309> angle<00:01:02.340> you're

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
down kinda depends on what angle you're

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.030 
down kinda depends on what angle you're
looking<00:01:02.820> at<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.300> from<00:01:03.329> anyway<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.739> there's<00:01:04.920> not

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
looking at it from anyway so there's not

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.250 
looking at it from anyway so there's not
too<00:01:05.189> much<00:01:05.339> time<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.880> even<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.780> even<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.049> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
too much time and even and even that and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.590 
too much time and even and even that and
also<00:01:07.409> spin<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.729> an<00:01:08.880> analogy<00:01:09.150> for

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
also spin is really just an analogy for

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.810 
also spin is really just an analogy for
this<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.200> property<00:01:10.590> ok<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> key

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this for this property ok so the key

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.219 
this for this property ok so the key
thing<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.119> let's<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.420> focus<00:01:12.540> too<00:01:12.840> much<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
thing is let's not focus too much on the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.630 
thing is let's not focus too much on the
positive<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.710> negative<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> key<00:01:14.310> thing<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
positive or negative the key thing is

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.660 
positive or negative the key thing is
that<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.880> magnitude<00:01:15.450> here<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.960> 1/2<00:01:16.400> now<00:01:17.400> what

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that the magnitude here is 1/2 now what

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.280 
that the magnitude here is 1/2 now what
would<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> total<00:01:18.240> spin<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.020> were<00:01:19.170> in

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
would be the total spin if we were in

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.730 
would be the total spin if we were in
the<00:01:19.380> weak<00:01:19.530> field<00:01:19.740> case<00:01:21.110> if<00:01:22.110> we're<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.619> this

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the weak field case if we're in this

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.080 
the weak field case if we're in this
weak<00:01:22.920> field<00:01:23.159> case<00:01:23.220> what<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.850> spin

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
weak field case what would this spin

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.749 
weak field case what would this spin
have<00:01:24.180> been<00:01:24.330> oh<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:26.100> total<00:01:26.400> spend<00:01:26.610> would

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
have been oh so the total spend would

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:35.899 
have been oh so the total spend would
have<00:01:26.880> been<00:01:27.530> positive<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:32.840> yeah<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:34.909> positive

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
have been positive what yeah or positive

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.030 
have been positive what yeah or positive
5<00:01:36.119> hats<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.930> each<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.290> these<00:01:37.380> has<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> 1/2

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
5 hats because each of these has a 1/2

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.460 
5 hats because each of these has a 1/2
spin<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.670> then<00:01:38.759> 1<00:01:38.939> 2<00:01:39.060> 3<00:01:39.180> 4<00:01:39.420> 5<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.780> them<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.409> we

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
spin and then 1 2 3 4 5 of them so we

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.499 
spin and then 1 2 3 4 5 of them so we
can<00:01:40.619> say<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> positive<00:01:41.280> 5<00:01:41.820> halves<00:01:42.150> or

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
can say this is a positive 5 halves or

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.340 
can say this is a positive 5 halves or
that's<00:01:43.200> two<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.590> half<00:01:43.740> that's<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:45.350> but

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
that's two and a half that's right but

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.660 
that's two and a half that's right but
again<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.860> key<00:01:47.040> thing<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.460> it's

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
again the key thing is not that it's

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.830 
again the key thing is not that it's
positive<00:01:48.119> because<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.390> could<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:48.810> well

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
positive because I could just as well

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.080 
positive because I could just as well
draw<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.290> these<00:01:49.439> all<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:49.799> negative<00:01:50.280> spins<00:01:50.579> so

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
draw on these all as negative spins so

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.310 
draw on these all as negative spins so
it<00:01:51.210> could<00:01:51.360> also<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.659> been<00:01:51.689> negative<00:01:52.170> 5

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
it could also have been negative 5

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.569 
it could also have been negative 5
halves<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> key<00:01:53.040> thing<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
halves but the key thing is that the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.810 
halves but the key thing is that the
magnitude<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.329> 5<00:01:54.570> halves<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.340> which<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.610> these

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
magnitude is 5 halves so which of these

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.910 
magnitude is 5 halves so which of these
would<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.119> well<00:02:00.450> called<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.960> high<00:02:01.200> spin<00:02:01.560> kicks

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
would be well called the high spin kicks

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.889 
would be well called the high spin kicks
and<00:02:02.219> which<00:02:02.579> would<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.880> well<00:02:03.119> termed<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.659> low

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
and which would be well termed the low

would be on the neutral atom and then

model<00:04:13.569> for<00:04:13.810> what<00:04:13.930> you<00:04:14.049> should<00:04:14.110> write<00:04:14.349> down

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
model for what you should write down

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.080 
model for what you should write down
with<00:04:14.709> you're<00:04:14.829> solving<00:04:15.040> these<00:04:15.250> problems<00:04:15.430> write

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
with you're solving these problems write

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.789 
with you're solving these problems write
down<00:04:16.299> this<00:04:16.539> this<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.320> then<00:04:17.440> you're<00:04:17.590> ready<00:04:17.739> to

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
down this this and then you're ready to

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.610 
down this this and then you're ready to
write<00:04:18.010> this<00:04:18.190> down<00:04:22.139> we'll<00:04:23.139> do<00:04:23.229> a<00:04:23.260> couple<00:04:23.410> more

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
write this down we'll do a couple more

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.140 
write this down we'll do a couple more
examples<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:24.190> it<00:04:24.280> would<00:04:24.370> be<00:04:24.460> clear<00:04:24.699> how<00:04:24.970> that

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
examples so it would be clear how that

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.640 
examples so it would be clear how that
applies<00:04:27.330> yeah<00:04:28.360> first<00:04:28.840> we<00:04:28.990> find<00:04:29.169> this<00:04:29.410> number

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
applies yeah first we find this number

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.110 
applies yeah first we find this number
if<00:04:29.770> we<00:04:29.889> wanted<00:04:30.190> out<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.370> valence<00:04:30.699> electrons

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
if we wanted out the valence electrons

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.820 
if we wanted out the valence electrons
of<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.300> cation<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.139> way<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:32.260> do<00:04:32.500> that<00:04:32.620> is

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
of the cation so the way to do that is

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.500 
of the cation so the way to do that is
first<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.220> find<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.520> valence<00:04:33.850> electrons<00:04:34.330> on

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
first to find the valence electrons on

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.969 
first to find the valence electrons on
the<00:04:34.570> neutral<00:04:34.930> atom<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:35.440> then<00:04:35.740> we<00:04:35.830> just

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
the neutral atom and then we just

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:45.649 
the neutral atom and then we just
subtract<00:04:36.479> how<00:04:37.479> many<00:04:37.660> they<00:04:37.840> have<00:04:37.870> been<00:04:38.139> removed

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.700 

well<00:04:46.659> that<00:04:46.779> means<00:04:46.960> there<00:04:47.110> was<00:04:47.169> another<00:04:47.409> step

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
well that means there was another step

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.679 
well that means there was another step
as<00:04:47.860> you<00:04:47.919> could<00:04:48.039> emphasize<00:04:48.219> to<00:04:48.699> here<00:04:48.849> one<00:04:49.599> of

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:49.689 
as you could emphasize to here one of

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:50.909 
as you could emphasize to here one of
the<00:04:49.749> other<00:04:49.899> things<00:04:50.110> we<00:04:50.229> had<00:04:50.349> to<00:04:50.409> do<00:04:50.529> maybe<00:04:50.740> the

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
the other things we had to do maybe the

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.499 
the other things we had to do maybe the
first<00:04:51.099> thing<00:04:51.249> we<00:04:51.399> had<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.550> do<00:04:51.699> was<00:04:51.969> figure<00:04:52.210> out

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
first thing we had to do was figure out

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.529 
first thing we had to do was figure out
the<00:04:52.749> oxidation<00:04:53.139> on<00:04:53.770> this<00:04:54.099> iron<00:04:54.279> because<00:04:54.969> if<00:04:55.089> we

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
the oxidation on this iron because if we

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.149 
the oxidation on this iron because if we
didn't<00:04:55.749> know<00:04:55.809> this<00:04:55.899> was<00:04:56.050> iron<00:04:56.319> three-plus<00:04:56.619> we

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
didn't know this was iron three-plus we

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:58.290 
didn't know this was iron three-plus we
wouldn't<00:04:57.430> know<00:04:57.490> that<00:04:57.639> we<00:04:57.699> were<00:04:57.789> taking<00:04:58.149> away

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
wouldn't know that we were taking away

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.820 
wouldn't know that we were taking away
free<00:04:58.509> electrons<00:04:58.990> is<00:04:59.139> good<00:04:59.289> I<00:04:59.319> said<00:04:59.559> iron

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
free electrons is good I said iron

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.189 
free electrons is good I said iron
two-plus<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:01.419> was<00:05:01.569> again<00:05:01.809> one<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.080> the

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
two-plus that was again one of the

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.659 
two-plus that was again one of the
reasons<00:05:02.229> I<00:05:02.649> spent<00:05:02.979> a<00:05:03.009> lot<00:05:03.129> of<00:05:03.159> time<00:05:03.369> last<00:05:03.550> time

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
reasons I spent a lot of time last time

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.820 
reasons I spent a lot of time last time
practicing<00:05:04.360> how<00:05:04.569> to<00:05:04.599> find<00:05:04.869> oxidation<00:05:05.529> numbers

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
practicing how to find oxidation numbers

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.749 
practicing how to find oxidation numbers
you<00:05:06.009> need<00:05:06.159> to<00:05:06.219> be<00:05:06.309> able<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.520> find<00:05:06.669> the

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
you need to be able to find the

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:16.769 
you need to be able to find the
oxidation<00:05:07.149> number<00:05:07.509> to<00:05:07.659> apply<00:05:07.869> crystal<00:05:15.779> the

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
oxidation number to apply crystal the

oxidation number to apply crystal the
beta's<00:05:17.080> electrons<00:05:17.439> in<00:05:17.529> the<00:05:17.589> cation<00:05:18.009> that's

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
beta's electrons in the cation that's

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.459 
beta's electrons in the cation that's
right<00:05:18.399> that's<00:05:18.759> right<00:05:18.909> so<00:05:19.319> literally<00:05:20.319> the

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:20.469 
right that's right so literally the

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:22.949 
right that's right so literally the
first<00:05:20.649> step<00:05:20.949> here<00:05:21.219> is<00:05:21.279> find<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.389> oxidation

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:22.959 
first step here is find the oxidation

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:26.760 
first step here is find the oxidation
number<00:05:23.499> on<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:24.189> transition<00:05:24.729> metal<00:05:24.999> and<00:05:25.770> you'd

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
number on the transition metal and you'd

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.689 
number on the transition metal and you'd
already<00:05:26.919> done<00:05:27.129> that<00:05:27.309> at<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.490> start

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
already done that at the start

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.429 
already done that at the start
automatically<00:05:28.180> so<00:05:28.330> that<00:05:28.539> was<00:05:28.659> good<00:05:28.839> in<00:05:29.199> this

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
automatically so that was good in this

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.989 
automatically so that was good in this
number<00:05:29.680> was<00:05:29.919> crucial<00:05:30.309> to<00:05:30.369> finding<00:05:30.580> how<00:05:30.849> many

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:30.999 
number was crucial to finding how many

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.909 
number was crucial to finding how many
valence<00:05:31.149> electrons<00:05:31.360> were<00:05:31.930> left<00:05:32.080> because<00:05:32.800> it

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
valence electrons were left because it

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.159 
valence electrons were left because it
wasn't<00:05:33.189> given<00:05:33.309> in<00:05:33.669> the<00:05:33.789> problem<00:05:34.270> right<00:05:34.779> the

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
wasn't given in the problem right the

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.689 
wasn't given in the problem right the
problem<00:05:35.860> didn't<00:05:36.069> say<00:05:36.159> this<00:05:36.309> was<00:05:36.369> iron

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
problem didn't say this was iron

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.689 
problem didn't say this was iron
three-plus<00:05:36.969> we<00:05:37.330> had<00:05:37.449> to<00:05:37.569> figure<00:05:37.719> it<00:05:37.930> out<00:05:38.699> so

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
three-plus we had to figure it out so

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.820 
three-plus we had to figure it out so
find<00:05:40.180> oxidation<00:05:40.809> numbers<00:05:41.139> and<00:05:41.319> we'll<00:05:41.529> find

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
find oxidation numbers and we'll find

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:50.249 
find oxidation numbers and we'll find
neutral<00:05:42.419> atoms<00:05:43.419> electrons<00:05:48.360> will<00:05:49.360> draw<00:05:49.689> those

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
neutral atoms electrons will draw those

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.259 
neutral atoms electrons will draw those
cases<00:05:50.800> up<00:05:50.979> strong<00:05:51.219> and<00:05:51.430> weak<00:05:51.639> and<00:05:51.879> then<00:05:52.059> we'll

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:52.269 
cases up strong and weak and then we'll

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:56.850 
cases up strong and weak and then we'll
give<00:05:52.539> a<00:05:52.779> look<00:05:53.019> at<00:05:53.229> clue<00:05:53.469> right<00:05:54.039> from<00:05:54.370> there

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.379 

yes<00:05:57.129> good<00:05:58.499> okay<00:05:59.529> now<00:06:00.089> good

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
yes good okay now good

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.749 
yes good okay now good
so<00:06:02.289> let's<00:06:02.439> frighten<00:06:02.709> others<00:06:02.769> example<00:06:03.249> all

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
so let's frighten others example all

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:05.939 
so let's frighten others example all
right
