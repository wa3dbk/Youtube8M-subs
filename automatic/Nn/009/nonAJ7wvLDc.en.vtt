hey what's up guys david here from foam

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.650 
hey what's up guys david here from foam
bluff<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:08.849> video<00:00:09.059> we'll<00:00:09.330> be<00:00:09.450> doing

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
bluff and in this video we'll be doing

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.910 
bluff and in this video we'll be doing
what<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.900> looks<00:00:10.080> like<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.500> doing<00:00:10.650> a

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
what it looks like and doing a

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.730 
what it looks like and doing a
durability<00:00:11.639> test<00:00:11.880> on<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.360> HTC<00:00:12.990> one<00:00:13.200> we

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
durability test on the HTC one we

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.110 
durability test on the HTC one we
actually<00:00:14.009> have<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.280> couple<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.700> tests<00:00:14.849> we'll<00:00:14.969> be

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
actually have a couple of tests we'll be

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.470 
actually have a couple of tests we'll be
doing

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
doing

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.630 
doing
one<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.320> key<00:00:16.560> test<00:00:16.830> which<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.369> probably

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
one is the key test which is probably

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.820 
one is the key test which is probably
the<00:00:17.730> most<00:00:17.850> practical<00:00:18.330> most<00:00:18.630> realistic<00:00:19.289> out<00:00:19.590> of

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the most practical most realistic out of

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.590 
the most practical most realistic out of
this<00:00:19.949> whole<00:00:20.100> test<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.820> also<00:00:20.970> could<00:00:21.180> be<00:00:21.240> doing<00:00:21.449> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
this whole test we also could be doing a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.750 
this whole test we also could be doing a
knife<00:00:21.869> scratch<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.500> stab<00:00:22.740> test<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.460> see<00:00:23.640> how

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
knife scratch and stab test to see how

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.429 
knife scratch and stab test to see how
tough<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.090> screen<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.570> also<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.109> actual

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
tough the screen and also the actual

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.620 
tough the screen and also the actual
body<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.250> phone<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.150> final<00:00:27.480> ring

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
body of the phone is and the final ring

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.630 
body of the phone is and the final ring
of<00:00:27.720> doing<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.080> hammer<00:00:28.380> drop<00:00:28.710> or<00:00:28.949> mallet<00:00:29.429> drop

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
of doing a hammer drop or mallet drop

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.700 
of doing a hammer drop or mallet drop
test<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.330> see<00:00:30.510> how<00:00:30.779> much<00:00:30.840> resistance<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
test to see how much resistance the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.590 
test to see how much resistance the
screen<00:00:32.009> could<00:00:32.160> take<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.579> also<00:00:33.030> maybe<00:00:33.420> we'll

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
screen could take and also maybe we'll

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.940 
screen could take and also maybe we'll
slam<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.020> back<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> couple<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.649> times<00:00:34.829> to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
slam it on the back a couple of times to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.130 
slam it on the back a couple of times to
see<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.460> know<00:00:35.550> how<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.880> fares<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.989> that

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
see you know how it fares so with that

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.780 
see you know how it fares so with that
said<00:00:37.440> let's<00:00:37.860> go<00:00:37.980> ahead<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.340> begin<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
said let's go ahead and begin with the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.250 
said let's go ahead and begin with the
easiest<00:00:39.300> test<00:00:39.660> out<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.960> three<00:00:40.110> or<00:00:40.200> at

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
easiest test out of the three or at

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.200 
easiest test out of the three or at
least<00:00:40.410> what<00:00:40.980> seems<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.430> be<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> easiest<00:00:41.670> test

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
least what seems to be the easiest test

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.510 
least what seems to be the easiest test
and<00:00:42.390> that's<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.780> key<00:00:43.620> scratch<00:00:43.950> test<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.370> see

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and that's the key scratch test to see

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.770 
and that's the key scratch test to see
you<00:00:44.820> know<00:00:44.940> what's<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> happen<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
you know what's going to happen to the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.700 
you know what's going to happen to the
screen<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.050> we'll<00:00:46.110> actually<00:00:46.230> turn<00:00:46.559> off<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
screen so we'll actually turn off the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.529 
screen so we'll actually turn off the
display<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.370> I'll<00:00:47.940> show<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> display

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
display and I'll show you the display

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.049 
display and I'll show you the display
right<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:49.250> no<00:00:50.250> scratches<00:00:50.700> or<00:00:50.730> anything<00:00:50.820> like

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
right now no scratches or anything like

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.160 
right now no scratches or anything like
that<00:00:51.120> couple<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.510> finger<00:00:51.750> prints<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.050> might

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
that couple of finger prints you might

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.350 
that couple of finger prints you might
be<00:00:52.289> able<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.120> most<00:00:54.239> part

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
be able to see but for the most part

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
be able to see but for the most part
it's<00:00:54.719> pretty<00:00:55.140> much<00:00:55.350> perfect<00:00:55.770> condition<00:00:56.250> so

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it's pretty much perfect condition so

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
it's pretty much perfect condition so
let's<00:00:57.059> go<00:00:57.149> ahead<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.420> actually<00:00:57.510> wipe<00:00:58.320> this

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
let's go ahead and actually wipe this

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.479 
let's go ahead and actually wipe this
off<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:58.890> quick<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.980> start<00:01:01.980> scratch<00:01:02.250> test

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
off really quick and start scratch test

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.310 
off really quick and start scratch test
so<00:01:02.699> got<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> key<00:01:03.270> right<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.480> I'm<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> be

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
so got a key right here I'm going to be

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.390 
so got a key right here I'm going to be
doing<00:01:04.530> these<00:01:04.619> rough<00:01:04.920> edges<00:01:05.040> right<00:01:05.339> here

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
doing these rough edges right here

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.719 
doing these rough edges right here
scratching<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.299> across<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> screen<00:01:06.900> so

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
scratching it all across the screen so

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.789 
scratching it all across the screen so
and<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.630> applying<00:01:09.930> quite<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> bit

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
and I'm going to be applying quite a bit

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.679 
and I'm going to be applying quite a bit
of<00:01:10.890> pressure<00:01:11.040> because<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.420> screen

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
of pressure because I know the screen

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.990 
of pressure because I know the screen
has<00:01:12.900> Gorilla<00:01:13.290> Glass<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.950> blue<00:01:14.760> glass<00:01:14.970> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
has Gorilla Glass and blue glass is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.520 
has Gorilla Glass and blue glass is
really<00:01:15.299> really<00:01:15.570> good<00:01:15.780> at<00:01:16.020> resisting

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
really really good at resisting

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.810 
really really good at resisting
scratches<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.430> fact<00:01:17.640> they're

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
scratches like this in fact they're

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.210 
scratches like this in fact they're
actually<00:01:18.150> built<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:19.020> resist<00:01:19.619> scratches<00:01:20.100> like

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
actually built to resist scratches like

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520 
actually built to resist scratches like
key<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.850> expect<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.509> pass<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.080> test<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
key so I expect it to pass this test and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.999 
key so I expect it to pass this test and
uh<00:01:23.119> looking<00:01:24.119> at<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.380> no<00:01:25.860> doubt

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
uh looking at it you can see no doubt

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.320 
uh looking at it you can see no doubt
I'm<00:01:26.130> gonna<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> wipe<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.820> off<00:01:26.880> usually<00:01:27.299> I

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
I'm gonna have to wipe it off usually I

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.450 
I'm gonna have to wipe it off usually I
have<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> wipe<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> off<00:01:27.979> nothing<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.340> is

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
a whole bunch of little scratch marks on

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.569 
a whole bunch of little scratch marks on
the<00:01:57.960> back<00:01:58.350> we're<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.159> go<00:01:59.219> ahead<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.490> try

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the back we're going to go ahead and try

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.209 
the back we're going to go ahead and try
to<00:01:59.640> wipe<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.000> off<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.649> get<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.770> microfiber

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
to wipe it off so get this microfiber

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.720 
to wipe it off so get this microfiber
cloth<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.110 

they<00:02:07.600> do<00:02:07.660> why<00:02:07.900> pop<00:02:08.140> seems<00:02:08.440> like<00:02:08.730> some<00:02:09.730> residue

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
they do why pop seems like some residue

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.060 
they do why pop seems like some residue
there<00:02:10.330> let's<00:02:11.080> see<00:02:11.170> if<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.260> could<00:02:11.410> rub<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:11.890> off<00:02:11.950> to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
there let's see if I could rub it off to

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.660 
there let's see if I could rub it off to
my<00:02:12.190> finger

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
my finger

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.670 
my finger
yeah<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:13.630> guess<00:02:13.720> my<00:02:13.870> finger<00:02:14.140> has<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.380> magic

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
yeah so I guess my finger has the magic

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.720 
yeah so I guess my finger has the magic
touch<00:02:14.710> because<00:02:16.560> all<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:18.070> went<00:02:18.220> away<00:02:18.280> so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
touch because all of it went away so

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.390 
touch because all of it went away so
first<00:02:19.720> scratch<00:02:19.960> test<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.920> know<00:02:21.010> what<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.220> key

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
first scratch test you know what the key

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.430 
first scratch test you know what the key
I'd<00:02:21.970> say<00:02:22.270> it's<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.450> past<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:23.050> know<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.200> screen

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
I'd say it's a past you know the screen

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.560 
I'd say it's a past you know the screen
pass<00:02:24.010> with<00:02:24.220> flying<00:02:24.250> colors<00:02:24.790> obviously<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
pass with flying colors obviously the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.670 
pass with flying colors obviously the
screen<00:02:25.780> still<00:02:26.020> works<00:02:26.200> we<00:02:26.350> didn't<00:02:26.530> put<00:02:26.650> any

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
screen still works we didn't put any

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.070 
screen still works we didn't put any
kind<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.430> real<00:02:27.610> pressure<00:02:27.910> on<00:02:28.060> here<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.780> make<00:02:28.930> it

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
kind of real pressure on here to make it

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.870 
kind of real pressure on here to make it
crack<00:02:29.260> or<00:02:29.380> anything<00:02:29.500> like<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.710> so<00:02:30.010> scratch

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
crack or anything like that so scratch

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.060 
crack or anything like that so scratch
test<00:02:31.180> with<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.360> key<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:32.050> pass

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
test with a key is a pass

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.770 
test with a key is a pass
let's<00:02:33.430> go<00:02:33.550> ahead<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:34.060> bring<00:02:34.390> out<00:02:34.570> this

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
let's go ahead and bring out this

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.920 
let's go ahead and bring out this
humongous<00:02:35.260> kitchen<00:02:36.220> knife<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:37.000> again<00:02:37.480> we'll

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
humongous kitchen knife so again we'll

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.660 
humongous kitchen knife so again we'll
try<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.950> screen<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.340> what<00:02:39.430> we're<00:02:39.520> going<00:02:39.610> to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
try the screen and what we're going to

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.300 
try the screen and what we're going to
do<00:02:39.790> here<00:02:40.240> actually<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:41.200> also<00:02:41.470> test<00:02:41.800> these<00:02:41.980> fine

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
do here actually is also test these fine

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.880 
do here actually is also test these fine
edges<00:02:42.670> over<00:02:42.880> here<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.410> east<00:02:44.440> see<00:02:44.770> one

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
edges over here on the east see one

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.220 
edges over here on the east see one
these<00:02:45.010> fine<00:02:45.250> finished<00:02:45.640> edges<00:02:45.910> because<00:02:46.690> it's

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
these fine finished edges because it's

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.600 
these fine finished edges because it's
similar<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.590> what<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:47.920> was<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.220> iPhone<00:02:48.460> 5

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
similar to what it was on the iPhone 5

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.430 
similar to what it was on the iPhone 5
member<00:02:48.910> when<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.180> did<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.420> iPhone<00:02:49.720> 5<00:02:49.900> test<00:02:50.170> it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
member when I did the iPhone 5 test it

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.650 
member when I did the iPhone 5 test it
did<00:02:50.980> actually<00:02:51.430> sustain<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.060> quite<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.480> few

did actually sustain a quite a few
scratches<00:02:52.900> here<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:53.500> first<00:02:54.070> we'll<00:02:54.190> do<00:02:54.280> the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
scratches here so first we'll do the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.230 
scratches here so first we'll do the
screen<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:57.130> am<00:02:57.280> applying<00:02:57.640> pressure<00:02:57.940> I'm

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
deeper actually and it doesn't seem like

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.030 
deeper actually and it doesn't seem like
it's<00:04:06.070> actually<00:04:06.190> coming<00:04:06.610> off<00:04:06.850> so<00:04:08.010> try<00:04:09.010> to

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.640 
going to wipe off it looks like they're
pretty<00:05:03.220> permanent<00:05:04.210> as<00:05:04.810> far<00:05:05.110> as<00:05:05.229> that<00:05:05.409> knife

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
pretty permanent as far as that knife

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.050 
pretty permanent as far as that knife
test<00:05:05.889> goes<00:05:06.069> obviously<00:05:06.430> you're<00:05:06.849> not<00:05:06.909> gonna

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
test goes obviously you're not gonna

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.460 
test goes obviously you're not gonna
slash<00:05:07.300> your<00:05:07.479> phone<00:05:07.599> with<00:05:07.720> a<00:05:07.780> knife<00:05:07.960> hopefully

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
slash your phone with a knife hopefully

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.029 
slash your phone with a knife hopefully
so<00:05:09.960> not<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:11.139> big<00:05:11.380> of<00:05:11.500> an<00:05:11.590> issue<00:05:11.680> but

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
so not that big of an issue but

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.620 
so not that big of an issue but
definitely<00:05:12.729> something<00:05:12.940> to<00:05:13.000> consider<00:05:13.090> so<00:05:13.449> now

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
definitely something to consider so now

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.719 
definitely something to consider so now
let's<00:05:13.900> go<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.050> maybe<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.770> most<00:05:14.949> exciting<00:05:15.460> test

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
let's go to maybe the most exciting test

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.320 
let's go to maybe the most exciting test
which<00:05:16.360> is<00:05:16.539> the<00:05:16.870> mallet<00:05:17.680> smashing<00:05:18.580> time<00:05:18.969> so

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
which is the mallet smashing time so

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.749 
which is the mallet smashing time so
we'll<00:05:20.110> go<00:05:20.229> ahead<00:05:20.319> and<00:05:20.530> take<00:05:21.190> this<00:05:21.340> guy<00:05:21.430> and

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
we'll go ahead and take this guy and

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.369 
we'll go ahead and take this guy and
start<00:05:22.210> smashing<00:05:22.629> the<00:05:22.659> screen<00:05:22.930> to<00:05:23.050> see<00:05:23.199> you

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
start smashing the screen to see you

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:24.899 
start smashing the screen to see you
know<00:05:23.500> if<00:05:23.560> we<00:05:23.620> could<00:05:23.740> take<00:05:24.099> you<00:05:24.430> know<00:05:24.460> moderate

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
know if we could take you know moderate

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.700 
know if we could take you know moderate
pressure<00:05:25.240> obviously<00:05:26.169> like<00:05:26.349> I<00:05:26.409> said<00:05:26.560> if<00:05:26.650> you

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
pressure obviously like I said if you

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.080 
pressure obviously like I said if you
drop<00:05:26.919> this<00:05:27.039> thing<00:05:27.099> on<00:05:27.400> the<00:05:27.550> floor<00:05:27.669> face<00:05:28.060> down

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
drop this thing on the floor face down

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.330 
drop this thing on the floor face down
from<00:05:28.569> like<00:05:28.690> five<00:05:29.080> feet<00:05:29.259> up<00:05:29.440> it's<00:05:29.949> gonna<00:05:30.069> crack

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
from like five feet up it's gonna crack

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.029 
from like five feet up it's gonna crack
I<00:05:30.460> mean<00:05:30.610> any<00:05:30.819> glass<00:05:31.150> is<00:05:31.419> going<00:05:31.569> to<00:05:31.630> crack<00:05:31.840> so<00:05:32.110> we

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
I mean any glass is going to crack so we

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.350 
I mean any glass is going to crack so we
want<00:05:33.219> to<00:05:33.280> see<00:05:33.340> what<00:05:33.610> it<00:05:33.699> does<00:05:33.849> with<00:05:34.030> this<00:05:34.150> thing

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
want to see what it does with this thing

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:44.700 
want to see what it does with this thing
so<00:05:34.599> all<00:05:42.000> right<00:05:43.000> so<00:05:43.210> you<00:05:43.300> can<00:05:43.569> hear<00:05:43.810> how<00:05:44.440> loud

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
so all right so you can hear how loud

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.279 
so all right so you can hear how loud
that<00:05:45.069> was<00:05:45.759> because<00:05:46.569> obviously<00:05:46.719> I<00:05:46.990> was

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
that was because obviously I was

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.769 
that was because obviously I was
applying<00:05:47.919> a<00:05:48.279> bunch<00:05:49.180> of<00:05:49.330> bunch<00:05:49.509> of<00:05:49.630> pressure

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:49.779 
applying a bunch of bunch of pressure

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:53.610 
applying a bunch of bunch of pressure
but<00:05:50.969> screen<00:05:51.969> still<00:05:52.210> working<00:05:52.630> let's<00:05:53.440> go<00:05:53.529> ahead

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
but screen still working let's go ahead

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.040 
but screen still working let's go ahead
and<00:05:53.800> clean<00:05:53.949> it<00:05:53.979> off<00:05:54.159> see<00:05:54.430> if<00:05:54.550> that<00:05:55.539> left<00:05:55.810> any

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
and clean it off see if that left any

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.540 
and clean it off see if that left any
kind<00:05:56.319> of<00:05:58.080> residue<00:05:59.080> but<00:05:59.409> now<00:05:59.860> the<00:06:00.130> screen<00:06:00.370> looks

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
kind of residue but now the screen looks

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.969 
kind of residue but now the screen looks
perfect<00:06:00.940> so<00:06:01.000> so<00:06:01.750> far<00:06:02.050> from<00:06:02.560> the<00:06:02.680> test<00:06:02.889> that

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
perfect so so far from the test that

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.510 
perfect so so far from the test that
we've<00:06:03.130> done<00:06:04.139> only<00:06:05.139> real<00:06:05.349> damage<00:06:05.800> is<00:06:06.069> again

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
we've done only real damage is again

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.769 
we've done only real damage is again
these<00:06:06.759> light<00:06:07.479> light<00:06:07.750> scratches<00:06:08.319> so<00:06:09.779> actually

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:10.779 
these light light scratches so actually

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:13.320 
these light light scratches so actually
I<00:06:10.810> forgot<00:06:11.319> I<00:06:11.349> actually<00:06:11.529> skipped<00:06:11.919> the<00:06:12.639> side

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
I forgot I actually skipped the side

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.180 
I forgot I actually skipped the side
scratch<00:06:13.719> so<00:06:13.870> I<00:06:13.930> want<00:06:14.080> to<00:06:14.139> scratch<00:06:14.409> these

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
scratch so I want to scratch these

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:22.370 
scratch so I want to scratch these
little<00:06:15.849> fine<00:06:16.090> edges<00:06:16.389> over<00:06:16.569> here<00:06:16.719> so<00:06:16.930> oh<00:06:20.789> yeah

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
little fine edges over here so oh yeah

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.149 
little fine edges over here so oh yeah
yeah<00:06:23.380> you<00:06:23.440> can<00:06:23.620> definitely<00:06:24.069> see<00:06:24.219> that<00:06:26.130> try<00:06:27.130> to

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:27.159 
yeah you can definitely see that try to

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.420 
yeah you can definitely see that try to
get<00:06:27.310> a<00:06:27.340> better<00:06:27.460> angle

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.200 

so<00:06:30.940> you<00:06:31.030> can<00:06:31.210> see<00:06:31.330> those<00:06:31.479> scratches<00:06:31.780> there<00:06:33.210> and

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
so you can see those scratches there and

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.350 
so you can see those scratches there and
those<00:06:34.479> things<00:06:34.690> are<00:06:34.810> not<00:06:34.930> coming<00:06:35.320> off<00:06:35.699> so<00:06:36.699> just

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
those things are not coming off so just

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.480 
those things are not coming off so just
like<00:06:37.449> the<00:06:37.600> iPhone<00:06:37.960> I<00:06:37.990> mean<00:06:38.199> it<00:06:38.410> looks<00:06:39.130> really

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
like the iPhone I mean it looks really

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.129 
like the iPhone I mean it looks really
really<00:06:39.520> nice<00:06:39.880> but<00:06:40.240> it<00:06:40.600> is<00:06:40.720> prone<00:06:41.110> to

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
really nice but it is prone to

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:44.090 
really nice but it is prone to
scratching<00:06:42.150> this<00:06:43.150> part<00:06:43.419> at<00:06:43.509> least

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
scratching this part at least

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.760 
scratching this part at least
so<00:06:45.539> gorilla<00:06:46.539> glass<00:06:46.720> screen<00:06:46.780> actually<00:06:47.320> really

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
so gorilla glass screen actually really

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.860 
so gorilla glass screen actually really
good<00:06:47.919> when<00:06:48.130> it<00:06:48.220> comes<00:06:48.370> to<00:06:48.520> scratch<00:06:49.330> resistance

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
good when it comes to scratch resistance

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.020 
good when it comes to scratch resistance
obviously<00:06:50.590> it's<00:06:50.680> not<00:06:50.740> scratch<00:06:51.039> proof<00:06:51.340> and<00:06:51.639> it

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
obviously it's not scratch proof and it

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.070 
obviously it's not scratch proof and it
will<00:06:52.120> actually<00:06:52.240> ends<00:06:52.509> up<00:06:52.539> scratching<00:06:52.810> these

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
will actually ends up scratching these

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.980 
will actually ends up scratching these
more<00:06:53.350> usually<00:06:54.509> elements<00:06:55.509> that<00:06:55.600> are<00:06:55.720> harder

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
more usually elements that are harder

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.050 
more usually elements that are harder
than<00:06:56.199> the<00:06:56.259> screen<00:06:56.650> itself<00:06:56.949> like<00:06:57.550> sand<00:06:57.910> or

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
than the screen itself like sand or

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.790 
than the screen itself like sand or
something<00:06:58.330> like<00:06:58.389> that<00:06:58.449> I<00:06:58.840> might<00:06:59.320> do<00:06:59.440> a<00:06:59.470> test<00:06:59.710> of

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
something like that I might do a test of

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.860 
something like that I might do a test of
that<00:06:59.889> in<00:06:59.979> the<00:07:00.039> future<00:07:00.340> if<00:07:00.400> you<00:07:00.460> guys<00:07:00.580> want<00:07:00.910> but

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
that in the future if you guys want but

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.840 
that in the future if you guys want but
for<00:07:02.380> just<00:07:02.830> regular<00:07:02.979> scratches<00:07:03.460> if<00:07:03.520> you<00:07:03.580> drop

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:03.850 
for just regular scratches if you drop

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.820 
for just regular scratches if you drop
it<00:07:04.000> on<00:07:04.060> the<00:07:04.150> on<00:07:04.270> on<00:07:04.539> the<00:07:04.720> floor<00:07:04.960> the<00:07:05.440> screen<00:07:05.740> is

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
it on the on on the floor the screen is

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.710 
it on the on on the floor the screen is
going<00:07:05.889> to<00:07:06.039> be<00:07:06.100> good<00:07:06.220> the<00:07:06.850> back<00:07:07.090> might<00:07:07.479> get

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 
going to be good the back might get

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.110 
going to be good the back might get
scratched<00:07:07.870> up<00:07:08.139> it's<00:07:08.350> pretty<00:07:08.560> resistant<00:07:09.250> but

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
scratched up it's pretty resistant but

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.909 
scratched up it's pretty resistant but
if<00:07:10.479> you<00:07:10.600> get<00:07:10.750> it<00:07:10.870> a<00:07:11.080> kitchen<00:07:11.620> knife<00:07:11.710> like<00:07:11.889> this

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 
if you get it a kitchen knife like this

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.920 
if you get it a kitchen knife like this
then<00:07:12.340> yeah<00:07:12.550> and<00:07:12.850> it<00:07:13.270> applies<00:07:13.539> much<00:07:13.750> pressure

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930 
then yeah and it applies much pressure

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.659 
then yeah and it applies much pressure
as<00:07:14.110> I<00:07:14.199> did<00:07:14.380> you'll<00:07:14.830> get<00:07:15.010> some<00:07:15.220> light<00:07:15.460> light

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:15.669 
as I did you'll get some light light

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.580 
as I did you'll get some light light
scratches<00:07:16.150> and<00:07:16.300> then<00:07:16.750> like<00:07:16.930> I<00:07:16.960> said<00:07:17.080> on<00:07:17.410> these

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
scratches and then like I said on these

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.610 
scratches and then like I said on these
edges<00:07:18.780> you're<00:07:19.780> bound<00:07:20.050> to<00:07:20.139> see<00:07:20.199> some<00:07:20.500> scribe

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
edges you're bound to see some scribe

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.350 
edges you're bound to see some scribe
actually<00:07:20.919> well<00:07:21.310> tried<00:07:21.610> to<00:07:21.820> see<00:07:22.000> is<00:07:22.060> how

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 
actually well tried to see is how

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.600 
actually well tried to see is how
vulnerable<00:07:23.110> it<00:07:23.410> is<00:07:23.530> by<00:07:23.740> doing<00:07:24.070> the<00:07:24.250> key<00:07:24.370> so<00:07:24.520> the

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
vulnerable it is by doing the key so the

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:32.100 
vulnerable it is by doing the key so the
key<00:07:24.789> you<00:07:25.150> know<00:07:25.270> shouldn't<00:07:25.599> be<00:07:25.750> that<00:07:25.930> bad<00:07:31.110> all

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.110 
key you know shouldn't be that bad all

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.629 
key you know shouldn't be that bad all
right<00:07:32.229> so<00:07:32.410> you<00:07:32.500> can<00:07:32.620> see<00:07:32.770> the<00:07:32.919> markings<00:07:33.310> on<00:07:33.490> on

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 
right so you can see the markings on on

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:34.920 
right so you can see the markings on on
this<00:07:33.820> part<00:07:34.090> but<00:07:34.210> I<00:07:34.240> think<00:07:34.419> that<00:07:34.539> wipes<00:07:34.750> off

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
this part but I think that wipes off

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.180 
this part but I think that wipes off
yeah<00:07:35.530> so<00:07:35.680> it<00:07:35.770> wipes<00:07:35.949> off<00:07:36.130> and<00:07:36.490> I<00:07:37.919> don't<00:07:38.919> really

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.190 
yeah so it wipes off and I don't really

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.939 
yeah so it wipes off and I don't really
see<00:07:39.610> anything<00:07:40.060> actually<00:07:40.389> no<00:07:40.630> I<00:07:40.840> do<00:07:41.020> yep<00:07:41.740> even

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:41.949 
see anything actually no I do yep even

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:44.909 
see anything actually no I do yep even
with<00:07:42.580> the<00:07:42.669> key<00:07:42.880> you<00:07:43.599> can<00:07:43.720> see<00:07:43.900> scratches<00:07:44.530> here

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:44.919 
with the key you can see scratches here

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:48.029 
with the key you can see scratches here
on<00:07:45.039> the<00:07:45.130> edges<00:07:45.370> so<00:07:45.550> you<00:07:46.289> know<00:07:47.289> it's<00:07:47.949> a

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:48.039 
on the edges so you know it's a

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:50.939 
on the edges so you know it's a
beautiful<00:07:48.190> phone<00:07:48.580> I<00:07:48.880> would<00:07:49.240> love<00:07:49.419> to<00:07:49.770> hold<00:07:50.770> it

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:50.949 
beautiful phone I would love to hold it

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.760 
beautiful phone I would love to hold it
or<00:07:51.099> use<00:07:51.520> it<00:07:51.729> without<00:07:51.940> a<00:07:52.120> case<00:07:52.389> but<00:07:53.050> maybe<00:07:53.650> a

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:53.770 
or use it without a case but maybe a

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.149 
or use it without a case but maybe a
case<00:07:54.010> is<00:07:54.159> worth<00:07:54.400> investing<00:07:54.909> in<00:07:54.940> because<00:07:56.159> it

00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:57.159 
case is worth investing in because it

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:58.920 
case is worth investing in because it
can<00:07:57.460> get<00:07:57.610> scratched<00:07:57.880> up<00:07:58.060> especially<00:07:58.780> along

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:00.610 
these edges because it scratches pretty
