00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.689
 psv is a favorite in the battle for it 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.269
 national championship and tomorrow evening on 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.470
 paper also in the cup match in eindhoven 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.240
 why did you get a good result 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.490
 books 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.920
 how confident we are in ourselves 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.050
 have it green by 2006 on Sunday 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.010
 play team somewhere and show what we 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.449
 being able 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.490
 we have 20 make a very difficult one 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.050
 maybe have to win that match 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.330
 why then would not be able to use psv 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.980
 to win there is a tip or after the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.119
 dead tomorrow night between 3 and 5 pm 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.119
 17,000 people are sitting 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.920
 think a benefit if you get out of stuff 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.660
 strautmann in eindhoven is also present 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.430
 and just like here him well then me 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.020
 To forget that there are only 17,000 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.760
 person 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.320
 You have a substantial part of this 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.450
 season missed by that injury 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.190
 just a moment Lamprou you can replace you 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.550
 and put the finger on why it until now 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.579
 to 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.070
 in away games and psv twente ajax in 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.390
 the competition has not yet gone well 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.090
 because they impose most difficult finger 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.739
 and we just don't have it as a team there 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.749
 I think I played well 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.770
 the spaces where at that time were too 

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:10.109
 great 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.579
 when you see that the top teams which 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.560
 just play well and I think it is 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.959
 want to be there tomorrow or have to 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.159
 it also has good standing that is what 

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:18.749
 your first Sunday your goods 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.399
 our lines stay close together 

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:22.979
 put one pressure goes another measure do there 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.389
 you then on the moods we have without 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.709
 own as a team also plays to one again 

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:27.569
 have not done it 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.459
 no then you can keep the middle lines short 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.950
 are short of each other so that we are just whole 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.539
 good football then another question 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.279
 and where you are as a football player 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.389
 part of that competition part 

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:37.770
 from football but in that 

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:39.229
 soccer de seems to be the cup tournament 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.969
 becoming less and less interesting 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.200
 while whatever the clichÃ©s go on 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.119
 let go the shortest way to europe 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.669
 will be the final in their own stadium how 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.649
 do you follow how you stand in that discussion 

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:51.179
 tangible prize last year we are 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.939
 peaceful orders also very nice but that is 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.859
 no tangible prices to the can it me 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.439
 week is with tangible prices 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.909
 we now go with will just be full for him 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.889
 to play the final here in the cockpit 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.409
 to win that so we also have to go for it 

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:07.529
 psv we the lights this really busy there 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.019
 find you at and be a lawyer 

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:12.969
 maybe maybe 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.599
 they think I do not quite knvb cup 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.400
 interesting 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.769
 they really want to become champions and the doe 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.450
 is all for one we just want 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.650
 a good result all said yes go now 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.459
 also into the field to the match 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.799
 to win 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.060
 even though nice parties are how was 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.599
 think on your most dangerous weapon 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.310
 It is difficult to say in advance that I think 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.780
 team was just really good very cool 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.909
 compact play that's very important 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.200
 and that is our strength 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.239
 is it for you personally 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.060
 more important because you were good on Sunday 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.709
 you were certain against twente in the arena 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.150
 not bad not very good but but 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.010
 many things went wrong if 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.389
 this is the waste in the team for you 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.519
 your important to own one 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.510
 deliver top performance 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.219
 Do you also want a match by a top 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.750
 delivering performance that everyone wants and 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.189
 we need that confirmation that we 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.629
 would rather look at you giving him that confirmation 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.310
 or needed for yourself 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.139
 no I mean I know what I can do and they 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.519
 know what i come here 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.379
 no of course i could also contest you 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.419
 do you just want to be his anyway 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.639
 that is not always possible but there is one 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.919
 strive because because to be able to 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.989
 but no i have that we establishment dino 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:13.319
 No need to put real can on match 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.319
 play
