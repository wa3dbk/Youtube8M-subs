here<00:00:19.439> approximately<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.369> think<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.550> was<00:00:20.640> 65

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210

million years ago a small crater hit

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.420 
million years ago a small crater hit
this<00:00:23.939> island<00:00:24.150> near<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:25.320> Fiji<00:00:25.800> obviously<00:00:26.369> it

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
this island near of Fiji obviously it

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.769 
this island near of Fiji obviously it
wasn't<00:00:26.550> called<00:00:26.760> Fiji<00:00:27.090> back<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.390> those<00:00:27.570> days

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
wasn't called Fiji back in those days

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.589 
wasn't called Fiji back in those days
and<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.470> performed<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.949> massive<00:00:29.460> crater<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and it performed that massive crater and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.990 
and it performed that massive crater and
as<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.800> see<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.399> whether<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.730> away<00:00:32.940> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
as you can see it is whether it away to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.420 
as you can see it is whether it away to
