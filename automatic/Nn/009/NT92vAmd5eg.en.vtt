 ap 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.879
 business drivers 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.349
 the jackets are white the shoes are white 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.929
 the summer may already be a bit over 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.310
 still look for the ultimate convertible 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.669
 and it becomes white 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.289
 and that's it 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.319
 this is the lamborghini 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:24.999
 can you be her culprit 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.810
 all investors the car of this moment 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 520 HP Italian madness 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.949
 incredible looks you have to look at 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.220
 finally 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.160
 the top speed 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
 you know what is alive 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.180
 it is actually the last achievement of the neighborhood dark clouds the man has 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.500
 actually with so few successful beautiful little signs that 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.660
 now owned by the audi that says mister doing dark clouds promoted 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.530
 is 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.140
 I see it as a degradation but the man may now have had it put on and off 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.470
 actually make Seattle a big success again 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.120
 and that actually a shame because 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.120
 look at what a scourge 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.160
 The great thing about this damiano is that we actually took it 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.230
 he is just so easy to reach 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.420
 what old has actually done is 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.310
 overpowering an incredibly useful one 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.590
 well roubaix look at it 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.060
 he was not injured we have 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.340
 two meters long and there is a victory 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.690
 the handlebars everything must be a this is a bit of attitude 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.970
 of course you can send the messages everywhere 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.920
 you have seen that necessary 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.200
 what does it matter 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.119
 it continues to do a lot and it failed 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.119

 the price of this per year the roadster will in the netherlands on dutch license plate 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.499
 well in excess of 230 thousand euros 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.559
 good afternoon 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.699
 its name justifies which options one of them is to reverse it 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:38.109
 to drive 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.339
 camera 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:41.629
 I'm really used to the vans 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.629
 but that is actually also perfect at work 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:51.740
 the hour jokes always in your bikini times this car is like so many were 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.799

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:06.140
 that is 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.140
 incredibly fastest bobjenac can't beat that 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.879
 and you must hear this project 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.519
 That teaches that the PSU is not constantly opposed anymore if you better long 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.379
 people like me 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.379
 but you only hear a little crazy 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.099
 when turning upstairs neighbors president has a so-called tarp 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:36.269
 lamborghini has its own making sure you get this old that is too 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.619
 can drive normally 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:41.449
 with normal buses run to more than 3,000 young people with 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.739
 exception of home burglaries 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.949
 threshold kester 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:51.699
 there is no blow to it because you just want to be above 3,000 rpm 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.699
 giving interest 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.029
 we have to get away quickly 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:03.029
 he was blown during the blow 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.930
 it is no longer running and more rarely has there been better control in the group 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.680
 only talked to each other in the eleventh and twelfth time 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.400
 this remains the king of emotion 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.629
