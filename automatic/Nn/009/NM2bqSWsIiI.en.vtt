00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
tank this is my first tank I've ever had

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.460 
tank this is my first tank I've ever had
and<00:00:19.970> pretty<00:00:20.970> much<00:00:21.119> got<00:00:21.359> obsessed<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.080> and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
and pretty much got obsessed with it and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.790 
and pretty much got obsessed with it and
wanted<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.250> do<00:00:23.430> every<00:00:23.760> upgrade<00:00:24.650> impossible

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
wanted to do every upgrade impossible

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.790 
wanted to do every upgrade impossible
so<00:00:26.490> over<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> last<00:00:27.210> six<00:00:27.510> months<00:00:27.599> I've<00:00:27.990> pretty

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.540 
so over the last six months I've pretty
much<00:00:28.890> done<00:00:29.510> anything<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.840> think<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
much done anything I can think of to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.280 
much done anything I can think of to
really<00:00:32.550> make<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.329> tank<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> best<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.230> be

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
really make this tank the best it can be

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.830 
really make this tank the best it can be
so<00:00:35.059> basically<00:00:36.059> first<00:00:36.329> two<00:00:36.510> things<00:00:36.719> you'll

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
so basically first two things you'll

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.200 
so basically first two things you'll
notice<00:00:36.989> right<00:00:37.730> there<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.910> is

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
notice right there it is

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.889 
notice right there it is
the<00:00:39.780> JBJ<00:00:40.260> nano<00:00:40.530> cubed<00:00:40.950> 28<00:00:41.399> gallon<00:00:41.899> two

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the JBJ nano cubed 28 gallon two

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.869 
the JBJ nano cubed 28 gallon two
differences<00:00:43.530> right<00:00:44.219> off<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.489> bat<00:00:44.670> you'll

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
differences right off the bat you'll

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.049 
differences right off the bat you'll
notice<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:46.230> filtration<00:00:47.190> system<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.789> comes

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
notice the filtration system that comes

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.740 
notice the filtration system that comes
with<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> tank

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
with the tank

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.619 
with the tank
obviously<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> completely<00:00:50.039> ripped<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.399> off

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
obviously I completely ripped that off

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.880 
obviously I completely ripped that off
got<00:00:51.629> rid<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.379> wanted<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> run<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
got rid of it because I wanted to run a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.689 
got rid of it because I wanted to run a
sump<00:00:53.250> refugium<00:00:54.620> which<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> PVC

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
sump refugium which you can see the PVC

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.910 
sump refugium which you can see the PVC
pipe<00:00:56.940> leading<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.570> into<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.410> sump<00:00:58.680> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
pipe leading down into the the sump and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.650 
pipe leading down into the the sump and
I'll<00:00:59.129> show<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.730> minute

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
I'll show you that in a minute

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.340 
I'll show you that in a minute

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the second thing is the canopy I removed

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.710 
the second thing is the canopy I removed
that<00:01:04.500> obviously<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.850> wanted<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:06.540> rid<00:01:06.689> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that obviously I wanted to get rid of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.230 
that obviously I wanted to get rid of
the<00:01:07.010> stock<00:01:08.010> lighting<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> came<00:01:09.210> with

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the stock lighting that it came with

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.200 
the stock lighting that it came with
here's<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> canopy<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.939> don't<00:01:11.939> know<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.119> I'm

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
here's the canopy I don't know what I'm

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.090 
here's the canopy I don't know what I'm
gonna<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.720> maybe<00:01:12.930> someone<00:01:13.619> needs<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
gonna do with it maybe someone needs to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.490 
gonna do with it maybe someone needs to
buy<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> canopy<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.200> went<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
buy a canopy and then I went with a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.530 
buy a canopy and then I went with a
Viper<00:01:17.780> 150<00:01:18.780> watt<00:01:19.020> metal<00:01:19.799> halide<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:21.420> can

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
Viper 150 watt metal halide as you can

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.990 
Viper 150 watt metal halide as you can
see<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> built-in<00:01:22.229> fan<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:23.000> really

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
see with the built-in fan which really

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.940 
see with the built-in fan which really
works<00:01:24.270> great<00:01:24.600> gives<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.140> lot<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.320> light<00:01:25.439> doesn't

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
works great gives a lot of light doesn't

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.700 
works great gives a lot of light doesn't
add<00:01:26.070> too<00:01:26.250> much<00:01:26.369> heat<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> tank<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.619> this<00:01:28.619> is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
add too much heat to the tank so this is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.710 
add too much heat to the tank so this is
my<00:01:28.799> tank<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.700> metal<00:01:29.939> halides<00:01:30.240> not<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.570> right

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
my tank the metal halides not on right

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.490 
my tank the metal halides not on right
now<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> set<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:32.030> LEDs<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.500> just

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
now I just have a set of LEDs that just

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.450 
now I just have a set of LEDs that just
make<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.369> nice<00:01:36.409> nice<00:01:37.409> lighting<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.159> tank

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
make a nice nice lighting for the tank

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.510 
make a nice nice lighting for the tank
to<00:01:38.670> view<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.689> keep<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.310> about<00:01:41.310> 10

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to view and I keep that on about 10

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280 
to view and I keep that on about 10
hours<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.850> day<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> metal

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
hours a day and then I have the metal

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.319 
hours a day and then I have the metal
halide<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.770> about<00:01:44.009> 6<00:01:44.280> hours<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.579> day<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.090> I

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
halide on about 6 hours a day so I

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.609 
halide on about 6 hours a day so I
wanted<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.229> show<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:48.619> really

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
wanted to show you this this is really

I was gonna do a a deep sand bed
pretty<00:02:14.610> much<00:02:14.760> my<00:02:14.969> nitrates<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.510> phosphates

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
pretty much my nitrates and phosphates

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.170 
pretty much my nitrates and phosphates
have<00:02:16.079> been<00:02:16.230> at<00:02:16.349> zero<00:02:16.709> since<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:17.489> started<00:02:17.969> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
have been at zero since I started the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.819 
have been at zero since I started the
tanks<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.629> didn't<00:02:18.840> really<00:02:19.019> feel<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.290> need<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.680> do

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
tanks I didn't really feel a need to do

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.520 
tanks I didn't really feel a need to do
a<00:02:19.859> deep<00:02:20.340> sand<00:02:20.640> bed<00:02:21.140> here<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.349> last

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
a deep sand bed here the last

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.869 
a deep sand bed here the last
compartment<00:02:23.189> just<00:02:23.750> have<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.930> reactor<00:02:25.439> here

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
compartment just have this reactor here

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.039 
compartment just have this reactor here
pretty<00:02:26.879> much<00:02:27.000> removes<00:02:27.359> all<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.569> phosphates

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
pretty much removes all the phosphates

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.990 
pretty much removes all the phosphates
on<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.319> water<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.980> then<00:02:29.400> obviously<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:29.849> have<00:02:29.970> a

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.009 
on the water and then obviously I have a
return<00:02:30.390> pump<00:02:30.629> running<00:02:30.930> also<00:02:31.859> just<00:02:32.129> added<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
return pump running also just added the

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.089 
return pump running also just added the
JBJ<00:02:34.340> auto<00:02:35.340> top<00:02:35.700> off<00:02:35.909> got<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.019> sensor<00:02:37.530> yeah

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
JBJ auto top off got the sensor yeah

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.770 
JBJ auto top off got the sensor yeah
that's<00:02:38.250> way<00:02:38.430> too<00:02:38.459> dark<00:02:38.819> but<00:02:39.030> sensors<00:02:39.569> right

there sex when the water level gets too
low<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:43.099> takes<00:02:44.099> out<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.579> bin<00:02:44.849> I've<00:02:45.299> got

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
low and takes out of this bin I've got

goes right over here and feeds right
back<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.169> the<00:03:04.290> tank<00:03:04.560> right<00:03:05.040> there

like I said my nitrates and phosphates
are<00:03:36.660> down<00:03:37.370> gonna<00:03:38.370> be<00:03:38.490> adding<00:03:38.820> some<00:03:39.290> SPS<00:03:40.290> here

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
are down gonna be adding some SPS here

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.470 
are down gonna be adding some SPS here
soon<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.190> I'll<00:03:41.550> actually<00:03:41.790> do<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> separate

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480

video
you<00:03:44.490> know<00:03:44.610> once<00:03:44.820> my<00:03:44.970> stuff<00:03:45.210> starts<00:03:45.450> growing

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
you know once my stuff starts growing

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
and once I have the SPS and they're all

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.020 
and once I have the SPS and they're all
do<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.030> second<00:03:48.570> video<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.230> actually<00:03:49.350> show

water comes in goes down into the sump
just<00:03:59.940> a<00:04:00.000> gravity-fed<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:03.020> paint<00:04:04.020> it<00:04:04.170> black<00:04:04.380> just

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
just a gravity-fed I paint it black just
