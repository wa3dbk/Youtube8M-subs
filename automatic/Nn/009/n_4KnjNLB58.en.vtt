 we have it here in the front 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.649

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.390
 ancient neo geo here is what it is like 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.119
 the special edition tells us that we 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.210
 bring a memory card with the game 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.520

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.740
 back tells us about the 20 games that 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.380
 brings us on the memory card as 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.620
 the metal slug the fatal fury and a lot 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.329
 of recreational classics and here was a 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.430
 little information about also what 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.160
 contains the box as the console itself 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.480
 portable the dock to be able to charge it and 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.380
 play on television 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.480
 the typical arcade control of the neo geo 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.550
 well, inside the box we have 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.019
 these two small boxes we are going to leave 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.509
 is here 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.219
 and a rather curious detail is that in 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:13.360
 the sticker in the zeal they bring us 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:16.649
 It has the original logo of the business 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.649
 to open it or is it that brings here 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.490
 Well, here we have the electric arcade 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.049
 the mind not here the ninja game 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.420
 master who comes on board 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.320
 memory 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.100
 the power connector and around here the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.530
 typical rca cable of three colors good 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.399
 already here we have the second box we are going to 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.399
 open the time you have 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.770
 here we have a bag with the manual 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.500
 of instructions that includes the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.189
 Castilian and the HDMI cable to be able 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.189
 play on TV 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.830
 for life 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.390
 here comes the protected console in 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.050
 this bag 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.409
 and finally the 2 to load the console 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.119
 and be able to use it on our TV 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.619
 Well here we are the console 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.420
 true that it has a pretty design 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.180
 solid we are seeing that it has a 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.340
 finished in glossy black and here then 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.770
 has all the action buttons the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.230
 joystick that is very similar touch to 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.020
 to the arcade stick that comes with the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.810
 console here on the top we 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.069
 come the yerres buttons the connector 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.130
 usb and hdmi for the video output of the 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.220
 dock here in the back comes to us 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.390
 the Seneca logo in silver and goes 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.940
 coated like one of a rubber here 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.250
 in the bottom part, we have to 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.650
 control the volume the brightness and a 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.330
 jack connector for our headphones 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.120
 and here we have 2 as we are 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.760
 seeing is almost identical to the original neo 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.850
 geo, as you can see, they have a lot of detail 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.700
 as the descriptions and the theme of the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.220
 cartridges also have the button on the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.660
 top part simply has the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.960
 current connection 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.970
 output to / v and hdmi and in the part of 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.250
 forward the connector to turn on and 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.980
 turn off the connector for both 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.350
 players that in this case is usb and what 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.870
 most important of this device if you 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.910
 we give this button the dock opens and 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.280
 here we can enter our console 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.590
 or to charge it or to enjoy 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.230
 our game on our TV and by 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.910
 last here we have the arcade stick that 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.100
 will make us enjoy the most of 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.860
 our recreational games for the 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.920
 neo geo x work has pretty design 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.390
 solid and touch as much as steve 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.000
 like the buttons is pretty 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.250
 nice and in this case unlike 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.280
 of the original neo geo connects via 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.620
 usb good no doubt this is about a 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.380
 edition for nostalgic and is that the neo 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.120
 geo here cold brings us 20 games in its 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.030
 internal memory and gives us the possibility 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.040
 of either playing it on the laptop itself 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.050
 or thanks to the device that we have 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.330
 seen or use our TV as if 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.940
 it was a home console also 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.500
 brings us the joystick to enjoy 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.370
 to the best of our game 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.590
 recreational 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.250
 good but you liked the video and 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.250
