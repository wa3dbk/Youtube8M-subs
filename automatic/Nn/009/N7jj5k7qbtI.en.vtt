that's such as the 50 cent to sync

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.869 
that's such as the 50 cent to sync
audios<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.079> type<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.350> plastic<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.700> is

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
audios and that type of plastic this is

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.680 
audios and that type of plastic this is
made<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.329> lighter<00:00:48.629> cheaper<00:00:48.960> plastic<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
made of a lighter cheaper plastic and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.560 
made of a lighter cheaper plastic and
the<00:00:51.690> cushion<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.500> made<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.489> material<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.360> I

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the cushion is made of material so I

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.689 
the cushion is made of material so I
don't<00:00:54.750> think<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.350> ideal<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.399> gym

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
don't think you to be ideal for the gym

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.080 
don't think you to be ideal for the gym
work<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.480> any<00:00:57.660> kind<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.370> exercise<00:00:59.370> where<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
work or any kind of exercise where you

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.200 
work or any kind of exercise where you
do<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> lot<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.629> sweating<00:01:01.730> so<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> guess<00:01:03.030> that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
do a lot of sweating so I guess that

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.160 
do a lot of sweating so I guess that
wouldn't<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.600> noise<00:01:03.870> isolation<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:06.170> these

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
wouldn't be noise isolation and these

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.320 
wouldn't be noise isolation and these
are<00:01:07.320> pretty<00:01:07.619> loud<00:01:07.950> headphones<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.119> they're

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
are pretty loud headphones and they're

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
are pretty loud headphones and they're
supposed<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> bass<00:01:10.320> extended

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
supposed to be the bass extended

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.280 
supposed to be the bass extended
response<00:01:12.260> headphones<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:15.360> bass<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.810> real

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
response headphones but the bass is real

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.679
