00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
shades go from light to dark and so they

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.110 
shades go from light to dark and so they
all<00:03:10.900> have<00:03:11.140> good<00:03:11.290> pigmentation<00:03:12.030> but<00:03:13.030> the

all have good pigmentation but the
strength<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.510> color<00:03:13.720> will<00:03:13.930> really<00:03:14.170> depend<00:03:14.350> on

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
strength of color will really depend on

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.040 
strength of color will really depend on
which<00:03:15.010> color<00:03:15.310> you're<00:03:15.550> getting<00:03:15.700> they<00:03:16.630> do<00:03:16.690> all

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
from the original line is that they do a

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.410 
from the original line is that they do a
