great okay we got our second half of our
butter<00:02:57.120> going<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.690> didn't<00:02:58.170> forget<00:02:58.440> to

butter going in I didn't forget to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.240 
butter going in I didn't forget to
mention<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.190> unsalted<00:02:59.850> butter<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:01.620> nice

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
that would be something without a lot of

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.670 
that would be something without a lot of
water<00:03:06.750> added<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:08.519> it's<00:03:09.269> really

water added to it that it's it's really

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.000 
water added to it that it's it's really
good<00:03:10.709> butter<00:03:11.280> fat<00:03:11.720> in<00:03:12.720> there<00:03:13.049> we'll<00:03:13.650> get<00:03:13.829> this

incorporated<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.150> then<00:03:15.570> it's<00:03:16.140> time<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.500> set

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
incorporated and then it's time to set

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.180 
incorporated and then it's time to set
our<00:03:16.920> timer<00:03:17.220> all<00:03:18.030> right<00:03:18.209> our<00:03:18.390> butter<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.810> all

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
our timer all right our butter is all

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.220 
our timer all right our butter is all
incorporated<00:03:20.190> there<00:03:20.579> I'm<00:03:21.540> gonna<00:03:21.750> keep<00:03:22.019> this

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
incorporated there I'm gonna keep this

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.680 
incorporated there I'm gonna keep this
on<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.470> heat<00:03:22.859> for<00:03:23.000> approximately<00:03:24.000> 10<00:03:24.299> minutes

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
on the heat for approximately 10 minutes

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.140 
on the heat for approximately 10 minutes
now<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.530> I'm<00:03:25.920> gonna<00:03:26.070> keep<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.640> watch<00:03:26.820> on<00:03:27.090> it

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
now and I'm gonna keep a watch on it

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.990 
now and I'm gonna keep a watch on it
here<00:03:27.540> keep<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.989> stirring<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:29.160> what's<00:03:29.790> gonna

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
here keep this stirring and what's gonna

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.270 
here keep this stirring and what's gonna
happen<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.660> our<00:03:30.900> little<00:03:31.739> mixture<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.100> gonna

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
happen is our little mixture is gonna

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.479 
happen is our little mixture is gonna
start<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.670> turn<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.120> little<00:03:33.359> bit<00:03:33.570> lighter<00:03:33.900> and

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
start to turn a little bit lighter and

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.699 
start to turn a little bit lighter and
thicken<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:36.450> will<00:03:36.660> take<00:03:36.900> about<00:03:37.350> 10

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
thicken and that will take about 10

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.440 
thicken and that will take about 10
minutes<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.310> then<00:03:38.370> at<00:03:38.579> that<00:03:38.730> point<00:03:38.790> it'll<00:03:39.329> be

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
minutes and then at that point it'll be

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.789 
minutes and then at that point it'll be
ready<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.989> take<00:03:40.350> off<00:03:40.590> strain<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.579> cool<00:03:42.799> we've

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
ready to take off strain and cool we've

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.830 
ready to take off strain and cool we've
now<00:03:43.980> been<00:03:44.190> on<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.549> stove<00:03:44.820> here<00:03:44.850> 10<00:03:45.420> minutes

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
now been on the stove here 10 minutes

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.530 
now been on the stove here 10 minutes
and<00:03:46.049> you<00:03:46.200> can<00:03:46.440> see<00:03:46.739> how<00:03:47.040> it's<00:03:47.420> thickened<00:03:48.420> up

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
and you can see how it's thickened up

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.300 
and you can see how it's thickened up
and<00:03:49.730> lightened<00:03:50.730> up<00:03:50.880> looks<00:03:51.840> really<00:03:52.230> good<00:03:52.440> need

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
and lightened up looks really good need

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.490 
and lightened up looks really good need
to<00:03:53.459> take<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.850> off<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.000> heat<00:03:54.329> now<00:03:54.359> and<00:03:55.230> we're

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
to take it off the heat now and we're

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.270 
to take it off the heat now and we're
gonna<00:03:55.560> run<00:03:55.859> it<00:03:56.010> through<00:03:56.220> our<00:03:56.609> sieve<00:03:57.980> all<00:03:58.980> that

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
gonna run it through our sieve all that

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.040 
gonna run it through our sieve all that
time<00:03:59.640> on<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.510> heat<00:04:01.069> has<00:04:02.069> allowed<00:04:03.060> that

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
time on the heat has allowed that

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.430 
time on the heat has allowed that
well<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:05.070> zest<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:08.040> infuse<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:09.390> flavor<00:04:09.720> into

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
well that zest to infuse the flavor into

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.430 
well that zest to infuse the flavor into
this<00:04:10.590> mixture<00:04:11.010> here<00:04:11.300> now<00:04:12.300> we're<00:04:12.510> gonna<00:04:12.630> strain

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
this mixture here now we're gonna strain

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.140 
this mixture here now we're gonna strain
out<00:04:13.520> most<00:04:14.520> of<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.820> zest<00:04:15.320> also<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.830> saw<00:04:17.670> a<00:04:17.700> seed

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
out most of the zest also I saw a seed

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.810 
out most of the zest also I saw a seed
or<00:04:18.330> two<00:04:18.510> floating<00:04:19.200> in<00:04:19.380> there<00:04:19.560> lemon<00:04:19.980> seed<00:04:20.220> that

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
or two floating in there lemon seed that

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.030 
or two floating in there lemon seed that
have<00:04:20.940> made<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.180> through<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.720> lemon<00:04:22.590> juicer

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
have made it through the lemon juicer

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.300 
have made it through the lemon juicer
that's<00:04:23.640> okay<00:04:23.940> because<00:04:24.150> we're<00:04:24.570> gonna<00:04:25.320> get<00:04:26.130> that

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
that's okay because we're gonna get that

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.070 
that's okay because we're gonna get that
