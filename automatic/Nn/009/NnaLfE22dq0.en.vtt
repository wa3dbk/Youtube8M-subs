00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.130
 america for myself for many people saves the center of a social 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.780
 live the extremely large shopping centers that are everywhere in the suburbs of the cities 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.759
 to be found 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.650
 so it is also the turn of the Netherlands, because in tilburg the largest is a mega 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.970
 shopping center of the Netherlands and not everyone is happy with that 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.800
 retailers in the center of tilburg are afraid that the inner cities will become 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800
 drained by those new shopping paradises 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.869
 6 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.339
 next 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.440
 3 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.900
 that is anything but a name recognition of the 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.559
 appeal of our city 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.090
 really big but it involves millions of visitors 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.660
 all shopkeepers trainings are against the arrival of the basket goes in the netherlands 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.559
 could escape and the question is indeed 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.379
 where does it go and countries and 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.970
 as far as we are concerned brabant 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.130
 and fantastic blackpool there 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.900
 and when you get there it will come 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.990
 in tilburg near the efteling behind this work on a former 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.380
 defense field 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.570
 The largest shopping center in the Netherlands is planned 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.800
 or as it is called in america 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.900
 the project developer lights up 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.960
 this is how it should be 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.110
 beh and what you see you actually see one and the green hill 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.730
 and under that green hill you are shopping in two days so you irish it 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.020
 stores come out to for example the actually they say as 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.750
 you play a role 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.990
 not too big makes nice on the square meanwhile 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.490
 then it does have to be whole 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.970
 positive meaning for on purpose 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.930
 and also of image for the environment very large employment effect five hundred 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.540
 up to 3,000 jobs 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.829
 the nice thing about it 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.079
 such a green hill is of course if you can organize all activities 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.719
 for example you see a place in the open air theater but I can 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.899
 you also provide paths governments will also be cycling routes the government you 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.380
 let someone make an investment of 400 million 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.430
 is important to 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.970
 well pass your nose with so many jobs that is so worried 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.210
 be irresponsible in addition to being played 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.280
 well then in that consideration and 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.390
 that gamemaker would be the culprit after the summer it is here that you see a place where 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.829
 you 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.029
 what I can do with pedal boats 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.820
 You can see some bytsje volleyball 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.819
 so this is pretty much the city beach from tilburg 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.730
 that is a new experience it is complete and inspiration for us 2 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.910
 keywords 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.299
 it is indeed real 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.400
 combination of the store and nice day out 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:30.579
 in the new shopping experience they call it 250 stores an area of ​​fifteen 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:31.409
 soccer fields 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:36.030
 a mega project in march and june in the Brabant country of tilburg in the 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:40.829
 shopping center after three days at the bos eindhoven and helmond de net 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.620
 And the most important conclusion is actually it's the wrong man on the 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.039
 wrong place 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:51.259
 alderman pali uit den bosch has with his colleagues from the other cities and 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:55.040
 own an investigation into the effect of such a mall 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.290
 The conclusion of the research is that we asked two questions about it 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.349
 the authority the costs of the mole 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.019
 in straw hands to the files store structure in Brabant and has it 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.629
 an added value 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.819
 and also with very clear answers the answer no 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.259
 the forest set beautiful historic center and pedagogue we have all kinds of activities 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.749
 you can recognize big by breda de bavelse berg 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.809
 between Eindhoven and a hive that has never been said 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.709
 furniture boulevards hardware stores 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.259
 that idea was based on own strength 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.779
 And now you happen to happen once you have come around in the fake area 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:28.659
 country location is obvious 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.849
 and now everyone in tilburg is taking the win with investigations and that is allowed 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:33.909
 not 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.269
 but in those other places they are terrified that the public will soon be gone 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.879
 stays out of their inner cities 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.879
 and stores must close due to lack of customers 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.099
 43 percent less revenue 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.099
 tomorrow is the absolute draw of the city center 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.839
 the subject matter experts and luckily to each other stop a talk about one like that 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:58.959
 draft relapse 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.499
 of more than 10 percent 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:04.590
 of this sustainable development sustainable development is disastrous for the 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.209
 inner city 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.299
 and the shopkeepers in tilburg think so too 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:14.219
 as under and bobby jindal water surface, the center will be total in five years 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.969
 different as we see now 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.749
 he disappeared for a trainer without prejudice 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:21.299
 take place during the renovation 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.000
 and in particular a few weeks ago it stopped because they just didn't 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.680
 more able to strongholds 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.300
 that sounds dramatic but the time has come 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.409
 history is always on the move, as history teaches 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.740
 mega mall is not just another step in shopping 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.150
 here you look at the opening of the beehive in 19 26 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.590
 twitter has developed very dynamically very quickly 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.590
 the peddler beijer used to come to your home 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.199
 for daddy and drew a house in it 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.849
 of course there were already shops but then you suddenly had everything at the bottom under one 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.009
 roof 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.139
 around 19 50 hit in Dutch supermarkets 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.159
 or, for example, also competing with the grocery market and supermarkets 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:12.099
 so there is always a whole series in the ring 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.240
 in the shops 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.710
 we should not be so afraid of that innovation, says gerard zandbergen 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.969
 he collects information about stores in the Netherlands and Belgium 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.360
 in the netherlands are very quickly 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:28.330
 I think that's it 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.840
 People have more driving especially for that 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.400
 to experience the mole's experience 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.320
 we are particularly against the man because it will be more of the same 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.360
 only bigger bigger and more free 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.179
 monster if they happen the american say year 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.479
 I'm not so fond of it 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.939
 yes, because I am once again extra on a hernia 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.610
 yes when he and the record finish after playing differently 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.139
 the hague anp the netherlands is a bronze medal 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.699
 and yes if it is no longer sit that appears from a broadcast I am driving 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.550
 I believed mall would go 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.539
 has agents 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:04.410
 after the loss 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.800
 too fast for socializing and I think we should what we want 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.800
 less pleasant is that we have a nice fight again 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.369
 the new shopping center has a lot of jobs 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:20.029
 but the opponents say about the same amount disappear 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.080
 only the moss sensor valve turns out to be talking about 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.509
 15 among places because you are not just talking about people no beautiful 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:29.919
 nice shops from 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.889
 but also everything that needs to be done with it from taxi drivers 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.259
 bus drivers yes I think what amazing city is being said 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.220
 he drops well and you come on it 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.650
 competition is bad yes or no 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.540
 then in my opinion competition is not bad competition means whole 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.139
 very often that the consumer benefits from being in downtown tilburg 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.830
 as in the past often too many players do it not just for the branch 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.550
 the bride 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.159
 If it is mainly small independent retailers and there are people who do it 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:57.740
 a nice thing to go shopping 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.470
 are the currants in the porridge of 15 and especially the small retailers who are small 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.030
 Self-employed people debate all stores that are the ones that hit the biggest 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.099
 are going to get as if when we come 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:08.409
 according to a day out 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:10.069
 this kind of a fraction park 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:11.339
 fairytale forest for
