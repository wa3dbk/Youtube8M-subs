00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.610 
wavelength it has two wavelengths that
give<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.789> additional<00:01:00.030> skin<00:01:00.780> tightening<00:01:01.350> it's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
give you additional skin tightening it's

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.650 
give you additional skin tightening it's
also<00:01:01.770> more<00:01:02.190> powerful<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> first

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
also more powerful so it's the first

fda-approved<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.920> laser<00:01:05.220> system<00:01:05.549> that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
fda-approved a laser system that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.910 
fda-approved a laser system that
combines<00:01:06.330> two<00:01:06.659> different<00:01:06.689> wavelengths<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
combines two different wavelengths you

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.770 
combines two different wavelengths you
can<00:01:08.100> blend<00:01:08.369> them<00:01:08.610> together<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.420> use<00:01:09.630> them

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
can blend them together you can use them

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.420 
can blend them together you can use them
independently<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.799> gives<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> lot<00:01:11.220> more

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
independently so it gives you a lot more

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.710 
independently so it gives you a lot more

traditional liposuction but they just
need<00:01:42.060> more<00:01:42.090> contouring<00:01:43.049> tightening<00:01:43.680> those

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
need more contouring tightening those

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.069 
need more contouring tightening those
kinds<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.310> things<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> laser

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
kinds of things and so with the laser

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.050 
kinds of things and so with the laser
takes<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.829> little<00:01:46.950> longer<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.670> takes<00:01:47.880> a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
takes a little longer and it takes a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.819 
takes a little longer and it takes a
little<00:01:48.180> more<00:01:48.299> skill<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.079> these<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
little more skill to do these but you

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.590 
little more skill to do these but you
get<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> much<00:01:50.340> better<00:01:50.579> outcome<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.479> have

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
get a much better outcome and you have

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.300 
get a much better outcome and you have
very<00:01:51.840> little<00:01:52.140> recovery<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.070> very

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
very little recovery you have very

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.370 
very little recovery you have very
little<00:01:53.430> post-op<00:01:53.850> pain<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.659> results<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.229> just

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
little post-op pain the results are just

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.350 
little post-op pain the results are just
so<00:01:55.829> much<00:01:55.979> better<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.490> somebody<00:01:56.759> who<00:01:57.090> really

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
so much better for somebody who really

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600 
so much better for somebody who really
is<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.899> good<00:01:58.350> candidate<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:58.740> smart<00:01:59.009> lipo<00:01:59.189> if

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
is a good candidate for smart lipo if

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.789 
is a good candidate for smart lipo if
you<00:01:59.729> remove<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.119> fat<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:00.810> their<00:02:01.409> underlying

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
you remove the fat then their underlying

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.219 
you remove the fat then their underlying
muscles<00:02:02.399> are<00:02:02.700> much<00:02:02.909> more<00:02:03.119> obvious<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.049> so

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
muscles are much more obvious and so

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.380 
muscles are much more obvious and so
with<00:02:04.439> Ron<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.490> know<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.640> could<00:02:05.909> tell<00:02:06.119> he<00:02:06.270> had

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
with Ron you know you could tell he had

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.160 
with Ron you know you could tell he had
good<00:02:06.540> musculature

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
good musculature

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.199 
good musculature
he<00:02:07.409> just<00:02:07.649> didn't<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.520> didn't<00:02:08.819> show<00:02:09.000> because

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
he just didn't you didn't show because

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.040 
he just didn't you didn't show because
he<00:02:09.390> had

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
he had

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.690 
he had
out<00:02:10.140> over<00:02:10.320> that<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.950> basically<00:02:11.280> more<00:02:11.460> about

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
out over that it's basically more about

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.120 
out over that it's basically more about
high-definition<00:02:12.450> body<00:02:12.690> contouring<00:02:13.380> where<00:02:14.010> he

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
high-definition body contouring where he

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.260 
high-definition body contouring where he
really<00:02:14.340> wanted<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.700> able<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.940> see<00:02:15.090> his

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
really wanted to be able to see his

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.700 
really wanted to be able to see his
underlying<00:02:15.630> abdominal<00:02:16.200> muscles

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
underlying abdominal muscles

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.160 
underlying abdominal muscles
he<00:02:16.830> now<00:02:17.040> has<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.730> know<00:02:17.820> pretty<00:02:18.450> much<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.660> 6-pack

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
he now has you know pretty much a 6-pack

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.720 
he now has you know pretty much a 6-pack
they<00:02:19.410> don't<00:02:19.530> only<00:02:19.620> get<00:02:19.830> better<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.340> know

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
they don't only get better I just know

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.700 
they don't only get better I just know
you<00:02:21.150> know<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.270> look<00:02:21.510> great<00:02:21.750> not<00:02:21.990> just<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.680> a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
you know I look great not just this is a

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.950 
you know I look great not just this is a
homerun
