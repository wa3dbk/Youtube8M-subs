what<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.589> up<00:00:07.710> YouTube<00:00:07.830> sharp<00:00:08.400> here<00:00:08.670> with

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
what is up YouTube sharp here with

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.870 
what is up YouTube sharp here with
another<00:00:09.300> step<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.019> easter<00:00:10.320> egg<00:00:10.440> on<00:00:10.880> shrink

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
another step of the easter egg on shrink

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.200 
another step of the easter egg on shrink
oola<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.950> for<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.880> probably<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
oola and for this this is probably the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.029 
oola and for this this is probably the
longest<00:00:15.360> up<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.170> hardest<00:00:16.529> step<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:16.949> had

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
longest up the hardest step that we had

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.370 
longest up the hardest step that we had
to<00:00:17.100> do<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.510> first<00:00:18.720> part<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.199> pretty

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
to do but the first part it's pretty

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.230 
to do but the first part it's pretty
easy<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.920> go<00:00:20.010> around<00:00:20.220> unite<00:00:20.760> these<00:00:20.970> little

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
easy just go around unite these little

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.349 
easy just go around unite these little
panels<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> wall<00:00:21.960> until<00:00:22.109> they<00:00:22.350> light<00:00:22.560> up

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
panels on the wall until they light up

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.640 
panels on the wall until they light up
direction<00:00:24.359> there's<00:00:24.750> actually<00:00:25.050> 12<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.500> them

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
direction there's actually 12 of them

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.170 
direction there's actually 12 of them
all<00:00:25.920> around<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.369> map<00:00:26.550> you're<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> see

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
all around the map you're going to see

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.759 
all around the map you're going to see
here<00:00:27.210> I'll<00:00:27.689> show<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.900> guys<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.140> couple<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.619> them

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
here I'll show you guys a couple of them

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.339 
here I'll show you guys a couple of them
I<00:00:29.039> actually<00:00:29.910> don't<00:00:30.269> show<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.170> don't

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
I actually don't show you like I don't

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.630 
I actually don't show you like I don't
record<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.949> whole<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.579> all<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.969> them<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:34.640> we

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
record the whole like all of them and we

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.040 
record the whole like all of them and we
actually<00:00:35.790> if<00:00:36.210> you're<00:00:36.329> watching<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> stream

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
actually if you're watching the stream

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.600 
actually if you're watching the stream
last<00:00:37.380> night<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.710> streamed<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> whole

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
last night we streamed this the whole

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.420 
last night we streamed this the whole
time<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.260> this<00:00:40.260> step<00:00:40.590> probably<00:00:41.010> took<00:00:41.160> us<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
time and this step probably took us a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.970 
time and this step probably took us a
couple<00:00:41.640> hours<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.899> because<00:00:43.079> after

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
couple hours to do just because after

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.060 
couple hours to do just because after
you<00:00:44.010> nice<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.550> things<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.030> panels<00:00:46.070> we

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
you nice the things on the panels we

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.740 
you nice the things on the panels we
figured<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.820> would<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.570> then

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
figured that it would do that and then

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.479 
figured that it would do that and then
you<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.260> I'd<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.440> done<00:00:49.770> they'd<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
you know I'd be done they'd be all you

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.260 
you know I'd be done they'd be all you
had<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:51.199> but<00:00:52.199> um<00:00:52.789> there's<00:00:53.789> something<00:00:53.879> else

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
had to do but um there's something else

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.180 
had to do but um there's something else
and<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.500> don't<00:00:55.739> complete<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and so you know you don't complete the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.279 
and so you know you don't complete the
step<00:00:56.579> unless<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.600> don't<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.930> complete

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
step unless you don't know you complete

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.810 
step unless you don't know you complete
the<00:00:58.410> step<00:00:58.620> until<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.980> power<00:00:59.160> comes<00:00:59.280> back<00:00:59.489> on

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the step until the power comes back on

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.869 
the step until the power comes back on
now<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> lights<00:01:00.690> come<00:01:00.899> back<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
now the lights come back on and so the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.280 
now the lights come back on and so the
lights<00:01:03.059> never<00:01:03.300> came<00:01:03.510> back<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.110> kept

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
lights never came back on we kept

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.980 
lights never came back on we kept
listening<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> radio<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.720> radio

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
listening to the radio and the radio
