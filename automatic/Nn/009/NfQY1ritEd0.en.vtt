00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello I am hurting fiddler and 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.300
 today I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.450
 ultra wide angle lens 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:16.500
 so the one I use the most is 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.699
 a practical 16 35 mm 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.080
 it's a zoom and 16 mm already offers a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:30.539
 field of view a field of view I believe 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.480
 a little over 90 degrees 94 degree which 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.050
 is already quite exceptional the problem 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.510
 is that a goal like that costs 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.360
 between 1000 and 1500 euros according to you 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.390
 buy it new or used 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.430
 so it's very expensive good quality but 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.340
 very expensive and if you want bigger 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.289
 the cannon 14 mm for example that more than 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.770
 2000 euros so the wide angle these are 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.760
 goals that are expensive until he 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.059
 there is little time 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.990
 a few months ago I bought this 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:12.080
 samyang look at the samyang it's a 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:17.369
 objective that is 14 mm and watch it 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.549
 a little the look that he has pretty gorgeous 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.720
 it's really very very very solid 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.759
 so there the samyang 14 mm is manufactured 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.340
 by a Korean company 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.509
 it's a goal that's very 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.350
 especially because they cost hold 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.259
 you hardly more than 300 euros to 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.540
 300 euros for a 14 mm is incredible 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.939
 I immediately bought to make 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.450
 real estate photographs 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:50.430
 of landscapes it is absolutely splendid 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:52.560
 so at 300 euros we have everything 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.560
 the same options as a goal like 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.939
 this one obviously not 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.700
 he has two things that will surprise 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.759
 a lot of the generation that used to 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.070
 to automatic crowd goals 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.750
 the first thing is the ring of 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.489
 diaphragm nokia a diaphragm ring 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.410
 it will not surprise 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.550
 nikon users who know a lot 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.800
 this is not bad their 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.480
 objectives have diaphragm tanks 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.459
 looked at against so there you have 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.860
 you a goal that opens at 2.8 which 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.410
 is not bad when you close it 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.120
 your viewfinder also becomes more 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.200
 dark so if they wanted to do a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.879
 very precise focus 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.890
 open it completely at 2.8 and then 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.040
 closed then since your viewfinder is going 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.390
 grow dark 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.959
 the second thing is that it's not a 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.220
 goal 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.160
 auto focus so it's going to take with your 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.090
 autofocus ring that you do your 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.340
 fully developed 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.110
 manual is a ring very very 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.080
 lanyards that practically a turn a lap 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.099
 complete it's nice 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.700
 there I recommend you 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.050
 rework your competition on the hyper 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.209
 focal for me I advise you to 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.019
 anyway stay between 1 and 2 meters 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.550
 as long as you close a little 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:15.180
 dia ring between f8 and f11 you go 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.900
 have absolutely all your image that 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.650
 will be in the area of maximum sharpness 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.550
 so once you've done these 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.790
 settings the f8 to f11 focus between 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.099
 1 and 2 meters and pretty much everything 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.010
 will be net 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.209
 good I'm a place we're going for 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.909
 learn a beautiful landscape 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:41.670
 I will show you the difference in 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:44.129
 the field of vision between 1 16 mm and 1 14 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.099
 mm I take you two pictures without 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.140
 move tripod and you'll see the 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.870
 huge difference that these two little ones 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.269
 millimeters melts on the field of vision 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.269
 it must be around 10 degrees more 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.040
 here I show you now 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.370
 the lens hooked on on the device 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.370
 Photo 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.609
 see that he is really extremely 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.850
 compact fits well in the hand 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.979
 good the goal being so bombay 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.180
 the front element does it's still 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.180
 well be careful you have a 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:38.530
 what is it called a sun visor 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.330
 but by sun and fx mahler enough 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.699
 good enough good quality 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.440
 I advise you always good 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:49.780
 kept the cap when you 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:54.580
 carry that way you risk 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:57.580
 not too much damage to your lens 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.860
 so for between 3,400 euros you have there 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.180
 a truly exceptional goal 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:07.780
 if you are ready to use 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:10.900
 manual focus and manual diaphragm 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.160
 also so now if you 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.099
 want to follow me we will try to 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.960
 take some pictures with the samyang 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.410
 14 mm that I show you what he has in 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.099
 The belly 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.099
 follow me 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.720
 at 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.500
 1 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:20.110
 I am black fiddler and I tell you to 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.110
 very soon
