beats it's really powerful hard to get

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
beats it's really powerful hard to get
over<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.270> malefic<00:01:30.750> sovereign<00:01:31.200> in

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
over just like malefic sovereign in

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.890 
over just like malefic sovereign in
Stardust<00:01:32.070> they're<00:01:32.579> very<00:01:32.970> very<00:01:33.270> hard<00:01:33.659> to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
Stardust they're very very hard to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.810 
Stardust they're very very hard to
defeat<00:01:34.290> you're<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.340> use<00:01:35.520> some

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
defeat you're going to have to use some

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850 
defeat you're going to have to use some
sort<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.210> effect<00:01:36.659> monster<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.290> get<00:01:37.470> over<00:01:37.770> them

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
sort of effect monster to get over them

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.030 
sort of effect monster to get over them
this<00:01:38.040> likely<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.329> why<00:01:39.659> skill<00:01:40.619> drain<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
this likely so that's why skill drain is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.520 
this likely so that's why skill drain is
so<00:01:41.340> good<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.729> shuts<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.390> option<00:01:42.869> off<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.350> then

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
so good it shuts that option off so then

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.200 
so good it shuts that option off so then
your<00:01:43.680> opponent<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.149> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
your opponent is really going to have to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.850 
your opponent is really going to have to
work<00:01:45.509> they<00:01:45.750> getting<00:01:46.020> rid<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.409> uh<00:01:48.380> next<00:01:49.380> card

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
running a low amount of monsters so this

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.349 
running a low amount of monsters so this
court<00:03:24.419> is<00:03:24.510> not<00:03:24.780> going<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.019> affect<00:03:25.079> me<00:03:25.560> at<00:03:25.650> all

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
court is not going to affect me at all

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.119 
court is not going to affect me at all
now<00:03:27.359> necrovalley<00:03:27.870> doesn't<00:03:28.470> do<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> whole<00:03:28.739> whole

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
now necrovalley doesn't do a whole whole

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.159 
now necrovalley doesn't do a whole whole
lot<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.549> mean<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:30.060> course<00:03:30.120> valley<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:31.139> a

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
lot I mean of course valley is a

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.349 
lot I mean of course valley is a
powerful<00:03:31.620> card<00:03:32.040> but<00:03:32.489> I'm<00:03:32.609> talking<00:03:32.970> about<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
powerful card but I'm talking about the

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.500 
powerful card but I'm talking about the
deck<00:03:33.659> in<00:03:33.959> general<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.560> course<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:35.040> stops

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
deck in general of course it stops

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.390 
deck in general of course it stops
certain<00:03:36.510> cards<00:03:36.780> but<00:03:37.169> because<00:03:37.949> we're<00:03:38.159> using

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
certain cards but because we're using

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.189 
certain cards but because we're using
necrovalley<00:03:38.879> you<00:03:39.299> definitely<00:03:39.840> want<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.079> use

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
necrovalley you definitely want to use

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.339 
necrovalley you definitely want to use
the<00:03:40.349> royal<00:03:40.560> tribute<00:03:40.829> so<00:03:41.810> that's<00:03:42.810> really<00:03:43.169> all

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
the royal tribute so that's really all

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.069 
the royal tribute so that's really all
that<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.709> have<00:03:43.919> for<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.579> deck<00:03:44.790> profile<00:03:45.269> of<00:03:45.659> I

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
that I have for the deck profile of I

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.009 
that I have for the deck profile of I
had<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.560> few<00:03:46.829> people<00:03:47.220> asking<00:03:48.090> me<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.569> make<00:03:48.870> an

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
had a few people asking me to make an

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.559 
had a few people asking me to make an
updated<00:03:49.530> build<00:03:49.979> on<00:03:50.250> my<00:03:50.639> malefic<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.359> that's

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
updated build on my malefic so that's

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.589 
updated build on my malefic so that's
why<00:03:51.780> I'm<00:03:51.900> doing<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.400> I<00:03:53.400> definitely<00:03:54.180> think<00:03:54.419> the

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
why I'm doing it I definitely think the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.839 
why I'm doing it I definitely think the
decks<00:03:54.840> powerful<00:03:55.500> people<00:03:56.430> aren't<00:03:56.699> really

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
decks powerful people aren't really

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.699 
decks powerful people aren't really
talking<00:03:57.209> about<00:03:57.479> it<00:03:57.750> i'm<00:03:57.900> not<00:03:57.930> exactly<00:03:58.530> sure

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
talking about it i'm not exactly sure

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.449 
talking about it i'm not exactly sure
why<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.250> mean<00:03:59.849> maybe<00:04:00.479> the<00:04:00.780> 3m<00:04:01.319> espe<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:02.010> heavy

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
why I mean maybe the 3m espe and heavy

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.119 
why I mean maybe the 3m espe and heavy
but<00:04:02.939> if<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.359> really<00:04:03.569> think<00:04:03.900> about<00:04:04.049> it<00:04:04.229> accords

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
but if you really think about it accords

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.129 
but if you really think about it accords
not<00:04:05.519> good<00:04:05.729> against<00:04:06.090> gear<00:04:06.269> tone<00:04:06.509> because<00:04:07.019> if

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
not good against gear tone because if

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.659 
not good against gear tone because if

going to do play heavy because now

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.890 
going to do play heavy because now
