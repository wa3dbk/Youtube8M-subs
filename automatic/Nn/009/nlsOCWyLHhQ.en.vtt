resource reduction is going to be the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.590 
resource reduction is going to be the
next<00:01:07.180> best<00:01:07.330> thing<00:01:07.659> so<00:01:09.119> that's<00:01:10.119> what<00:01:10.330> you<00:01:10.450> want

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
fall this is going to be key item for

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.630 
fall this is going to be key item for
any<00:01:16.180> build<00:01:16.450> that's<00:01:16.659> not<00:01:16.840> fire<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.250> this<00:01:18.490> is

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
any build that's not fire so this is

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.990 
any build that's not fire so this is
from<00:01:18.880> act<00:01:19.119> 3<00:01:19.420> bounty<00:01:19.810> bags<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.850> reduces

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
from act 3 bounty bags and it reduces

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.969 
from act 3 bounty bags and it reduces
the<00:01:22.450> resources<00:01:22.990> of<00:01:23.020> all<00:01:23.200> your<00:01:23.439> abilities<00:01:23.799> by

the resources of all your abilities by
thirty<00:01:24.219> percent<00:01:24.549> after<00:01:24.850> not<00:01:25.119> taking<00:01:25.509> damage

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
thirty percent after not taking damage

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.080 
thirty percent after not taking damage
and<00:01:26.229> this<00:01:26.649> is<00:01:26.799> really<00:01:26.950> easy<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.460> utilize<00:01:27.820> for

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
and this is really easy to utilize for

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.270 
and this is really easy to utilize for
the<00:01:28.180> demon<00:01:28.450> hunter<00:01:28.689> you<00:01:28.960> stay<00:01:29.320> at<00:01:29.439> range<00:01:29.680> avoid

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
the demon hunter you stay at range avoid

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.819 
the demon hunter you stay at range avoid
getting<00:01:30.549> hit<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.450> make<00:01:32.020> sure<00:01:32.049> that<00:01:32.409> that's<00:01:32.530> up

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
getting hit and make sure that that's up

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.260 
getting hit and make sure that that's up
whenever<00:01:33.219> you're<00:01:33.460> dumping<00:01:33.820> hatred<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.820> this

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
whenever you're dumping hatred so this

through the ring of the world grandeur
you're<00:01:43.929> going<00:01:44.079> to<00:01:44.140> use<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:45.310> prides<00:01:45.579> fall

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
you're going to use the prides fall

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.959 
you're going to use the prides fall
there<00:01:46.149> and<00:01:46.679> for<00:01:47.679> fire<00:01:47.890> builds<00:01:48.369> obviously<00:01:48.850> the

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
there and for fire builds obviously the

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.940 
there and for fire builds obviously the
sender<00:01:49.240> code<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.600> going<00:01:49.749> to<00:01:49.810> be<00:01:49.899> choice<00:01:50.170> got

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
sender code is going to be choice got

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.739 
sender code is going to be choice got

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
to be using so in this case would be

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
hatred region on the quiver is going to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.110 
hatred region on the quiver is going to
be<00:03:16.269> much<00:03:16.629> stronger<00:03:16.870> than<00:03:17.139> it's<00:03:17.290> ever<00:03:17.409> been

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
that you can get everywhere can't really

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.349 
that you can get everywhere can't really
get<00:03:25.480> hatred<00:03:25.810> region<00:03:26.169> anywhere<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.639> it's<00:03:28.120> nice

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
get hatred region anywhere so it's nice

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
to scoop that up on the quiver if you

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.999 
to scoop that up on the quiver if you
can<00:03:30.760> but<00:03:31.719> these<00:03:31.900> are<00:03:32.049> key<00:03:32.230> items<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.709> big<00:03:32.859> one

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.339 
can but these are key items the big one
is<00:03:33.040> too<00:03:33.250> prideful<00:03:33.459> again<00:03:34.209> x3<00:03:34.689> bounty<00:03:35.139> bags

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
is too prideful again x3 bounty bags

is too prideful again x3 bounty bags
Reaper<00:03:36.220> wraps<00:03:36.459> from<00:03:37.329> mal<00:03:37.989> fail<00:03:38.229> crafted<00:03:39.040> and

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
Reaper wraps from mal fail crafted and

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.929 
Reaper wraps from mal fail crafted and
then<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.750> weapon<00:03:41.139> you<00:03:41.979> have<00:03:42.159> either<00:03:42.400> creditor

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
then the weapon you have either creditor

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.039 
then the weapon you have either creditor
shot<00:03:43.150> Atreyu<00:03:43.629> or<00:03:44.019> any<00:03:45.269> two-handed<00:03:46.269> ancient

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
shot Atreyu or any two-handed ancient

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.240 
shot Atreyu or any two-handed ancient
weapon<00:03:48.509> so<00:03:49.509> one<00:03:50.319> of<00:03:50.349> these<00:03:50.530> two<00:03:50.829> weapons<00:03:51.159> is

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
weapon so one of these two weapons is

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.349 
weapon so one of these two weapons is
going<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.430> be<00:03:51.489> really<00:03:51.699> good<00:03:51.819> to<00:03:51.939> start<00:03:52.180> out

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
going to be really good to start out

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.719 
going to be really good to start out
with<00:03:52.389> until<00:03:53.319> you<00:03:53.439> work<00:03:53.829> into<00:03:54.280> an<00:03:54.400> ancient<00:03:55.199> and

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:56.729 
with until you work into an ancient and

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.249 
with until you work into an ancient and
so<00:03:57.729> I<00:03:57.759> mean<00:03:57.939> obviously<00:03:58.090> for<00:03:58.569> next<00:03:58.810> patch<00:03:58.959> we're

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
so I mean obviously for next patch we're

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:00.509 
so I mean obviously for next patch we're
still<00:03:59.500> running<00:03:59.650> with<00:03:59.979> the<00:04:00.009> Marauder

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.140 
still running with the Marauder
six-piece<00:04:01.239> Marauder<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.519> change<00:04:03.939> the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
six-piece Marauder so the change the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.520 
six-piece Marauder so the change the
bonuses<00:04:04.930> are<00:04:05.079> going<00:04:05.199> to<00:04:05.259> be<00:04:05.319> a<00:04:05.349> little

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
bonuses are going to be a little

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.909 
bonuses are going to be a little
different<00:04:06.030> but<00:04:07.409> you<00:04:08.409> know<00:04:08.500> you're<00:04:08.620> still

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
different but you know you're still

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
reduction and I'm not exactly sure the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.990 
reduction and I'm not exactly sure the
right<00:04:54.080> balance<00:04:54.380> of<00:04:54.890> each<00:04:55.220> how<00:04:55.490> much<00:04:55.640> resource

rec room versus cooldown reduction is

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.360 
rec room versus cooldown reduction is
going<00:04:58.760> to<00:04:58.820> be<00:04:58.910> optimal<00:04:59.450> just<00:05:00.110> yet<00:05:00.410> but<00:05:01.040> I<00:05:01.340> will

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
going to be optimal just yet but I will

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.820 
going to be optimal just yet but I will
in<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:01.880> future<00:05:02.110> after<00:05:03.110> I<00:05:03.140> have<00:05:03.560> some<00:05:03.740> more
