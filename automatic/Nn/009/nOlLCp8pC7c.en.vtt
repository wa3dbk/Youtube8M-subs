needs<00:01:07.689> to<00:01:07.780> be<00:01:07.899> worked<00:01:08.110> on<00:01:09.960> other<00:01:10.960> than<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.259> I

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
needs to be worked on other than that I

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.149 
needs to be worked on other than that I
think<00:01:12.280> it's<00:01:12.909> pretty<00:01:13.210> much<00:01:13.619> pretty<00:01:14.619> much<00:01:14.740> there

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
think it's pretty much pretty much there

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.410 
think it's pretty much pretty much there
I<00:01:15.429> just<00:01:15.609> took<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:15.759> out<00:01:15.909> of<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.060> render<00:01:16.299> mode

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
I just took it out of the render mode

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.169 
I just took it out of the render mode
obviously<00:01:17.079> I'm<00:01:17.829> probably<00:01:18.520> gonna<00:01:18.670> add<00:01:18.850> some

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
obviously I'm probably gonna add some

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.649 
obviously I'm probably gonna add some
more<00:01:19.270> drift<00:01:19.600> damage<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.560> later<00:01:20.950> on<00:01:21.659> let's

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
more drift damage to it later on let's

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.599 
more drift damage to it later on let's
close<00:01:22.960> out<00:01:23.109> of<00:01:23.139> that<00:01:23.259> as<00:01:24.009> you<00:01:24.189> can<00:01:24.310> see<00:01:24.490> I've

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
close out of that as you can see I've

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.889 
close out of that as you can see I've
got<00:01:24.639> the<00:01:25.259> front<00:01:27.090> front<00:01:28.090> flip<00:01:28.359> there<00:01:28.659> that's

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
got the front front flip there that's

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.300 
got the front front flip there that's
got<00:01:29.109> to<00:01:29.259> a<00:01:29.289> bunch<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.999> chunks<00:01:30.999> taken<00:01:31.179> out<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.569> it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
got to a bunch of chunks taken out of it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.219 
got to a bunch of chunks taken out of it
but<00:01:33.310> I<00:01:33.369> do<00:01:33.459> want<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.789> add<00:01:33.850> some<00:01:34.090> more<00:01:34.270> drift

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
but I do want to add some more drift

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.370 
but I do want to add some more drift
damage<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:37.420> completely<00:01:37.899> missing<00:01:38.289> this

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
have to add that in as well as an engine

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.450 
have to add that in as well as an engine
and<00:01:45.179> maybe<00:01:45.780> change<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.380> hood<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.219> little

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and maybe change the hood up a little

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.249 
and maybe change the hood up a little
bits<00:01:49.159> as<00:01:50.159> well<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.460> some<00:01:50.609> more<00:01:50.820> more<00:01:51.750> damage<00:01:52.109> as

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
bits as well as some more more damage as

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.859 
bits as well as some more more damage as
I<00:01:52.380> said<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.859> then<00:01:53.759> once<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.149> comes<00:01:54.359> out<00:01:54.569> into

the amount of polygons it has this has a

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.600 
the amount of polygons it has this has a
crazy<00:02:03.539> amount<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.929> polygons<00:02:05.869> see<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:06.959> i<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.289> go

right<00:02:17.190> i<00:02:17.220> have<00:02:17.340> 1<00:02:17.519> million<00:02:17.730> six<00:02:18.030> hundred<00:02:18.150> and

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
right i have 1 million six hundred and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.100 
right i have 1 million six hundred and
sixty<00:02:19.190> 8890<00:02:20.190> polygons<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:23.010> i<00:02:23.790> definitely<00:02:24.660> need

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
sixty 8890 polygons so i definitely need

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.030 
sixty 8890 polygons so i definitely need
to<00:02:25.349> work<00:02:25.829> on<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:27.299> is<00:02:27.510> for<00:02:27.750> sure

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
to work on that that is for sure

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.030 
to work on that that is for sure
definitely<00:02:29.040> get<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.640> lot<00:02:30.120> lower<00:02:30.450> um<00:02:31.040> I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
definitely get that a lot lower um I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.729 
definitely get that a lot lower um I
think<00:02:32.910> like<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.450> polygon<00:02:33.870> limit<00:02:34.140> for<00:02:34.290> GTA<00:02:34.620> is

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
think like the polygon limit for GTA is

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.110 
think like the polygon limit for GTA is
a<00:02:34.860> hundred<00:02:35.250> thousand<00:02:35.610> or<00:02:35.700> something<00:02:36.000> like

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
a hundred thousand or something like

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.380 
a hundred thousand or something like
that<00:02:36.860> like<00:02:37.860> I'd<00:02:38.250> have<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.610> ask<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.879> few<00:02:39.060> people

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
that like I'd have to ask a few people

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.520 
that like I'd have to ask a few people
about<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.840> but<00:02:40.549> yeah<00:02:41.549> this<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.819> my<00:02:41.940> s14<00:02:42.470> do<00:02:43.470> I

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
think i want to do a better diffuser and

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.279 
think i want to do a better diffuser and
maybe<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.560> front<00:04:34.889> splitter<00:04:35.510> but<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.660> bcl<00:04:37.050> wing

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
maybe a front splitter but the bcl wing

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.940 
maybe a front splitter but the bcl wing
