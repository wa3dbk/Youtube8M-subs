00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
pump insert it like so hold the cop with

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.899 
pump insert it like so hold the cop with
the<00:04:23.210> 5/8<00:04:23.659> nine<00:04:24.260> sixteenths<00:04:24.800> inch<00:04:24.950> wrench<00:04:25.070> and

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
the 5/8 nine sixteenths inch wrench and

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.520 
the 5/8 nine sixteenths inch wrench and
then<00:04:26.750> with

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
then with

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.129 
then with
11:16<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.730> mean<00:04:29.300> at<00:04:29.420> least<00:04:29.450> that's<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.930> size

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
11:16 I mean at least that's the size

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.110 
11:16 I mean at least that's the size
that<00:04:30.350> I'm<00:04:30.470> using<00:04:30.740> I'm<00:04:31.730> going<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.090> go<00:04:32.240> ahead<00:04:32.410> and

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
that I'm using I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.930 
that I'm using I'm going to go ahead and
just<00:04:35.120> spin<00:04:35.750> this<00:04:35.990> so<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.070> idea<00:04:37.400> is<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.760> hold

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
just spin this so the idea is to hold

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.760 
just spin this so the idea is to hold
this<00:04:38.180> in<00:04:38.360> place<00:04:38.389> here<00:04:38.810> only<00:04:39.139> got<00:04:39.320> two<00:04:39.500> hands

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
this in place here only got two hands

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.800 
this in place here only got two hands
guys<00:04:40.040> so<00:04:40.280> bear<00:04:40.490> with<00:04:40.520> me<00:04:40.730> you<00:04:41.450> got<00:04:41.540> to<00:04:41.660> hold

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
guys so bear with me you got to hold

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.600 
guys so bear with me you got to hold
this<00:04:43.150> tighten<00:04:44.150> this<00:04:44.300> up<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:46.100> idea<00:04:46.430> is<00:04:46.550> to

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
this tighten this up and the idea is to

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.480 
this tighten this up and the idea is to
press<00:04:47.000> it<00:04:47.180> in<00:04:47.270> nice<00:04:47.510> and<00:04:47.750> slow<00:04:48.340> till<00:04:49.340> you

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
press it in nice and slow till you

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.950 
press it in nice and slow till you
achieve<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:50.090> same<00:04:51.610> as<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:54.530> old<00:04:54.950> one<00:04:55.130> I<00:04:55.870> put<00:04:56.870> it

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
achieve the same as the old one I put it

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.760 
achieve the same as the old one I put it
exactly<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.530> same<00:04:57.770> way<00:04:58.010> as<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:59.090> old<00:04:59.240> one<00:04:59.770> so
