 strong can eat think it 's batatinha 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.270
 because I like it very much like a 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.220
 well- seasoned sweet potato has only one sweet 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.020
 sinhá the stuff itself in the type of 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.850
 Beets a little more from the hospital will 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.860
 protesting more curious that is more expensive 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:48.440
 when it is more expensive and more chic and 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:51.050
 Japan go to another here is easier 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.110

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.040
 regular who's found you a pod 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.840

 we saw to sell common market 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.739
 also american 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:12.670
 different from the one he has 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:12.670
 the carrot pod zucchini pumpkin 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.190
 zucchini goes to beets and rafa 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.620
 difference 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:27.800
 I'll get back to that here is the 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.660
 of this package a guy and the gringo and that 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.690
 here is industrialized from almargem 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:43.220
 start with the beets chips again 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:45.710
 well the grooves were all giving a 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.100
 bite is very different from the taste of 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.220
 another but very different a carrot 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.080
 beet was denied dried beet is that 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.510
 It tastes like seasoning only here. 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:02.090
 so we feel the vegetable plant a 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:05.030
 carrot liked it 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.200
 a week kind of a little bit sun 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.200
 the vacancy 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.759
 will not be like vegetable that got less 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.879
 healthy right? 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.110
 there is also ne, but I do not know there looks 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:33.389
 French fries 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.389
 It was there that here is a potato 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:43.000
 How much faster did you like Senegal? 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.090
 You look sincerely at the end too. 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.330
 but I prefer him hiding the raw 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:54.340
 No, it's not just a curiosity to 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.430
 You guys are so much nicer than 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.370
 other allows even healthier 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:04.030
 the other has a taste of longing between 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.610
 Guinea-Bissau will last so long 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.500
 are not made housed know she is 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.780
 all the same format that is not made of 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.259
 potato that can not consist of french fries 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.180
 xix because the potato is more the same 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.990
 design a clay the same as 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.639
 colorful 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.490
 This already really has a little taste 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:23.229
 of the Member is not just another 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:27.240
 curiosity in the United States if you like
