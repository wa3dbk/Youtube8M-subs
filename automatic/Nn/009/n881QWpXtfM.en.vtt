we're getting close here now I just want
to<00:03:16.129> quiet<00:03:16.430> detail<00:03:18.190> scoring<00:03:29.799> talking<00:03:30.799> about<00:03:31.069> it

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
to quiet detail scoring talking about it

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.259 
to quiet detail scoring talking about it
second<00:03:32.420> sort<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.840> things<00:03:33.079> up<00:03:33.410> eyes<00:03:34.340> on<00:03:34.700> doing

second sort of things up eyes on doing
one<00:03:35.480> direction<00:03:36.190> is<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.400> appearance<00:03:38.060> of

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
one direction is the appearance of

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:48.339 
one direction is the appearance of
wrinkles<00:03:39.500> on<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.069> eyelid<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:47.959> effect

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
wrinkles on the eyelid and this effect

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.150 
wrinkles on the eyelid and this effect
really<00:03:49.660> stands<00:03:50.660> out<00:03:50.900> after<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.560> couple<00:03:51.890> days

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
really stands out after a couple days

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.020 
really stands out after a couple days
after<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.730> pumpkin<00:03:53.120> starts<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.860> dry<00:03:54.860> it<00:03:55.030> dry

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
after the pumpkin starts to dry it dry

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.569 
after the pumpkin starts to dry it dry
out<00:03:56.440> know<00:03:57.440> what<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.680> scoring<00:03:58.040> does<00:03:58.370> is

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
out know what the scoring does is

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.199 
out know what the scoring does is
creates<00:03:59.120> texture<00:03:59.810> on<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.890> meat<00:04:01.129> so<00:04:01.670> it<00:04:01.940> kind

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
creates texture on the meat so it kind

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.870 
creates texture on the meat so it kind
of<00:04:02.239> looks<00:04:02.389> like<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.569> wrinkled<00:04:03.049> skin<00:04:06.760> gotten<00:04:07.760> to

of looks like a wrinkled skin gotten to

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.650 
of looks like a wrinkled skin gotten to
the<00:04:08.000> point<00:04:08.239> where<00:04:08.590> it's<00:04:09.590> almost<00:04:09.739> look

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:23.050 

realistic<00:04:21.220> it<00:04:22.220> doesn't<00:04:22.550> make<00:04:22.639> for<00:04:22.849> a<00:04:22.910> messy

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
realistic it doesn't make for a messy

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:39.040 
realistic it doesn't make for a messy
pumpkin

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.999 

make<00:04:40.050> some<00:04:40.319> marks<00:04:41.309> go<00:04:41.729> across<00:04:42.649> and<00:04:43.649> they<00:04:43.769> don't

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
make some marks go across and they don't

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.469 
make some marks go across and they don't
have<00:04:44.189> to<00:04:44.339> be<00:04:44.519> down<00:04:44.699> deep<00:04:45.149> in<00:04:45.360> between<00:04:45.749> it

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
have to be down deep in between it

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.439 
have to be down deep in between it
crosses<00:04:48.479> it's<00:04:49.259> more<00:04:49.469> of<00:04:49.559> a<00:04:49.649> surface<00:04:50.449> technique

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
crosses it's more of a surface technique

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.389 
crosses it's more of a surface technique
so<00:04:52.099> just<00:04:53.099> basically<00:04:53.489> get<00:04:54.119> as<00:04:54.330> much<00:04:54.479> of<00:04:55.339> this<00:04:56.339> as

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:56.399 
so just basically get as much of this as

00:04:56.399 --> 00:05:06.169 
so just basically get as much of this as
I<00:04:56.729> can<00:05:03.199> if<00:05:04.199> I<00:05:04.379> can<00:05:04.759> get<00:05:05.759> carried<00:05:06.119> away

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:06.179 
I can if I can get carried away

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:10.209 
I can if I can get carried away
