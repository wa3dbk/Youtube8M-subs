00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.240 

personally<00:00:03.780> I<00:00:03.810> think<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.319> tie<00:00:04.560> is<00:00:04.620> one<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.160> the

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
personally I think a tie is one of the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.430 
personally I think a tie is one of the
best<00:00:05.460> ways<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.700> do<00:00:05.970> it<00:00:06.000> because<00:00:06.299> not<00:00:06.839> only<00:00:06.899> did

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
best ways to do it because not only did

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.379 
best ways to do it because not only did
you<00:00:07.890> know<00:00:08.010> we<00:00:08.250> get<00:00:08.460> this<00:00:08.670> incredible<00:00:09.120> score

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
you know we get this incredible score

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.240 
you know we get this incredible score
but<00:00:09.599> there's<00:00:09.870> no<00:00:10.080> reason<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.679> break<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> tie

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
but there's no reason to break a tie

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.970 
but there's no reason to break a tie
when<00:00:11.580> both<00:00:11.849> teams<00:00:12.179> did<00:00:12.440> phenomenal<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.650> mean

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
when both teams did phenomenal I mean

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.919 
when both teams did phenomenal I mean
that's<00:00:14.250> like<00:00:14.429> saying<00:00:14.700> oh<00:00:14.940> no<00:00:15.450> you're<00:00:15.809> not

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
that's like saying oh no you're not

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.330 
that's like saying oh no you're not
quite<00:00:16.289> as<00:00:16.320> good<00:00:16.529> as<00:00:16.680> them<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:16.949> like<00:00:17.130> them

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
quite as good as them we like them

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.490 
quite as good as them we like them
better<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.760> think<00:00:18.210> honestly<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.690> tiebreaker<00:00:19.199> it

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
better I think honestly a tiebreaker it

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.010 
better I think honestly a tiebreaker it
kind<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.800> ruins<00:00:20.130> ruins<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.300> feeling<00:00:21.869> of

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
kind of ruins ruins that feeling of

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.560 
kind of ruins ruins that feeling of
being<00:00:22.080> accomplished<00:00:22.980> because<00:00:23.609> not<00:00:24.060> only<00:00:24.090> did

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
being accomplished because not only did

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.929 
being accomplished because not only did
we<00:00:24.750> not<00:00:24.779> break<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.500> tie<00:00:25.650> but<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.160> know<00:00:26.279> being

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
we not break the tie but you know being

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.000

up<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.480> Oklahoma<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.080> incredible<00:00:28.800> I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
up here with Oklahoma it's incredible I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.500 
up here with Oklahoma it's incredible I

don't think you know all of us that
forward<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:31.080> wouldn't<00:00:31.410> have<00:00:31.500> wanted<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.769> tie

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
forward we wouldn't have wanted to tie

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.490 
forward we wouldn't have wanted to tie
with<00:00:32.279> any<00:00:32.520> other<00:00:32.850> team<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.420> not<00:00:34.079> only<00:00:34.200> are<00:00:34.469> we

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
with any other team and not only are we

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.229 
with any other team and not only are we
again<00:00:34.890> repeating<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.880> know<00:00:36.000> we're

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
again repeating but you know we're

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.850 
again repeating but you know we're
making<00:00:36.329> history<00:00:36.630> again<00:00:36.870> when<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.350> there<00:00:37.680> ever

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
making history again when is there ever

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.260 
making history again when is there ever
been<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> die

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
been a die

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.170 
been a die
and<00:00:39.629> again<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.200> know<00:00:40.399> having<00:00:41.399> tie<00:00:41.579> breakers<00:00:42.030> I

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and again you know having tie breakers I

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.790 
and again you know having tie breakers I
guess<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.570> some<00:00:42.750> sports<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.260> great<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.620> for

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
guess for some sports it's great but for

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.450 
guess for some sports it's great but for

we're in a dream we're literally out
there<00:02:06.030> doing<00:02:06.390> what<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:06.630> love<00:02:06.899> doing<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.380> we

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
there doing what we love doing what we

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.949 
there doing what we love doing what we
know<00:02:07.680> doing<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.489> best<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
know doing what we do best and the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.360 
know doing what we do best and the
results<00:02:10.349> were<00:02:10.470> perfect<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.660> mean<00:02:12.660> it's<00:02:12.840> really

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
results were perfect I mean it's really

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.280 
results were perfect I mean it's really
hard<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.640> compare<00:02:14.030> like<00:02:14.299> Ally<00:02:14.629> gymnastics<00:02:15.170> in

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
hard to compare like Ally gymnastics in

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.559 
hard to compare like Ally gymnastics in
college<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:15.890> cuz<00:02:16.099> they're<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:16.970> different<00:02:17.239> I

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
college just cuz they're so different I

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.259 
college just cuz they're so different I
mean<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.870> can't<00:02:18.049> really<00:02:18.110> put<00:02:18.560> an<00:02:19.060> emotion<00:02:20.060> on

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
mean you can't really put an emotion on

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.850 
mean you can't really put an emotion on
getting<00:02:20.750> an<00:02:20.840> Olympic<00:02:21.140> medal<00:02:21.379> getting<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.680> world

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.130 
girls year out you know day in day out
all<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.760> time<00:02:28.909> you<00:02:29.180> form<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:29.659> sisterhood

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
all the time you form this sisterhood

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.500 
all the time you form this sisterhood
that<00:02:30.500> really<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.790> makes<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.299> much<00:02:32.450> more

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
that really it makes it that much more

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.740 
that really it makes it that much more
special<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:33.920> guess<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.430> college<00:02:34.940> terms<00:02:35.360> this

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
special so I guess in college terms this

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.780 
special so I guess in college terms this
was<00:02:36.079> hands-down<00:02:36.980> one<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.610> most

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
pressure it's more of going out there

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.890 
pressure it's more of going out there
and<00:03:24.769> doing<00:03:25.730> everything<00:03:25.970> for<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:26.450> team<00:03:26.630> and

and doing everything for the team and
the<00:03:26.959> Gator<00:03:27.169> Nation<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:28.239> knowing<00:03:29.239> that<00:03:29.419> you

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
the Gator Nation and knowing that you

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.809 
the Gator Nation and knowing that you
know<00:03:29.599> in<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.959> gym<00:03:30.169> you've<00:03:30.410> practiced<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:31.579> many

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
routines and I just think it's an honor

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.729 
routines and I just think it's an honor
to<00:03:34.430> be<00:03:34.700> able<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.629> started<00:03:36.049> out<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.410> meet<00:03:36.530> for

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
to be able to I started out the meet for

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.530 
to be able to I started out the meet for
the<00:03:36.829> Gators<00:03:37.129> and<00:03:37.310> then<00:03:37.400> end<00:03:37.639> up<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.389> meet

for the Gators and I think that was
pretty<00:03:40.639> cool<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:42.280> just<00:03:43.280> last<00:03:43.549> year<00:03:43.819> was<00:03:44.000> the
