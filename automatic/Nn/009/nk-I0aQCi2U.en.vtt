00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
and for playing games we think for four

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.980 
and for playing games we think for four
hours<00:01:22.790> at<00:01:23.150> a<00:01:23.180> time<00:01:23.390> I'm<00:01:23.510> gonna<00:01:23.630> have<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.840> wait

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
hours at a time I'm gonna have to wait

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.290 
hours at a time I'm gonna have to wait
till<00:01:24.020> we<00:01:24.260> get<00:01:24.350> our<00:01:24.410> full<00:01:25.070> review<00:01:25.250> unit<00:01:25.640> in<00:01:25.760> so

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
till we get our full review unit in so

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.850 
till we get our full review unit in so
when<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:26.510> add<00:01:26.630> this<00:01:26.750> all<00:01:26.930> together<00:01:27.080> it's

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
when you add this all together it's

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.660 
when you add this all together it's
really<00:01:28.160> a<00:01:28.190> compelling<00:01:28.640> value<00:01:28.940> at<00:01:29.060> 499<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:30.020> fact

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
really a compelling value at 499 in fact

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.070 
really a compelling value at 499 in fact
we<00:01:31.670> would<00:01:31.850> probably<00:01:32.180> get<00:01:32.300> this<00:01:32.540> over<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:32.960> new

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
we would probably get this over the new

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.630 
we would probably get this over the new
iPad<00:01:33.440> Mini<00:01:33.650> with<00:01:33.800> Retina<00:01:33.830> display<00:01:34.400> because

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
iPad Mini with Retina display because

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.630 
iPad Mini with Retina display because
you're<00:01:35.600> getting<00:01:35.810> a<00:01:35.869> bigger<00:01:36.080> screen<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.830> in<00:01:37.520> a

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
you're getting a bigger screen and in a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.120 
you're getting a bigger screen and in a
package<00:01:38.000> that's<00:01:38.030> almost<00:01:38.509> as<00:01:38.720> portable<00:01:39.130> for

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
package that's almost as portable for

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.880 
package that's almost as portable for
around<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.550> same<00:01:40.580> price<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:42.200> we<00:01:42.590> also<00:01:42.740> took

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
around the same price and we also took

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.680 
around the same price and we also took
some<00:01:43.190> pictures<00:01:43.399> with<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.300> camera<00:01:44.330> we're

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
some pictures with the camera we're

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.109 
some pictures with the camera we're
going<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.869> show<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.050> that<00:01:45.229> right<00:01:45.410> now<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:47.030> we

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
going to show you that right now so we

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.050 
going to show you that right now so we
go<00:01:47.240> into<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.540> Photos<00:01:47.810> app<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:49.490> back<00:01:49.640> into

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
go into the Photos app and the back into

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.980 
go into the Photos app and the back into
our<00:01:50.390> camera<00:01:50.869> roll

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.770 

so<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:56.650> guess<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:56.829> those<00:01:57.130> didn't<00:01:57.430> save<00:01:57.780> but

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
so I guess that those didn't save but

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.999 
so I guess that those didn't save but
you<00:01:58.869> are<00:01:58.960> definitely<00:01:59.170> getting<00:01:59.470> faster

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
you are definitely getting faster

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.399 
you are definitely getting faster
performance<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:01.360> little<00:02:01.780> less<00:02:01.899> lag<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.320> we

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
performance a little less lag that we

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.420 
performance a little less lag that we
actually<00:02:02.740> saw<00:02:02.950> with<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.430> iphone<00:02:03.850> 5s<00:02:05.430> but

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
actually saw with the iphone 5s but

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.980 
actually saw with the iphone 5s but
overall<00:02:06.790> we're<00:02:07.149> certainly<00:02:07.630> looks<00:02:07.840> like<00:02:07.869> a

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
overall we're certainly looks like a

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.400 
overall we're certainly looks like a
