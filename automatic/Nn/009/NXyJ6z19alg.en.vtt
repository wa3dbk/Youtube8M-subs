Madden<00:04:17.520> players<00:04:17.760> I<00:04:17.970> can<00:04:18.150> think<00:04:18.390> of<00:04:18.540> use<00:04:18.720> a

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
Madden players I can think of use a

Madden players I can think of use a
custom<00:04:18.989> nor<00:04:19.380> will<00:04:19.530> they<00:04:19.650> ever<00:04:19.680> use<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.040> custom

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
playbook I can't think of a tournament

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.780 
playbook I can't think of a tournament
that<00:04:22.500> ever<00:04:22.650> will<00:04:22.830> come<00:04:23.040> up<00:04:23.190> where<00:04:23.370> that's<00:04:23.520> even

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
that ever will come up where that's even

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.870 
that ever will come up where that's even
part<00:04:23.970> of<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.150> game<00:04:24.740> but<00:04:25.740> anyway<00:04:26.220> use<00:04:26.640> them<00:04:26.790> if

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
part of the game but anyway use them if

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.060 
part of the game but anyway use them if
you<00:04:26.970> want<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.419> have<00:04:27.870> fun<00:04:28.080> with<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.380> hopefully

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
you want and have fun with it hopefully

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.800 
you want and have fun with it hopefully
if<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.430> play<00:04:29.640> me<00:04:29.880> I'll<00:04:30.000> lock<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.240> up<00:04:30.450> and

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
if you play me I'll lock you up and

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.030 
if you play me I'll lock you up and
we'll<00:04:31.320> call<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.710> day

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
we'll call it a day

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.210 
we'll call it a day
so<00:04:32.190> anyway<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.330> guess<00:04:34.320> in<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.800> other<00:04:34.950> part<00:04:35.160> is

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
so anyway I guess in the other part is

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.159 
so anyway I guess in the other part is
just<00:04:35.700> challenge<00:04:36.180> that's<00:04:36.360> my<00:04:36.450> last<00:04:36.660> point<00:04:36.810> it

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
just challenge that's my last point it

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.690 
just challenge that's my last point it
makes<00:04:37.380> it<00:04:37.560> more<00:04:37.710> challenging<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:38.430> play<00:04:38.550> the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
makes it more challenging to play the

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.280 
makes it more challenging to play the
game<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.060> way<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.270> was<00:04:39.360> supposed<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.750> be<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.169> I

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
game the way it was supposed to be and I

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.810 
game the way it was supposed to be and I
know<00:04:40.350> people<00:04:40.710> gonna<00:04:40.830> say<00:04:40.950> oh<00:04:41.010> well<00:04:41.340> you<00:04:41.730> know

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
know people gonna say oh well you know

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.550 
know people gonna say oh well you know
you<00:04:41.880> can't<00:04:42.180> blitz<00:04:42.600> be<00:04:42.900> gaps<00:04:43.140> that's<00:04:43.410> not

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
you can't blitz be gaps that's not

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.020 
you can't blitz be gaps that's not
realistic<00:04:43.860> in<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.160> NFL<00:04:44.490> well<00:04:44.760> there's<00:04:44.910> not

realistic in the NFL well there's not

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.430 
realistic in the NFL well there's not
too<00:04:45.270> much<00:04:45.390> about<00:04:45.720> Madden<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.169> becomes

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
too much about Madden that becomes

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.950 
too much about Madden that becomes
realistic<00:04:46.950> because<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:48.030> defense<00:04:48.479> you<00:04:48.840> know

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
realistic because the defense you know

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.180 
realistic because the defense you know
they<00:04:49.080> try<00:04:49.229> to<00:04:49.290> make<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.680> little<00:04:49.950> bit<00:04:50.070> better

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
they try to make it a little bit better

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.589 
they try to make it a little bit better
but<00:04:50.460> it's<00:04:50.520> still<00:04:50.729> very<00:04:50.790> offensive

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
but it's still very offensive

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.869 
but it's still very offensive
and<00:04:51.839> you<00:04:52.289> need<00:04:52.559> blitzing<00:04:53.039> in<00:04:53.159> this<00:04:53.279> game<00:04:53.520> to

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
and you need blitzing in this game to

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.239 
and you need blitzing in this game to
make<00:04:54.029> it<00:04:54.179> fun<00:04:55.080> for<00:04:55.110> myself<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.069> other

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:56.249 
make it fun for myself and the other

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:57.619 
make it fun for myself and the other
people<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:56.999> know<00:04:57.089> want<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.360> consider

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:57.629 
people that you know want to consider

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:59.209 
people that you know want to consider
themselves<00:04:57.809> above<00:04:58.289> average<00:04:58.679> Madden<00:04:58.979> players

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
themselves above average Madden players

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:01.699 
themselves above average Madden players
because<00:05:00.209> there's<00:05:00.449> so<00:05:00.599> much<00:05:00.779> offense<00:05:01.289> it<00:05:01.529> just

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:01.709 
because there's so much offense it just

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:03.649 
because there's so much offense it just
you<00:05:02.219> need<00:05:02.369> something<00:05:02.849> that<00:05:02.999> contain<00:05:03.389> it<00:05:03.569> and

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
you need something that contain it and

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.449 
you need something that contain it and

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:30.529 
the day I'm sure everybody can be

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.689 
the day I'm sure everybody can be
depending<00:05:31.529> on<00:05:31.619> the<00:05:31.740> time<00:05:31.949> you<00:05:32.309> know<00:05:32.430> and<00:05:32.610> then

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
depending on the time you know and then

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:33.920 
depending on the time you know and then
I<00:05:32.849> don't<00:05:33.029> go<00:05:33.119> I<00:05:33.149> don't<00:05:33.360> not<00:05:33.629> gonna<00:05:33.779> ever

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
I don't go I don't not gonna ever

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.239 
I don't go I don't not gonna ever
probably<00:05:34.259> travel<00:05:34.529> to<00:05:34.619> a<00:05:34.649> storm<00:05:34.860> unless<00:05:35.009> it's<00:05:35.219> a

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:35.249 
probably travel to a storm unless it's a

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.779 
probably travel to a storm unless it's a
big<00:05:35.430> one

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
big one

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.010 
big one
and<00:05:36.059> I<00:05:36.119> think<00:05:36.180> we<00:05:36.419> all<00:05:36.509> know<00:05:36.689> that<00:05:36.719> you<00:05:36.990> know

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
and I think we all know that you know

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.989 
and I think we all know that you know
problem<00:05:37.649> was<00:05:38.279> probably<00:05:38.550> you<00:05:38.669> know<00:05:38.759> definitely

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:38.999 
problem was probably you know definitely

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:40.429 
problem was probably you know definitely
probably<00:05:39.479> the<00:05:39.659> best<00:05:39.779> of<00:05:39.899> all<00:05:39.990> time<00:05:40.169> I<00:05:40.199> guess

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:40.439 
probably the best of all time I guess

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:42.170 
probably the best of all time I guess
that's<00:05:40.589> hard<00:05:40.740> to<00:05:40.830> dispute<00:05:41.159> and<00:05:41.909> then<00:05:41.999> you<00:05:42.059> got

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
that's hard to dispute and then you got

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.519 
that's hard to dispute and then you got
players<00:05:42.389> like<00:05:42.569> serious<00:05:42.930> mode<00:05:43.110> that<00:05:43.289> are<00:05:43.379> up
