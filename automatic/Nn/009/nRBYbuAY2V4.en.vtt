00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.430
 sixteen coffee can not cheese 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:35.660
 villarán no left franc 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:35.660
 it comes from our 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.860
 O 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.800
 she lost two matches very well 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.060
 against the first two places I 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.680
 I think he deserved the victory not 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.450
 liked and drugs and she did not come 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.910
 I want you can not lower the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.050
 competitiveness index is the level of 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.060
 competition 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.160
 you are a game that does not come maybe 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.860
 first place is the tenth you can 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.959
 but it's a more difficult team to 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.819
 win harder if you see that 1 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.440
 are days at home than the athletic 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.360
 because it is such a 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.670
 very defensive purpose of controlling the 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.220
 fast car epe good ball 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.080
 now we played two games now and 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.750
 play well again and get the win 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.489
 that Saturday we put 40 to 50 thousand 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.470
 people in morumbi and we win in the 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.209
 hard way on Saturday but to bring the 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.640
 knows that I did not know the 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.959
 today's victory was the ease of 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.880
 to achieve this we do not have the capacity 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.910
 that we will not be able to 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.930
 victory in Formula 1 can not be more 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.310
 what we were doing and let 's go 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.040
 work better than it is working 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.269
 a flooded spot that he scores for 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:00.440
 quality of each one and light bongo 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.299
 talent but what is break is outstanding 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.549
 of the slow you quoted and more than 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.480
 size of the talent you have the desire to 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.480
 win 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.250
 he is above his quality of 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.760
 students and it's just like that for us 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.760
 win 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.020
 Paulo 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.760
 ae 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.120
 O 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:23.990
 the building with two goals is not just usda 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:27.050
 look at the name other than this effect the 19th 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.550
 goal and hope this goal can bring 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.240
 São Paulo fan finds more 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:37.130
 I want to make a lot of goals important. 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:41.870
 It was not good for you, not many. 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:44.270
 people thinking that they would return to play 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.010
 more soccer but only I, my wife and 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.080
 my children know how hard it was 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.090
 for me to be in germany 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.890
 and when I went to Brazil, how did you 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:59.960
 I put the head that was that was 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:07:02.300
 to work 100% to be able to work 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.160
 as holder and was no different today 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.550
 he put me the headline ending up with 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.770
 different position but there were already 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.840
 I talked to him and I talked to him 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.430
 can do to help the nautical out 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.290
 was available 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.880
 I think it's important is a table of 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.770
 score if put in g4 and improved 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.380
 This kind of use is out of 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.620
 home and was even think I'll think 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.750
 a classic patio last I was going to have a 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.009

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.599
