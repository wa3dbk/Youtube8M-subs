white conversions in Lightroom going to
talk<00:00:14.099> about<00:00:14.660> pre-visualization<00:00:15.660> when<00:00:16.410> you're

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
talk about pre-visualization when you're

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.439 
talk about pre-visualization when you're
doing<00:00:16.920> your<00:00:17.039> black<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.609> white<00:00:17.760> conversions

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
doing your black and white conversions

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.390 
doing your black and white conversions
we<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.050> image<00:00:19.410> here<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.740> these<00:00:19.980> trains

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
we have this image here of these trains

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.870 
we have this image here of these trains
it's<00:00:20.730> kind<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.210> low<00:00:21.539> contrast

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
it's kind of like a low contrast

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.140 
it's kind of like a low contrast
overcast<00:00:23.880> sky<00:00:24.420> kind<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.109> image<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
overcast sky kind of image and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.089 
overcast sky kind of image and
pre-visualization<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.779> really<00:00:28.560> important

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
pre-visualization is really important

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.849 
pre-visualization is really important

concept in photography Ansel Adams
talked<00:00:32.160> about<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.700> lot<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.390> course<00:00:33.690> his

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
talked about this a lot of course his

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.990 
talked about this a lot of course his
type<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.680> photography<00:00:34.829> was<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> kind<00:00:35.820> where

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
type of photography was the kind where

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.940 
type of photography was the kind where
you'd<00:00:36.149> sit<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.660> think<00:00:36.719> about<00:00:37.170> your<00:00:37.469> picture

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
you'd sit and think about your picture

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.369 
you'd sit and think about your picture
and<00:00:38.239> ruminate<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.750> want<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.110> look

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and ruminate on what you want it to look

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.290 
and ruminate on what you want it to look
like<00:00:40.440> at<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> end<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.790> think<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.180> also

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
like at the end but I think it's also

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.720 
like at the end but I think it's also
very<00:00:42.690> applicable<00:00:43.260> even<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.010> run<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.550> gun

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
very applicable even in this run and gun

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.970 
very applicable even in this run and gun

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
photos process you have the photo now I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.639 
photos process you have the photo now I
know<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.090> want<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.600> convert<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> black<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
know I want to convert it to black and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.860 
know I want to convert it to black and
white<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.640> want<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.180> though<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.570> be

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
white what I want to do though is be

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.580 
white what I want to do though is be
able<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.379> understand<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.520> my<00:00:56.760> options<00:00:57.270> and

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
able to understand all of my options and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.510 
able to understand all of my options and
determine<00:00:58.590> what's<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
determine what's going to be the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.270 
determine what's going to be the
absolute<00:00:59.760> best<00:01:00.239> conversion<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.590> what<00:01:02.129> do<00:01:02.219> I

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
absolute best conversion and what do I

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.009 
absolute best conversion and what do I
want<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.640> picture<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.149> look<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.629> at<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
want this picture to look like at the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.500 
want this picture to look like at the
end<00:01:04.049> there's<00:01:04.830> really<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.489> huge<00:01:05.909> range<00:01:06.330> of

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
end there's really a huge range of

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.780 
end there's really a huge range of
possibilities<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.920> doing<00:01:08.250> black<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.670> white

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
possibilities for doing black and white

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.640 
possibilities for doing black and white
conversions<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.659> before<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.260> into<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
conversions so before we get into the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.789 
conversions so before we get into the
specific<00:01:11.220> technique<00:01:11.670> let's<00:01:11.970> talk<00:01:12.299> about

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
specific technique let's talk about

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.320 
specific technique let's talk about
pre-visualization<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.430> kind<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.000> range

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
pre-visualization and kind of the range

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.660 
pre-visualization and kind of the range
of<00:01:15.830> possibilities<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.400> within

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
of possibilities that you have within

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.539 
of possibilities that you have within
lightroom<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:19.140> let's<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
lightroom so let's go here and take a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.710 
lightroom so let's go here and take a
look<00:01:20.790> at<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> number<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.450> different

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
look at a number of different

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.880 
look at a number of different
conversions<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> pretty<00:01:25.080> standard

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
conversions this is a pretty standard

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.490 
conversions this is a pretty standard
black<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.700> white<00:01:26.820> conversion<00:01:27.299> actually<00:01:28.140> used

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
black and white conversion actually used

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.620 
black and white conversion actually used
in<00:01:28.650> using<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> black<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.970> white<00:01:30.119> treatment

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
in using the black and white treatment

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.850 
in using the black and white treatment
in<00:01:30.780> Lightroom<00:01:31.729> it's<00:01:32.729> got<00:01:32.970> decent<00:01:33.659> contrast<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
in Lightroom it's got decent contrast a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.530 
in Lightroom it's got decent contrast a
little<00:01:35.130> more<00:01:35.310> contrast<00:01:35.729> than<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> color

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
little more contrast than in the color

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.260 
little more contrast than in the color
version<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.860> see<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> number<00:01:38.850> seven

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
version you can see the number seven

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.170 
version you can see the number seven
pretty<00:01:39.570> clearly<00:01:39.990> here<00:01:40.530> you've<00:01:41.159> got<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.579> kind

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
pretty clearly here you've got this kind

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
pretty clearly here you've got this kind
of<00:01:42.299> black<00:01:42.630> filled<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> round

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
of black filled with the with the round

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.929 
of black filled with the with the round
number<00:01:44.610> seven<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.240> number<00:01:45.540> inside<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.170> it

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
number seven and the number inside of it

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.240 
number seven and the number inside of it
plenty<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.149> detail<00:01:48.689> not<00:01:49.439> too<00:01:49.680> much<00:01:49.860> noise

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
plenty of detail not too much noise

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.429 
plenty of detail not too much noise
there's<00:01:50.700> decent<00:01:51.030> amount<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.540> contrast<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
there's decent amount of contrast and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.069 
there's decent amount of contrast and
the<00:01:52.500> shadows<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.939> know<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.299> pretty<00:01:54.540> plain

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
the shadows you know it's a pretty plain

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.039 
the shadows you know it's a pretty plain
vanilla<00:01:55.409> white<00:01:56.100> conversion<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.869> of

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
vanilla white conversion and this of

vanilla white conversion and this of
course<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.500> kind<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.700> would<00:01:59.939> think

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
course is kind of what you would think

course is kind of what you would think
about<00:02:00.390> traditionally<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.380> okay<00:02:01.860> I'm<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.040> to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.530 
about traditionally of okay I'm going to
make<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> black<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.759> white<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.329> image

make a black and white out of this image

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.479 
make a black and white out of this image
here's<00:02:06.540> version<00:02:07.049> two<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.099> little<00:02:08.340> bit

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
here's version two it's a little bit

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.309 
here's version two it's a little bit
more<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.910> vintage<00:02:09.149> look<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.899> has<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> little

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
more of a vintage look it has a little

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.870 
more of a vintage look it has a little
bit<00:02:10.560> less<00:02:10.830> contrast

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
bit less contrast

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.560 
bit less contrast
and<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.540> bit<00:02:13.170> more<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:14.190> sleek<00:02:15.030> kind

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
and a bit more of that that sleek kind

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.130 
and a bit more of that that sleek kind
of<00:02:16.460> filmic<00:02:17.460> feeling<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:18.840> see

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
of filmic feeling to it and you can see

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.340 
of filmic feeling to it and you can see
here<00:02:19.650> in<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.850> details<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.570> very<00:02:21.900> different

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
here in the details it's very different

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.740 
here in the details it's very different
than<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.590> last<00:02:22.770> one<00:02:23.070> let's<00:02:23.250> take<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.490> look<00:02:23.790> even

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
than the last one let's take a look even

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.450 
than the last one let's take a look even
at<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.960> top<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.440> trains<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:26.040> can<00:02:26.220> see<00:02:26.430> a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
at the top of the trains you can see a

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.490 
at the top of the trains you can see a
big<00:02:27.030> difference<00:02:27.210> in<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.750> way<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.350> this

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
big difference in the way that this

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.770 
big difference in the way that this
conversion<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.250> done<00:02:29.280> it's<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.390> little<00:02:30.630> bit

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
conversion is done it's a little bit

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.710 
conversion is done it's a little bit
lower<00:02:31.050> key<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.880> shadows<00:02:33.360> are<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.540> little

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
lower key and the shadows are a little

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.960 
lower key and the shadows are a little
bit<00:02:33.960> deeper<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.410> there's<00:02:34.770> more<00:02:35.040> contrast<00:02:35.760> in

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
bit deeper and there's more contrast in

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.200 
bit deeper and there's more contrast in
these<00:02:36.090> mid-tones<00:02:36.720> right<00:02:37.620> here<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.940> kind<00:02:39.180> of

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
these mid-tones right here it kind of

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.740 
these mid-tones right here it kind of
gives<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:40.820> dirty<00:02:41.820> vintage<00:02:42.360> feel

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
gives you that that dirty vintage feel

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.990 
gives you that that dirty vintage feel
to<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.290> image<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.920> sky<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.520> little<00:02:44.850> bit

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
to the image the sky is a little bit

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.500 
to the image the sky is a little bit
darker<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.380> again<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.400> totally<00:02:47.940> different<00:02:48.330> way

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
darker and again a totally different way

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.760 
darker and again a totally different way
to<00:02:48.540> look<00:02:48.840> at<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.260> black<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.620> white

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
to look at the black and white

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.290 
to look at the black and white
conversion<00:02:50.130> but<00:02:50.520> still<00:02:50.850> pretty<00:02:51.150> standard

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
conversion but still pretty standard

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.450 
conversion but still pretty standard
this<00:02:54.300> here<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:55.260> toned<00:02:55.680> version<00:02:56.220> there's

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
this here is a toned version there's

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.220 
this here is a toned version there's
actually<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:57.710> bit<00:02:58.710> of<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.920> blue<00:02:59.250> tone<00:02:59.780> here<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.960> a

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
actually a bit of a blue tone here and a

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.740 
actually a bit of a blue tone here and a
little<00:03:01.500> bit<00:03:01.680> more<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.580> visible<00:03:03.120> grain<00:03:03.450> or

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
little bit more of a visible grain or

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.010 
little bit more of a visible grain or
noise<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.860> image<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.490> has<00:03:06.330> brighter

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
noise in the image it has brighter

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.160 
noise in the image it has brighter
whites<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.970> could<00:03:09.150> actually<00:03:09.300> see<00:03:09.510> in<00:03:09.930> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
whites you could actually see in the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.790 
whites you could actually see in the
tone<00:03:10.410> curve<00:03:11.160> here<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.700> histogram<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:13.230> the

tone curve here the histogram the the
cyan<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.460> kind<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.880> peeking<00:03:15.660> out<00:03:16.050> of<00:03:16.830> this<00:03:16.980> peak

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
cyan is kind of peeking out of this peak

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.010 
cyan is kind of peeking out of this peak
right<00:03:17.610> there<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.330> shows<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.900> that

right there and that shows you that

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.300 
right there and that shows you that
there's<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.290> little<00:03:19.530> bit<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.680> color<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.250> a

here the blacks aren't closed up if we

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.220 
here the blacks aren't closed up if we
increase<00:04:08.520> the<00:04:08.550> blacks<00:04:08.970> here<00:04:09.270> you<00:04:09.810> can<00:04:09.990> see

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
increase the blacks here you can see

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.660 
increase the blacks here you can see
what<00:04:10.410> happens<00:04:10.860> if<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.130> make<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.459> higher

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
vintage classic film filter kind of look

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.070

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
little bit more like with the blacks but

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.279

tone curve to this one and probably want

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.200 
tone curve to this one and probably want
to<00:05:48.800> actually<00:05:48.950> do<00:05:49.340> add<00:05:49.610> a<00:05:49.669> little<00:05:49.880> bit<00:05:50.150> of

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
to actually do add a little bit of

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.750 
to actually do add a little bit of
additional<00:05:50.960> noise<00:05:51.410> reduction<00:05:51.979> to<00:05:52.340> this<00:05:52.520> one

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
additional noise reduction to this one

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.270 
additional noise reduction to this one
because<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.570> grain<00:05:53.990> doesn't<00:05:54.320> look<00:05:54.470> great<00:05:54.620> so

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
because the grain doesn't look great so

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.460 
because the grain doesn't look great so
again<00:05:55.639> a<00:05:55.849> very<00:05:56.419> different<00:05:56.930> treatment<00:05:57.349> than

got<00:06:17.419> a<00:06:17.479> little<00:06:17.720> bit<00:06:17.960> of<00:06:17.990> a<00:06:18.139> tone<00:06:18.729> and<00:06:20.169> again

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
got a little bit of a tone and again

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.290 
got a little bit of a tone and again
what<00:06:21.770> this<00:06:21.919> is<00:06:22.130> doing<00:06:22.340> is<00:06:22.580> bringing<00:06:22.760> a<00:06:23.000> lot

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
what this is doing is bringing a lot

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.000 
what this is doing is bringing a lot
more<00:06:23.570> attention<00:06:23.660> to<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:24.289> face<00:06:24.620> of<00:06:24.650> these

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
more attention to the face of these

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.000 
more attention to the face of these
trains<00:06:25.460> and<00:06:26.349> giving<00:06:27.349> you<00:06:27.470> that<00:06:27.650> kind<00:06:27.860> of

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
trains and giving you that kind of

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.909 
trains and giving you that kind of
diffuse<00:06:28.700> glow<00:06:29.120> that<00:06:30.050> you<00:06:30.229> can<00:06:30.440> get<00:06:30.650> from

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
diffuse glow that you can get from

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.890 
diffuse glow that you can get from
high-pass<00:06:31.580> filtering<00:06:32.150> and<00:06:32.419> things<00:06:32.659> like<00:06:32.840> that

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
high-pass filtering and things like that

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.920 
high-pass filtering and things like that
up<00:06:33.380> here<00:06:33.440> again<00:06:34.430> a<00:06:34.610> very<00:06:34.880> different<00:06:35.419> look<00:06:35.690> than

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
up here again a very different look than

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.270 
up here again a very different look than
even

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
even

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.440 
even
this<00:06:38.260> filmic<00:06:40.030> treatment<00:06:41.030> for<00:06:41.240> black<00:06:41.420> and

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
this filmic treatment for black and

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.510 
this filmic treatment for black and
white<00:06:41.720> so<00:06:42.110> you<00:06:42.200> can<00:06:42.500> do<00:06:42.650> a<00:06:42.680> lot<00:06:42.980> of<00:06:43.010> different

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
white so you can do a lot of different

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.370 
white so you can do a lot of different
things<00:06:43.790> the<00:06:44.540> other<00:06:44.660> thing<00:06:44.930> that<00:06:44.960> you<00:06:45.200> might

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
things the other thing that you might

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.400 
things the other thing that you might
notice<00:06:45.650> here<00:06:46.160> is<00:06:46.280> a<00:06:47.240> slightly<00:06:48.050> different

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
notice here is a slightly different

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.740 
notice here is a slightly different
amount<00:06:48.889> of<00:06:49.130> distortion<00:06:49.760> what<00:06:50.210> I<00:06:50.240> did<00:06:50.480> is<00:06:50.630> I

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
amount of distortion what I did is I

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.310 
amount of distortion what I did is I
actually<00:06:50.930> use<00:06:51.290> the<00:06:51.440> lens<00:06:52.360> correction<00:06:53.360> here<00:06:53.810> to

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 
actually use the lens correction here to

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.180 
actually use the lens correction here to
change<00:06:54.860> the<00:06:55.100> distortion<00:06:55.700> in<00:06:55.880> this<00:06:56.090> image<00:06:56.360> so

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
change the distortion in this image so

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.400 
change the distortion in this image so
here<00:06:58.190> we<00:06:58.310> have<00:06:58.870> blazing<00:06:59.870> through<00:07:00.050> them<00:07:00.230> real

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
here we have blazing through them real

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.040 
here we have blazing through them real
quick<00:07:00.680> very<00:07:01.639> very<00:07:02.030> different<00:07:02.330> ways<00:07:02.690> to

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
quick very very different ways to

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.790 
quick very very different ways to
visualize<00:07:03.370> this<00:07:04.370> image<00:07:05.169> hurt<00:07:06.169> them<00:07:06.410> to<00:07:06.590> black

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
visualize this image hurt them to black

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.870 
visualize this image hurt them to black
and<00:07:07.040> white<00:07:07.220> using<00:07:08.210> Lightroom<00:07:09.100> so<00:07:10.100> in<00:07:10.430> the
