00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
think it is that we we haven't seen that

think it is that we we haven't seen that
that<00:02:51.150> very<00:02:52.049> good<00:02:52.349> team<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.680> we've<00:02:52.829> seen

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
that very good team that we've seen

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.080 
that very good team that we've seen
especially<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.609> beginning<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
especially in the beginning of the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.289 
especially in the beginning of the
summer<00:02:54.209> split<00:02:54.540> last<00:02:54.720> year<00:02:55.159> hmm<00:02:56.159> I'm<00:02:57.030> not<00:02:57.090> sure

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
summer split last year hmm I'm not sure

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.360 
summer split last year hmm I'm not sure
what<00:02:57.569> happened<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.019> team<00:02:58.230> because<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:58.920> I

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
what happened in the team because it's I

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.949 
what happened in the team because it's I
mean<00:02:59.579> they<00:02:59.670> obviously<00:02:59.790> lost<00:03:00.180> our<00:03:00.420> top<00:03:00.780> lane

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
mean they obviously lost our top lane

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.140 
mean they obviously lost our top lane
and<00:03:01.230> corrupt<00:03:02.190> had<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.459> switch<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.819> mid<00:03:02.970> lane

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
and corrupt had to switch to mid lane

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.640 
and corrupt had to switch to mid lane
but<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.510> don't<00:03:03.780> think<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:03.989> was<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.109> big<00:03:04.349> issue<00:03:04.500> at

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
but I don't think it was a big issue at

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.920 
but I don't think it was a big issue at
all<00:03:04.769> it's<00:03:05.430> more<00:03:05.760> like<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.269> think<00:03:06.659> it<00:03:06.810> was

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
all it's more like that I think it was

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.539 
all it's more like that I think it was
an<00:03:07.140> internal<00:03:07.530> problem<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.069> team<00:03:08.250> in<00:03:08.489> terms

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
an internal problem in the team in terms

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.520 
an internal problem in the team in terms
of<00:03:08.849> communication<00:03:09.269> simply<00:03:10.200> because<00:03:10.319> you

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
of communication simply because you

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.500 
of communication simply because you
could<00:03:10.829> see<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.220> they're<00:03:11.940> not<00:03:12.030> very<00:03:12.239> common

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
could see that they're not very common

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.479 
could see that they're not very common
like<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.379> communication<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.099> team<00:03:14.280> isn't

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
like the communication the team isn't

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.390 
like the communication the team isn't
there<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.030> they<00:03:15.750> don't<00:03:16.470> really<00:03:16.799> have<00:03:17.099> like<00:03:17.130> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
there and they don't really have like a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.159 
there and they don't really have like a
good<00:03:17.609> strategy<00:03:17.760> they<00:03:18.450> just<00:03:18.630> go<00:03:18.750> into<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.989> game

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
good strategy they just go into the game

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.289 
good strategy they just go into the game
hoping<00:03:20.040> they<00:03:20.250> can<00:03:20.310> win<00:03:20.609> through<00:03:20.760> lanes<00:03:20.970> and

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
hoping they can win through lanes and

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.210 
hoping they can win through lanes and
yes<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:21.959> never<00:03:22.230> learned<00:03:22.470> how<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.650> place<00:03:22.919> a<00:03:22.950> team

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
yes I never learned how to place a team

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.129 
yes I never learned how to place a team
pretty<00:03:23.430> much<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.910> maybe<00:03:24.660> there<00:03:24.870> was<00:03:24.959> like

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
pretty much and maybe there was like

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.020 
pretty much and maybe there was like
eternal<00:03:25.530> problems<00:03:25.889> was<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.489> people

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
eternal problems was like people

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.699 
eternal problems was like people
disliking<00:03:27.780> each<00:03:27.900> other<00:03:28.079> something<00:03:28.349> you<00:03:28.560> never

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
disliking each other something you never

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.650 
disliking each other something you never
know<00:03:28.919> but<00:03:29.609> I<00:03:29.639> think<00:03:29.879> there<00:03:30.239> might<00:03:30.359> be<00:03:30.419> problems

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
know but I think there might be problems

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.330 
know but I think there might be problems
in<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.049> team<00:03:31.230> here<00:03:31.379> and<00:03:31.859> obviously<00:03:31.980> tiny

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
in a team here and obviously tiny

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.159 
in a team here and obviously tiny

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
one what is the important factor well I

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
that 00 and nuke dark probably act the

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.909 
that 00 and nuke dark probably act the
best<00:03:53.819> lanes<00:03:54.030> in<00:03:54.419> your<00:03:54.629> right<00:03:54.840> now<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.169> mean

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
best lanes in your right now I mean

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.400 
best lanes in your right now I mean
they're<00:03:56.129> really<00:03:56.370> good<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.959> they<00:03:57.959> have<00:03:58.139> the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
they're really good and they have the

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.039 
they're really good and they have the
individual<00:03:59.160> talent<00:03:59.790> and<00:03:59.970> everything<00:04:00.329> but

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
individual talent and everything but

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.809 
individual talent and everything but
it's<00:04:01.349> all<00:04:01.680> up<00:04:01.889> to<00:04:02.040> them<00:04:02.190> how<00:04:02.370> they<00:04:02.519> perform

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
it's all up to them how they perform

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.640 
it's all up to them how they perform
alarm<00:04:03.060> because<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.660> saw<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.139> past<00:04:04.290> that

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
alarm because I saw in the past that

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.689 
alarm because I saw in the past that
they<00:04:04.829> hadn't<00:04:05.099> have<00:04:05.190> formed<00:04:05.400> really<00:04:05.579> good

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
they hadn't have formed really good

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.559 
they hadn't have formed really good
online<00:04:05.819> and<00:04:06.269> they<00:04:06.840> choked<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:07.560> yeah<00:04:08.400> Game<00:04:09.359> one

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
online and they choked and yeah Game one

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.539 
online and they choked and yeah Game one
will<00:04:09.810> indicate<00:04:10.109> how<00:04:10.470> good<00:04:10.709> they<00:04:10.859> prepared<00:04:11.220> and

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
will indicate how good they prepared and

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.789 
will indicate how good they prepared and
I<00:04:11.910> think<00:04:12.359> both<00:04:12.569> him<00:04:12.810> prepare<00:04:13.410> pretty<00:04:13.650> well

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
I think both him prepare pretty well

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.650 
I think both him prepare pretty well
from<00:04:14.099> what<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.310> could<00:04:14.400> tell<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:14.879> talk<00:04:15.419> to<00:04:15.510> them

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
from what I could tell and talk to them

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.930 
from what I could tell and talk to them
so<00:04:16.349> the<00:04:16.560> priority<00:04:17.039> should<00:04:17.099> be<00:04:17.250> right<00:04:17.519> in<00:04:17.549> terms

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
so the priority should be right in terms

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.360 
so the priority should be right in terms
of<00:04:18.030> pigs<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.630> everything<00:04:19.169> but<00:04:19.320> it's<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:20.099> mental

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
of pigs and everything but it's a mental

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.589 
of pigs and everything but it's a mental
game<00:04:20.430> pretty<00:04:20.729> much<00:04:20.820> like<00:04:21.030> it's<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.269> prepared

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
game pretty much like it's a prepared

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.630 
game pretty much like it's a prepared
then<00:04:22.200> they<00:04:22.919> have<00:04:23.039> a<00:04:23.070> really<00:04:23.280> good<00:04:23.370> chance<00:04:23.430> of

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
then they have a really good chance of

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.540 
then they have a really good chance of
getting<00:04:23.789> in<00:04:24.060> but

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
getting in but

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.249 
getting in but
it<00:04:24.610> can<00:04:24.789> also<00:04:24.940> go<00:04:25.180> completely<00:04:25.780> in<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.110> other

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
it can also go completely in the other

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.710 
it can also go completely in the other
favor<00:04:26.680> of<00:04:26.949> millennium<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.819> think<00:04:28.300> Game<00:04:28.479> one

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
favor of millennium and I think Game one

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.409 
favor of millennium and I think Game one
will<00:04:28.930> decide<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:30.009> series<00:04:30.340> actually<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:31.270> Game

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
will decide the series actually so Game

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.089 
will decide the series actually so Game
one<00:04:31.629> will<00:04:31.780> be<00:04:31.900> incredibly<00:04:32.470> important<00:04:32.889> but<00:04:33.009> I'm

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
one will be incredibly important but I'm

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.050 
one will be incredibly important but I'm
still<00:04:33.340> going<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.580> ask<00:04:33.699> you<00:04:33.879> for<00:04:34.000> your

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
still going to ask you for your

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.550 
still going to ask you for your
predictions<00:04:34.569> for<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.750> series<00:04:35.139> who<00:04:35.289> will<00:04:35.409> make

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
predictions for the series who will make

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.260
