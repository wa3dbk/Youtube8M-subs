00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
duplicate recordings of the same show so

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.639 
duplicate recordings of the same show so
let's<00:01:05.300> say<00:01:05.479> for<00:01:05.509> example<00:01:05.840> I<00:01:06.200> have<00:01:06.320> literally

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
let's say for example I have literally

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.660 
let's say for example I have literally
almost<00:01:07.070> set<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.369> record<00:01:07.460> series<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:09.670> when

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
almost set to record series and when

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.850 
almost set to record series and when
there's<00:01:10.820> me<00:01:10.940> Center<00:01:11.330> just<00:01:11.570> randomly<00:01:11.960> I<00:01:12.259> mean

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
there's me Center just randomly I mean

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.249 
there's me Center just randomly I mean
it<00:01:12.979> may<00:01:13.369> be<00:01:13.430> 9<00:01:14.090> or<00:01:14.119> 10<00:01:14.420> months<00:01:14.450> later<00:01:14.869> but<00:01:15.110> it

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
it may be 9 or 10 months later but it

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.859 
it may be 9 or 10 months later but it
will<00:01:15.350> record<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.009> same<00:01:16.360> airing<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.600> show

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
will record the same airing of a show

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.940 
will record the same airing of a show
over<00:01:18.170> again<00:01:18.920> for<00:01:19.880> example<00:01:23.500> let's<00:01:24.500> go<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.740> look

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950
