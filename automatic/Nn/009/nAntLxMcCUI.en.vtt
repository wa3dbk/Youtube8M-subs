 Milk with undo or that can not 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.220
 resist to try 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:22.060
 Alvaro wonderful we can not cook 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:25.690
 with vanilla 5 eggs and I have them here 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.119
 hulled 5 eggs that are 8 pesos a 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.280
 total cost of the 24 peso prescription with 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:35.920
 12 cents now look me out there from 2 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.990
 can you pass me a list that of 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.170
 a basket an old lady who left in the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.750
 basket in the cups of the milkmaid 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.880
 past milk to make the plans ok and 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.280
 what I do is obviously spend very 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.050
 ok the can opener although afterwards as I 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.550
 there are residues here what I do is with 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:58.660
 a sandpaper 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:00.730
 I do this to the metal bits that 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.350
 it looks great and there is something else here 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.110
 also that when we take away the 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.840
 label is this different 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.060
 what I do is in the direct flame 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.430
 this I paste I just put there and when I already 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.200
 half burns he passes a traffic and I 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.730
 is clean so he does not want me 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.850
 this stuck ok 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.000
 we have that in minutes now I have 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.530
 here already for a matter of time you have to 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.290
 really express is the water with the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.800
 flour that falls like a paste like a 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.430
 paste once it's like this all that 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.510
 is going to do I do not have to let it cool 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:40.510
 hot for reasons of time but 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.080
 so we do not know exactly if not 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.080
 here 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.920
 for me it's already there we have it here 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:01.239
 was for five custards to five plans 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.239
 who already has candy 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.200
 you can buy truth exactly if you do not 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.090
 they want to do it I prefer to do it 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.459
 you know what we do is leave it a 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.050
 little bit cool ok very well when 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.730
 I put here the candy what I'm going to 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.819
 to do is to ar very carefully 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.650
 because the part of the bottom of which the 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.980
 cup is hot the devil a 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.019
 bit and put it to the rest I will 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.470
 I put and we're going to put the mixer in there 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:33.769
 water bath 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:41.599
 We are going to do banking, the cost is 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:43.760
 5 pesos if we can continue there is already 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.190
 we have another one and this amount of 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.830
 sugar that is 150 grams reaches us 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.959
 perfectly for 5 although I already have 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.459
 here but I to measure it obviously 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.170
 how is a kitchen to do business 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.300
 clear then what I'm going to do is 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.720
 measure it with a measuring cup though 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:04.490
 but it will be the first refusal right now is already 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.610
 then let's empty our plan 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.860
 although already with the candy down 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.210
 so that I get out if we're going to put in 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.400
 bain marie and I put it in this mold 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.780
 round that is for cake and I do not know 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.690
 how much are we going to bake at one hundred and eighty 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.550
 180 by 4 about an hour 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.110
 as an hour will vary a bit in 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.300
 its ovens because obviously everyone 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:33.540
 it's different more serious the plan is 80 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.130
 forgive more than packing the motto that is 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.170
 in what I serve it that exactly there 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.890
 I have my teaspoon tea teaspoon 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.350
 and the appetite and costs in total 5 pesos 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.970
 with 10 cents everything already prorated 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.700
 together with the base is where we are going to 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.790
 serve with all the ingredients the 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.580
 cost per plan is 5 pesos with 10 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.860
 cents and the sale to the public is 15 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.500
 weights pesos so we are earning a 200 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.230
 percent percent is very good very 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.630
 good if it comes out and the truth that one sees 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.570
 more mais the truth, not because up to 18 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.460
 weights have up to 20 pesos because 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.650
 Yes here we are entering the cost 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.600
 we have here is with milk with hai with 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.840
 homemade candy but also 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.790
 we make substitutes 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.790
 and obviously it saves us time and money 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.150
 approximately one tablespoon of 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.120
 portland portland candy where up 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.140
 here it is ready I have my bags 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.140
 I'm going to put it upside down 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:46.340
 and then we go to a commercial cut and 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.340
 coming back since I have here 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:53.870
 the chocolate magazine 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.610
 jorge Ã¡lvarez and all just appeared 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.710
 on screen a conversion cut and it's 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.270
 national presenter of all 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.080
 dishes that we made the day drone this 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.080
 Danish corner 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.510
 that they had a wailing area 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.740
 do not leave because you think the presentation 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.090
 end of the media and we are all 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.139
 running in this studio so that 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.139
 then tell us the truth 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.899
 there is something missing 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:40.869
 here I mashed the penalty around or 32 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:49.910
 in life then do not put much 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.260
 attention and they say put your five 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.240
 senses on the screen so you do not 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.560
 forget nothing because everything is delicious to 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.780
 starting next week look for a 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.010
