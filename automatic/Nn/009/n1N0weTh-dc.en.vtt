00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
is getting stronger basically so is the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.240 
is getting stronger basically so is the
rest<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.629> Navi<00:00:40.020> there's<00:00:40.649> only<00:00:40.800> there's<00:00:41.070> only

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
rest of Navi there's only there's only

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.500 
rest of Navi there's only there's only
so<00:00:41.460> much<00:00:41.579> more<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> could<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.480> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
so much more here I could do this is a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.240 
so much more here I could do this is a
team<00:00:42.750> game<00:00:42.780> after<00:00:43.230> all<00:00:43.260> yeah<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.219> true

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
team game after all yeah that is true
