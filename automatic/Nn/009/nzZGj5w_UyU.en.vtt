teeth<00:00:24.000> which<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.990> be<00:00:25.170> pretty<00:00:25.650> common

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
teeth which to be pretty common

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.089 
teeth which to be pretty common
post-surgery<00:00:27.420> not<00:00:28.019> quite<00:00:28.230> sure<00:00:28.260> why<00:00:28.710> but

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
post-surgery not quite sure why but

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.429 
post-surgery not quite sure why but
seems<00:00:29.640> pretty<00:00:29.820> common<00:00:30.240> anyway<00:00:30.900> at<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.230> stage

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
seems pretty common anyway at this stage

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.799 
them in a box formation in the album
bowlers<00:00:41.610> um<00:00:43.129> there's<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.399> less<00:00:45.000> space<00:00:45.360> for

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
bowlers um there's like less space for

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.250 
bowlers um there's like less space for
the<00:00:45.930> elastic<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.530> hook<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.160> hooks<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:48.260> so

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the elastic to hook on the hooks and so

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
the elastic to hook on the hooks and so

from that sub from that motion anyway so

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.899 
from that sub from that motion anyway so
it's<00:01:11.760> basically<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.689> um<00:01:13.760> conditioning<00:01:14.760> me

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
it's basically like um conditioning me

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.969 
it's basically like um conditioning me
to<00:01:15.030> shut<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.380> um<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.900> that's<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> orthodontist

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.080 
staff he's very happy with everything
probably<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.159> next<00:01:23.310> time<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.790> might<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.030> able

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
probably the next time you might be able

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.270

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
basically depends if the adjustments

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.550 
basically depends if the adjustments
worked<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.640> my<00:01:29.850> back<00:01:30.329> bite<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.200> left

eating the skins of things because it's

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.420 
eating the skins of things because it's

got so many good nutrients in it but um

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.370 
got so many good nutrients in it but um
it's<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.550> bit<00:05:15.700> difficult<00:05:15.850> for<00:05:16.090> now<00:05:16.300> so<00:05:16.750> are

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
it's a bit difficult for now so are

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.680 
it's a bit difficult for now so are
either<00:05:17.770> if<00:05:18.220> it's<00:05:18.430> not<00:05:18.640> like<00:05:19.060> chopped<00:05:19.330> up<00:05:19.510> or

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
either if it's not like chopped up or

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.260 
either if it's not like chopped up or
something<00:05:19.990> small<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:20.680> small<00:05:21.010> amounts<00:05:21.550> um<00:05:21.670> I

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
something small and small amounts um I

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.000 
something small and small amounts um I
have<00:05:22.780> a<00:05:22.810> really<00:05:23.080> hard<00:05:23.260> time<00:05:23.380> chewing<00:05:23.770> the

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
have a really hard time chewing the

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.700 
have a really hard time chewing the
skins<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:25.510> I<00:05:25.570> think<00:05:25.780> that's<00:05:25.930> more<00:05:26.170> because<00:05:26.560> of

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
skins and I think that's more because of

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.560 
skins and I think that's more because of
the<00:05:26.860> soreness<00:05:27.370> from<00:05:27.400> the<00:05:27.730> adjustments<00:05:28.330> and

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
the soreness from the adjustments and

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.030 
the soreness from the adjustments and
from<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:29.200> oral<00:05:29.770> surgery<00:05:30.420> so<00:05:31.420> I<00:05:31.840> can't<00:05:32.830> really

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
from the oral surgery so I can't really

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.180 
from the oral surgery so I can't really
gauge<00:05:33.310> which<00:05:33.790> is<00:05:33.970> which<00:05:34.120> but<00:05:34.480> so<00:05:35.380> but<00:05:36.040> that's

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
gauge which is which but so but that's

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.500 
gauge which is which but so but that's
kind<00:05:36.400> of<00:05:36.460> what<00:05:36.700> I'm<00:05:36.790> feeling<00:05:36.970> right<00:05:37.180> now<00:05:37.480> as

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
kind of what I'm feeling right now as

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.800 
kind of what I'm feeling right now as
far<00:05:37.780> as<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.500> chewy<00:05:38.800> abilities<00:05:39.660> the<00:05:40.660> other

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
far as the chewy abilities the other

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.510 
far as the chewy abilities the other
weird<00:05:41.170> thing<00:05:41.380> is<00:05:41.500> because<00:05:41.800> my<00:05:41.950> teeth<00:05:42.160> are<00:05:42.310> knob

weird thing is because my teeth are knob
I<00:05:42.730> feel<00:05:43.300> a<00:05:43.330> lot<00:05:43.480> of<00:05:43.840> that<00:05:43.960> pressure<00:05:44.320> feeling

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
I feel a lot of that pressure feeling

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.790 
I feel a lot of that pressure feeling
what<00:05:45.520> I<00:05:45.550> biting<00:05:46.000> into<00:05:46.150> something<00:05:46.690> so<00:05:47.380> it's

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
what I biting into something so it's

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.470 
what I biting into something so it's
uncomfortable<00:05:50.340> so<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:51.850> I<00:05:51.910> think<00:05:52.150> that's<00:05:52.270> what

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
uncomfortable so and I think that's what

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.030 
uncomfortable so and I think that's what
probably<00:05:52.630> why<00:05:52.900> I<00:05:52.930> avoid<00:05:53.350> a<00:05:53.380> lot<00:05:53.650> of<00:05:53.710> like

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
probably why I avoid a lot of like

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.340 
probably why I avoid a lot of like
biting<00:05:54.670> into<00:05:54.850> stuff<00:05:55.300> like<00:05:55.570> the<00:05:55.960> corner<00:05:56.230> of<00:05:56.260> the

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350

cob was fun to try and everything but I

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.620
