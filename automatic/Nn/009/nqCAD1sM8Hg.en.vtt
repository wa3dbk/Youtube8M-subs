who<00:00:05.670> looks<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.750> see<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.290> a

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
who looks and you see this is a

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.440 
who looks and you see this is a
prototype<00:00:08.130> where<00:00:08.519> we've<00:00:08.700> actually<00:00:08.820> bent<00:00:09.300> the

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
prototype where we've actually bent the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.540 
prototype where we've actually bent the
edge<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.599> little<00:00:09.780> bit<00:00:09.990> now<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.190> one<00:00:11.370> that

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
edge a little bit now this is one that

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.190 
edge a little bit now this is one that
actually<00:00:11.730> has<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.090> bit<00:00:12.360> more<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.690> dish<00:00:12.929> shape

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
actually has a bit more of a dish shape

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.410 
actually has a bit more of a dish shape
to<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.710> can<00:00:13.830> see<00:00:14.040> there's<00:00:14.250> some<00:00:14.940> contour

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
to it you can see there's some contour

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.349 
to it you can see there's some contour
and<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:17.029> ok<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.210> that's<00:00:18.539> voyage<00:00:19.939> yeah<00:00:20.939> looks

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
and I ok and that's voyage yeah looks

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.640 
and I ok and that's voyage yeah looks
like<00:00:21.449> about<00:00:21.720> four<00:00:21.900> inch<00:00:22.050> maybe<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.380> little<00:00:22.470> bit

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
like about four inch maybe a little bit

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.990 
like about four inch maybe a little bit
more<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.550> think<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.119> one<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.960> has<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> simple

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
more I think this one just has a simple

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000 
more I think this one just has a simple
this<00:00:27.000> one's<00:00:27.180> actually<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.539> dish<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:27.930> well<00:00:28.010> but

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
this one's actually a dish as well but

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.070 
this one's actually a dish as well but
it's<00:00:29.189> got<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> its<00:00:29.699> got<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.300> slot<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.929> one

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
it's got a its got a slot in this one

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.380 
it's got a its got a slot in this one
right<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.160> these<00:00:32.279> are<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.579> some<00:00:32.730> future

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
right so these are just some future

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.900 
right so these are just some future
design<00:00:33.780> options<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.219> what<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:35.820> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
design options and what to do is if you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.819 
design options and what to do is if you
take<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.300> ball<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.870> press<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
take that ball and you press on the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.100 
take that ball and you press on the
target<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.120> break<00:00:41.329> room<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.870> didn't

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
target you can break room so it didn't

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.580 
target you can break room so it didn't
take<00:00:43.260> much<00:00:43.469> right<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.969> also<00:00:45.440> you<00:00:46.440> can

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
take much right so you can also you can

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.520 
take much right so you can also you can
also<00:00:46.739> chemically<00:00:47.160> temper<00:00:47.850> soda<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.510> okay<00:00:49.320> in

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
also chemically temper soda one okay in

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.110 
also chemically temper soda one okay in
a<00:00:49.590> willing<00:00:49.920> parts<00:00:50.190> Trenck<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.610> you'll<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:50.969> if

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
a willing parts Trenck as you'll see if

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.450 
a willing parts Trenck as you'll see if
you<00:00:51.239> try<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> break<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.309> it'll<00:00:53.309> give<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
you try to break that one it'll give a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.760 
you try to break that one it'll give a
little<00:00:53.610> bit<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:53.910> resistance<00:00:54.469> again<00:00:55.469> same

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
little bit more resistance again same

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.660 
little bit more resistance again same
thickness<00:00:56.039> same<00:00:56.460> vibration<00:00:56.969> pattern<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:59.340> so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
thickness same vibration pattern and so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760 
thickness same vibration pattern and so
now<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.239> gorilla<00:01:00.629> glass<00:01:00.870> right<00:01:01.530> this

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
now this is the gorilla glass right this

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.880 
now this is the gorilla glass right this
is<00:01:01.920> ours<00:01:02.129> same<00:01:02.579> thickness<00:01:02.850> 1.1<00:01:03.710> we'll<00:01:04.710> wait<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
is ours same thickness 1.1 we'll wait a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.600 
is ours same thickness 1.1 we'll wait a
minute<00:01:05.189> oh<00:01:06.020> ok<00:01:07.020> ok<00:01:07.049> take<00:01:07.439> two<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> girl

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
minute oh ok ok take two this is a girl

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.850 
minute oh ok ok take two this is a girl
go<00:01:08.820> out<00:01:08.939> same<00:01:09.180> sort<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> thing<00:01:09.590> again<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.740> get

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
go out same sort of thing again you get

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.250 
go out same sort of thing again you get
that<00:01:10.979> deeper<00:01:11.490> compressive<00:01:12.450> layer<00:01:12.659> which

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that deeper compressive layer which

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.340 
that deeper compressive layer which
makes<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.710> more<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.189> continual<00:01:14.820> damage<00:01:15.350> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
makes it more just continual damage and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.270 
makes it more just continual damage and
you<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.590> press<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.950> press<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.220> press

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
you can press and press and press

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.710 
you can press and press and press
actually<00:01:17.820> I've<00:01:17.880> been<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.420> few<00:01:18.689> of

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
actually I've been going to a few of

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.910 
actually I've been going to a few of
these<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.140> we've<00:01:19.259> got<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.500> or<00:01:19.619> two<00:01:19.770> people

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
these and we've got one or two people

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.880 
these and we've got one or two people
that<00:01:20.130> could<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:20.850> tough<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.150> do

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.810 

I<00:01:26.440> just<00:01:27.440> want<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:27.680> try<00:01:27.890> for<00:01:27.950> our<00:01:28.430> readers<00:01:30.820> okay

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
I just want to try for our readers okay

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.630 
I just want to try for our readers okay
now<00:01:32.060> that's<00:01:32.600> pretty<00:01:33.020> this<00:01:33.350> graduate<00:01:33.920> no<00:01:34.100> no

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
now that's pretty this graduate no no

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.010 
now that's pretty this graduate no no
that's<00:01:34.880> just<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:35.360> we<00:01:35.510> have<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.840> put<00:01:35.990> the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
that's just so we have to put the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.990 
that's just so we have to put the
plastic<00:01:36.260> on<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:36.680> in<00:01:36.950> case<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.310> does<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.880> know<00:01:37.970> I

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
plastic on it in case it does you know I

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.060 
plastic on it in case it does you know I
right<00:01:38.900> right<00:01:39.140> right<00:01:39.170> want<00:01:39.590> anybody<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:39.920> cut

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
right right right want anybody to cut

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.710 
right right right want anybody to cut
themselves<00:01:40.250> but<00:01:40.940> believe<00:01:41.210> me<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.450> there's

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
themselves but believe me this there's

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.940 
themselves but believe me this there's
nothing<00:01:41.990> on<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.170> trees<00:01:42.530> can<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:42.770> talk<00:01:42.920> about

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
nothing on the trees can you talk about

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.410 
nothing on the trees can you talk about
the<00:01:43.160> technology<00:01:43.430> behind<00:01:43.759> it<00:01:44.000> one<00:01:44.150> more<00:01:44.240> time

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
the technology behind it one more time

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.469 
the technology behind it one more time
are<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:44.960> sure<00:01:45.110> yeah<00:01:45.650> I<00:01:45.680> can<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.550> basically

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
are you sure yeah I can so basically

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.040 
are you sure yeah I can so basically
what<00:01:47.869> we<00:01:48.020> have<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.740> an<00:01:49.580> alkali<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.450> Lumina

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
what we have is an alkali the Lumina

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.620 
what we have is an alkali the Lumina
silicon<00:01:51.500> glass<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:54.440> alkali<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.630> incident

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
silicon glass and the alkali is incident

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.719 
silicon glass and the alkali is incident
has<00:01:56.720> sodium<00:01:57.110> and<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.220> way<00:01:58.310> we<00:01:58.460> make<00:01:58.610> it

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
has sodium and so the way we make it

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.969 
has sodium and so the way we make it
strong<00:01:59.030> and<00:01:59.300> put<00:01:59.600> this<00:01:59.690> class<00:01:59.930> in<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.560> salt<00:02:00.830> bath

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
strong and put this class in a salt bath

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
a bigger molecule when the glass cools

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.719 
a bigger molecule when the glass cools

edge lit sort of work which means

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.070 
edge lit sort of work which means
they're<00:02:21.470> getting<00:02:21.709> thinner

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.620 

and<00:02:24.890> as<00:02:24.980> they<00:02:25.130> get<00:02:25.250> thinner<00:02:25.550> one<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.480> ways

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
and as they get thinner one of the ways

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.250 
and as they get thinner one of the ways
that<00:02:28.360> brands<00:02:29.360> could<00:02:29.510> differentiate<00:02:29.900> their

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
that brands could differentiate their

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.660 
that brands could differentiate their
models<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:30.740> by<00:02:30.950> putting<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.340> sort<00:02:31.520> of<00:02:31.550> this

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
models this by putting a sort of this

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.990 
models this by putting a sort of this
edge<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.120> edge<00:02:32.240> sleek<00:02:33.520> design<00:02:34.520> out<00:02:34.760> there<00:02:34.910> in

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
edge to edge sleek design out there in

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.730 
edge to edge sleek design out there in
the<00:02:35.060> marketplace<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:36.110> when<00:02:36.380> they<00:02:36.530> do<00:02:36.590> that

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
the marketplace and when they do that

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.520 
the marketplace and when they do that
they<00:02:37.430> don't<00:02:37.610> want<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.820> put<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:37.970> very<00:02:38.150> thick

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
they don't want to put a very thick

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.560 
they don't want to put a very thick
substrate<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.740> front<00:02:40.090> let's<00:02:41.090> get<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.330> very

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
substrate on the front let's get a very

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.940 
substrate on the front let's get a very
thin<00:02:41.870> that's<00:02:42.170> what<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:42.410> give<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.770> role

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
thin that's what you give it the role

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.930 
thin that's what you give it the role
and<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.660> this<00:02:44.870> will<00:02:45.050> be<00:02:45.170> on<00:02:45.320> a<00:02:45.350> TV<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:46.520> models

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
and so this will be on a TV in models

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.370 
and so this will be on a TV in models
coming<00:02:47.210> up<00:02:47.390> it's<00:02:47.510> printing<00:02:47.900> on<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.140> back<00:02:48.350> of

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
coming up it's printing on the back of

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.530 
coming up it's printing on the back of
Gorilla<00:02:48.830> Glass<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.120> course<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.420> can

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
Gorilla Glass and so of course you can

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.180 
Gorilla Glass and so of course you can
see<00:02:50.720> through<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:50.990> it's<00:02:51.170> optically<00:02:51.620> very<00:02:51.830> clear

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
see through it it's optically very clear

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.250 
see through it it's optically very clear
and<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:53.270> can<00:02:53.480> make<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.660> lot<00:02:53.870> of<00:02:53.900> different

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
and you can make a lot of different

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.470 
and you can make a lot of different
designs<00:02:54.560> right<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.580> could<00:02:55.700> imagine<00:02:55.880> maybe<00:02:56.270> on

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
designs right you could imagine maybe on

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.980 
designs right you could imagine maybe on
the<00:02:56.570> back<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:57.700> laptop<00:02:58.700> you'd<00:02:59.360> have<00:02:59.510> still

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
the back of a laptop you'd have still

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.600 
the back of a laptop you'd have still
the<00:03:00.020> scratch<00:03:00.470> resistance<00:03:00.980> of<00:03:01.130> Gorilla<00:03:01.400> Glass

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
the scratch resistance of Gorilla Glass

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.900 
the scratch resistance of Gorilla Glass
but<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.540> could<00:03:02.660> have<00:03:02.780> some<00:03:02.959> very<00:03:03.140> unique

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
but you could have some very unique

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.090 
but you could have some very unique
styles<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:05.090> brands<00:03:05.480> could<00:03:05.709> put<00:03:06.709> on<00:03:06.800> there<00:03:07.010> to

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
styles that brands could put on there to

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.860 
styles that brands could put on there to
differentiate<00:03:07.670> their<00:03:07.880> product<00:03:08.240> or<00:03:08.360> maybe

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
differentiate their product or maybe

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.760 
differentiate their product or maybe
even<00:03:08.959> potentially<00:03:09.590> consumers<00:03:10.190> could<00:03:10.370> custom
