00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.880
 sides shoots a guy getting 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.530
 exploit the fusion coils that 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.900
 they were exactly behind there we see how 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.879
 the bullet bounced and hit exactly the 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.070
 coils making the enemy explode 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.930

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.670

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.830
 another who came ahead doing his 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.750
 epic win 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.790
 in the number 8 comes to a move of 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.340
 melissa 14 is with 9 but it will be 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.470

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.560
 like a guy who was coming out there and good 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.240
 this last subject was already about to 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.310
 kill her but good he managed to make her one 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.870
 excellent matrix then good there 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.610
 they ended a guy who came from behind 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.230
 He finished his little streak but hey 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.120
 there is not over everything sees that it is 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.680
 coming out an enemy on the back wants 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.170
 make an attempt two attempts three 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.870
 attempts and in the fourth he gets to do 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.180
 its 3 sixty super mega turbo today we're going to 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.130
 see how he did it here we see how 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.229
 it seems that it is spinning like that trying to 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.240
 shoot the subject but well this is not 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.430
 it was the third was the fourth where it was 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.440
 the vanquished there managed to shoot him and 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.890
 getting his headshot for the number 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.890
 8 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.730
 say epic fail of mini declare in the 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.810
 number 7 where is with the enemies 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.850
 seeing them he wants to shoot and for 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.710
 suicide with his cards and see how it is 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.600
 that the walls then come to troll 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.370
 from time to time he shot him there not 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.840
 It seemed like he was going to die but hey 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.060
 suicided unfortunately 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.370
 and in the number 6 we have an epic 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.290
 fail of snot 76 but this time 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.849
 is with the rocket you are in 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.680
 with an enemy valley then what you 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.019
 does is shoot him with his missiles the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.910
 fury but hey the banch was about 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.890
 to kill him not before then decided 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.540
 better steal it to save yourself and it's gone 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.489
 happy about life but forgot that those 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.489
 missiles were still heading to the bungee 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.319
 and well, I had to die is what 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.299
 happens when you launch missiles at 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.129
 enemies the kidnappings and well then there 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.319
 we see how the missiles arrived pop what 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.569
 they killed unfortunately also with a 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.140
 epic fail and good there remains in the number 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.140
 6 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.810
 and we have halo reach 430 in the number 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.600
 5 and this time it's going to be a small 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.740
 killing in what is being m 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.450
 and well, here we see how it is 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.120
 shooting strips to the head with the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.410
 of m &amp; r of excellent precision here 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.300
 we see that he makes triple death the type that 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.750
 he already came with the sniper and he makes his 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.430
 excellent extermination doing his epic 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.430

 not one but with double epic fail here 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.569
 we see how his friends went through and 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.700
 Well, I was saying on the verge of 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.770
 shoot the one that came from behind and 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.330
 well, they had to take the picture 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.459
 from the wrong place his friends 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.160
 getting double shot to the epic head 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.080
 fail for your classmates and we arrived in 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.520

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.810
 wee's where good is with the sniper 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.580
 first you will start making a new 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.290
 excellent hub to a guy who came 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.430
 running around back then good it 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.860
 find another one that was coming up 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.510
 platform shoots him and this guy that 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.280
 He came from behind is not for nothing that is 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.709
 heir but good what I liked about 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.010
 final was that let's say that the last shot 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.540
 it was half 360 or 180 lol but good 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.519
 there we see how he turns around and achieves 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.900
 shoot him doing new cut and epic 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.269
 win for number 3 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.500
 in the dossier wins again melissa 14 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.390
 but this time it happened 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.250
 several things that not even I still 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.200
 First of all, he understands him. 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.060
 shoot in the distance an enemy that was going 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.250
 going up then your partner will 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.590
 he went through but he managed to betray 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.380
 but already when they killed her she appears and 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.509
 a colleague betrays her say 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.180
 that appeared and was let's say something like 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.340
 instant karma for shooting at 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.350
 his partner unconsciously but 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.240
 good as it recovers and returns to 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.919
 shoot this other guy who also 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.350
 it was decorated for the photo but not 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.030
 they know how to position themselves well they go out 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.430
 they care and well then here we see how 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.880
 the murdered here appears and his partner 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.350
 gave shot to the head equal everything was 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.449
 unconsciously since it was his 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.460
 I reappeared normal sleep here we see how 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.289
 betrayal of the other guy and well then there 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.080
 several pixels happened to him and that's what 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.970
 called instant and good karma in the 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.520
 number one we have two clips that we what 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.410
 they send here alone where good to this I 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.720
 I could call it the art of 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.300
 murders I do not know very well if this has 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.030
 itself a name or something like that but good 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.740
 itself what this guy did was that he did 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.750
 some pretty good murders here 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.960
 we see as even from a platform 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.240
 with your cannon your concussion cannon here 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.120
 we see that he is positioning himself wants 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.830
 plan a master murder then 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.870
 good shoots the walls 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.150
 bounce comes out jump no and well there we see 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.610
 as he murders the green elite that 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.590
 had gone through and well this second 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.210
 let's say it was something similar but 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.919
 it was with the help of a colleague of his 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.569
 here we see that your partner is also 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.490
 the one that has the weapon now jumps on 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:42.139
 he and manages to make him a matrix of this type 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.539

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.729
