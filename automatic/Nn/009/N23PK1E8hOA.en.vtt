ninety-nine cents and it from the looks

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.750 
ninety-nine cents and it from the looks
of<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.470> website<00:00:29.890> it<00:00:30.039> looks<00:00:30.070> like<00:00:30.369> one<00:00:30.550> of<00:00:30.580> the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
of the website it looks like one of the

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.439

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030

guide the instructions just to see

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.090 
guide the instructions just to see
exactly<00:01:58.540> how<00:01:59.229> I'm<00:01:59.380> supposed<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.829> put<00:02:00.009> this

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
exactly how I'm supposed to put this

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.340 
exactly how I'm supposed to put this

need to find the front support which is

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.819 
need to find the front support which is
this<00:02:04.899> piece<00:02:05.290> here<00:02:07.019> this<00:02:08.019> small<00:02:08.349> little<00:02:08.530> tab

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:08.829 
this piece here this small little tab

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.100 
this piece here this small little tab
here<00:02:09.039> is<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.340> front<00:02:09.489> support<00:02:09.819> and<00:02:10.329> then<00:02:10.750> in

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
here is the front support and then in

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.989 
here is the front support and then in
order<00:02:11.439> to<00:02:11.590> get<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.890> lightning<00:02:12.280> cable<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.819> work

order to get the lightning cable to work

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.580 
order to get the lightning cable to work
properly<00:02:13.269> obviously<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.930> put<00:02:14.139> it<00:02:14.260> through

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
properly obviously you put it through

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.890 
the hole in the front
of<00:02:17.909> the<00:02:18.150> stand<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.930> then<00:02:19.049> that<00:02:19.319> feeds<00:02:19.769> through

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
of the stand and then that feeds through

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.839 
of the stand and then that feeds through
this<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:24.599> front<00:02:24.900> support<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.829> believe<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.609> goes

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
this the front support I believe it goes

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.699 
this the front support I believe it goes
this<00:02:27.540> way<00:02:29.359> and<00:02:30.359> then<00:02:30.450> once<00:02:30.659> that's<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:31.200> place<00:02:31.230> i

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
this way and then once that's in place i

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.059 
this way and then once that's in place i
can<00:02:31.889> now<00:02:32.010> screw<00:02:33.109> the<00:02:34.109> cable<00:02:34.560> kinda<00:02:34.829> gets

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
can now screw the cable kinda gets

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.649 
can now screw the cable kinda gets
fitted<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.700> here<00:02:37.849> it<00:02:38.849> gets<00:02:39.120> held<00:02:39.420> very

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
fitted in here it gets held very

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.839 
fitted in here it gets held very
securely<00:02:40.200> inside<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.829> base<00:02:40.980> now<00:02:41.219> it's<00:02:41.370> pretty

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
securely inside the base now it's pretty

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.250 
securely inside the base now it's pretty
much<00:02:42.000> all<00:02:42.209> made<00:02:42.420> out<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.599> brushed<00:02:43.019> aluminium

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
much all made out of brushed aluminium

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.699 
much all made out of brushed aluminium
like<00:02:43.950> most<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.689> twelve<00:02:45.689> south<00:02:45.989> stands<00:02:46.409> and

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
like most of twelve south stands and

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.679 
like most of twelve south stands and
docks<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:48.980> always<00:02:49.980> find<00:02:50.189> with<00:02:50.459> 12<00:02:50.819> south<00:02:51.120> there

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
docks I always find with 12 south there

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.539 
docks I always find with 12 south there
stands<00:02:52.139> and<00:02:52.469> things<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.040> have<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.189> screw

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
stands and things that you have to screw

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.009 
stands and things that you have to screw
together<00:02:53.790> there's<00:02:54.209> always<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.659> kind<00:02:54.870> of

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
together there's always that kind of

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.949 
together there's always that kind of
element<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.310> fun<00:02:56.549> of<00:02:56.760> constructing<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.599> almost

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
element of fun of constructing it almost

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.839 
element of fun of constructing it almost
like<00:02:58.230> when<00:02:58.680> you're<00:02:58.859> a<00:02:58.889> kid<00:02:59.129> in<00:02:59.340> your<00:02:59.459> making

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
like when you're a kid in your making

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.140 
like when you're a kid in your making
meccano<00:03:00.269> or<00:03:01.260> lego<00:03:01.769> or<00:03:02.069> just<00:03:02.250> screwing<00:03:03.000> things

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
meccano or lego or just screwing things

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.530 
meccano or lego or just screwing things
together<00:03:03.449> I<00:03:04.790> think<00:03:05.790> that's<00:03:06.150> really<00:03:06.419> quite

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
together I think that's really quite

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.319 
together I think that's really quite
awesome<00:03:07.099> this<00:03:08.099> screw<00:03:08.579> doesn't<00:03:08.790> appear<00:03:09.299> to

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
awesome this screw doesn't appear to

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.280 
awesome this screw doesn't appear to
have<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.980> right<00:03:11.189> end<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:12.000> I'm<00:03:12.269> gonna<00:03:12.449> pop

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
have the right end so I'm gonna pop

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.679 
have the right end so I'm gonna pop
another<00:03:13.590> one<00:03:13.799> in<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.730> now<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.909> front<00:03:15.209> parts<00:03:15.569> in

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
another one in so now the front parts in

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.000 
another one in so now the front parts in
place<00:03:15.900> then<00:03:16.139> you<00:03:16.230> have<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.439> choose<00:03:16.680> which<00:03:16.949> of

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
place then you have to choose which of

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.830 
place then you have to choose which of
these<00:03:17.370> clips<00:03:17.790> you're<00:03:18.000> going<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.359> put<00:03:18.569> in<00:03:18.719> now

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
these clips you're going to put in now

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.599 
these clips you're going to put in now
because<00:03:19.169> I<00:03:19.290> don't<00:03:19.469> really<00:03:19.680> use<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.010> thick<00:03:20.579> a

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
because I don't really use that thick a

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.030 
because I don't really use that thick a
case<00:03:20.939> on<00:03:21.209> my<00:03:21.389> iPhone<00:03:21.810> I'm<00:03:22.379> just<00:03:22.650> going<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.829> pop

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
case on my iPhone I'm just going to pop

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.149 
case on my iPhone I'm just going to pop
the<00:03:23.340> first<00:03:23.579> clip<00:03:23.879> clip<00:03:24.180> 0<00:03:24.479> in<00:03:24.780> if<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:25.859> use<00:03:25.919> an

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
the first clip clip 0 in if you use an

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.710 
the first clip clip 0 in if you use an
otterbox<00:03:26.609> or<00:03:26.790> something<00:03:27.120> like<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.479> can

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
otterbox or something like that you can

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.210 
otterbox or something like that you can
use<00:03:27.900> one<00:03:28.109> of<00:03:28.139> the<00:03:28.319> other<00:03:28.349> clips<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:28.979> it<00:03:29.040> just

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
use one of the other clips and it just

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.469 
use one of the other clips and it just
helps<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.549> raise<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.060> little<00:03:30.269> bit<00:03:30.479> higher<00:03:32.479> so

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:33.479 
helps to raise it a little bit higher so

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:37.490 
helps to raise it a little bit higher so
let's<00:03:33.659> just<00:03:33.900> pop<00:03:34.199> that<00:03:34.229> in<00:03:34.620> there<00:03:36.349> and<00:03:37.349> then

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
let's just pop that in there and then

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.679 
let's just pop that in there and then
slide<00:03:37.889> it<00:03:37.919> downwards<00:03:38.639> and<00:03:38.879> then<00:03:39.359> I'll<00:03:39.509> pull

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
slide it downwards and then I'll pull

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:47.240 
slide it downwards and then I'll pull
the<00:03:39.810> cable<00:03:40.229> through<00:03:44.060> like<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.919> you<00:03:46.919> can<00:03:47.069> see

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
the cable through like so you can see

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.670 
the cable through like so you can see
your<00:03:47.519> lightning<00:03:47.790> cable<00:03:48.359> is<00:03:48.479> then<00:03:48.720> quite

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
your lightning cable is then quite

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.640 
your lightning cable is then quite
nicely<00:03:50.069> attached<00:03:51.139> almost<00:03:52.139> like<00:03:52.290> it's<00:03:52.470> meant

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
nicely attached almost like it's meant

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.229 
nicely attached almost like it's meant
to<00:03:52.769> be<00:03:52.829> part<00:03:53.129> of<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.340> dock<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:53.609> that's<00:03:53.909> kind

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
to be part of the dock and that's kind

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.699 
to be part of the dock and that's kind
of<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.479> beauty<00:03:54.659> of<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.079> design<00:03:55.439> of<00:03:55.470> this

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
of the beauty of the design of this

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.770 
of the beauty of the design of this
thing's<00:03:56.009> actually<00:03:56.220> they've<00:03:57.209> made<00:03:57.419> it<00:03:57.569> so<00:03:57.750> that

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
thing's actually they've made it so that

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.179 
thing's actually they've made it so that
it<00:03:58.019> doesn't<00:03:58.169> feel<00:03:58.470> like<00:03:58.530> you've<00:03:58.829> just<00:03:58.859> got<00:03:59.159> a

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
it doesn't feel like you've just got a

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.530 
it doesn't feel like you've just got a
lightning<00:03:59.579> cable<00:03:59.939> in<00:04:00.030> there<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.329> almost

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
lightning cable in there it's almost

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.979 
lightning cable in there it's almost
like<00:04:00.780> it's<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.109> it's<00:04:01.500> it's<00:04:01.680> own<00:04:01.889> proper<00:04:02.370> doc<00:04:02.989> now

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
like it's a it's it's own proper doc now

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.509 
like it's a it's it's own proper doc now
depending<00:04:04.469> on<00:04:04.560> what<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.799> want<00:04:04.979> to<00:04:05.069> place<00:04:05.250> in

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
you can have it really really close if

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.580 
you can have it really really close if
you're<00:04:11.879> just<00:04:12.000> using<00:04:12.120> an<00:04:12.419> iphone<00:04:12.810> with<00:04:13.019> no<00:04:13.229> case

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
you're just using an iphone with no case

you're just using an iphone with no case
but<00:04:13.889> depending<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.699> can<00:04:14.849> adjust<00:04:14.969> it<00:04:15.329> as<00:04:15.419> much

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
but depending you can adjust it as much

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.370 
but depending you can adjust it as much
as<00:04:15.659> you<00:04:15.900> want<00:04:16.139> and<00:04:16.349> that's<00:04:16.799> that's<00:04:17.159> a<00:04:17.370> good

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
as you want and that's that's a good

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.270 
as you want and that's that's a good
centimeter<00:04:19.380> right<00:04:19.590> there<00:04:19.829> good<00:04:20.009> 10

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
centimeter right there good 10

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.459 
centimeter right there good 10
millimeters<00:04:20.940> distance<00:04:21.449> between<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:22.079> and

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
millimeters distance between that and

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.790 
millimeters distance between that and
that<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.820> we'll<00:04:23.969> just<00:04:24.030> place<00:04:24.389> it<00:04:24.419> in<00:04:24.800> screw

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
that so we'll just place it in screw

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.469 
that so we'll just place it in screw
that<00:04:25.979> part<00:04:26.219> in<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.520> we'll<00:04:26.669> see<00:04:26.880> how<00:04:27.240> this

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
that part in and we'll see how this

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.779 
that part in and we'll see how this
thing<00:04:27.690> actually<00:04:27.840> works<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:29.039> this<00:04:29.279> is<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.580> all

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
thing actually works so this is it all

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.350 
thing actually works so this is it all
fully<00:04:30.180> made<00:04:30.479> up<00:04:30.510> you<00:04:30.930> can<00:04:31.080> see

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
fully made up you can see

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.260 
fully made up you can see
I'll<00:04:31.719> just<00:04:31.930> place<00:04:32.169> this<00:04:32.409> back<00:04:33.370> panel<00:04:33.639> on<00:04:33.939> here

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
I'll just place this back panel on here

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.909 
I'll just place this back panel on here
again<00:04:34.569> we<00:04:34.750> can<00:04:34.930> see<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.199> four<00:04:35.439> screws<00:04:35.680> that

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
again we can see the four screws that

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.279 
again we can see the four screws that
are<00:04:35.979> holding<00:04:36.069> the<00:04:36.840> different<00:04:37.840> parts<00:04:38.169> of<00:04:38.229> the

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
that it's held very well indeed it's not

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.100 
that it's held very well indeed it's not
nice<00:05:08.680> and<00:05:08.949> sturdy<00:05:10.409> the<00:05:11.409> ipad<00:05:11.860> mini<00:05:12.840> may<00:05:13.840> not

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
nice and sturdy the ipad mini may not

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.050 
nice and sturdy the ipad mini may not
fit<00:05:14.680> right<00:05:15.039> as<00:05:15.219> it<00:05:15.370> is<00:05:15.520> i<00:05:15.669> might<00:05:15.879> have<00:05:16.029> to

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
fit right as it is i might have to

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.409 
fit right as it is i might have to
adjust<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.719> rear<00:05:16.870> support<00:05:17.349> to<00:05:17.469> the<00:05:17.560> tiny<00:05:17.860> bit

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
adjust the rear support to the tiny bit

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.390 
adjust the rear support to the tiny bit
but<00:05:19.419> just<00:05:19.750> as<00:05:19.960> no<00:05:20.229> there<00:05:20.500> we<00:05:20.590> go<00:05:20.740> you<00:05:21.129> can<00:05:21.279> see

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
but just as no there we go you can see

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.269 
but just as no there we go you can see
that's<00:05:21.639> held<00:05:21.909> again<00:05:22.569> both<00:05:23.529> in<00:05:23.710> portrait<00:05:24.250> mode

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279 
that's held again both in portrait mode

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:25.800 
that's held again both in portrait mode
and<00:05:24.580> i<00:05:24.610> guess<00:05:24.789> that's<00:05:25.029> maybe<00:05:25.240> one<00:05:25.479> of<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:25.659> only

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
and i guess that's maybe one of the only

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.869 
and i guess that's maybe one of the only
weaknesses<00:05:26.439> about<00:05:26.770> that<00:05:27.039> the<00:05:27.370> high-rises

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:27.879 
weaknesses about that the high-rises

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:31.080 
weaknesses about that the high-rises
that<00:05:28.240> it<00:05:28.360> only<00:05:28.539> holds<00:05:28.840> in<00:05:29.590> port<00:05:30.219> in<00:05:30.520> portrait

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
that it only holds in port in portrait

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.480 
that it only holds in port in portrait
mode<00:05:31.120> and<00:05:31.569> horizontally<00:05:32.219> but<00:05:33.219> then<00:05:33.340> you'll

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
mode and horizontally but then you'll

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.610 
mode and horizontally but then you'll
find<00:05:33.789> that<00:05:33.939> with<00:05:34.150> most<00:05:34.389> docs<00:05:34.870> with<00:05:35.110> connectors

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
find that with most docs with connectors

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.709 
find that with most docs with connectors
built<00:05:35.860> in<00:05:36.069> you<00:05:36.639> can<00:05:36.819> only<00:05:36.940> really<00:05:37.089> hold<00:05:37.539> them

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 
built in you can only really hold them

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:40.110 
built in you can only really hold them
one<00:05:37.900> way<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:38.169> it's<00:05:39.159> a<00:05:39.250> nice<00:05:39.400> little<00:05:39.669> place<00:05:39.940> to

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
one way so it's a nice little place to

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.600 
one way so it's a nice little place to
have<00:05:40.270> your<00:05:40.300> iphone<00:05:40.779> or<00:05:40.990> ipad<00:05:41.319> charging<00:05:41.949> it's
