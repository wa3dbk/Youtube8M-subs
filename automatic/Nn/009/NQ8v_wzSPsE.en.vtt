00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.530
 Yes Kon'nichiwae 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:11.420
 It is the sixth day of the maker of windows live 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:18.480
 Today is video and a 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:24.789
 A little lack respectively from it for the processing of the photos that I put it is a picture 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.539
 I think I'd love to do it or Nechotto editing that all of the high side by side the way 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:33.230
 First of all 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:35.910
 We have to introduce several points that it may not go up a little in the previous processing 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.390
 Ribbon path at the tab of the form just right 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.140
 There is, but this 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.220
 I think there is an improvement to the left 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.540
 this is 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:51.240
 For example, this time in It is easy to understand English even this is nice this child 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.240
 It will rotate when you do it will rotate more and more 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.220
 For example 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:03.230
 From the beginning at the time were taken with a digital camera with a photograph of voice taxes orientation become a portrait is wrong of wind 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.170
 I think that one should I use when on something the house of correction 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.270
 Disciplined have say 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 This can fix it if the video or photo is tilted 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.290
 eh 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.330
 It is a bit of a moving Toko we can also modify the video here 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.870
 If you can tilt it like this 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.670
 I will come back 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.110
 It is opened 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.110
 It from him 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.450
 I will explain to the west that the side will be used later with photo b etc. 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.830
 Disqualification Koroko 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.409
 I explained the project , yes 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:43.560
 From but here is Tan did not here explained 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:49.020
 First of all it is written as time zoom, but scaling reset 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.789
 It is related to this plus / minor of this 8 people under here 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.789
 Say it happens when is this extension 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.160
 is not it 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:04.750
 Here is something this 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:08.679
 I think that can be seen of had come out a lot and at the same time, now long this however reflected moving 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.730
 It is this expansion that I brought to this plus now 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:17.050
 When I bring a participle, after a little coat 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.770
 When it comes to the reduction which I want you to take off with a lot 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.500
 do you understand 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.500
 This number is decreasing while here is falling 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.880
 I've been doing this and it's been a lot 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.569
 Yes it will take also at one point do it reset 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.499
 It may be covered up to here 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.740
 I say why there is this kind of reason and timeline and time scale 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:44.680
 Though 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:48.240
 Though it was one video this video long video 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.310
 And I wonder if went moved to Dokora side of the bill 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:58.310
 So it is better that there is a certain length in order to see that say 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:01.030
 Is a form of look Sugge a look at one of the videos it is in this kind of Fu 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.030
 Taiga a 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.620
 Say the easy-to-understand time allocation has been in this kind of wind 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.230
 Such wind also there that 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.050
 Time 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.530
 Shrink or expand 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.840
 May be edited 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:26.000
 Here is a reduced view this 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:29.160
 Kokusho icon whether the die i will be grudge and had a little doing troubled here 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.220
 There was no high class each 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:37.020
 It became smaller when I made a key cruel comment 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.430
 I think that any good when you are working in a cheap size passbook and I wonder if much small icon is good 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.130
 Do you think 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.930
 If this preview screen is a little small 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.200
 Only low 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.040
 I want to see the details 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.540
 Resulting in a full screen at a preview of the full-screen preview sailed say 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.540
 It is such a feeling 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:10.599
 And if I have to stop you to the point in case you want to revert to the original 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:13.980
 Make sure you write escape esc on the left side of the keyboard Yes 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.980
 This will return to the original 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:21.540
 Maybe also If you wait too long and probably back that octopus 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:25.530
 It will be blue towards the display now I'm done this is a pre- turtle preview 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:33.350
 I will check once more how to take the guy who got bigger with a face wash 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:33.350
 Press the button on the upper left of the keyboard labeled Escacy to return 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.960
 Generally this place 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.030
 Video 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.030
 Below the processing value of the photo 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:49.870
 Then again when I was back to the headquarters home tab 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:54.010
 It was awful and I practiced so many things 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.550
 As the number increases at the beginning a little, it is organized, and the next one 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.810
 for 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.330
 I would like to do a little sort 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:06.210
 Let's go home 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:10.470
 Well cormorant little I'd softening line is made to the length 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:14.680
 Let's get rid of it by 20 minutes for one minute 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:17.390
 To Paia by right-clicking no longer a is deleted mouth 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.140
 After this also cut out the animation on the way 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:25.300
 Well Kedomo is not made in order to do snapshot It is this snapshot 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.300
 I will delete this too because I will not need it 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.930
 Naka hand acceleration and this is 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:38.370
 I think so, let's try this too and this is also a stemmer and delete 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:44.720
 Let's do it with muki 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:50.200
 I This is out of Nde do I not have a What or story Kedomo is after the flow Well 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.200
 Seasonal cherry tree is a beautiful house a little here Nearby 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.639
 Te Netoshi 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.639
 Even though is the video 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.689
 Then it is big 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.689
 I'm a child 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.860
 Do it 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:16.169
 Move 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:18.689
 In to more and more come on and on from better outside the wallet liked to go to close to home 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.810
 Well there was such an attached table fuller 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:25.230
 It is one flow like that 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:28.720
 Well in the this kind of wind so I think that what do I give to make 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:34.170
 I tried to rearrange the photos above 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.170
