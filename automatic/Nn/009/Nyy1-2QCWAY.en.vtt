00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.969
 good in this tutorial tries to explain 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:15.930
 how to root the cell phone before 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:21.760
 because for 90-60 good for this process 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:23.650
 we will need two good programs the 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.449
 first we need the three bread 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.820
 to fish without bread after 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.550
 raise the bread we need it 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.619
 in order to get the drivers of this 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.110
 cellular is already incorporated all the 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.180
 drivers in addition with an application for 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.930
 the computer that allows us to see the 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.510
 contacts see the music and so on and the 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.040
 super one click that is another or little program 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.080
 for pc that would allow us 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.620
 be able to surround yourself talking about this program 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.910
 It serves to surround almost any cell 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.080
 that's why I'm using it in these 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:00.590
 good moments already downloaded the two 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:04.120
 play you're where they go to the 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.550
 good description downloaded 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.930
 we proceed to install them well I have 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.540
 the species plan today already in the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.880
 good desktop I'm going to open the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.250
 execute good so they know from a 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.640
 beginning the pair after that should be 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.630
 install without having the cell phone connected 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.320
 good ok next I accept next 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.320
 install 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.150
 we wait for it to be installed 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.280
 and this and we already give in finishing 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.690
 good already installed and we proceed to 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.950
 to use him 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.719
 to decompress the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.619
 the super one click I already have it 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:55.020
 downloaded then unzip it good 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.360
 unzip on the desktop where 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.190
 you saw 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.909
 let's accept 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.689
 already with these two 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.929
 2 ready programs we proceed to 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:14.220
 put our cell phone in 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.280
 good debugging the good I'm not going to put 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.739
 healing mode so they see how it gets 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.890
 well now we will continue with the part 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:26.459
 of how to put the same healing on 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.640
 cellular parts because for 90 60 good 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.640
 yes they have it turn off then turn on the already 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.600
 learned we're going 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.600
 to start the menu 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.200
 we go here to the menu to the pitcher in 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.840
 conflict 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.840
 then we go to applications 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.420
 and then we go to development to those who 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.610
 they do not have native usually appears in off 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.190
 to activate it you simply have to 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.049
 stay on top of the off and remain green 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.510
 and then this box will appear 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.640
 they are going to accept this already since the 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.879
 new debugging and now the only thing that remains 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.760
 is to connect the cell phone the seen pc 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:13.510
 we already connect we are going to connect the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.549
 cellular the pc should sound this sound 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.069
 indicating that it will be spoken has been 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.010
 recognized good for us to work 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.069
 well we have to open the application of the 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.930
 bread that is pc suite we wait for it 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.170
 open 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.580
 we already appear the logo we follow 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.810
 hoping good and we were opened 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.940
 we give in allowing access 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.040

 that connects says there are devices 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.530
 but we have to keep trying 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.930
 good 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:05.030
 to cojedes with this we try again 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.540
 should appear on the screen of the 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.730

 gamón donatella der and we give it in red 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.280
 we have to bear in mind that the 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.280
 cellular never 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.180

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.360
 of the cell phone while doing this 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.940

 and your phone will be surrounded and in 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.409
 the menu will appear 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.899
 the following logo 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.569

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:08.529
 one click on the cell phone should we 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:10.010
 appear and this we go to the drawer at 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:13.080
 menu 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.630
 we look in the third box for 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.700
 third and third and we slide 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.400
 three times better said and he owes us 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.890
 appear the super user icon in this 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.400
 part or somewhere the icon will be 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:30.470
 like an eye doll from android 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.960
 but with a communiqués with a 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.750
 something that covers his eye what they use 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.540
 the pirates I do not remember in the name 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:41.680
 with a patch I was going to say super user and 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.370
 we open it and it shows us the 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.490
 applications that have been using 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.140
 or per user as we can do 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.570
 with the superuser what we can do 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.180
 with the amount per user is to delete all 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.420
 those applications that come with the 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.910
 ronde factory since many of these 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.320
 they consume space and none of those 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.720
 calls in soon we're not going to 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.500
 use and also allows us to take 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:09.470
 files from the root files for 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:13.160
 to be able to modify our our version 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:15.920

 retrieve this the phone after 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.770
