00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
there I'll forget so like I said I have

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.570 
there I'll forget so like I said I have
samples<00:04:11.870> these<00:04:12.440> three<00:04:12.739> are<00:04:12.950> origins<00:04:13.430> by

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
samples these three are origins by

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.039 
samples these three are origins by
design<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:14.150> these<00:04:14.360> three<00:04:14.690> are<00:04:14.739> makeup<00:04:15.739> a

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
design and these three are makeup a

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.570 
design and these three are makeup a
another<00:04:18.049> than<00:04:18.289> Mac<00:04:18.470> eye<00:04:18.680> cream<00:04:18.979> and<00:04:19.160> the

another than Mac eye cream and the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.550 
another than Mac eye cream and the
reason<00:04:19.820> why<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:19.970> have<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.419> origins<00:04:20.960> ones
