 to say a little the dr so for secret for 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.820
 what do you need then the banana that 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.950
 will serve as a binder to replace the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.090
 eyes so that rallied stop from you 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.909
 hide from putting the skunk the race 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.200
 stone happened crab and roman goes 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.409
 to eat pancakes the short ones I spent 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.750
 fly hair is so it's a 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.180
 half a liter of water of water in us as 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.189
 you 're going someone I 'm water 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.780
 the agreement did not advertise but there is 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.939
 also milk of vines and almonds 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.060
 and hazelnuts 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:39.180
 I do not really like flour 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.439
 corn and rice whole rice flour and 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.780
 coconut sugar that I'm going 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.040
 maybe I do not know at all 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.549
 so I music to sweeten it could 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.799
 to be not bad 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.360
 and that's what after that I would put 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.430
 rapeseed oil for hair gsm for 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.189
 to make the pancakes by first time 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.210
 go first smashed the whales so 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.759
 I'll basin 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.050
 the crab passenger via I will take you 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.700
 5:20 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.670
 with the age of the most beautiful mothers 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.990
 blows so crushed bananas what's that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.790
 will serve as a binder with why I have 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.830
 taken corn flour and 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.820
 whole rice flour that's all 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.320
 simply because there is no 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.940
 gluten donations that's if I take the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.230
 even spelled flour is when 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.720
 even a little britten and flour 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.860
 easy that there is noise you are in 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.810
 as I do not want to send my 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.800
 loved ones I tell you that quit to see 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.440
 have something tested 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.720
 vegans so to do that is blurry 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.970
 who with anything not just the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.460
 eyes that were removed but also the whole 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.880
 rest so I'm going to do so I 'm going 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.300
 do with 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.080
 with what this second for his departure 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.390
 reasoning but close 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.800
 so here's where there are five bananas and 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.510
 me it's a little big talent out of the ordinary 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.580
 in the recipe is a banana artist 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.810
 crushed but speaks of small walks 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.480
 month households are medium 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.060
 of which 95 to put a little less and 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.500
 then at the same time we will see 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.390
 marmont six small crushed bananas or 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.600
 five bullets on average I'm going to put 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.700
 250 g of corn flour and 250 g of 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.140
 whole rice flour and I find you 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.030
 unfair on the arrival of bananas 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.880
 now I will add as and when 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:10.590
 measure the milk so I'm half a liter 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:12.090
 milk of which 500 minitre about me 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.350
 I do not take soy milk because 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.060
 I do not know what I do not like 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:21.090
 especially soymilk and I 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.160
 hear me taking almond milk from 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.750
 thousands of hazelnut 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.489
 our favorites I the chÃ¢toire network bio 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.180
 and at the same time it's finally coming 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.330
 feed almost 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.120
 we do not have to actually a milk 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.040
 almond and all because I saw 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.400
 see almost vegetable juices and where 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.080
 I see badly after having more except that 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.880
 Drink a liter and a half of water addition 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.260
 jus plus sees it almost a hopper of 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.680
 view is all over eat bananas or 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.180
 apples 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.340
 i mean thatapple did not have 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.890
 especially finally here is my case I 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.810
 pours to the captivated bespoke street and that's 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.209
 for that it takes like a dough in 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.470
 did I wanted to eat you not expected that 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.880
 the people for the movie and it's going to be 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.860
 misery 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.480
 I do not want to go 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.430
 with one sleeve I find you 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.240
 after once I'm done so here we go 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:10.040
 so basically it's going to be half a liter of 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.150
 vegetable milk and half a liter well here 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.100
 I think I could have had a shot 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.950
 blender or a little bit to remove the 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.049
 greedy it was a little thick 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.440
 I added a little more milk at once 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.790
 because I spend my game towards premium 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.480
 you're putting it on fire 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.730
 started to do but have retouched by so 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.020
 but after he did not stop farid 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.220
 massacre I'm having fun doing a normal 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.820
 our pans in Paris does not need 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.640
 to be a little bit more liquid so 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.530
 I do not know and after reacting well leave 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.910
 rest at least half an hour between 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.680
 half an hour and two hours to leave 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.390
 rest and then I find you so 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.600
 for making pancakes really 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.680
 the first crepe to heat or do it 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.910
 in stages can easily face 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.790
 not want what as soon as it is cooked 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.690
 Belgian returns and control was 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.820
 always surrounded anyway the end 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.950
 that I film everything after all we get 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.120
 was serving spit after I think it's 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.419
 well to remove lumps is 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.280
 outright to pass all blender in fact 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.630
 put the lean and wolf down and 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.169
 add all the rest over and 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.550
 franck blender it can be a lot of 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.810
 head to remove the lumps the past 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.900
 in the blender what's up five years 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.870
 beaumian the banana the vegetables secam or 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.280
 what but I'll tell you that after 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.830
 worse if I create it's too ugly and ben 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.690
 I was playing because my team 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.240
 blazer or mx 1 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:34.169
 we will see beautiful for pancakes 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.350
 vegan failing not to eat 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.260
 necessarily 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.790
 in common% which we can please 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.730
 funds will necessarily be better than with 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.020
 gluten of the 18 still both a 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.390
 this is my opinion but for me 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.950
 my everyone I have better and without 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.000
 necessarily make concessions or have 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.190
 the impression of making it anyway 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.390
 six months ago I will not eat with 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.420
 instead I 'm going to do a super it's 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:58.600
 also because I am a buyer 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:01.630
 blender yesterday so here I present you 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.800
 on when the next video I 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.900
 know the table there to take care of 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.620
 good worries and all that is going to be 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.060
 nice 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.700
 so here because I can not eat 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.520
 enough fruits at the level of quantity 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.690
 take it too, it'll be better 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.760
 so will it be found then 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:21.100
 I think we're going to laugh at Leipold 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:25.480
 left glued to the ceiling flat and the 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:29.040
 risk at least that's hop it's the bourget 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.040
 like that, it's clinging 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:37.000
 I'll blow you up here 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.960
 so here is the pancake we do not film 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.580
 here are pancakes 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.460
 once he has this side it does like 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.920
 a real normal fear we see the same 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.560
 listening but what you want you have the 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.780
 chocolate there since the code of headscarves 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.820
 source of what sees there is no 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.160
 sugar 2 in its state on sugar 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.760
 chips but there are some whales have 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.760
 makes a banana flavor 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.810
 you had told yourself what you 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:05.700
 think that have tested me ratio for his 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.700
 share an ice goodie then 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:15.870
 another course that the consistency of a 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:19.590
 cream meringue bosco it's a bad 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:22.050
 billion to be really happy 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:27.980
 very little to be happy you have to 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.980
 to satisfy the necessary a bit early
