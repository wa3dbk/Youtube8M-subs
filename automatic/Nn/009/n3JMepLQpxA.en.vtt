00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.049
 in the netherlands the largest number in the world 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.560
 cyclists and this is the safest 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.630
 country for them 3 gang 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.400
 largely a consequence 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.340
 perego is a similar infrastructure matter 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.840
 which is built around the country as well 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.140
 the dutch got this network 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.029
 first-class bike paths 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.200
 many including the Dutch themselves consider 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.720
 that the bike paths were always but this is true 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.910
 Yes, only some 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.140
 bike paths but they were not committed 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.800
 such as today is narrow with bad 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.050
 coated 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.239
 dangerous or completely absent 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.330
 intersections and unrelated to each 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.210
 other bike paths in general were not 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.840
 bicyclists need special attention 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.490
 exceeded all other types of traffic 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.060
 after the second world everything changed and 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.060
 tea something 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.940
 the Dutch had to restore their 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.490
 the country and also they have become extraordinary 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.360
 rich 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:14.920
 48 to 60, average income increased by 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:18.000
 44 percent and to 70 by 222 people could 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.380
 afford expensive goods and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.240
 feature of the fifty-seventh year is 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.570
 led to an increase in the number of cars on 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.130
 streets streets advantage on old 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.730
 cities that were not intended 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.760
 for cars the building collapsed to 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.410
 get comfortable a place for cars even 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.040
 some old bike paths were 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.040
 eliminated 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.390
 Viennese mails turned into parking lots 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.990
 and new areas were built with huge 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.020
 roads for car traffic 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.100
 daily trips rose from 3.9 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.200
 kilometer or seventh year to 23.2 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.390
 kilometers seventy five 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.860
 but this progress was a terrible price. 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.140
 the bike turned out to be marginalized 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.099
 the level of the matter of motion was reduced by 6 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:20.470
 percent every year 3300 people 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:26.069
 died in accidents in 1971 alone 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:28.390
 among them more than 400 children under the age of 14 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.050
 mass infanticide made people 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:36.000
 take to the streets to protest 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.430
 stop killing children such slogans 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.170
 were the company behind safe streets for 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.640
 children as pedestrians and 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.959
 cyclists these calls were heard 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.150
 especially when in the seventy third year 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.420
 the first oil crisis stopped life in 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.420
 country 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.250
 the then prime minister announced to the people 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.840
 the netherlands what this crisis will become 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.720
 turning point 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.260
 what will have to change lifestyle and be 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.130
 less volatile but what is it 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.120
 possible without 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.810
 declining quality of life stab in live 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.580
 cycling support policy 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.930
 perfectly fit into this video 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.940
 sunday without cars to save 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.680
 fuels have become a reminder of how 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.680
 cities looked without cars 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.840
 at the same time, the first central streets 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.359
 cities were closed for cars on 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.079
 ongoing at the same time protests 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.599
 continued 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.139
 massive automobilization was killing people 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.969
 cities and the mass environment 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.040
 bike rides in Dutch cities and 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.139
 more local give way to support 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.840
 development of bicycle infrastructure raised 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.379
 level of awareness and in the final 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.689
 the result 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:54.040
 changed the approach to transport policy 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:55.569
 hair in the mid seventies 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.579
 municipal government started 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.680
 experiment with full or 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.360
 safe zil routes away from 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.790
 trophy end fig 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.070
 with the financial support of the national 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.730
 governments first cycle routes ate 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.740
 we created art gay lady gaga in 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.140
 in retrospect they looked like the beginning 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.380
 modern politics in the field introduced 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.320
 transport level cycling 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:24.570
 incredibly increased in the time of 30 60 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.720
 percent and in tilburg on all 75 spears and 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.720
 build 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.170
 and they will come this approach was justified in 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.870
 netherlands summing up what has changed 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.760
 the situation in the netherlands was a problem 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.150
 cities that could not cope with 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.980
 growing traffic this problem has led to 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.020
 demolition of buildings reproach protest 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.430
 against how much space is given 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.430
 to private transport 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.690
 a huge number of deaths on the roads 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.690
 also provoked mass protests 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.160
 oil and economic crisis led 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:05.660
 to higher fuel and energy prices j 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.120
 the solution was found in political will 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.280
 at national and local levels when 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.680
 cooperation sumer scouts and people 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.570
 host or not downloading it 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.550
 the decision was to refuse the car 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.920
 centric policy and support 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.860
 alternative modes of transport such 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.720
 like a bike a bike today is 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.200
 integral part of the transfer themselves 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.200
 politicians 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:33.550
 What a number of protesters reached 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.060
 child road deaths decreased and 300 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:41.280
 seventy first year to 14 in 2010 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.280
 this street was complemented by a cycle path 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:50.070
 and on this bridge bike lane is not 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.250
 preserved instead was built 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.250
 cycle path 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.290
 it is drawn of its composition constant 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.900
 bike path mit uns occupy a cars 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.840
 were expelled wanna give repent today 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.170
 it is a famous place to stand here sign MHC 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.170
 a coward 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.400
 and here is another place of mass protests 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.300
 it would be much more convenient to lie here 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.300
 people today 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.820
 the problem of the Netherlands were not and not 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:29.500
 are unique then all solutions are not 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.330
 must remain unique voiced 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.500
 development project is a matter of movement in 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.500
 Russian years of tales
