00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:17.920
 I've done terrible things we thought 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.920
 we helped us turned out to be like this 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.540
 you are the assigned shooter 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.500
 is the biggest mistake that the 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.450
 murder that has not yet been 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.310

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.210
 confrontations and has aggravated the crisis 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.210
 humanitarian

 and what are you doing here someone tried to kill me 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.520
 3 days ago 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.950
 The company cleaning station 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.600
 you have to unmask them 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.530
 is the only trick you have left 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.489
 the past is the past friend of ours 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.489
 mission did not take place 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.800
 it is clear perhaps intends to play with me 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.300
 we know you have information 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.300
 tell us what it is about 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.680
 I have names dates I have left 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.680
 record of everything 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.030
 would bring us to light so that the world 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.030
 he hears 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.750
 I understand the company 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.080
 you are the threat that they have left 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.940
 pending 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.940
 we have nothing more to talk about 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.690
 I already throw you a campaign 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.690

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.410
