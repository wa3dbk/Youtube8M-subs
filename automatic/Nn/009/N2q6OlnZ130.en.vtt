00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:15.740
 the table is good here, all right thank god 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:19.279
 People today will show you a 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.400
 The modification I did here on the bike is 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.650
 related to the passage of the gears is 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.119
 usually a motorbike 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.789
 it is a great xj6 thousand bikes 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:37.190
 original factory video 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.000
 She's the first marching down to 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.160
 top 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.950
 2nd 3rd 4th 5th and 6th certain beauty 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.090
 this is normal that original then 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.800
 first down 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:55.240
 middle term neutral 2nd 3rd 4th 5th and 6th grade 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.300
 This is normal, what I did I changed. 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.579
 Why did you change some places? 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.900
 I will I lie to enough 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.420
 left 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.640
 so when you make the curve to 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.350
 and you change gears in the curve 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.810
 when she is very close to the ground 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.460
 It happens that you can not put the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.840
 foot under the pedal because it is 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.090
 very close to the ground 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.400
 we assume that the ground is right here 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.260
 More or less here when you lie down 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.640
 the pedalboard is very close to the 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.500
 So you're going to hit dad for 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.790
 low superpenas dangerous lack you 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.479
 get the foot on the asphalt broke the foot to 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.960
 back 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.500
 so it had already happened before 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.510
 he is getting his foot on the ground and I had 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.000
 piloted the escape husband's bike but 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.150
 x10 and I really liked it 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.610
 because the reverse is reversed. 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.560
 the first to the first down 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.799
 first up to the rest down 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.119
 so I chose to do my also 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.400
 It was very difficult for you to do this. 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.229
 have to change the exchange has to do the 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.790
 What the fella wanted to adapt his crazy was 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.510
 so you did not do much 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.189
 OK 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.580
 it was more or less one was a yes 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:08.360
 adaptation would do to do a little 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.610
 better to but as I was I did and 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.480
 It was functional good and has my 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.620
 guarantee I would rather be doing it 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.769
 even at home 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.890
 To be able to learn is also to raise my bike. 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.379
 always for good workshops to be able to do 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.239
 services until story mode 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.060
 just some things i like to do 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.459
 also to be able to learn in those 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.540
 in this case here I did what I did 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.810
 I made this stand here on the rod era 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.409
 underneath do not think with me here she here 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.599
 down 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:47.060
 certain is that he had a habit that I did 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.799
 I cut open and started going upstairs is 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.049
 crazy is cutting out the bike business and 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.390
 put on and weld I'm crazy 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.829
 yes, because if it's already here, it's already gone 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.160
 Seeing later I would have to change because 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:00.799
 This is what spends over time he has a 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.069
 Validity because you pull a lot then 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.379
 then this exchange inks screws exchange 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.370
 here is the subject to run away here and right 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:14.659
 it 's raining he 's stuck because he 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:19.220
 would come because of the ac of the game that he 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:21.019
 have that is a pivot here so a shot of 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.970
 down put it up ready 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.510
 reversed is what happens with the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.599
 guys 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.859
 most of the time so I really liked it 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.190
 It worked 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:34.459
 It was very good, you have my seal of approval. 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.079
 And that's where you have to go, calm down. 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.329
 For you are learning again. 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.680
 because totally different you 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.959
 learned a motorbike 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.629
 the day was one down, but 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.049
 now it 's different in a curve if you 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.010
 entering if they have a second and 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.889
 third 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.900
 If you forget, you 'll hit the fourth and 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.739
 down with the inverted field 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.530
 old 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.780
 this gives a boy understood why 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.879
 it reduces if you think it's going up 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.239
 china is not coming down, right? 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:07.459
 is reducing then you hit 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.500
 Wrong she gives a boyfriend understood her 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.799
 Ask me until I fall off the bike. 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.949
 So you have to learn, you have to be calm. 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:19.250
 so you can and they will pay and you will have 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:21.979
 security, this is what each of the 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.990
 street bikes I like to do some 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.500
 different thing in mine because I use 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.510
