00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
the whole thing about being in the NBA

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.030 
the whole thing about being in the NBA
is<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.300> want<00:05:04.810> to<00:05:04.930> stay<00:05:05.110> stay<00:05:05.560> as<00:05:05.620> long<00:05:05.800> as<00:05:05.980> you
