to<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.849> left<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.209> then<00:02:09.630> build<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.049> so<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.289> can

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
to the left and then build it so you can

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.500

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
kind of stumbles around a little bit

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.009 
kind of stumbles around a little bit
which<00:02:17.250> takes<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.880> little<00:02:17.970> bit<00:02:18.120> too<00:02:18.510> long<00:02:18.720> if<00:02:18.930> you

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
which takes a little bit too long if you

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.570 
which takes a little bit too long if you
ask<00:02:19.170> me<00:02:19.380> you're<00:02:19.530> going<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.769> need<00:02:19.920> hacker<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.370> to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
ask me you're going to need hacker it to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.839 
ask me you're going to need hacker it to
pull<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.120> change<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.019> can<00:02:22.640> hold<00:02:23.640> down

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
pull this change so you can hold down

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.449 
pull this change so you can hold down
the<00:02:24.060> bleachers<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.810> walk<00:02:25.349> on<00:02:25.560> over<00:02:25.620> although

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
the bleachers and walk on over although

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.180 
the bleachers and walk on over although
i'm<00:02:26.579> sure<00:02:26.640> those<00:02:26.940> Wizards<00:02:27.420> must<00:02:27.690> be

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
i'm sure those Wizards must be

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.229 
i'm sure those Wizards must be
completely<00:02:29.190> confuse<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.060> what's

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
completely confuse this is what's

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.660 
completely confuse this is what's
happening<00:02:30.650> then<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:31.950> shoot<00:02:32.099> w<00:02:32.430> again

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
happening then you can shoot w again

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.370 
happening then you can shoot w again
then<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:32.940> need<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.299> use<00:02:33.420> nobilis<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.140> these

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
then you need to use nobilis on these

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.670 
then you need to use nobilis on these
Pixies<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.579> get<00:02:35.970> something<00:02:36.660> from<00:02:36.780> holding<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
Pixies to get something from holding the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.590 
Pixies to get something from holding the
door<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.250> blocking<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.000> devil's<00:02:39.450> snare

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.220 
door that is blocking the devil's snare
and<00:02:40.049> then<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.319> need<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:41.120> let<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.420> snitch<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
and then you need to let the snitch and

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.620 
and then you need to let the snitch and
other<00:02:43.560> stuff<00:02:43.980> just<00:02:44.220> fly<00:02:45.150> around<00:02:45.329> a<00:02:45.690> little<00:02:45.840> bit

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
other stuff just fly around a little bit

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.910 
other stuff just fly around a little bit
then<00:02:48.630> there's<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.989> staircase<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.709> build

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
then there's a staircase you can build

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.460 
then there's a staircase you can build
here

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.960 

and<00:02:55.470> then<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.739> can<00:02:55.860> go<00:02:56.040> up<00:02:56.159> and<00:02:56.400> attempt<00:02:56.909> to

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
away and right here for some reason I

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.460 
away and right here for some reason I
decided<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.319> pick<00:03:02.190> up<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.780> odd<00:03:03.780> for<00:03:04.319> some

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
decided to pick up the odd for some

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.990 
decided to pick up the odd for some
reason<00:03:04.739> it<00:03:04.830> didn't<00:03:05.099> shoot<00:03:05.280> Bobby<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.819> I<00:03:05.879> was

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
trying to test getting ahead of myself

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.660 
trying to test getting ahead of myself
we<00:03:07.530> shoot<00:03:07.769> Bobby<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.190> then<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.340> put<00:03:08.519> that

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
blue folder on that chain up there which

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.580 
blue folder on that chain up there which
will<00:03:11.879> lower<00:03:12.030> its<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.569> give<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:12.959> access<00:03:13.170> into
