00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.880 
enough just to call the police and have
uh<00:01:44.060> you<00:01:45.060> know<00:01:45.180> CPS<00:01:45.960> take<00:01:46.350> care<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> baby

uh you know CPS take care of the baby
it's<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:47.700> did<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.060> no<00:01:48.659> interesting

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
it's not they did that no interesting

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.719 
it's not they did that no interesting
you<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.560> what<00:01:49.740> what<00:01:50.009> another<00:01:50.220> question<00:01:50.640> is

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
you know what what another question is

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.819 
you know what what another question is
since<00:01:50.909> math<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.210> involved<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
since math is involved in this if you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.740 
since math is involved in this if you
legalize<00:01:53.340> drugs<00:01:53.640> does<00:01:54.210> something<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.600> this

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
legalize drugs does something like this

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.600 
legalize drugs does something like this
go<00:01:54.960> away<00:01:55.259> let's<00:01:55.740> think<00:01:55.950> about<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.189> people

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
go away let's think about that people

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.310 
go away let's think about that people
say<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> lot<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.299> problems<00:01:57.570> related<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
say a lot of the problems related to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.319 
say a lot of the problems related to
drugs<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.950> away<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.399> legalize<00:01:59.820> drugs<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
drugs go away if you legalize drugs and

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.719 
drugs go away if you legalize drugs and
I<00:02:00.420> agree<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.810> some<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.229> them<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:02.340> this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
I agree that some of them do is this

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.100 
I agree that some of them do is this
type<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> situation<00:02:03.180> something<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:03.990> would

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
type of situation something that would

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.649 
type of situation something that would
anyway<00:02:04.439> improve<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.399> math<00:02:05.759> were<00:02:06.000> legal<00:02:06.390> let's

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
anyway improve if math were legal let's

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.460 
anyway improve if math were legal let's
think<00:02:06.840> about<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.500> would<00:02:07.710> still<00:02:07.920> happen

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
think about that this would still happen

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.030 
think about that this would still happen
well<00:02:10.100> i<00:02:10.310> mean<00:02:10.580> if<00:02:11.060> if<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:12.080> think<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.830> by

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
well i mean if if you think that by

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.280 
well i mean if if you think that by
legalizing<00:02:13.730> meth<00:02:14.180> people<00:02:14.810> aren't<00:02:15.080> going<00:02:15.230> to

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
legalizing meth people aren't going to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.050 
legalizing meth people aren't going to
be<00:02:15.380> addicted<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.950> meth<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.340> act<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.030> way

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
be addicted to meth and act in a way

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.160 
be addicted to meth and act in a way
that<00:02:17.240> we<00:02:18.110> know<00:02:18.320> addicts<00:02:18.890> act<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.760> mean<00:02:20.330> it's

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
that we know addicts act I mean it's

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.320 
that we know addicts act I mean it's
gonna<00:02:21.440> keep<00:02:21.620> happening<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.850> would<00:02:23.000> have<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.300> be

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
gonna keep happening it would have to be

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.180 
gonna keep happening it would have to be
that<00:02:23.630> when<00:02:23.780> Pitt<00:02:24.020> one<00:02:24.200> meth<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.590> made<00:02:24.950> legal

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
that when Pitt one meth is made legal

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.300 
that when Pitt one meth is made legal
then<00:02:26.180> people<00:02:26.540> are<00:02:26.720> no<00:02:27.050> longer<00:02:27.320> driven<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.190> do

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
then people are no longer driven to do

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.590 
then people are no longer driven to do
things<00:02:28.520> like<00:02:28.610> this<00:02:28.790> because<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.240> and<00:02:29.450> I

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
things like this because of it and I

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.970 
things like this because of it and I
don't<00:02:29.780> see<00:02:29.900> why<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.110> would<00:02:30.290> happen<00:02:30.410> now<00:02:30.830> I

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
don't see why that would happen now I

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.140 
don't see why that would happen now I
don't<00:02:31.070> see<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.280> connection<00:02:31.460> there<00:02:31.880> there

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
don't see the connection there there

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.850 
don't see the connection there there
will<00:02:32.300> still<00:02:32.510> be<00:02:32.570> addicts<00:02:33.080> there<00:02:33.380> was<00:02:33.500> still<00:02:33.710> be

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
will still be addicts there was still be

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.400 
will still be addicts there was still be

a mongoose for a skateboard when we were

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.280 
a mongoose for a skateboard when we were
in<00:02:41.180> high<00:02:41.240> school<00:02:41.360> that's<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.930> only<00:02:42.080> time<00:02:42.230> you

traded living things for inanimate
objects<00:02:44.420> right<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.750> would<00:02:45.080> never<00:02:45.290> trade<00:02:45.980> a

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
objects right I would never trade a

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.010 
objects right I would never trade a
mongoose<00:02:46.520> if<00:02:46.820> I<00:02:46.940> had<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.090> mongoose<00:02:47.510> really

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
mongoose if I had a mongoose really

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.010 
mongoose if I had a mongoose really
never<00:02:48.440> knowing<00:02:48.950> what<00:02:49.220> about<00:02:49.400> like<00:02:49.520> a<00:02:49.550> weasel

sure weasels you don't care about

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.310 
sure weasels you don't care about
Mongoose<00:02:53.120> might<00:02:53.300> even<00:02:53.480> be<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.630> type<00:02:53.870> of<00:02:53.900> weasel

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
Mongoose might even be a type of weasel

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.410 
Mongoose might even be a type of weasel
I<00:02:54.380> don't<00:02:54.590> know<00:02:54.680> yeah<00:02:54.890> I'm<00:02:55.010> not<00:02:55.130> sure<00:02:55.420> mongooses

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
I don't know yeah I'm not sure mongooses

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.360 
I don't know yeah I'm not sure mongooses
those<00:02:56.870> are<00:02:57.050> they're<00:02:57.500> pretty<00:02:57.620> crazy<00:02:57.950> is<00:02:58.220> it

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
those are they're pretty crazy is it

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.199 
those are they're pretty crazy is it
mongooses<00:02:59.030> are<00:02:59.209> or<00:02:59.390> mongeese<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:01.120> think<00:03:02.120> it's

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
mongooses are or mongeese I think it's

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.300 
mongooses are or mongeese I think it's
mongooses<00:03:02.810> really<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.440> time<00:03:04.010> what<00:03:04.190> do<00:03:04.250> you

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
mongooses really a time what do you

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.550
