00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
which has two horses on the side which I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.869 
which has two horses on the side which I
would<00:00:46.379> imagine<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.860> horses<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.460> each<00:00:47.610> side

would imagine as horses on each side

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.200 
would imagine as horses on each side
others<00:00:48.629> behind<00:00:49.200> those<00:00:49.379> doors<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.090> got

the<00:00:51.329> idea<00:00:51.360> where<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:51.930> putting<00:00:52.079> myself<00:00:52.230> I

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the idea where I was putting myself I

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.020

is that the horses on the racetrack now

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.370 
is that the horses on the racetrack now
I'm<00:01:47.850> sure<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.270> isn't<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.600> new<00:01:48.780> audio<00:01:49.080> clip<00:01:49.259> I

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
I'm sure this isn't a new audio clip I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.990 
I'm sure this isn't a new audio clip I
share<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> lot<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.830> people<00:01:50.040> who<00:01:50.100> heard<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
share a lot of people who heard it you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.280 
share a lot of people who heard it you
could<00:01:51.119> also<00:01:51.240> hear<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.690> something<00:01:52.050> like<00:01:52.259> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
could also hear like something like a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.530 
could also hear like something like a
cradle<00:01:52.710> or<00:01:53.009> something<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.640> barn<00:01:53.940> if<00:01:54.390> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
cradle or something in that barn if you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.960 
cradle or something in that barn if you
go<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.159> what's<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.549> cuz<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.850> was

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
go up to it what's I like cuz I was

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.280 
go up to it what's I like cuz I was
looking<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.360> horse<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.720> once<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.960> put<00:01:58.140> two

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
looking for the horse so once I put two

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.749 
looking for the horse so once I put two
and<00:01:58.320> two<00:01:58.500> together<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.860> got<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.520> really

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and two together I got really really

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.850 
and two together I got really really
intrigued<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.659> now<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.590> where<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
intrigued then and now this is where the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.859 
intrigued then and now this is where the
theory<00:02:02.190> of<00:02:02.310> possible<00:02:02.790> speculation<00:02:03.450> about<00:02:03.659> how

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
theory of possible speculation about how

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.990 
theory of possible speculation about how
I<00:02:04.170> believe<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.979> possibly<00:02:05.460> translate

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
I believe that possibly translate

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.609 
I believe that possibly translate
connects<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.509> die<00:02:06.660> rise<00:02:06.899> now<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.170> think<00:02:07.440> it's<00:02:07.530> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
connects to die rise now I think it's a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.160 
connects to die rise now I think it's a
really<00:02:07.800> sound<00:02:08.360> theory<00:02:09.360> once<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.780> show<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
really sound theory once I show you the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.930 
really sound theory once I show you the
proof<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.679> when<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> went<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.130> bed<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.370> night<00:02:11.550> I

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
proof so when I went to bed that night I

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.610 
proof so when I went to bed that night I
was<00:02:12.420> like<00:02:12.510> what<00:02:12.660> do<00:02:12.720> we<00:02:12.810> know<00:02:12.989> okay<00:02:13.380> we<00:02:13.500> know

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
was like what do we know okay we know

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.800 
was like what do we know okay we know
die<00:02:13.830> rise<00:02:14.070> takes<00:02:14.340> place<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.730> China<00:02:14.760> yes<00:02:15.540> if<00:02:15.720> you

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
die rise takes place in China yes if you

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.360 
die rise takes place in China yes if you
watch<00:02:15.959> my<00:02:16.170> first<00:02:16.380> video<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:16.769> said<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.160> was<00:02:17.250> in

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
watch my first video I said it was in

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.740 
watch my first video I said it was in
Germany<00:02:17.730> because<00:02:18.000> there<00:02:18.150> was<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.269> clip<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.569> a

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
Germany because there was a clip of a

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.300 
Germany because there was a clip of a
guy<00:02:18.870> saying<00:02:19.140> he<00:02:19.290> was<00:02:19.410> playing<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.800> map<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.220> it

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
guy saying he was playing the map and it

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.940 
guy saying he was playing the map and it
was<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.550> Germany<00:02:20.940> now<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:22.140> his<00:02:22.260> defense

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
was in Germany now to his defense

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.710 
was in Germany now to his defense
Treyarch<00:02:23.550> said<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.060> China<00:02:24.330> they<00:02:24.540> never

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
Treyarch said it's in China they never

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.660 
Treyarch said it's in China they never
said<00:02:25.019> we're<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.500> China<00:02:25.769> that<00:02:26.040> could<00:02:26.100> mean<00:02:26.459> it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
said we're in China that could mean it

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.040 
said we're in China that could mean it
could<00:02:26.790> still<00:02:27.030> be<00:02:27.090> Germany<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.750> could<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:28.019> a

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
could still be Germany it could be a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.680 
could still be Germany it could be a
china<00:02:28.410> town<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:28.980> Germany<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.630> a

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
china town in Germany I have a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.880 
china town in Germany I have a
speculation<00:02:30.959> about<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.560> I'll<00:02:31.709> tell<00:02:31.830> you

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
speculation about that I'll tell you

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.620 
speculation about that I'll tell you
it's<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.310> map<00:02:32.489> but<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.239> could<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.600> just

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
it's in the map but it could be just

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.390 
it's in the map but it could be just
German<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.319> could<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:34.769> China<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.310> not

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
German it could just be China and not

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.940 
German it could just be China and not
Germany<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.660> ran<00:02:37.230> with<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:37.799> was

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
Germany so I ran with that and I was

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.350 
Germany so I ran with that and I was
like<00:02:37.980> what<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.400> Chinese<00:02:38.640> connection<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.329> a

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
like what is the Chinese connection to a

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.819 
like what is the Chinese connection to a
horse<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.200> have<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.410> Chinese<00:02:40.620> zodiac

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
horse and you have the Chinese zodiac

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.319 
horse and you have the Chinese zodiac
you<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.640> year<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.000> horse

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
you have the year of the horse

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.600 
you have the year of the horse
so<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.930> decided<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.440> look<00:02:43.560> up<00:02:43.739> when<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> year

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
so I decided to look up when is the year

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.699 
so I decided to look up when is the year
of<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.730> horse<00:02:44.880> it's<00:02:45.239> every<00:02:45.570> 12<00:02:45.870> years<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.410> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
of the horse it's every 12 years and the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.210 
of the horse it's every 12 years and the
next<00:02:46.890> one<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.850> fire<00:02:48.090> horse<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.980> 2026<00:02:49.980> and

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
next one is the fire horse in 2026 and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.690 
next one is the fire horse in 2026 and
2027<00:02:51.150> now<00:02:51.420> when<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.630> heard<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> fire<00:02:52.140> horse<00:02:52.410> I

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
2027 now when I heard the fire horse I

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.069 
2027 now when I heard the fire horse I
thought<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.730> was<00:02:53.910> onto<00:02:54.060> something<00:02:54.180> because<00:02:54.750> as

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
thought I was onto something because as

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.949 
thought I was onto something because as
you<00:02:55.530> guys<00:02:55.650> know<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.970> maps<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.540> transit

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
you guys know the maps and transit

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.140 
you guys know the maps and transit
everywhere<00:02:58.320> it's<00:02:58.590> lava<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.310> fire<00:02:59.640> everything

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
everywhere it's lava on fire everything

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.940 
everywhere it's lava on fire everything
in<00:03:01.400> 2026<00:03:02.420> 2027<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.780> was<00:03:04.079> like<00:03:04.200> hold<00:03:04.440> up<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:04.769> was

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
in 2026 2027 I was like hold up I was

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.370 
in 2026 2027 I was like hold up I was
like<00:03:05.070> nuketown<00:03:05.549> 2025<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:06.989> starting<00:03:07.290> to

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
like nuketown 2025 this is starting to

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.750 
like nuketown 2025 this is starting to
add<00:03:07.530> up<00:03:07.739> this<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.070> starting<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.340> make<00:03:08.430> sense

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
add up this is starting to make sense

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.210 
add up this is starting to make sense
now<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:10.049> is<00:03:10.170> gonna<00:03:10.290> bring<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.739> debate<00:03:10.890> over

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
now this is gonna bring the debate over

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.550 
now this is gonna bring the debate over
a<00:03:11.790> windows<00:03:12.120> nuketown<00:03:12.570> take<00:03:12.810> place<00:03:13.079> a<00:03:13.290> lot<00:03:13.530> of

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
a windows nuketown take place a lot of

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.220 
a windows nuketown take place a lot of
people<00:03:13.859> believe<00:03:14.160> since<00:03:15.060> moon<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.870> taking

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
people believe since moon is taking

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.440 
people believe since moon is taking
place<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.620> 1960s<00:03:17.340> they<00:03:17.489> believe<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.940> Newtown

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
place in 1960s they believe that Newtown

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.160 
place in 1960s they believe that Newtown
is<00:03:18.690> also<00:03:19.380> taking<00:03:19.650> place<00:03:19.829> in<00:03:19.980> 1960s<00:03:20.670> and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
is also taking place in 1960s and

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.170 
is also taking place in 1960s and
honestly<00:03:22.170> my<00:03:22.500> personal<00:03:22.920> opinion<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.700> I

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
honestly my personal opinion is that I

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.640 
honestly my personal opinion is that I
don't<00:03:24.420> think<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.720> could<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.019> case<00:03:25.230> moon

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
don't think that could be the case moon

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.000 
don't think that could be the case moon
was<00:03:25.920> way<00:03:26.130> too<00:03:26.190> high-tech<00:03:26.840> even<00:03:27.840> like<00:03:28.829> the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
was way too high-tech even like the

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.770 
was way too high-tech even like the
people<00:03:29.370> like<00:03:29.670> all<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.000> new<00:03:30.120> characters<00:03:30.600> they

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
people like all the new characters they

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.960 
people like all the new characters they
seem<00:03:31.049> like<00:03:31.190> from<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.280> future<00:03:32.700> or<00:03:32.730> like

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
seem like from the future or like

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.490 
seem like from the future or like
they're<00:03:33.150> more<00:03:33.329> modern<00:03:33.750> they're<00:03:33.900> not<00:03:34.049> like<00:03:34.290> all

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
they're more modern they're not like all

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.039 
they're more modern they're not like all
old<00:03:34.799> time<00:03:35.130> like<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.459> older<00:03:35.760> characters<00:03:36.269> also

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
old time like the older characters also

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.500 
old time like the older characters also
like<00:03:37.290> we<00:03:37.739> have<00:03:37.859> a<00:03:37.890> guy<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.579> robot<00:03:39.000> driving<00:03:39.299> us

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
like we have a guy of robot driving us

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.930 
like we have a guy of robot driving us
around<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.230> in<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.950> bus<00:03:41.220> like<00:03:41.580> how<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:41.909> that

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
around in a in a bus like how is that

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.180 
around in a in a bus like how is that
that's<00:03:42.269> not<00:03:42.360> 1960s<00:03:43.319> that's<00:03:43.470> got<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.739> be<00:03:43.860> in<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
that's not 1960s that's got to be in the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.600 
that's not 1960s that's got to be in the
future

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
future

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.600 
future
and<00:03:44.819> what<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.060> think<00:03:45.480> honestly<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.170> that

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
and what I think honestly is that

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.080 
and what I think honestly is that
the<00:03:47.850> multiplayer<00:03:48.180> map<00:03:48.570> yeah<00:03:48.810> nuketown<00:03:49.260> 2025

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
the multiplayer map yeah nuketown 2025

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.610 
the multiplayer map yeah nuketown 2025
that's<00:03:51.090> what<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.360> map<00:03:51.570> looks<00:03:51.900> like<00:03:51.990> before<00:03:52.530> it

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
that's what the map looks like before it

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.400 
that's what the map looks like before it
gets<00:03:52.800> Newt<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.430> now<00:03:54.390> it's<00:03:54.600> nuked<00:03:54.960> and<00:03:55.260> that's

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
gets Newt and now it's nuked and that's

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.980 
gets Newt and now it's nuked and that's
why<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.710> looks<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.400> way<00:03:56.490> it<00:03:56.520> looks<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.180> that's

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
why it looks the way it looks and that's

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.020 
why it looks the way it looks and that's
the<00:03:58.200> after-effects<00:03:58.800> after<00:03:59.130> being<00:03:59.460> nuked<00:03:59.730> I

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
the after-effects after being nuked I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.120 
the after-effects after being nuked I
don't<00:04:00.510> see<00:04:00.810> how<00:04:00.990> all<00:04:01.590> right<00:04:01.710> you're<00:04:01.860> saying

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
don't see how all right you're saying

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.800 
don't see how all right you're saying
people<00:04:02.460> would<00:04:02.700> say<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.240> got<00:04:03.360> nuked<00:04:03.690> to

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
people would say that it got nuked to

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.950 
people would say that it got nuked to
1960s<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.950> then<00:04:05.490> what<00:04:05.970> sixty<00:04:06.450> years<00:04:06.660> later

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
1960s and then what sixty years later

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.450 
1960s and then what sixty years later
it's<00:04:07.200> gonna<00:04:07.320> be<00:04:07.530> like<00:04:07.740> what<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.100> is<00:04:08.220> now<00:04:08.430> and

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
it's gonna be like what it is now and

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.980 
it's gonna be like what it is now and
that<00:04:08.700> multiplayer<00:04:09.240> map<00:04:09.450> where<00:04:09.630> it's<00:04:09.720> gonna<00:04:09.840> be

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
that multiplayer map where it's gonna be

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.420 
that multiplayer map where it's gonna be
way<00:04:10.170> in<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.410> future<00:04:10.770> and<00:04:10.920> all<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.340> don't

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
way in the future and all that I don't

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.880 
way in the future and all that I don't
think<00:04:11.760> that's<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.030> case<00:04:12.210> but<00:04:12.600> even<00:04:13.020> if<00:04:13.800> you

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
think that's the case but even if you

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.870 
think that's the case but even if you
are<00:04:14.100> one<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.340> those<00:04:14.460> people<00:04:14.640> that<00:04:14.790> believe

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
are one of those people that believe

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.070 
are one of those people that believe
that<00:04:15.739> it<00:04:16.739> takes<00:04:17.040> place<00:04:17.220> in<00:04:17.459> 1960s<00:04:18.209> that<00:04:18.630> still

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
that it takes place in 1960s that still

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.259 
that it takes place in 1960s that still
does<00:04:19.290> not<00:04:19.440> debunk<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.430> theory<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.030> fire

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
does not debunk the theory of the fire

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.240 
does not debunk the theory of the fire
horse<00:04:21.540> because<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.470> this<00:04:22.620> might<00:04:22.860> actually

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
horse because and this might actually

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.690 
horse because and this might actually
add<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.970> is<00:04:24.150> on<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.020> last<00:04:25.260> time<00:04:25.560> there<00:04:26.520> was

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
add to it is on the last time there was

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.940 
add to it is on the last time there was
the<00:04:27.000> fire<00:04:27.210> horse<00:04:27.540> like<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.200> said<00:04:28.410> this<00:04:28.500> is<00:04:28.650> every

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
the fire horse like I said this is every

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.290 
the fire horse like I said this is every
12<00:04:29.220> years<00:04:29.430> they<00:04:29.550> have<00:04:29.640> a<00:04:29.670> bunch<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:30.030> horses

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
12 years they have a bunch of horses

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.970 
12 years they have a bunch of horses
they<00:04:30.510> had<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.720> fire<00:04:30.960> horse<00:04:31.260> they<00:04:31.770> have<00:04:31.890> the

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
they had the fire horse they have the

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.150 
they had the fire horse they have the
earth<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.490> metal<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.970> water<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.510> wood<00:04:34.160> the

earth the metal the water the wood the
last<00:04:35.400> time<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.760> fire<00:04:35.970> horse<00:04:36.210> was<00:04:36.480> was<00:04:36.950> 1966<00:04:37.950> to

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
last time the fire horse was was 1966 to

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.670 
last time the fire horse was was 1966 to
1967<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:39.240> that's<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:39.540> only<00:04:39.660> one<00:04:39.900> in<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.230> 60s

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
1967 so that's the only one in the 60s

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.730 
1967 so that's the only one in the 60s
it<00:04:40.830> was<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.040> fire<00:04:41.340> horse<00:04:42.140> all<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:43.410> other<00:04:43.560> ones

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
it was a fire horse all the other ones

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.070 
it was a fire horse all the other ones
after<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.250> are<00:04:44.550> not<00:04:44.700> the<00:04:44.880> fire<00:04:45.090> horse<00:04:45.360> the

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
after that are not the fire horse the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.820 
after that are not the fire horse the
next<00:04:46.380> one<00:04:46.530> like<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:46.830> said<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:47.250> in<00:04:47.370> 2026<00:04:48.240> 2027<00:04:49.230> so

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
next one like I said is in 2026 2027 so

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.200 
next one like I said is in 2026 2027 so
that<00:04:49.980> might<00:04:50.160> be<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.310> connection<00:04:50.640> right<00:04:50.940> there

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
that might be a connection right there

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.470 
that might be a connection right there
in<00:04:51.419> some<00:04:51.930> way<00:04:52.080> like<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:53.180> in<00:04:54.180> conclusion

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
in some way like that so in conclusion

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.470 
in some way like that so in conclusion
what<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:54.990> think<00:04:55.350> honestly<00:04:55.800> is<00:04:56.100> I<00:04:56.550> think<00:04:56.700> because

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
what I think honestly is I think because

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.610 
what I think honestly is I think because
a<00:04:57.630> lot<00:04:57.780> of<00:04:57.810> people<00:04:58.020> are<00:04:58.110> thinking<00:04:58.290> like<00:04:58.350> how

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
a lot of people are thinking like how

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.580 
a lot of people are thinking like how
did<00:04:58.800> they<00:04:58.890> get<00:04:59.070> from<00:04:59.660> the<00:05:00.660> United<00:05:01.020> States<00:05:01.290> over

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
did they get from the United States over

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.930 
did they get from the United States over
to<00:05:01.710> China<00:05:01.980> through<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.310> teleporter

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
to China through the teleporter

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.120 
to China through the teleporter
I<00:05:03.060> think<00:05:03.660> that's<00:05:03.840> possibly<00:05:04.380> part<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.919> next

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
I think that's possibly part of the next

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.920 
I think that's possibly part of the next
Easter<00:05:05.490> egg<00:05:05.640> maybe<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.360> end<00:05:06.510> of<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:06.810> or

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
Easter egg maybe the end of it or

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.300 
Easter egg maybe the end of it or
something<00:05:07.110> like<00:05:07.230> that<00:05:07.290> is<00:05:07.680> you<00:05:07.890> have<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.070> take

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
something like that is you have to take

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.760 
something like that is you have to take
the<00:05:08.550> horse<00:05:08.760> into<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.480> teleporter<00:05:10.169> and<00:05:10.320> it

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
the horse into the teleporter and it

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.210 
the horse into the teleporter and it
takes<00:05:10.980> you<00:05:11.100> to<00:05:11.220> China<00:05:11.690> another<00:05:12.690> theory<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.220> you

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
takes you to China another theory is you

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.670 
takes you to China another theory is you
know<00:05:14.340> if<00:05:14.520> we're<00:05:14.700> going<00:05:14.940> to<00:05:15.030> China<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:16.410> it's

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
know if we're going to China and it's

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.450 
know if we're going to China and it's
2026<00:05:17.640> 2027<00:05:18.450> or<00:05:18.740> 1966<00:05:19.740> or<00:05:19.860> whatever<00:05:20.130> it's<00:05:20.430> the

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
2026 2027 or 1966 or whatever it's the

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.940 
2026 2027 or 1966 or whatever it's the
year<00:05:20.760> of<00:05:20.790> the<00:05:20.880> fire<00:05:21.120> horse<00:05:21.560> one<00:05:22.560> guy<00:05:22.710> who<00:05:22.770> put

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
year of the fire horse one guy who put

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.440 
year of the fire horse one guy who put
up<00:05:23.040> a<00:05:23.100> video<00:05:23.220> should<00:05:23.460> check<00:05:23.640> out<00:05:23.730> his<00:05:23.850> video<00:05:24.090> he

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
up a video should check out his video he

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.630 
up a video should check out his video he
thinks<00:05:24.720> that<00:05:24.840> there's<00:05:24.990> gonna<00:05:25.110> be<00:05:25.320> like<00:05:25.560> a<00:05:25.740> like

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
thinks that there's gonna be like a like

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.520 
thinks that there's gonna be like a like
a<00:05:26.669> horse<00:05:27.060> boss<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:27.690> I<00:05:27.870> think<00:05:28.110> that<00:05:28.260> would<00:05:28.380> be<00:05:28.500> a

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
a horse boss and I think that would be a

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.750 
a horse boss and I think that would be a
good<00:05:28.710> theory<00:05:29.070> is<00:05:29.160> that<00:05:29.280> there's<00:05:29.460> gonna<00:05:29.580> be

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
good theory is that there's gonna be

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.250 
good theory is that there's gonna be
horses<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.300> we're<00:05:30.419> gonna<00:05:30.510> fire<00:05:30.780> horses<00:05:31.169> that

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
horses that we're gonna fire horses that

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.330 
horses that we're gonna fire horses that
we're<00:05:31.350> gonna<00:05:31.440> have<00:05:31.530> to<00:05:31.620> kill<00:05:31.830> kind<00:05:32.100> of<00:05:32.160> like<00:05:32.280> a

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
we're gonna have to kill kind of like a

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.000 
we're gonna have to kill kind of like a
dog<00:05:32.580> ground<00:05:32.880> or<00:05:33.150> something<00:05:33.480> like<00:05:33.600> that<00:05:34.010> also

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
dog ground or something like that also

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.890 
dog ground or something like that also
the<00:05:35.250> last<00:05:35.430> theory<00:05:35.850> on<00:05:36.150> what<00:05:36.480> I<00:05:36.510> was<00:05:36.630> talking

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
the last theory on what I was talking

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.390 
the last theory on what I was talking
about<00:05:36.960> how<00:05:37.200> it<00:05:37.380> could<00:05:37.560> be<00:05:37.680> Germany<00:05:38.160> it<00:05:38.280> could

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
about how it could be Germany it could

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.190 
about how it could be Germany it could
be<00:05:38.460> a<00:05:38.520> china<00:05:38.790> town<00:05:39.000> in<00:05:39.150> Germany<00:05:39.540> and<00:05:39.690> we<00:05:40.050> take

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
be a china town in Germany and we take

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.409 
be a china town in Germany and we take
the<00:05:40.320> horse<00:05:40.530> back<00:05:40.740> to<00:05:40.860> Germany<00:05:41.240> it's<00:05:42.240> just

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
the horse back to Germany it's just

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.450 
the horse back to Germany it's just
maybe<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:43.080> could<00:05:43.200> be<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:43.410> possible<00:05:43.860> end<00:05:44.160> of

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
maybe it could be the possible end of

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.580 
maybe it could be the possible end of
the<00:05:45.090> story<00:05:45.390> mode<00:05:45.600> for<00:05:45.840> zombies<00:05:46.230> because<00:05:46.500> you

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
the story mode for zombies because you

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.780 
the story mode for zombies because you
think<00:05:46.770> about<00:05:46.919> there's<00:05:47.130> not<00:05:47.280> much<00:05:47.460> more<00:05:47.669> they

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
think about there's not much more they

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.100 
think about there's not much more they
can<00:05:47.820> do<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.360> would<00:05:48.450> make<00:05:48.570> a<00:05:48.600> lot<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:48.840> sense

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
can do and it would make a lot of sense

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.230 
can do and it would make a lot of sense
it<00:05:49.350> started<00:05:49.800> in<00:05:49.950> Germany<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:50.550> now<00:05:50.970> it's<00:05:51.120> gonna

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
it started in Germany and now it's gonna

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.480 
it started in Germany and now it's gonna
end<00:05:51.480> in<00:05:51.660> the<00:05:51.720> Jeremy<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.560> story<00:05:52.980> came<00:05:53.220> full

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
end in the Jeremy the story came full

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.250 
end in the Jeremy the story came full
circle<00:05:53.520> so<00:05:54.150> it<00:05:54.240> could<00:05:54.390> be<00:05:54.540> a<00:05:54.570> china<00:05:54.840> town<00:05:55.080> in

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
circle so it could be a china town in

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.350 
circle so it could be a china town in
Germany<00:05:55.650> that's<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.760> theories<00:05:57.030> that<00:05:57.060> I<00:05:57.180> have

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
Germany that's the theories that I have

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.930 
Germany that's the theories that I have
guys<00:05:57.600> you<00:05:57.810> guys<00:05:57.960> let<00:05:58.169> me<00:05:58.200> know<00:05:58.289> what<00:05:58.380> you<00:05:58.530> guys

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
guys you guys let me know what you guys

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.550 
guys you guys let me know what you guys
I<00:05:59.120> really<00:05:59.510> do<00:05:59.660> think<00:05:59.810> I'm<00:05:59.960> onto<00:06:00.170> something

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
I really do think I'm onto something

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.990 
I really do think I'm onto something
with<00:06:00.650> this<00:06:00.800> so<00:06:01.070> I<00:06:01.310> know<00:06:01.580> there's<00:06:01.820> a<00:06:01.850> lot<00:06:01.970> of

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
with this so I know there's a lot of

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.130 
with this so I know there's a lot of
people<00:06:02.180> are<00:06:02.330> trying<00:06:02.450> to<00:06:02.630> figure<00:06:02.840> this<00:06:02.930> out<00:06:03.080> so

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
people are trying to figure this out so
