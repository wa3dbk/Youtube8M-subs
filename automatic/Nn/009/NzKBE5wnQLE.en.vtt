00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
he's in a bad spot I could have been

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.640 
he's in a bad spot I could have been
alternatively<00:02:56.120> waited<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.900> then<00:02:57.110> did<00:02:57.380> that

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
alternatively waited and then did that

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.010 
alternatively waited and then did that
for<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.070> 3<00:02:58.490> a<00:02:58.520> 0<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.820> clear<00:03:00.610> but<00:03:01.840> over<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.870> last

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
for a 3 a 0 a clear but over the last

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.180 
for a 3 a 0 a clear but over the last
like<00:03:03.230> 10<00:03:03.830> battles<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.970> haven't<00:03:05.300> really<00:03:06.190> had

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
like 10 battles I haven't really had

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.590 
like 10 battles I haven't really had
much<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.580> need<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.910> use<00:03:08.030> blade<00:03:08.270> furry<00:03:08.510> I

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
much of a need to use blade furry I

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.290 
much of a need to use blade furry I
might<00:03:08.870> actually<00:03:08.990> remove<00:03:09.590> that<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:14.150> this

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
might actually remove that is this

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.970 
might actually remove that is this
important<00:03:14.860> do<00:03:15.860> I<00:03:15.890> have<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.100> worry<00:03:16.280> about<00:03:16.430> it

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
important do I have to worry about it

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.210 
important do I have to worry about it
what<00:03:18.980> is<00:03:19.070> this<00:03:19.750> give<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.840> charge<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:21.590> you

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
what is this give it charge and you

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.860 
what is this give it charge and you
should<00:03:22.580> have<00:03:22.700> probably<00:03:23.030> not<00:03:23.420> worried<00:03:23.810> about

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
should have probably not worried about

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.950 
should have probably not worried about
that<00:03:24.050> too<00:03:24.470> much<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:25.040> you<00:03:25.310> know<00:03:25.430> what<00:03:28.810> yeah<00:03:29.810> I

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
like that field photonica gives me some

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.870 
like that field photonica gives me some
tongs<00:03:34.880> for<00:03:35.060> later<00:03:35.330> on<00:03:35.920> next<00:03:36.920> I'll<00:03:37.160> probably<00:03:37.370> do

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
figured he'd have it executes and I'm

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.740 
figured he'd have it executes and I'm
glad<00:04:28.220> he's<00:04:28.370> actually<00:04:28.520> using<00:04:28.699> an<00:04:29.000> execute<00:04:29.449> now

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750

longer<00:05:20.060> than<00:05:20.419> just<00:05:20.720> next<00:05:21.080> turn<00:05:21.380> so<00:05:21.860> I<00:05:22.220> want<00:05:22.460> to

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
longer than just next turn so I want to

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.490 
longer than just next turn so I want to
put<00:05:22.669> on<00:05:22.819> here<00:05:23.150> just<00:05:23.449> to<00:05:23.690> be<00:05:23.720> safe<00:05:24.080> because<00:05:24.350> a

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
put on here just to be safe because a

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.930 
put on here just to be safe because a
next<00:05:25.069> time<00:05:25.160> he'll<00:05:25.340> have<00:05:25.520> to<00:05:25.639> go<00:05:25.729> through<00:05:25.910> this

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
next time he'll have to go through this

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.570 
next time he'll have to go through this
one<00:05:26.120> way<00:05:26.180> or<00:05:26.300> another<00:05:26.330> so<00:05:27.160> that<00:05:28.160> would<00:05:28.340> be<00:05:28.400> kind

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
one way or another so that would be kind

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:42.550 
one way or another so that would be kind
of<00:05:28.610> short-lived<00:05:33.910> okay<00:05:39.880> well<00:05:40.880> then<00:05:41.090> as<00:05:41.560> you

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
of short-lived okay well then as you

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.580 
of short-lived okay well then as you

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.279 
defies ringleader was awesome I denied
him<00:05:52.610> to<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:52.910> point<00:05:53.150> where<00:05:53.449> he<00:05:53.660> had<00:05:53.930> to

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
him to the point where he had to

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.010 
him to the point where he had to
surrender<00:05:54.940> so<00:05:55.940> overall<00:05:56.300> i'd<00:05:56.660> have<00:05:56.810> to<00:05:56.840> say

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
surrender so overall i'd have to say

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.300 
surrender so overall i'd have to say
that<00:05:57.169> was<00:05:57.199> a<00:05:57.289> win<00:05:57.470> mind<00:05:57.770> you<00:05:57.889> i'm<00:05:58.009> pretty<00:05:58.190> sure

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
that was a win mind you i'm pretty sure

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.290 
that was a win mind you i'm pretty sure
he<00:05:58.400> could<00:05:58.460> have<00:05:58.610> kind<00:05:58.759> of<00:05:58.789> stuck<00:05:59.030> through<00:05:59.270> it

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
he could have kind of stuck through it

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.510 
he could have kind of stuck through it
but<00:05:59.630> he<00:05:59.900> was<00:06:00.020> pretty<00:06:00.169> much<00:06:00.259> dead<00:06:00.500> I<00:06:00.740> don't

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
but he was pretty much dead I don't

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.290 
but he was pretty much dead I don't
think<00:06:01.699> there<00:06:01.789> would<00:06:01.880> have<00:06:01.940> been<00:06:02.000> anything

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
think there would have been anything

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.460 
think there would have been anything
that<00:06:02.570> he<00:06:02.630> would<00:06:02.720> have<00:06:02.780> been<00:06:02.870> able<00:06:02.960> to<00:06:03.080> take<00:06:03.289> out

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
that he would have been able to take out

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.629 
that he would have been able to take out
right<00:06:03.650> then<00:06:03.800> and<00:06:03.830> there<00:06:03.979> especially<00:06:04.250> that<00:06:04.610> I

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
right then and there especially that I

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.629 
right then and there especially that I
had<00:06:05.000> like<00:06:05.240> the<00:06:05.630> venture<00:06:06.080> co<00:06:06.460> he<00:06:07.460> would<00:06:07.550> have

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
had like the venture co he would have

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.189 
had like the venture co he would have
surrendered<00:06:07.789> next<00:06:08.419> turn<00:06:08.630> one<00:06:08.840> way<00:06:08.870> or<00:06:09.139> another

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
surrendered next turn one way or another

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.370 
surrendered next turn one way or another
so<00:06:10.419> yeah<00:06:11.419> he<00:06:11.539> would<00:06:11.659> probably<00:06:11.810> been<00:06:12.050> dead<00:06:12.229> in

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
so yeah he would probably been dead in

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.089 
so yeah he would probably been dead in
about<00:06:12.470> three<00:06:13.310> turns<00:06:13.580> maybe<00:06:14.120> ish<00:06:14.590> but<00:06:15.590> overall

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
about three turns maybe ish but overall

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:17.980 
about three turns maybe ish but overall
that<00:06:16.370> was<00:06:16.490> actually<00:06:16.729> quite<00:06:16.789> fun<00:06:17.000> hopefully

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
that was actually quite fun hopefully

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.020 
that was actually quite fun hopefully
