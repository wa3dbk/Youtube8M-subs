00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
for papering around doors apply the

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.480 
for papering around doors apply the
sheet<00:00:03.149> so<00:00:03.389> it<00:00:03.510> overlaps<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:04.589> frame<00:00:04.830> making

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
sheet so it overlaps the frame making

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.600 
sheet so it overlaps the frame making
sure<00:00:05.759> you<00:00:05.970> match<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.509> pattern<00:00:06.839> at<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:06.930> edge

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
sure you match the pattern at the edge

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.580 
sure you match the pattern at the edge
using<00:00:08.610> your<00:00:08.730> scissors<00:00:09.090> cut<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.630> diagonal<00:00:10.110> line

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
using your scissors cut a diagonal line

under the switch smooth down the paper

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.280 
under the switch smooth down the paper
and<00:01:12.810> tighten<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> screws<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> fascia

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290

decorate<00:01:19.950> behind<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.880> radiator<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.659> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
decorate behind a radiator then you

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.530 
decorate behind a radiator then you
should<00:01:22.259> remove<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.130> radiator<00:01:23.490> from<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.330> wall

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
should remove the radiator from the wall

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.109 
should remove the radiator from the wall
however<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.860> isn't<00:01:26.130> possible<00:01:26.460> then

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
however if this isn't possible then

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.420 
however if this isn't possible then
begin<00:01:27.600> by<00:01:27.810> switching<00:01:28.439> off<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.619> radiator<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
begin by switching off the radiator and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.789 
begin by switching off the radiator and
making<00:01:30.060> sure<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.479> cool<00:01:33.110> make<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> note<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
making sure it's cool make a note of the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.800 
making sure it's cool make a note of the
position<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> radiator<00:01:35.880> wall<00:01:36.240> brackets

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
position of the radiator wall brackets

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.830 
position of the radiator wall brackets
by<00:01:37.350> measuring<00:01:37.890> from<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.520> edge<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.970> top<00:01:39.630> of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
by measuring from the edge and top of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.020 
by measuring from the edge and top of
the<00:01:40.020> radiator<00:01:42.950> now<00:01:43.950> hang<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> wall<00:01:44.520> paper<00:01:44.820> is

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the radiator now hang the wall paper is

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.499 
the radiator now hang the wall paper is
normal<00:01:45.450> over<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:45.990> radiator<00:01:46.850> cut<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> panel

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
normal over the radiator cut out a panel

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.840 
normal over the radiator cut out a panel
so<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.079> paper<00:01:49.470> will<00:01:49.920> fit<00:01:50.250> around<00:01:50.430> the
