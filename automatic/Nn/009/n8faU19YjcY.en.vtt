00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
you and what I'm doing here is I'm

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.500 
you and what I'm doing here is I'm
actually<00:00:07.309> demonstrating<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.400> last<00:00:08.670> step<00:00:09.210> and

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
actually demonstrating the last step and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.350 
actually demonstrating the last step and
actually<00:00:10.260> they're<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.250> series<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.759> steps<00:00:12.150> in

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360

important<00:00:14.849> than<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:15.120> producing<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> shirt

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
important than just producing the shirt

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.450 
important than just producing the shirt
is<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:17.039> messages<00:00:17.550> those<00:00:17.730> are<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.000> shirts<00:00:19.460> for

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
darker garments Twitter out pretty quite

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.310 
darker garments Twitter out pretty quite
simple<00:02:46.240> it's<00:02:46.330> just<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.630> white<00:02:46.840> need<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.170> be

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
simple it's just that a white need to be

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.130 
simple it's just that a white need to be
able<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.560> tuft<00:02:47.830> actually<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:49.750> actually<00:02:49.870> a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
able to tuft actually it's actually a

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.520 
able to tuft actually it's actually a
little<00:02:50.320> tougher<00:02:50.680> than<00:02:50.800> most<00:02:51.040> inks<00:02:51.780> well<00:02:52.780> at

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
little tougher than most inks well at

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.690 
little tougher than most inks well at
least<00:02:53.710> that's<00:02:53.890> my<00:02:54.010> experience<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.700> you

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
least that's my experience and so you

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.970 
least that's my experience and so you
have<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:59.080> should<00:02:59.110> have<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.410> take<00:02:59.590> this<00:02:59.740> long

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
have you should have to take this long

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.860 
have you should have to take this long
but<00:03:00.190> it's<00:03:00.340> just<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.730> pink<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.780> little

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
but it's just that pink is a little

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.030 
but it's just that pink is a little
thick<00:03:02.260> didn't<00:03:02.980> get<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:03.840> nice<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:04.870> warm<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.920> was

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
thick didn't get it nice and warm it was

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.460 
thick didn't get it nice and warm it was
just<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.280> quick<00:03:06.490> demonstration<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:08.290> yeah

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
just a quick demonstration so yeah

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.560 
just a quick demonstration so yeah
usually<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.160> mean<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.460> cannot<00:03:09.760> probably<00:03:10.270> more
