00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.040
 party 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:12.359
 do not 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.359
 villarino 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.739
 another player that marked storytelling 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.839
 each of us each of the players has with more than five 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.269
 doors with drawings 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.529
 of this one for more 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.919
 then there is a storyteller that changes in each one in each manga 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.150
 extend your hand 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.130
 Is chosen 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.130
 one of the harvests for example this one 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.700
 i after playing 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.550
 vienna 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.860
 oo 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.010
 a phrase 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.760
 happened that represents to win 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.710
 that way that idea that has to be 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.970
 ee 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.989
 specific enough to 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.960
 vienna 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.120
 but later generic so that not all the Arab world 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.770
 then the player 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.410
 remember how many put your letters 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.300
 and want 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.640
 we remember 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.670
 26 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.140
 then the rest of the players look at their last cards 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.530
 and they put 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 something that is related to several injuries 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.350
 petrobras - for example the second player alive this was really is 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.450
 and the third place 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.610
 because they are all 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.610
 the storyteller to the hilt 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.820
 and exposes them 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.750
 and the rest of players 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.420
 all players 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.780
 I want to thank 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.780
 cut out points that caracas represents the actress 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.260
 we have these three people here 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.460
 well 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.790
 there are some numbers in CÃ¡ceres these are not yet closed their parents the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.930
 people vote 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.610
 for example this move bogota 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.410
 letter number 1 this to number three and this is the storyteller too 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.719
 to number one 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:13.489
 then he added points depending on the successes that have occurred 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:19.629
 if all the players guess the storyteller's letter that have another point 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.119
 and the other players get two points 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.329
 if the storyteller's letter did not 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.329
 edward of the player to raise funds with little football and everyone else was 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.949
 in two points 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:37.179
 and what interests councilman by then that only some guesses in his letter 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:41.399
 if that is the case of earning points in which the house took three points 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.199
 and the rest 6 nothing 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.220
 and for more there 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.179
 hannah montana special 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.179
 p those caracas 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.439
 that have also been cut we imagine that you take 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:57.619
 to guarantee 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.349
 the regulator gropes 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.489
 bounded 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.019
 sacred art 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.290
 that I saved games then it is worth for canada for each player that endures 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.949
 to a caterva mehr 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:16.859
 the player who owns the card who is estebanÃ© also takes a 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.769
 point on board 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.110
 consequently until this framework ends 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.739
 and on top of the victims
