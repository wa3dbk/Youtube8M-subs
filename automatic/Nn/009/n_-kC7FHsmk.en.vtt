00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.100 
mostly affiliated with beginners it
seems<00:04:49.820> that<00:04:50.820> they<00:04:51.120> obviously<00:04:51.360> could<00:04:51.750> practice

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
seems that they obviously could practice

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.110 
seems that they obviously could practice
opposing<00:04:52.500> much<00:04:52.650> better<00:04:52.950> I<00:04:53.250> really<00:04:53.820> don't<00:04:53.970> know

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
opposing much better I really don't know

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.400 
opposing much better I really don't know
if<00:04:54.300> it's<00:04:54.450> gotten<00:04:54.690> better<00:04:54.810> or<00:04:55.020> worse<00:04:55.139> over<00:04:55.380> time

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
if it's gotten better or worse over time

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.290 
if it's gotten better or worse over time
I<00:04:55.710> just<00:04:55.860> know<00:04:55.979> that<00:04:56.130> I<00:04:56.400> feel<00:04:56.910> like<00:04:57.000> everyone

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
I just know that I feel like everyone

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.200 
I just know that I feel like everyone
could<00:04:57.419> step<00:04:57.600> up<00:04:57.630> their<00:04:57.840> game<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.520> I<00:04:59.520> think<00:05:00.120> it

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
could step up their game and I think it

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.600 
could step up their game and I think it
makes<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.990> events<00:05:01.650> more<00:05:01.770> entertaining<00:05:02.220> I

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
makes the events more entertaining I

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.830 
makes the events more entertaining I
feel<00:05:03.240> like<00:05:03.390> if<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.320> Posen<00:05:04.620> was<00:05:04.740> better<00:05:04.979> and
