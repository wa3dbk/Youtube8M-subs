00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.430
So, the mantle's in.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.700
We're moving along.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.010
Should we paint it or not?

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.590
I've made up my mind.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.179
They say an eco-friendly house can't be built
in 150 days for $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:18.179
I'm Allen Smith.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.630
Join me as I push the limits with time, budget
and creativity, with the Garden Home Challenge,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.560
exclusively on eHow Home.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.560
You know, there'e just something marvelous
about a fireplace.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.800
And it's so thrilling to finally see this
room –or at least this end of the room–

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.800
where we have what is close to the finished
wall material.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.340
So, I have paint to apply.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.790
But the mantle is now attached, not completely
and permanently attached, because there's

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.070
a lot of work that has to be done to yet–we'll
get that in just a minute.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.950
But what I'm working on right here is we have
about a 14 inch expanse from just in here,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.830
just inside this part of the mantle to here,
and then it's 41 inches across here.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.269
And what I wanna do is make sure that we're
thinking about what this hearth stone will

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.269
be.

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:08.549
And this is a very practical part of a firebox.

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.689
The idea initially was put forth –I believe
it was by Marcus– that perhaps we do this

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.069
with some sort of brick or brick tile.

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.299
If we did solid brick, they're gonna sit up
above the floor–I don't really like that.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.280
I want something flush with the floor.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.700
Particularly if you wanna put a chair or you
wanna set something near the firebox, if you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.020
have something sitting up, it's gonna always
going to be sort of whopper-jaw and will never

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.249
be able to sit level.

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:40.469
And the other thing is with an insert like
this, if this were a classic firebox, this

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:47.079
part here, the bottom of the firebox itself
would be level here, so it's not–so, whatever

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:52.409
this material is here for the hearth, we're
gonna bring up across here, and we're gonna

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.340
bring it up vertically and across the top
horizontally and then back down vertically.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.389
Now, if we went with brick, we would have
to be using half sawn brick or brick tile.

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:06.920
This is very smooth.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.940
There's really no way to attach that, I don't
think, very successfully.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.130
This is gonna get hot–you're gonna get expansion
and contraction, and you're gonna have mortar

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.410
breaking and cracking.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.640
So, it just makes sense to me that we find
a lovely piece of stone, not anything fancy,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.640
we don't need granite.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.891
Would love to find a piece of field stone,
something that's from nearby, something that

00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:34.630
feels really indigenous, for both the hearth
and for this complete surround around this

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.470
firebox insert.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.080
The idea is that you really don't want it
to look like an insert, if you can.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.610
And I think playing down the materials will
really help that.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.430
Now, let's talk about the mantle itself.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.340
You can see that this mantle– well, I'm
very proud of it, by the way, because we were

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.340
recycling.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.570
This mantle comes from the 1830s.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.480
It still has it's original milk paint finish.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.591
And milk paint was a very inexpensive way
to mix pigment with milk and apply it and

00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:04.030
get color onto things.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.590
And you can see, this was really sort of a
lovely dove gray here.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.250
But it's all but come off.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.910
And I think that what we need to do here is
do just what we did with the front door: And

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.800
that's fill in some of these gaps in these
places.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.740
This mantle had been through a fire.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.010
I pointed it out in the past, and you'd seen
how it had burned, even charred here.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.930
So, what I'm gonna do is have Tony take this
down, and we're gonna fix it up, and we're

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.730
gonna put a nice coat of paint on it, because
I think it's gonna fit into the decor of the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.980
house beautifully that way.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.100
And we're at that point now: We're beginning
to have to think about what will the final

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.910
decor of this room begin to look like.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.450
Hey, keep checking in with us, because this
is going to transform very rapidly.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.960
