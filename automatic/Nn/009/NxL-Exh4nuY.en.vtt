us bees really necessary to have a good
USB<00:00:26.580> hub<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.840> we've<00:00:27.990> got<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.439> crazy<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.519> USB

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
USB hub so we've got the crazy and USB

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.299 
USB hub so we've got the crazy and USB
hub<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.510> USB<00:00:30.720> 2.0<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.679> incredibly<00:00:32.099> stable

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
hub it's USB 2.0 it's incredibly stable

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.270 
hub it's USB 2.0 it's incredibly stable
we've<00:00:32.790> we've<00:00:33.600> tested<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.290> every

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
we've we've tested it with every

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.080 
we've we've tested it with every
controller<00:00:36.079> that<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.290> used<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:37.710> serato<00:00:38.090> so

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
controller that is used with serato so

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.389 
controller that is used with serato so
it's<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.329> really<00:00:39.809> stable<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.980> you're<00:00:41.190> not<00:00:41.280> going

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
it's a really stable so you're not going

to have a you know have a thing crash on
you<00:00:43.710> when<00:00:43.829> you're<00:00:43.920> out<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.940> again<00:00:45.030> or

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
you when you're out do it again or

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.720 
you when you're out do it again or
something<00:00:45.590> it's<00:00:46.590> pretty<00:00:46.739> sweet<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.399> designed

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
something it's pretty sweet we designed

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.250 
something it's pretty sweet we designed
it<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> where<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.450> actually<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.989> clip

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
it to where you can actually just clip

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.639 
it to where you can actually just clip
it<00:00:49.289> right<00:00:49.620> onto<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> tray<00:00:51.289> clip<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.410> launched

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
it right onto the tray clip it launched

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.799 
it right onto the tray clip it launched
different<00:00:52.980> spots<00:00:53.250> wherever<00:00:53.730> wherever<00:00:54.629> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
different spots wherever wherever it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.529 
different spots wherever wherever it
suits<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.140> best<00:00:55.789> it<00:00:56.789> attaches<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
suits you best it attaches to the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.189 
suits you best it attaches to the
substrate<00:00:57.989> well<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.579> pretty<00:01:00.210> neat<00:01:00.359> gives

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
substrate well so it's pretty neat gives

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.250 
substrate well so it's pretty neat gives
you<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> lot<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:02.190> lot<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.789> flexibility<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
you a lot of a lot of flexibility and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.289 
you a lot of a lot of flexibility and
then<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> kind<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
then it really is going to kind of

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.539 
then it really is going to kind of
revolutionize<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.320> look<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.130> feel<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.340> your

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
power demanding of you know hard drives

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.520 
power demanding of you know hard drives
or<00:03:09.940> many<00:03:10.239> controllers<00:03:10.599> might<00:03:11.110> have<00:03:11.319> an<00:03:11.410> issue

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
or many controllers might have an issue

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.500 
or many controllers might have an issue
if<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:11.920> start<00:03:12.130> packing<00:03:12.459> them<00:03:12.549> into<00:03:12.819> it<00:03:13.000> but

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
if you start packing them into it but

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.539 
if you start packing them into it but
generally<00:03:14.470> speaking<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.950> should<00:03:15.130> work<00:03:15.280> great
