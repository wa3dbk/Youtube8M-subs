let's<00:00:35.450> take<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> look<00:00:36.750> here<00:00:38.809> as<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.110> see

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
let's take a look here as you can see

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.150 
let's take a look here as you can see
the<00:00:40.620> darker<00:00:40.980> spots<00:00:41.360> where<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:43.010> chunk<00:00:44.010> of

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the darker spots where the chunk of

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.119 
the darker spots where the chunk of
chunks<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> feta<00:00:45.300> cheese<00:00:45.450> are<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.710> there<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.100> a

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
chunks of feta cheese are so there is a

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.840 
chunks of feta cheese are so there is a
six<00:00:51.000> cheese<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:52.250> can't<00:00:53.250> really<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.670> much

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
six cheese on here can't really see much

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.590 
six cheese on here can't really see much
of<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:55.010> Asiago<00:00:56.010> crust<00:00:56.550> cheese<00:00:56.940> crust<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.449> guess

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
of the Asiago crust cheese crust I guess

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.250 
of the Asiago crust cheese crust I guess
that's<00:00:57.780> maybe<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.350> little<00:00:58.590> bit<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.930> let's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that's maybe a little bit of it so let's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:13.320 
that's maybe a little bit of it so let's
take<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.500> taste<00:01:01.829> here

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.860
