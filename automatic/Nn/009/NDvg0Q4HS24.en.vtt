centre-halves are well covered and I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.250 
centre-halves are well covered and I
read<00:00:31.650> his<00:00:32.160> contracts<00:00:32.730> fin<00:00:32.880> up<00:00:33.300> at<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.750> end<00:00:34.140> of

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
read his contracts fin up at the end of

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.660 
read his contracts fin up at the end of
the<00:00:34.350> season<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.890> maybe<00:00:35.070> bringing<00:00:35.460> another

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the season so maybe bringing another

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.020 
the season so maybe bringing another
centre-half<00:00:36.559> could<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.649> been<00:00:37.829> an<00:00:38.399> idea<00:00:38.820> but

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
centre-half could have been an idea but

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.400 
centre-half could have been an idea but
apart<00:00:39.329> from<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.719> squad<00:00:39.930> looks<00:00:40.079> strong

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
apart from that the squad looks strong

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.479 
apart from that the squad looks strong
it<00:00:40.559> looks<00:00:40.710> balanced<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.219> didn't<00:00:41.430> think

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
it looks balanced so I didn't think

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.010 
it looks balanced so I didn't think
there<00:00:41.670> was<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> necessity<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.329> bring<00:00:42.540> anyone<00:00:42.840> in

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
there was a necessity to bring anyone in

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.170 
there was a necessity to bring anyone in
and<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.469> balls<00:00:43.590> talked<00:00:44.070> about<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:45.000> know<00:00:45.090> what

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and a balls talked about you know what

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.130 
and a balls talked about you know what
you're<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> better<00:00:45.719> by<00:00:45.960> or

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
you're going to get the better by or

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.569 
you're going to get the better by or
you'll<00:00:46.500> probably<00:00:46.739> turn<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.430> few

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
you'll probably turn it on for a few

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.979 
you'll probably turn it on for a few
months<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.879> then<00:00:48.030> they'll<00:00:48.120> go<00:00:48.239> missing<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.780> I

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
months and then they'll go missing so I

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.319 
months and then they'll go missing so I
think<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.160> know<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:51.059> would<00:00:51.180> probably

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
think that you know that would probably

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.810 
think that you know that would probably
a<00:00:51.480> good<00:00:51.570> thing<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:51.899> West<00:00:52.079> Hamlet<00:00:52.699> that<00:00:53.699> he

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
a good thing for West Hamlet that he

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.310 
a good thing for West Hamlet that he
didn't<00:00:54.059> sign<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.539> got<00:00:54.570> stuck<00:00:54.899> how<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.110> got

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
didn't sign you got stuck how you got

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.250 
didn't sign you got stuck how you got
Andy<00:00:55.559> Carroll<00:00:55.920> Valencia<00:00:57.020> plenty<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.109> options

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
Andy Carroll Valencia plenty of options

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.660 
Andy Carroll Valencia plenty of options
there<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.859> don't<00:00:59.219> think<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.520> was<00:00:59.609> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
there so I don't think it was a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.090 
there so I don't think it was a
necessity<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.410> suspend<00:01:01.410> any<00:01:01.530> money<00:01:01.739> really<00:01:01.949> in

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
what do you think well I think it could

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.120 
what do you think well I think it could
be<00:01:33.720> truth<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.079> both<00:01:34.229> sides<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> mean

be truth on both sides there I mean

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.219 
be truth on both sides there I mean
ultimately<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:36.240> look<00:01:36.420> at<00:01:36.570> Winston<00:01:36.960> Reid<00:01:37.110> I

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229

ultimately you look at Winston Reid I
mean<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.500> hear<00:01:37.680> he's<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.159> Tottenham<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.700> big

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.749

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
a squads very strong but it would be a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.050 
a squads very strong but it would be a
chance<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.770> maybe<00:01:49.920> make<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.399> or<00:01:50.520> two<00:01:50.640> marquee

Paulo future arum if you remember who

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.490 
Paulo future arum if you remember who
was<00:03:45.240> probably<00:03:45.780> one<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.050> best<00:03:46.170> players<00:03:46.440> in

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
was probably one of the best players in

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.530 
was probably one of the best players in
the<00:03:46.590> world<00:03:46.650> book<00:03:46.980> was<00:03:47.100> unfit<00:03:47.550> so<00:03:47.820> if<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.360> could

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
the world book was unfit so if you could

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.810 
the world book was unfit so if you could
get<00:03:48.720> 10<00:03:48.990> 15<00:03:49.380> 20<00:03:49.680> games<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.950> year<00:03:49.980> out<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.459> then<00:03:50.610> a

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
get 10 15 20 games a year out and then a

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
get 10 15 20 games a year out and then a
hundred<00:03:51.180> percent<00:03:51.270> and<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.720> would<00:03:51.810> be

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
hundred percent and it would be

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.020 
hundred percent and it would be
fantastic<00:03:52.050> for<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.620> club<00:03:52.770> but<00:03:53.030> realistically

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
fantastic for the club but realistically

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.699 
fantastic for the club but realistically
I<00:03:54.180> think<00:03:54.209> you'd<00:03:54.510> probably<00:03:54.750> be<00:03:55.080> paying<00:03:55.500> well

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
I think you'd probably be paying well

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.290 
I think you'd probably be paying well
over<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:56.010> odds<00:03:56.160> for<00:03:56.280> someone<00:03:56.640> who<00:03:56.760> might<00:03:57.180> be

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
over the odds for someone who might be

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.930 
over the odds for someone who might be
well<00:03:57.450> past<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.930> well<00:03:58.709> stay<00:03:59.040> on<00:03:59.190> transfers<00:03:59.670> Matt
