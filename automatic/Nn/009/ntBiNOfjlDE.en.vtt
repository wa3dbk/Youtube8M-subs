00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.109
 is local novak and in the video where I 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.170
 I want to send a message to you 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.969
 the following message never covers interest 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.410
 in dentistry 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.650
 This is the message that I have to give. 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.230
 you today and it is if you criticize me 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.100
 teacher should come to think it crazy I 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.990
 I'm gonna explain 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.960
 I will pass on to you today a technique 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.539
 a very powerful sales technique 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.939
 very nice sales and what you can do 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.759
 a lot of difference for you mainly 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.640
 when the treatments are more expensive 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.820
 is a case of habilitation or aesthetics 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.610
 At home in the neighborhood, okay, let's go there like 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 works today that is customary and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.219
 clinics and clinics 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.239
 the person the patient receives evaluation 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:55.050
 and then go to the street or in case 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.870
 office by office is to do aa 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.050
 negotiations in some cases in the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.780
 own chair happens in the negotiation and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.439
 when the treatment is a little bigger 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.549
 value is higher and more costly 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.460
 If a problem arises, most of the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.210
 professionals are afraid to pass the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.299
 value feel confident that they 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.180
 suddenly is not worth that and there is the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.880
 first problem to install that this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.880
 insecurity is this fear, right? 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.270
 Good, and what happens? Let's not assume 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.000
 that a dentist is negotiating with the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.340
 patient the treatment of 20 thousand reais 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.350
 how it works today 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.990
 usually the tooth will talk like air 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.560
 cable treatment and twenty thousand reais I 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.720
 I can share it for you up to 10 times 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.689
 more than that I'll need to charge one 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.899
 interest you and why that's the point 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.469
 I want to get with you today 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.899
 people will not charge this interest because it is 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.820
 It's a negotiation technique. 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.450
 do the opposite 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.660
 in reality we instead of charging 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.650
 interest above 10 times we 'll talk 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.870
 the total value of the treatment already with interest 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.569
 embedded then in this case would be 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.300
 example to Ricardo, his treatment gave 25 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.050
 thousand reais and I can divide up to 15 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.120
 times 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.030
 but if you do it up to 10 times I'll 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.459
 I give a discount notice the difference in 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.980
 Instead of taking interest we gave a 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.080
 Discount, I can give you a discount 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.129
 in up to ten times 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.569
 is this technique many professionals have 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.239
 used has given result 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:47.470
 So it's the tip I give you. 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:50.019
 today is try to make this attempt face 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.269
 test that you will probably have a 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.700
 very cool result people have 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.799
 Awe helps nobody likes to pay interest 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.440
 It's everybody knows when you 're paying. 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.549
 interest you actually pay a premium 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.160
 it is that you should not be paying 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:10.120
 then discounted in full 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.239
 world likes and is a cool tip 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.420
 because who wants to share a little bit 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.950
 more times to fit in your pocket this 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.530
 person will have the possibility of you 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.430
 is charging at the end of the day without interest 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.250
 is a higher value and you end up forcing the 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.100
 patient to close in fewer times if 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.049
 He has the condition to do that. 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.019

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:31.260
