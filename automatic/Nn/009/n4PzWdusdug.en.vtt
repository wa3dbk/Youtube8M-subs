00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.809
 all welcome in this tutorial i will show 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:12.690
 how to close the loop for the armhole for knitting 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.289
 vest topics where there is not provided 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.260
 in the hands is very important that the line armhole 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.359
 was smooth and beautiful 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.720
 I know that not all it turns out 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.019
 so I was asked to write it down 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.810
 lesson and today we will see how it 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.250
 the number of loops is made which I 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.100
 I will take it away for example from 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.079
 you will have your loops 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.820
 the number of loops is important to you 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.710
 understood so in the right side we will 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.469
 make a decrease on the front side 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.460
 side and on the left we will 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.160
 diminish on the wrong side 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.430
 so to example we close the first four 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.430
 loops 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.519
 edge loop remove the following 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.600
 knitting face and pulling through 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:20.700
 we knit the second time 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:26.430
 again we stretch through the first 2 3 again 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:31.140
 stretch and fourth again stretch 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.210
 and so we closed the first four loops for 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.640
 our armhole 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.640
 continue to knit until the end of the row 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.439
 knit all the loops knit to end of row 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.159
 and on the left we will do 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.890
 subtraction already on the seamy side 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.820
 also remove the first loop next 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.590
 knit seam loop and 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:13.190
 stretch through the first time again 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:23.730
 tying loop 2 next 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:27.799
 3 and 4 again stretch and with this 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:32.220
 sides we also closed 4 loops 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.519
 knit a row to the end so here 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.950
 at the end of the row 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:42.980
 we do not knit the last two loops 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.980
 but just shoot them on the right knitting needle 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.230
 thread left before work just 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:55.200
 take off turn our knitting and 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.350
 close the following loops let's us 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.810
 need to close two more loops 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.750
 we knit the first 2 loops together 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.190
 front of the back wall of such loops 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.190
 which we shot 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:18.060
 next loop knit facial and 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:22.639
 we stretch through the first so we turn down 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.639
 two more loops further knit the series to 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.639
 the end 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:36.740
 and at the end of the row there are again two loops 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:44.210
 remove without provyazyvaya thread leave 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:47.720
 at work we turn and knit 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.750
 first two loops together purl 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.750
 loop 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:04:01.190
 we knit the next loop 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:06.170
 backlash and stretch after 1 year we 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:16.340
 closed 2 loops on this side 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:20.690
 knit the string again until the end and knit 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:23.750
 all loops together with the edge usually 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.919
 edge knit purl but I'm her 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.150
 I see the face because when 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.800
 we knit and here 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.230
 it turns out not so special as a bundle 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.450
 I personally don't like it 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:45.370
 tied up today well who used to 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.370
 and so close another loop 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.900
 that's when you close let's say 2 by 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.910
 3 eyelets 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.130
 then the last two loops you don't 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.100
 knit in the previous row 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.040
 and if you close one loop then 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.040
 then we knit the row to the end that is 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.520
 close one edge loop 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:10.060
 remove the following knit facial and 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.640
 stretching through the shot 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:20.510
 so we closed another loop on 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:26.060
 knit a series until the end of knitting together with 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:29.060
 edge and close one loop sing 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.150
 seamy side also edging 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.590
 remove the next knit purl 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:39.789
 and stretch through the unleashed row 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.789
 to end 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.730
 This is how we do it 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.460
 such here 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:06:00.570
 straight armhole line without steps 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:09.160
 here you are just how much you need 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:13.020
 Here it rovnenko she turns here 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:16.860
 so easy to just fit the armhole line 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:20.640
