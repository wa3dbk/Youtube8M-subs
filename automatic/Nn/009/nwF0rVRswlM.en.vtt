00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
open those up and it's flat so that and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.140 
open those up and it's flat so that and
it's<00:02:47.290> kind<00:02:47.380> of<00:02:47.500> high<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:48.340> that's<00:02:48.550> basically<00:02:48.970> at

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
it's kind of high so that's basically at

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.720 
it's kind of high so that's basically at
the<00:02:49.239> same<00:02:49.270> height<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.190> if<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.459> have<00:02:51.550> big

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
the same height and so if you have big

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.010 
the same height and so if you have big
hands<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.120> would<00:02:52.270> be<00:02:52.390> good<00:02:52.540> for<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.780> if<00:02:52.810> you

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
hands this would be good for you if you

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.410 
hands this would be good for you if you
have<00:02:53.110> small<00:02:53.320> hands<00:02:53.560> I'd<00:02:54.160> keep<00:02:54.489> them<00:02:54.640> down<00:02:54.820> and

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
have small hands I'd keep them down and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.520 
have small hands I'd keep them down and
the<00:02:55.690> good<00:02:55.840> thing<00:02:56.020> about<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.320> some<00:02:56.500> people

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
the good thing about it some people

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.430 
the good thing about it some people
might<00:02:56.980> not<00:02:57.010> like<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:57.700> textured<00:02:58.390> pad<00:02:58.750> so

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.259 
keyboard it's not like any other
keyboard<00:04:03.540> because<00:04:03.659> you<00:04:03.840> have<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.760> backspace

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
keyboard because you have the backspace
