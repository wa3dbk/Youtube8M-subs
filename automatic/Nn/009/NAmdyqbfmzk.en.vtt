there<00:01:57.330> we<00:01:57.509> go<00:01:57.660> okay<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.830> I've<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.070> got<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.310> go

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
there we go okay so I've just got to go

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.919 
there we go okay so I've just got to go
completely<00:01:59.640> overkill<00:02:00.210> with<00:02:00.360> it

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
completely overkill with it

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.080 
completely overkill with it
just<00:02:01.350> waste<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.800> my<00:02:01.860> ammo<00:02:02.429> on<00:02:02.610> them<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.909> I

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
just waste all my ammo on them and I

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.800 
just waste all my ammo on them and I
might<00:02:03.330> get<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.539> kill<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:05.420> guess<00:02:06.420> that's<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:06.780> way

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
might get a kill I guess that's one way

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.010 
might get a kill I guess that's one way
to<00:02:06.929> play<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:08.360> yeah<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> got<00:02:09.450> into<00:02:09.690> my<00:02:09.780> middle

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.610 
building like I wanted to
I<00:02:11.280> hope<00:02:12.150> my<00:02:12.300> teammates<00:02:12.630> also<00:02:12.900> like<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.410> hope<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
I hope my teammates also like I hope the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.430 
I hope my teammates also like I hope the
game<00:02:13.770> doesn't<00:02:14.040> end<00:02:14.130> too<00:02:14.370> fast

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
game doesn't end too fast

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.680 
game doesn't end too fast
melted<00:02:16.440> not<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> chance<00:02:17.190> not<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.239> chance<00:02:18.360> it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
melted not a chance not a chance it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.030 
melted not a chance not a chance it
could<00:02:18.720> have<00:02:18.870> killed<00:02:18.989> them<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:19.620> literally

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
could have killed them like literally

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.400 
could have killed them like literally
the<00:02:20.099> time<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.430> kill<00:02:20.550> up<00:02:20.670> my<00:02:20.790> gun<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.150> too<00:02:22.020> low<00:02:22.230> to

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
the time to kill up my gun is too low to

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.270 
the time to kill up my gun is too low to
be<00:02:22.500> able<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.709> get<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> kill<00:02:23.040> against<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.459> guy

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:36.270 

ah<00:02:33.600> nothing<00:02:34.600> nothing<00:02:35.080> this<00:02:35.530> was<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.800> pistol

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
ah nothing nothing this was the pistol

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.580 
ah nothing nothing this was the pistol
assist<00:02:36.670> challenge<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.300> could<00:02:37.569> probably<00:02:37.750> do<00:02:37.990> it

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.080 

actually<00:02:41.590> would<00:02:41.830> be<00:02:41.860> very<00:02:42.100> easy<00:02:42.310> because

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
actually would be very easy because

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.010 
actually would be very easy because
getting<00:02:43.420> assists<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.930> easy<00:02:44.800> with<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.130> pistol

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
getting assists is easy with a pistol

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.150 
getting assists is easy with a pistol
apparently<00:02:47.020> I<00:02:49.680> know<00:02:50.680> there's<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:50.920> guy<00:02:51.010> behind

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.640 
shots aren't bad I wonder if they get
much<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:35.019> multiplier<00:03:37.320> didn't<00:03:38.320> even<00:03:38.410> hit<00:03:38.530> him

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
much of a multiplier didn't even hit him

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.140 
much of a multiplier didn't even hit him

but I was off target I was a little to

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.000 
but I was off target I was a little to
the<00:03:40.239> right<00:03:40.269> of<00:03:40.480> him<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:41.470> gonna<00:03:41.560> jump<00:03:41.829> back<00:03:41.980> up

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
the right of him you gonna jump back up

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.870 
the right of him you gonna jump back up
there<00:03:42.310> now<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:44.200> made<00:03:44.380> roid<00:03:45.040> him<00:03:45.310> that's<00:03:45.640> good

oh<00:03:52.840> man<00:03:53.840> this<00:03:54.020> is<00:03:54.080> so<00:03:54.200> challenging<00:03:54.950> I

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
oh man this is so challenging I

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.490 
oh man this is so challenging I
initially<00:03:56.510> thought<00:03:56.540> 10<00:03:56.930> kills<00:03:57.200> I<00:03:57.380> was

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
initially thought 10 kills I was

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.400 
initially thought 10 kills I was
probably<00:03:57.740> going<00:03:58.070> way<00:03:58.280> too<00:03:58.340> easy<00:03:58.730> on<00:03:58.850> myself

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
probably going way too easy on myself

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.140 
probably going way too easy on myself
for<00:04:00.410> going<00:04:00.620> for<00:04:00.800> 10<00:04:00.950> kills<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.430> not<00:04:01.550> like<00:04:01.730> 20

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
for going for 10 kills and not like 20

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.960 
for going for 10 kills and not like 20
or<00:04:02.330> 15<00:04:02.690> oh<00:04:02.870> there's<00:04:03.080> another<00:04:03.170> one<00:04:03.410> but<00:04:04.370> this<00:04:04.790> is

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
or 15 oh there's another one but this is

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.730 
or 15 oh there's another one but this is
actually<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.480> bit<00:04:05.750> of<00:04:05.780> a<00:04:05.900> challenge<00:04:06.080> to<00:04:06.320> get<00:04:06.500> 10

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
actually a bit of a challenge to get 10

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.290 
actually a bit of a challenge to get 10
kills<00:04:06.770> in<00:04:07.190> team<00:04:07.370> deathmatch<00:04:07.610> especially<00:04:08.210> when
