00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
well it's legible it's a little bit more

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.950 
well it's legible it's a little bit more
of<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.250> retro<00:01:47.430> look<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.540> wrist

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
of a retro look on the wrist

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.260 
of a retro look on the wrist
I<00:01:49.020> find<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.680> constellation<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.759> pretty

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
I find the constellation to be pretty

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.630 
I find the constellation to be pretty
comfortable<00:01:51.689> again<00:01:52.020> sized<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:53.130> me<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.549> my

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
comfortable again sized for me and my

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.069 
comfortable again sized for me and my
personal<00:01:54.119> taste<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.570> bit<00:01:54.780> smaller

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
personal taste is a little bit smaller

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.770 
personal taste is a little bit smaller
at<00:01:55.829> 38<00:01:56.250> millimeters<00:01:56.670> wide<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> would<00:01:57.210> prefer<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
at 38 millimeters wide I would prefer a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.319 
at 38 millimeters wide I would prefer a
40<00:01:58.409> or<00:01:58.530> 42<00:01:58.860> millimeters<00:01:59.430> wide<00:01:59.579> given<00:02:00.270> this

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
40 or 42 millimeters wide given this

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.969 
40 or 42 millimeters wide given this
case<00:02:00.570> shape<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.770> gonna<00:02:01.890> be

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
case shape but I think this is gonna be

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.920 
case shape but I think this is gonna be
a<00:02:02.009> good<00:02:02.130> size<00:02:02.369> for<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.149> lot<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.360> people<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
a good size for a lot of people and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.450 
a good size for a lot of people and
again<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> steel<00:02:04.860> version<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.310> like

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
again this is a steel version I like

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.580 
again this is a steel version I like
that<00:02:05.579> little<00:02:05.670> gold<00:02:06.119> Omega<00:02:06.390> logo<00:02:07.229> there<00:02:07.350> again

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that little gold Omega logo there again

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.699 
that little gold Omega logo there again
this<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.829> very<00:02:08.009> retro<00:02:09.229> but<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.289> think<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.560> done

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
this is very retro but I think it's done

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.020 
this is very retro but I think it's done
kind<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.610> cool<00:02:11.819> way

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
kind of in a cool way

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.640 
kind of in a cool way
I<00:02:12.270> like<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.750> Arabic<00:02:13.110> numerals<00:02:13.500> or

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
I like this Arabic numerals or

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.869 
I like this Arabic numerals or
on<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.829> bezel<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.400> sort<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.579> a<00:02:14.670> neat

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
on the bezel it's just sort of a neat

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.170 
on the bezel it's just sort of a neat
watch<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.230> know<00:02:16.379> is<00:02:16.620> still<00:02:17.370> very

because<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.650> depleting<00:02:50.310> amounts<00:02:50.609> of

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
because of the depleting amounts of

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.970 
because of the depleting amounts of
copper<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:51.930> believe<00:02:52.379> or<00:02:52.590> something<00:02:52.829> like<00:02:52.920> that

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
copper I believe or something like that

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.300 
copper I believe or something like that
as<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.970> rubs<00:02:54.180> away<00:02:54.470> changes<00:02:55.470> color<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.129> that's

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
as it rubs away changes color and that's

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.910 
as it rubs away changes color and that's
not<00:02:57.060> good<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.720> if<00:02:58.109> you<00:02:58.230> want<00:02:58.409> a<00:02:58.470> rose<00:02:58.650> gol<00:02:58.889> that

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
there's a significantly different look

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.910 
there's a significantly different look
even<00:03:11.579> though<00:03:11.670> they're<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.909> same<00:03:12.090> size<00:03:12.920> again

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
rose gold or Sedna gold it's going to be

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.220 
rose gold or Sedna gold it's going to be
significantly<00:03:17.910> more<00:03:18.480> expensive<00:03:18.569> but<00:03:19.079> there

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
significantly more expensive but there

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.990 
significantly more expensive but there
is<00:03:19.319> sort<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.650> more<00:03:20.060> classy<00:03:21.230> formal<00:03:22.230> dressy
