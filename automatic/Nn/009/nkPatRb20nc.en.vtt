 fifth march and it's over all I insist the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.230
 public applauding 300 meters from the 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.220
 goal that is only within reach of 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.720
 champions iluso canarias is an authentic 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.390
 out of series 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.180
 what a way to gallop what way to 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.209
 win what way to show off gentlemen 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.970
 this is a champion born and raised in 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.549
 Spain a colt that cost eleven thousand euros 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.610
 a four for which a 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.280
 million and a half euros its owners 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.340
 they rejected it because they want 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.670
 dream and because they want to make history 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.950
 to try the next appointment the 2000 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.860
 guineas in newmarket in britain 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.379
 early May there are reasons to dream 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.530
 gentlemen light or canary has us 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.230
 demonstrated today by demonstrating that it is a 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.690
 horse as we have seen very little if 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.799
 is that we have seen one similar to him 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.140
 here in Spain repeat look who 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.209
 way to leave without his rider 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.580
 have to use in no time 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.430
 simply accompanying him with his hands 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.170
 Álvaro Gómez pulling a whip and every 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.720
 seeing him farther 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.940
 arkaitz who today loses his unbeaten 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.340
 it's over at the end there we see it at 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.599
 add to be second but notice the 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.870
 sidereal distance between Canarian knot and 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.569
 the rest a sidereal distance that we 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.390
 suggests that this is a horse that 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.390
 is going to have serious options of truth 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.120
 fight big prizes in europe here has 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.730

 come here a British television 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.609
 They have come here to see another Spanish 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.800
 of these who did not expect much from him 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.310
 and that certainly is surprising 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.370
 Europe 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.740

 simply moving the horse to 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.979
 put it to point because it was about that 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.050
 the horse will be used because 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.570
 commitments that await you now are going to 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.850
 be commitments of a huge entity it 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.310
 I tried to get the horse to run 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.690
 will employ up to the goal it was not about 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.880
 that it was an easy race and that's why 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.770
 José Luís has continued to insist 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.840
 the end without touching him with the whip for 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.580
 course but has continued to arm 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.889
 the same goal was about a career 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.590
 preparatory it was that the 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.600
 horse was getting ready for the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.510
