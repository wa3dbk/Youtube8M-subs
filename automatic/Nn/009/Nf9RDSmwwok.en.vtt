been<00:00:20.939> discounted<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:22.380> before<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.980> let

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
been discounted but before I do that let

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.160 
been discounted but before I do that let
me<00:00:23.850> walk<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.150> through<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> whole<00:00:24.570> vehicle<00:00:25.019> so

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
you actually can see it and think is it

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.870 
you actually can see it and think is it
worth<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.720> price<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.529> think<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.519> but<00:00:29.699> let's

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
worth the price I think it is but let's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.089 
worth the price I think it is but let's
do<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.240> first<00:00:31.230> off<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.650> want<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> show<00:00:32.070> that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
this is a very high very heavy duty type

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.299 
this is a very high very heavy duty type
of<00:00:35.730> vehicle<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.450> actually<00:00:36.750> control<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.590> lot<00:00:38.010> I

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
of vehicle and actually control a lot I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
of vehicle and actually control a lot I
think<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.850> actually<00:00:39.210> tell<00:00:39.420> ya<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.989> think

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.560 
has beige and black interior wit and
it's<00:00:48.840> cloth<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.559> -<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:50.160> not<00:00:50.340> leather<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.480> you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
it's cloth in - it's not leather so you

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.819 
it's cloth in - it's not leather so you
don't<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.899> worry<00:00:52.079> about<00:00:52.199> getting<00:00:52.440> burned

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
don't have to worry about getting burned

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.979

in<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> heat<00:00:53.399> some<00:00:54.270> people<00:00:54.600> prefer<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
in the heat some people prefer the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.430 
in the heat some people prefer the
leather<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.739> think<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> clock<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.670> much<00:00:56.879> easier

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
leather I think the clock is much easier

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.740 
leather I think the clock is much easier
