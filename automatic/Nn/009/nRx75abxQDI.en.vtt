00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.900
 great news for you 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.299
 in the future, the technical will be shot 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.160
 on this sting 1975 published and 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.920
 Now it's off to the first one 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.070
 follow this on sting 1970 thus remains 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.070
 tuned 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.899
 yes totally in the name of the iphone 5 what me 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.940
 of course immediately at 14 have presented 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.100
 and a week later, too 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.469
 was delivered by post very nice and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.320
 very nice as seen here can it 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.559
 from the design just super sexy all around 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.649
 a black metallic frame so 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.550
 frame also the front is in 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.680
 kept black 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.190
 the back like one in the beloved one 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.199
 could already see photos discreetly 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.239
 divided metallic and glass raised and 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.090
 and interrisk to plastic that is glass 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.500
 I have already been asked and completely 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.540
 Of course new at the connection and 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:18.900
 the connector for the lightning cable 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.930
 and front side new camera back 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.840
 also new camera new flashlight that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.450
 are basically the whole 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.549
 Specification I have the version in 32 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.939
 gigabyte, there is one more 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.610
 level less than 16 and one level higher 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.220
 of course you can pay the prices with 64 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.560
 as always on the apple point de 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.470
 homepage erlin after just one week 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.329
 or half a week rather use 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.210
 I have to say I am very much of this 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.360
 Product convinced the display is great 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.899
 ingeniously very nice to look at and also from 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.170
 the haptic 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.090
 it feels so good not only that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.670
 it has become thinner too 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.710
 just as brilliant as me in one 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.829
 already mentioned earlier video 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.270
 on the subject of reception one has of course as 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.910
 for example telekom customer the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.190
 possibility to use lte there i have 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.080
 made under normal speed test 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.480
 the measurement did not reach that point 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.180
 to measure this high speed 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.930
 but of course both mean 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:26.160
 screenshot of the whole so great 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.440
 almost when you're in the lte mode, of course 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.240
 also the option to turn it off as well 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.610
 like 3g you could be yourself 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.430
 of course, reducing it does not do much 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.700
 I also have fun for one 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.470
 speedtest made on the way in advance 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.440
 So before delivery was natural 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.660
 much to hear that the displays 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.370
 and the backs one or the other 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.320
 call that it can have hit so 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.030
 for example, it was reported that 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.850
 the back already scratch and also on 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.080
 Frames could be there at delivery 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.590
 of course I already had a bit 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.200
 jitters and trembling 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.300
 The package had to make me happy 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.950
 appreciate and say hey displays in 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.240
 Order also no scratches or 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.700
 similar so therefore top if one 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.420
 now such a broken device 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.070
 Apple has exchanged that 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.900
 Of course, without dumb and one 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.959
 last point I want to refer 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.340
 on the weight of the iphone 5 persons 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.360
 we already have from face to face 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.800
 In the face, that's far too easy 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.989
 I personally see something different 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.810
 I think the weight is optimal 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.700
 nice and light and easy 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.400
 therefore also good to act 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.370
 briefly on the theme of music and volume 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.080
 with my headphones the Bavarian dynamics 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.550
 770 per that we also in the studio 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.430
 I have to use my channel 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.570
 sting 19 75 also done a review 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.940
 You can do that again 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.720
 I have to say I am loud 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.030
 great and last but not least if you are 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.920
 now from music so a whole song 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.560
 that's what it's all about 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.510
 under ios 6 possible yes that were too 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.370
 already the first impressions I give you 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.989
 communicate and wanted to report 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.900
 thank you as always for that 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.739
 turn on for subscribing and for 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.500
 Leave a Comment 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.330

 comments, of course, all others 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.049
 I would like to answer you 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.910
 We would like to see each other in any case 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.870

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.139
