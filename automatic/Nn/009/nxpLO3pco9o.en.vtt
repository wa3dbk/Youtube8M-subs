00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:09.790
 Hi. I 'm supposed to upload a terÃ¶rter video in a long time . 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:11.889
 I'm the deities processor bus phlegm nirang confrontation has yobeon changing the system in three wrath 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.820
 I'll try it. 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:20.409
 Again temyeon in wearing a similarly aligned so you can go frontier 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.899
 I think it's better to go, but because the physical map itself is too low, 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:28.179
 So, I saw it I thought the preparation will be similar 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:31.479
 If you go to the upward ditch the ultimate Faustian bus from the new areas which 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:36.090
 Let's see if there's a difference. 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:36.090
 Please scan the house and you will not be blessed. 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:45.420
 At the same time I started a movement speed 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.840
 Faust would like faster hunting itself will get faster e garen 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.840
 It's the same. 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.590
 If the passive is turned on, the speed of movement seems to be similar. 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:01.920
 Because Garen is so good, the speed at which he can handle it is definitely more 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.920
 I think it's fast. 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:16.920
 In the case of Faust, it is a little distant , 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.910
 And I think it is better than the one ram as fast moving speed 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.910
 I'll keep looking. 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.079
 Karin is jjokkom itguyo become one proceeds to the previous situation 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.980
 Garren got his first appearance. 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:42.100
 Faust removes these summons in the background. 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.100
 You, LAN, first went to the Dura 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.880
 Faust is here to catch me. 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:58.119
 Like that because it was the first re-laid turtle Jan plurality of second regions 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:02.729
 LAN is back and back again. 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.729
 So, yeah, Faust is continuing at a slightly depressed 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:20.450
 It seems that the speed of movement is getting slightly different due to some difference. 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.450
 But Garren removed all of his first conquest first 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.530
 Faust followed suit , and now the phallus continues to follow. 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.730
 I have. 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.940
 The difference in speed of movement is a little bit small, 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.940
 Equal 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:48.230
 Here is itguyo continue to do so gradually narrow differences 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:52.690
 This seems to be little or passed 5 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.690
 I will 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:01.970
 Now that the difference has narrowed a lot , 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.970
 I'll go ahead and keep an eye on it. 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:12.490
 There is still ahead of you to go even physical Faust has written before itguyo 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.570
 I have a situation where I keep going back and forth in the first place. 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:22.060
 In a fast rate hikes ahead dwaeseo Zen rate me out this situation 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:24.520
 It is going to be the same even if the comparison can not go back because the character is so basic hunting 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.300
 Because the speed is so low 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.300
 Even if I go back, I guess I'll do another hunting for Jorrons. 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.420
 Oh, now that I saw it, Faust was a little ahead of me. 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.610
 The rate of return is now faster than the powder. 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:04:00.270
 Oh, now Garen is back a little late, and there's a difference here. 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:04.310
 Faust arrived first and arrived at the area. 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:08.870
 I'm fighting the tree first . 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:13.550
 So quickly, Faust first took over. 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.130
 It was a Lando Passive that melted the repair more quickly, but the body itself 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:21.709
 Faust won this. 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:25.460
 In terms of physical strength, as you can see many times, 0 12 and 11 12 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:30.320
 If you do not like these three maps, you're pretty nervous. 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:34.610
 Faust case is almost 99% reliable sputum to reform success 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:39.200
 When Nina is going to come a little dangerous at that case is that Faust 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.450
 Once in stability, it certainly seems to be dominant, 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.830
 Because there is a case 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:48.070
 I think buses will always be the Faust . 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.070
 I'll do it
