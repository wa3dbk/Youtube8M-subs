to do was take that and say how would
you<00:00:18.330> approach<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.900> if<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.289> were<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
you approach this if you were a

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.740 
you approach this if you were a
triathlete<00:00:20.130> or<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.910> were<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> runner<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.630> if

you played a specific sport you trained

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.700 
you played a specific sport you trained
for<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:23.970> event<00:00:24.330> an<00:00:24.570> obstacle<00:00:25.109> race<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.560> no

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
for that event an obstacle race is no

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.439 
for that event an obstacle race is no
different<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.640> you're<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.180> training

different so you're going to be training

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.029 
different so you're going to be training
your<00:00:27.750> run<00:00:27.960> base<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.349> build<00:00:28.529> your<00:00:28.680> target

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
your run base to build your target

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.169 
your run base to build your target
you're<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.550> training<00:00:29.880> your

you're going to be training your
strength<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.689> build<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.050> strength<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.890> body

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
strength to build that strength to body

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.979 
strength to build that strength to body
weight<00:00:32.219> ratio<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.300> you're<00:00:33.450> also<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> be

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
weight ratio but you're also going to be

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.780 
weight ratio but you're also going to be
combining<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.620> two<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> hybrid<00:00:35.460> type

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
combining the two into a hybrid type

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.940 
combining the two into a hybrid type
training<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.870> cover<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.380> you're<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:37.920> to

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
training we cover that you're going to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.310 
training we cover that you're going to
in<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> progressive<00:00:38.850> period<00:00:39.120> start<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
in a progressive period start with a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.590 
in a progressive period start with a
baseline<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.250> cardio<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.940> strength<00:00:42.239> you're

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
baseline of cardio and strength you're

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
baseline of cardio and strength you're
going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> build<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.170> body<00:00:43.410> weight

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
going to build your body weight

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.110 
going to build your body weight
exercises<00:00:44.280> you're<00:00:44.399> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.579> build<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
exercises you're going to build a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.660 
exercises you're going to build a
general<00:00:45.870> run<00:00:46.170> distance<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.890> then<00:00:47.129> from<00:00:47.489> there

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
general run distance and then from there

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.740 
general run distance and then from there
we're<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> take<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.390> make<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.539> more

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
we're going to take it and make it more

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.110 
we're going to take it and make it more
complicated<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.100> strength<00:00:50.489> and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
complicated for the strength and

comes<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.060> preparing<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.479> your<00:01:12.720> race<00:01:13.020> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
comes to preparing for your race you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.469 
comes to preparing for your race you
need<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.860> think<00:01:14.159> train<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> specific<00:01:15.150> skills

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
need to think train the specific skills

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.700 
need to think train the specific skills
that<00:01:15.600> you're<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.930> encounter<00:01:16.229> along<00:01:16.500> the

maybe up and over a wall you need to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.510 
maybe up and over a wall you need to
prepare<00:01:21.960> yourself<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:22.770> grip<00:01:23.130> strength
