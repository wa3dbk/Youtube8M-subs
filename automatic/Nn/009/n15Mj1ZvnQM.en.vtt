00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
on a regular basis so they are still

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.740 
on a regular basis so they are still
updating<00:01:20.090> this<00:01:20.210> game<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.479> they're<00:01:20.570> actually

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
updating this game and they're actually

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.840

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
in the process of releasing a second one

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.400 
in the process of releasing a second one
because<00:01:23.420> this<00:01:23.600> one<00:01:23.990> was<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:24.560> successful

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.720 

so<00:01:29.410> let's<00:01:29.590> go<00:01:29.710> ahead<00:01:29.830> and<00:01:30.010> start<00:01:30.640> with
