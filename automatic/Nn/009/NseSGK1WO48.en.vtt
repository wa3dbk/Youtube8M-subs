00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.090 
and I thought about this on the drive
back<00:00:39.809> home<00:00:39.989> from<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> college<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:40.860> going

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:11.159 
want to give them a free chance to

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:13.040 
want to give them a free chance to
switch<00:06:11.340> out<00:06:11.520> because<00:06:11.759> Kadabra<00:06:12.300> could<00:06:12.810> still

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
switch out because Kadabra could still

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.480

be<00:06:13.199> a<00:06:13.229> massive<00:06:13.740> there<00:06:13.889> because<00:06:14.159> it<00:06:14.310> is<00:06:14.400> very

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
be a massive there because it is very

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.790 
be a massive there because it is very
very<00:06:14.789> fast<00:06:15.210> so<00:06:15.780> I<00:06:15.810> pursued<00:06:16.199> trap<00:06:16.440> him<00:06:16.590> as<00:06:16.680> he

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
very fast so I pursued trap him as he

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.980 
very fast so I pursued trap him as he
