00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.019
 benefit and will show eliza 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.120
 as part of a basic outline for the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.699
 day to day and arrive in a dramatic look 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.619
 to you bulldoze night I'll use 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.050
 and the draft beer that the new pen 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.539
 delineadora benefit she has one little tip 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.279
 which greatly facilitates the application and gives 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.859
 get close to the root of the eyelashes 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.619
 what facebook need only want 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.920
 very fine line of the day to 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.920
 day 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.380
 now I'll thicken a little more 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.010
 this line to look is more 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.010
 striking 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.170
 I use the tip of it turned inside. 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.140
 to make the inner corner of the eye and 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.690
 when the external crunching advance will 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.690
 pen and points them out 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.240
 now I'm going to make the famous eyeliner 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.330
 kitten using the technique I already 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.700
 I taught in the other video I support the tip 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.090
 pen in the outer corner of the eye or 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.180
 until you find the tip of the nose and 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.490
 I make my mark 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.580
 I do this from both sides to 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.580
 to ensure the asymmetry of the kitten 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.120
 Now to finish I'll do a look. 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.290
 to open the look outline to the 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.610
 lower eyelashes 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.410
 It is important that the tip of the pen 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.700
 Hugs the root of the lashes to look good 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.440
 beautiful and not have to go all the way to 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.650
 finishing is important as well. 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.580
 joining the upper stroke with the stroke 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.580
 bottom 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.730

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.730

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.400
