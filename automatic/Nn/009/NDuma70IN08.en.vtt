here<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:02.340> another<00:00:02.820> obvious<00:00:03.890> lymphoid<00:00:04.890> tissue

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
here is another obvious lymphoid tissue

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.299 
here is another obvious lymphoid tissue
or<00:00:05.790> perhaps<00:00:06.029> lymphoid<00:00:06.660> organ<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:08.040> you

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
or perhaps lymphoid organ in that you

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.580 
or perhaps lymphoid organ in that you
can<00:00:08.519> see<00:00:08.790> like<00:00:09.269> in<00:00:09.420> practically<00:00:09.929> all<00:00:09.960> lymphoid

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
can see like in practically all lymphoid

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.999 
can see like in practically all lymphoid
organs<00:00:11.450> follicles<00:00:12.450> are<00:00:12.719> secondary<00:00:13.290> follicles

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
organs follicles are secondary follicles

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.260 
organs follicles are secondary follicles
in<00:00:14.250> which<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.610> have<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.299> clearer<00:00:16.170> or<00:00:16.379> lighter

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
in which you have the clearer or lighter

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.400 
in which you have the clearer or lighter
lymphocytes<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.690> inside<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
lymphocytes and the inside of the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.320 
lymphocytes and the inside of the
follicle<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.250> germinal<00:00:20.699> center<00:00:21.119> and

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
follicle are the germinal center and

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.259 
follicle are the germinal center and
then<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.020> darker<00:00:22.590> blue<00:00:22.920> ER<00:00:23.100> or<00:00:23.430> less

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
cytoplasm

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.710 
cytoplasm
cells<00:00:25.980> towards<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> periphery<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
cells towards the periphery of the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.700 
cells towards the periphery of the
follicle<00:00:29.090> so<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.630> know<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.470> some

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
follicle so we know that this is some

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.430 
follicle so we know that this is some
type<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:31.980> lymphoid<00:00:32.610> tissue<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.870> know<00:00:34.140> that

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
type of lymphoid tissue we know that

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.010 
type of lymphoid tissue we know that
it's<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.160> lymph<00:00:35.790> node<00:00:35.880> because<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.780> don't

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
it's not a lymph node because you don't

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.700 
it's not a lymph node because you don't
have<00:00:37.230> organization<00:00:38.219> into<00:00:38.640> capsules<00:00:39.710> and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
have organization into capsules and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.000 
have organization into capsules and
medullary<00:00:41.489> areas<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.170> suspect<00:00:43.800> it's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
medullary areas so we suspect it's

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.250 
medullary areas so we suspect it's
probably<00:00:44.370> some<00:00:44.670> sort<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:45.210> mucosal<00:00:45.930> associated

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
probably some sort of mucosal associated

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.250 
probably some sort of mucosal associated
lymphoid<00:00:46.710> tissue<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:48.059> indeed<00:00:48.539> you

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
lymphoid tissue and because indeed you

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.680 
lymphoid tissue and because indeed you
have<00:00:49.289> some<00:00:49.920> glands<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.120> which<00:00:51.420> look

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
have some glands here which look

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.240 
have some glands here which look
mucinous<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.980> typical<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:55.379> oral<00:00:56.039> cavity

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
mucinous so typical of the oral cavity

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.700 
mucinous so typical of the oral cavity
or<00:00:56.699> upper<00:00:57.090> respiratory<00:00:57.300> tract<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.230> suspect

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
or upper respiratory tract we suspect

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.099 
or upper respiratory tract we suspect
these<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:59.070> tonsils<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.300> know<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.899> they

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
these are tonsils and we know that they

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.920 
these are tonsils and we know that they
are<00:01:01.140> not<00:01:01.260> Palatine<00:01:02.010> tonsils<00:01:02.420> because<00:01:03.420> they

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
are not Palatine tonsils because they

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.399 
are not Palatine tonsils because they
don't<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.400> squamous<00:01:05.400> lined<00:01:05.790> crypts<00:01:06.409> but

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
don't have squamous lined crypts but

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.219 
don't have squamous lined crypts but
what<00:01:08.040> they<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.659> were<00:01:09.869> paying

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
what they do have if you were paying

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.609 
what they do have if you were paying
attention<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:11.240> if<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.390> am<00:01:12.570> paying<00:01:12.869> attention<00:01:13.439> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
attention or if I am paying attention is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.859 
attention or if I am paying attention is
at<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> periphery<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.619> some<00:01:17.009> type<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
at the periphery we do have some type of

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.950 
at the periphery we do have some type of
mucosa<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.610> really<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.119> squamous<00:01:21.750> its

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
mucosa and it is really not squamous its

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.830 
mucosa and it is really not squamous its
columnar<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.939> know<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.119> these<00:01:24.540> tonsils

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
columnar so we know that these tonsils

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.030 
columnar so we know that these tonsils
are<00:01:25.380> something<00:01:26.070> other<00:01:26.340> than<00:01:28.040> Palatine

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
are something other than Palatine

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.100 
are something other than Palatine
tonsils<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:30.259> because<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.680> normal<00:01:32.720> mucosa<00:01:33.720> of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
tonsils and because the normal mucosa of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.609 
tonsils and because the normal mucosa of
the<00:01:34.549> nasal<00:01:35.549> pharynx<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.619> ciliated

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the nasal pharynx is a ciliated

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.850 
the nasal pharynx is a ciliated
pseudostratified<00:01:38.689> columnar<00:01:39.860> epithelium

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
pseudostratified columnar epithelium

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.569 
pseudostratified columnar epithelium
like<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.369> see<00:01:41.640> here<00:01:41.670> which<00:01:42.630> slightly<00:01:43.579> enters

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
like we see here which slightly enters

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.639 
like we see here which slightly enters
into<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.149> lymphoid<00:01:45.570> area<00:01:46.049> as<00:01:46.140> well<00:01:46.350> to

this is a fur in geol cancel' found in
