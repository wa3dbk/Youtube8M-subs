00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.620
 Greetings to all the friends of the cases 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.929
 always wind samsung this time we are 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.900
 with tablets 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.609
 the 3 series we start with the device 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.529
 which seemed to us the most 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.980
 interesting or the samsung galaxy 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.199
 tab 3 8 inches is a device indeed 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.330
 as the 8-inch name suggests 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.090
 with a resolution of hd therefore 1200 80 x 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.940
 800 pixels peculiarities of the whole 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.190
 new family of tablets that the buttons 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.200
 they are no longer on the screen 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.480
 but I'm a bit off like it happens on 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.030
 on smartphones to have half solutions 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.370
 taxes and back button 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.399
 let's see the version of the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.340
 operating system here we are on 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.510
 4.2.2 distribution of android is the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.489
 kernel version is 3.0 point 31 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.700
 so this makes us think that 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.059
 the hardware is 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.920
 of the past generation or at least ex 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.110
 our view the kernel version 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.200
 the processor is a dual core processor 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:17.170
 from 1.5 ghz ram memory and from 1.5 e 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.579
 we also have 16GB of internal memory 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.600
 expandable up to 64 gb with micro with 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.640
 micro sd 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.460
 the 8 inch model and what 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.250
 we have seen a inherit more functionality 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.500
 from samsung galaxy s against for example 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.200
 even if we go to the settings menu 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.030
 as you can see we really have many 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.979
 settings such as even the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.710
 stand 20 points and people mode 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.530
 multi screen the myth ring and we have 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.170
 also the opportunity to activate 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.110
 disable intelligent peace then 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.510
 we can go to 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.910
 so if we see a video if not 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.130
 let's look at the front-facing video camera 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.110
 marra video has automatically stopped 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.430
 same thing then for the teeth stand of 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.440
 people were telling us here at the booth if that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.660
 we buy one of a product of 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:12.270
 Family tab 3 we will have up to 31 to 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.380
 January 31, 2014 we will have for a year 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.270
 the opportunity to be able to use 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.880
 the application of the evening courier 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.770
 sports gazette while for six months 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.940
 we will have the opportunity to use 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.400
 skype is the application to read the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.900
 these comics of online mouse that that 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.820
 see on the home are all 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.500
 applications that we will find preinstalled 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.320
 as you can see we have an eye that 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.750
 also wrings to users on 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.270
 youthful then to children with 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.470
 applications such as the pimpa and those of 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.180
 Geronimo Stilton 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.570
 but let's go see some 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.030
 tablet functionality 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.380
 we are always loading de casilla 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.380
 the condition helps us 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.180
 let's give the desktop version 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.250
 as you can see the speed is enough 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.770
 good fluidity also does not seem to us 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.630
 then bad pinch to zoom, and enough 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.670
 fluid and follows us 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.890
 well we are going to load too 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.180
 an article just to realize 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.910
 of the fluidity that as you see not 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.950
 we have dual screen problems 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.620
 so we have the opportunity to open 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.110
 another application we can go to 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.819
 adjust it on the screen and then 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.939
 we can run two applications in 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:30.690
 at the same time we can also 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:32.940
 also going to rotate them 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.540
 exchange then peel between the two 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.340
 between the two applications 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.370
 here too we have the opportunity to 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.330
 use watson then also here on the 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.990
 top side we have the 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.330
 no here we have the plug to be able to 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.650
 to control our TV and 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.420
 so there's a moment from samsung and then 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.320
 be able to use the samsung here too 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.760
 galaxy tab 3 8-inch as a 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.980
 advanced remote control as we can 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.990
 also go to memorize ours 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.050
 events of our film episodes 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:14.250
 favorites as you can see there are already 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.700
 indeed several presets 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.959
 let's go out the rear camera from 5 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.609
 megapixel 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.340
 let's see the software of the 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.720
 camera that in the past is not there 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.460
 liked how much here is taken up 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.650
 from the family 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.539
 smartphone so advanced software 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.850
 which still allows us to have 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.360
 several settings as you see 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.300
 we also have the presence of 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.039
 no autofocus the led flash i 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.039
 videos are recorded by 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.629
 maximum resolution of 1080p a 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.110
 device that you really see 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:53.509
 very thin but above all very much 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.830
 very very light we are talking about 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:59.920
 314 grams and the dimensions are 200 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.670
 9.8 percent 23 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.680
 mm the thickness 7.4 so really a lot 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:10.070
 very small will arrive 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.229
 soon at a price of 329 euros in the 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.810
 wifi version only for 3g version 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.150
 we will have to wait a little longer than with a 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.009
 price of about 50 euros more for you 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.009
 casino is all a salute from savior
