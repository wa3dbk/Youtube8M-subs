00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
can see some ventilation right here at

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.830 
can see some ventilation right here at
the<00:00:35.190> forefoot<00:00:35.610> because<00:00:36.030> everywhere<00:00:36.630> else

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the forefoot because everywhere else

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.510 
the forefoot because everywhere else
there<00:00:37.110> pretty<00:00:37.320> much<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.739> none<00:00:37.980> Chung<00:00:38.370> is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
there pretty much is none Chung is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.209 
there pretty much is none Chung is
perforated<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.690> anything

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
perforated but it's not anything

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.650 
perforated but it's not anything
anything<00:00:41.219> special<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.910> think<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> back

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
anything special I think that the back

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.920 
anything special I think that the back
system<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.469> very<00:00:43.770> interesting<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.480> some

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
system is very interesting it's for some

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.630 
system is very interesting it's for some
lockdown<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.620> Achilles<00:00:47.039> area<00:00:47.399> when<00:00:47.550> you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
lockdown in the Achilles area when you

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.540 
lockdown in the Achilles area when you
lace<00:00:47.820> them<00:00:48.030> up<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.390> pulls<00:00:48.899> these<00:00:49.550> little

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
lace them up it pulls these little

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.400 
lace them up it pulls these little
things<00:00:50.789> snug<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.390> keep<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:51.719> your<00:00:52.050> ankle

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
things snug to keep your your ankle

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.750 
things snug to keep your your ankle
secured<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.920> there<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.280> not<00:00:53.430> really

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
secured in there it's not really

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.610 
secured in there it's not really
anything<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.270> needs<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:55.020> there<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> just

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
anything that needs to be there I just

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.869 
anything that needs to be there I just
think<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:55.890> interesting<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.610> could<00:00:56.760> see

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
think it's interesting and you could see

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.639 
think it's interesting and you could see
its<00:00:57.000> branding<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:57.960> well<00:00:58.170> sort<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
its branding right here as well sort of

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.139 
its branding right here as well sort of
materials<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.340> think<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> material<00:01:00.120> that

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
materials I think that the material that

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.400 
materials I think that the material that
they<00:01:00.270> use<00:01:00.300> are<00:01:00.539> really<00:01:00.660> nice<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.050> don't<00:01:01.199> know<00:01:01.289> if

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
they use are really nice I don't know if

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.139 
they use are really nice I don't know if
they're<00:01:01.579> synthetics<00:01:02.579> or<00:01:02.699> not<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.120> just

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
they're synthetics or not and just

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.910 
they're synthetics or not and just
because<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:04.140> rolled<00:01:04.500> all<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
because they they rolled all of the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.830 
because they they rolled all of the
edges<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.939> can't<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.540> if

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
edges up here so you can't see if

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.300 
edges up here so you can't see if
there's<00:01:07.110> any<00:01:07.290> grain<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.100> leads

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
there's any grain in there which leads

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.800 
there's any grain in there which leads
me<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.549> believe<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.479> all<00:01:09.570> synthetic

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
me to believe that it's all synthetic

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.200 
me to believe that it's all synthetic
they<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.409> fit<00:01:10.619> true<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.830> size<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.400> as<00:01:11.880> far<00:01:12.119> as

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
they do fit true to size and as far as

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.969 
they do fit true to size and as far as
their<00:01:12.330> tech<00:01:12.600> specs<00:01:12.869> are<00:01:13.020> concerned<00:01:13.380> basically

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
their tech specs are concerned basically

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.219 
their tech specs are concerned basically
you<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.729> cage<00:01:15.030> heel<00:01:15.659> zoom<00:01:15.930> unit

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you just have this cage heel zoom unit

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.200 
you just have this cage heel zoom unit
this<00:01:16.350> thing<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.770> massive<00:01:17.400> dude<00:01:17.820> look<00:01:18.060> at<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
this thing is massive dude look at that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.080 
this thing is massive dude look at that
it<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.110> beautiful<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.220> love<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.640> kind<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.970> zoom

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
it is beautiful I love that kind of zoom

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.640 
it is beautiful I love that kind of zoom
you<00:01:21.210> could<00:01:21.360> see<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> fibers<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.110> there<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
you could see the fibers in there the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.770 
you could see the fibers in there the
only<00:01:22.860> downside<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.000> caged<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.600> all

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
only downside is that it is caged so all

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.120 
only downside is that it is caged so all
of<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.020> stuff<00:01:25.229> there's<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> really<00:01:25.950> hard

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
