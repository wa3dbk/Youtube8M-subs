00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that i found and basically these have

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.700 
that i found and basically these have
the<00:01:42.570> possibilities<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.560> being<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.810> candy

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the possibilities of being the candy

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.359 
the possibilities of being the candy
saga<00:01:47.250> blocks<00:01:48.290> however<00:01:49.290> none<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.189> these

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
saga blocks however none of these

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.330 
saga blocks however none of these
pictures<00:01:50.820> are<00:01:51.000> confirmed<00:01:51.509> these<00:01:51.930> are<00:01:52.340> still

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
pictures are confirmed these are still

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.399 
pictures are confirmed these are still
being<00:01:54.060> tested<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.750> seeing<00:01:55.140> what<00:01:56.100> type<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.460> of

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
being tested out seeing what type of of

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.830 
being tested out seeing what type of of
textures<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.009> people<00:01:59.189> were<00:01:59.399> using

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
textures that the people were using

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.350 
textures that the people were using
however<00:02:00.840> i<00:02:01.290> still<00:02:01.500> think<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.030> candy

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
however i still think that the candy

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.080 
however i still think that the candy
saga<00:02:03.570> texture<00:02:03.960> pack<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.579> going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.759> kind<00:02:06.030> of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
saga texture pack is going to be kind of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.580 
saga texture pack is going to be kind of
like<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> brand<00:02:06.810> new<00:02:06.930> text<00:02:07.229> back<00:02:07.380> we've

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
like a like a brand new text back we've

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.109
