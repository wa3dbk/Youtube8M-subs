00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.899 
set up this one instead of look at
lean-to<00:03:49.980> you<00:03:50.159> already<00:03:50.370> got<00:03:50.459> your<00:03:50.579> center<00:03:50.849> line

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
lean-to you already got your center line

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.849 
lean-to you already got your center line
here<00:03:51.379> right<00:03:52.379> here<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:55.230> would<00:03:55.379> run<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.680> on

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
here right here you would run it on

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.759 
here right here you would run it on
between<00:03:56.280> these<00:03:56.430> two<00:03:56.579> trees<00:03:56.849> and<00:03:57.689> you'd<00:03:58.620> have

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
between these two trees and you'd have

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.190 
between these two trees and you'd have
an<00:03:58.889> a-frame<00:03:59.359> the<00:04:00.359> other<00:04:00.480> thing<00:04:00.719> that<00:04:00.750> we<00:04:00.959> could

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
an a-frame the other thing that we could

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.039 
an a-frame the other thing that we could
do<00:04:01.379> is<00:04:02.040> we<00:04:02.459> could<00:04:02.609> disconnect<00:04:02.969> these<00:04:03.810> two

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
do is we could disconnect these two

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.179 
do is we could disconnect these two
corners<00:04:04.409> here<00:04:04.590> are<00:04:04.829> two<00:04:05.010> corners<00:04:05.870> come<00:04:06.870> out

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
corners here are two corners come out

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:12.080 
corners here are two corners come out
with<00:04:08.189> a<00:04:09.049> hiking<00:04:10.049> staff<00:04:10.290> like<00:04:11.159> this<00:04:11.310> one<00:04:11.519> they

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
with a hiking staff like this one they

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.959 
with a hiking staff like this one they
use<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.239> track<00:04:12.540> slight<00:04:12.810> staff<00:04:13.639> set<00:04:14.639> it<00:04:14.730> up<00:04:14.819> in

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:14.969 
use a track slight staff set it up in

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:17.029 
use a track slight staff set it up in
the<00:04:15.060> center<00:04:15.329> now<00:04:16.289> you<00:04:16.349> have<00:04:16.500> another<00:04:16.739> center

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
the center now you have another center

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.650 
the center now you have another center
line<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.489> run<00:04:17.669> your<00:04:17.699> two<00:04:17.970> sides<00:04:18.239> down<00:04:18.479> you

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
line and you run your two sides down you

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.129 
line and you run your two sides down you
basically<00:04:18.959> close<00:04:19.229> off<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.530> front<00:04:19.769> end<00:04:21.139> it's

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
basically close off the front end it's

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.560 
basically close off the front end it's
kind<00:04:22.320> of<00:04:22.349> like<00:04:22.500> Andrea<00:04:23.060> yeah<00:04:24.090> sorry
