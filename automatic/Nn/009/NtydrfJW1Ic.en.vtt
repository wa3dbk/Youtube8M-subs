though<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.280> get<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.610> kind<00:01:37.850> of<00:01:37.940> smoke<00:01:38.300> screen

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
though you get a kind of smoke screen

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.510 
though you get a kind of smoke screen
effect<00:01:39.320> so<00:01:39.680> you<00:01:39.770> have<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:39.979> kind<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.220> clear<00:01:40.490> the

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.900 
effect so you have to kind of clear the
smoke<00:01:40.760> more<00:01:41.470> concentration<00:01:42.470> I<00:01:42.920> think<00:01:43.250> so

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
smoke more concentration I think so

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.550 
smoke more concentration I think so
