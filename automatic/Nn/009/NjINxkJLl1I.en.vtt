but that's it all right and the last but
not<00:01:31.340> least<00:01:31.789> is<00:01:32.149> the<00:01:32.479> beer<00:01:32.750> at<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.530> top<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
not least is the beer at the top of the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.870 
not least is the beer at the top of the
beer<00:01:34.220> mug<00:01:35.110> it's<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.200> little<00:01:36.560> bit<00:01:36.799> if<00:01:37.580> you<00:01:37.700> look

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
at this we have we have it like a little

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.449 
at this we have we have it like a little
foam<00:01:41.240> where<00:01:41.569> the<00:01:41.659> foam<00:01:41.899> is<00:01:42.140> we<00:01:43.039> just<00:01:43.280> take<00:01:43.429> a

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
foam where the foam is we just take a

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.480 
foam where the foam is we just take a
little<00:01:43.759> rounded<00:01:44.209> gouge<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.899> we<00:01:45.140> kind<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.590> go

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
little rounded gouge and we kind of go

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.559 
little rounded gouge and we kind of go
in<00:01:46.670> different<00:01:47.119> directions<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:48.970> that<00:01:49.970> works

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
in different directions and that works

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.930 
in different directions and that works
out<00:01:50.810> pretty<00:01:50.990> good<00:01:51.319> and<00:01:54.190> that's<00:01:55.190> kind<00:01:55.849> of

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940
