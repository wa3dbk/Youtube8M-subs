00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
the skin because the camera is all

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.090 
the skin because the camera is all
right<00:02:14.210> but<00:02:14.690> it's<00:02:14.840> also<00:02:15.050> not<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.530> best<00:02:15.860> as<00:02:16.070> you

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100
