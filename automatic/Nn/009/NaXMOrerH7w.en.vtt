well<00:00:05.620> until<00:00:06.190> very<00:00:07.030> recently<00:00:07.480> we<00:00:07.779> had<00:00:07.960> beaten

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.110 
well until very recently we had beaten

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.860 
well until very recently we had beaten
them<00:00:08.850> twice<00:00:09.850> as<00:00:10.000> many<00:00:10.090> times<00:00:10.360> as<00:00:10.480> they<00:00:10.600> beaten

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
them twice as many times as they beaten

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.660 
them twice as many times as they beaten
us<00:00:11.020> I<00:00:11.290> think<00:00:11.530> that's<00:00:11.680> domination<00:00:12.160> you<00:00:12.580> know

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
us I think that's domination you know

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.150 
us I think that's domination you know
what<00:00:12.880> he's<00:00:13.180> right<00:00:13.350> it<00:00:14.350> was<00:00:14.620> just<00:00:14.890> recently

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
what he's right it was just recently

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.359 
what he's right it was just recently
that<00:00:15.640> Clemson<00:00:15.970> had<00:00:16.330> twice<00:00:17.230> as<00:00:17.290> many<00:00:17.680> wins<00:00:17.980> as

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
that Clemson had twice as many wins as

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.620 
that Clemson had twice as many wins as
South<00:00:18.640> Carolina<00:00:18.910> in<00:00:19.570> fact<00:00:20.290> it<00:00:20.439> was<00:00:20.940> 1946<00:00:21.940> when

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
South Carolina in fact it was 1946 when

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.540 
South Carolina in fact it was 1946 when
the<00:00:22.690> overall<00:00:22.900> record<00:00:23.350> was<00:00:23.650> 28<00:00:24.130> for<00:00:24.340> Clemson

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
the overall record was 28 for Clemson

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.029 
the overall record was 28 for Clemson
and<00:00:24.880> 14<00:00:25.270> for<00:00:25.449> South<00:00:25.690> Carolina<00:00:26.170> which<00:00:26.710> was<00:00:26.890> only

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
and 14 for South Carolina which was only

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.849 
and 14 for South Carolina which was only
66<00:00:27.699> years<00:00:27.970> ago<00:00:28.210> so<00:00:28.750> I'm<00:00:28.810> assuming<00:00:29.109> by<00:00:29.380> recently

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
66 years ago so I'm assuming by recently

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.090 
66 years ago so I'm assuming by recently

he was referring relative to the actual

he was referring relative to the actual
age<00:00:33.370> of<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:33.790> cosmos<00:00:34.360> because<00:00:34.870> in<00:00:35.050> a<00:00:35.170> you<00:00:35.350> know

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
age of the cosmos because in a you know

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.340 
age of the cosmos because in a you know
millions<00:00:35.769> of<00:00:36.190> years<00:00:36.550> 66<00:00:37.239> years<00:00:37.480> ago<00:00:37.750> seems

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
millions of years 66 years ago seems

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.920 
millions of years 66 years ago seems
like<00:00:38.470> two<00:00:39.010> weeks<00:00:39.190> okay<00:00:39.940> until<00:00:40.270> very<00:00:40.570> recently

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
like two weeks okay until very recently

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.720 
like two weeks okay until very recently
do<00:00:41.050> you<00:00:41.110> know<00:00:41.200> when<00:00:41.320> that<00:00:41.440> was<00:00:43.559> before<00:00:44.559> I<00:00:45.399> think

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
do you know when that was before I think

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.760 
do you know when that was before I think
it<00:00:45.790> wasn't<00:00:46.000> in<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.750> mid-2000s<00:00:47.380> when<00:00:47.530> I<00:00:47.590> first

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
it wasn't in the mid-2000s when I first

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.290 
it wasn't in the mid-2000s when I first
started<00:00:48.010> following<00:00:48.280> Clemson<00:00:48.700> I<00:00:48.880> remember<00:00:49.180> we

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
started following Clemson I remember we

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.670 
started following Clemson I remember we
had<00:00:49.450> on<00:00:49.600> we<00:00:49.870> had<00:00:49.960> about<00:00:50.200> twice<00:00:50.410> as<00:00:50.559> many

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
had on we had about twice as many

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.080 
had on we had about twice as many
victories<00:00:51.040> as<00:00:51.250> they<00:00:51.340> did<00:00:51.489> you<00:00:51.670> know<00:00:51.760> what<00:00:51.940> will

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
victories as they did you know what will

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.670 
victories as they did you know what will
give<00:00:52.210> him<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:52.360> benefit<00:00:52.750> of<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:52.960> doubt<00:00:53.140> will

because<00:01:06.220> this<00:01:06.520> gentleman<00:01:06.880> used<00:01:07.240> Clemson<00:01:07.840> math

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
because this gentleman used Clemson math

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.600 
because this gentleman used Clemson math
to<00:01:08.289> figure<00:01:08.440> out<00:01:08.649> which<00:01:08.830> number<00:01:09.160> it<00:01:09.250> was<00:01:09.369> twice

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
to figure out which number it was twice

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.669 
to figure out which number it was twice
as<00:01:09.640> big<00:01:09.970> as<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.209> other<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.630> there's<00:01:11.020> an<00:01:11.140> axiom

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:11.679 
as big as the other and there's an axiom

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:13.680 
as big as the other and there's an axiom
in<00:01:11.890> Clemson<00:01:12.520> math<00:01:12.700> which<00:01:13.030> states<00:01:13.390> clearly

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
in Clemson math which states clearly

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.900 
in Clemson math which states clearly
that<00:01:14.200> any<00:01:14.410> two-digit<00:01:15.069> number<00:01:15.399> that<00:01:15.759> is<00:01:15.880> the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
that any two-digit number that is the

that any two-digit number that is the

invert of another two-digit number

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.730 
invert of another two-digit number
equals<00:01:18.550> twice<00:01:19.179> that<00:01:19.539> number<00:01:19.840> it's<00:01:20.319> so<00:01:20.530> a

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
equals twice that number it's so a

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.290

this error in his math is that he maybe

rounds<00:01:53.950> up<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.099> 70<00:01:54.459> at<00:01:54.550> Clemson<00:01:54.849> exactly<00:01:55.539> yes

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
rounds up to 70 at Clemson exactly yes

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.620 
rounds up to 70 at Clemson exactly yes
I<00:01:56.759> wish<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.910> grade<00:01:58.060> point<00:01:58.270> average<00:01:58.509> we

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
I wish the grade point average we

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.300 
I wish the grade point average we
rounded<00:01:58.959> up<00:01:59.020> like<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.349> you<00:01:59.739> know<00:01:59.860> what<00:02:00.009> makes

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
rounded up like that you know what makes

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.639 
rounded up like that you know what makes
better<00:02:00.520> sense<00:02:00.670> using<00:02:01.599> this<00:02:01.929> rounding<00:02:02.470> see

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
better sense using this rounding see

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.339 
better sense using this rounding see
they<00:02:02.770> take<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.099> 63<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.179> they<00:02:04.599> round<00:02:04.929> it<00:02:05.080> up<00:02:05.200> to

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:05.349 
they take the 63 and they round it up to

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.219 
they take the 63 and they round it up to
70<00:02:05.860> then<00:02:06.250> they<00:02:06.369> take<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.640> 36<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.509> round<00:02:07.959> that

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
70 then they take the 36 and round that

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.770 
70 then they take the 36 and round that
down<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.979> 30<00:02:09.310> then<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:10.060> have<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.209> 70<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.750> 30

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
down to 30 then you have a 70 to 30

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.069 
down to 30 then you have a 70 to 30
relationship<00:02:11.680> which<00:02:11.860> is<00:02:11.909> domination<00:02:12.909> so<00:02:13.360> Maya

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
relationship which is domination so Maya

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:19.820 
relationship which is domination so Maya
had<00:02:14.349> Clemson<00:02:14.860> ma<00:02:15.459> bad

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.680 

holy<00:02:20.790> crap<00:02:21.740> West<00:02:22.740> Virginia<00:02:23.550> has<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:24.210> scored

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
holy crap West Virginia has just scored
