00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.280
Roy Chiu is here. He's really good at pressing these things.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.280
He's an electronic god. He knows how to hit combos.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.720
But I'm not necessarily going to give you questions relating to combos.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.920
All right, everyone, get ready. I'm going to start saying the question now.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:16.840
First question!

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.160
257+107+260-421+489+487-176-635+798 equals...?

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.040
Two of them have already given up.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.040
Belly.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.240
What did you just say?

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.120
Belly?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.560
Your stomach is too big, so there is a belly.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.440
It was too fast! I couldn't understand.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.520
So it was too fast?

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.920
Standard?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.240
All right.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.800
It's like you were beat-boxing.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.840
Too fast! Don't have such a nimble tongue.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.160
Normal beats will be fine.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.040
Let's try it again.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.080
128 bpm.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:16.760
257+107+260-421+489+487-176-635+798 equals...?

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.480
All right, everyone together.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.720
Wait, wait, but James Wen already has the answer.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.880
Your answer is...?

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.880
1423.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.400
1423.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.040
What's your answer? / 1143. / 1143.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.080
Tia, what's your answer? / 1166. / 1166?

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.160
I'm 1166. / Hey, you two have the same answer!

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.080
Roy Chiu, what's your answer?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.440
370. / See! I told you not to use your combos.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.440
You just kept pressing and pressing.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.640
Can you turn off your turbo and press them normally?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.040
Patrick, what did you get?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.200
1003.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.520
So the answer... what's the answer?

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.240
1166! Congratulations to the two females!

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.520
All right. That was the first question. We still 
 have a second question. Are females really smarter?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.680
Second question... get ready...

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.560
There's a second question? / There's a second question.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.840
Roy Chiu, turn off your turbo first. All right. Ready, start!

00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:08.080
37+510-86+953+41-602+27+814-63+489 equals...?

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.600
So 2120? James Wen: 2120. Tia: 2120. She has 2120.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.480
Roy Chiu!!! / Let me see, let me see.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.720
Wait, wait! Don't turn it off!

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.440
All right, all right.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.360
What's wrong with you?

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.040
Where did you get these decimals from?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.400
Where did the decimals come from, and when?

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.440
This calculator is sick.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.800
Your hand suffered a stroke.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.240
Patrick's answer is...?

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.040
Two-thousand and one-hundred and twenty. / 2120!

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.680
So everyone got it right, except for Roy 
 Chiu! And he even got a decimal.
