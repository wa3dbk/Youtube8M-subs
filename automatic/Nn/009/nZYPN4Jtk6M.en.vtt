00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.600
 I have to respond to a fan’s question today. 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.100
 If you can't find a teacher, what should you pay attention to when you want to learn a guitar? 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.420
 I will share a few key points with you below. 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.840
 First, you have to choose a guitar that suits your body shape. 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.400
 Because you can easily buy a guitar with a large size on the market. 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.560
 I personally think that a guitar that is too big is not suitable for Asians. 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:39.280
 Because the body of this type of guitar is too big, it is easy to make your right shoulder tired. 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.180
 And I don't recommend beginners to practice with steel string guitars. 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.000
 Because you can easily buy a larger steel string guitar 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.100
 And the strings of the steel string guitar need to be replaced frequently. 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.900
 If the maintenance is not good, the string pitch of the steel string guitar is easy to become high. 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.020
 So that the left hand increases the difficulty of the string 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.160
 Left hand is easy to feel tired 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.800
 After explaining the precautions on the guitar 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.020
 Now explain the precautions of self-learning guitar 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.060
 Because you have no teacher guidance 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.160
 So when you hold the guitar, you just have to feel comfortable. 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.220
 Note that the left and right shoulders do not shrink 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.640
 Many people who play guitar are also injured on the right shoulder, neck and back. 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.000
 Without the teacher, as long as the action is comfortable, you can 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.140
 What do you have to learn to learn from your own guitar? 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.140
 There are two very important 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.060
 First, you have to learn to read the score 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.320
 I think it’s all about self-study, it’s not hard to learn. 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.960
 Second, you have to learn how to count yourself. 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.340
 It’s a very important study to count yourself. 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.980
 If you want to listen to the music, you need to listen to the Internet once. 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.100
 Then you will play, then you will be easily affected by others. 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.100
 It is more difficult to build your own playing style 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.900
 Now I will teach you how to count the beats. 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.980
 Before explaining the number of beats, you must first understand how to play the strings. 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.060
 How to play the strings to see my related teaching videos 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.860
 Let’s take a look at the score 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.960
 You see the 4/4 beat mark on the score. 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.240
 What do the two 4 words actually mean? 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.260
 The 4 characters above represent 4 beats per measure, while the 4 characters below represent a 4th note as a beat. 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.620
 Let's learn the simplest method of counting beats. 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.120
 First look at my left foot 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.120
 Let's learn how to count simple rhythms. 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.760
 1,2,3,4 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.320
 Take a look at the first exercise. 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.940
 Play the left foot, the right hand 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:29.040
 1,2,3,4 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.680
 The first exercise is very simple 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.760
 Now take a look at the second exercise. 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.800
 This is a bit more complicated 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.200
 When playing with the foot, except for the downward movement 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.800
 There is an upward movement 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.700
 The whole action is 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.700
 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.740
 Try it now. 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.380
 Look at the third exercise 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.480
 Review this rhythm a little more 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.500
 The easiest way to learn this rhythm is 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.220
 Strawberry, apple 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.600
 Look at when my left foot is falling 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.780
 Look carefully at the left foot and beat the beat. 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.520
 Strawberry, apple 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.480
 Look at the next rhythm 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.120
 I call this rhythm to do 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.520
 Orange, apple 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.440
 Take a look at how the left foot beats the beat. 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.400
 When practicing these exercises, you must figure out the ups and downs of your feet. 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.540
 It is very certain that those sounds are positive shots, those are the second half shots. 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.720
 I will explain the last rhythm. 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.580
 Take a look at the spectrum 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.600
 This rhythm is also used in many music. 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.800
 How to learn at the beginning? 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.980
 The average person listens and then imitates 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.920
 As long as you learn how to practice a few of my previous exercises. 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.240
 You can also try this rhythm 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.480
 This rhythm is not used in the 2nd and 4th beats. 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.980
 Take a look at the demonstration 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.520
 I’ve taught the basic rhythms today. 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.380
 Play again, don't get muscle injury 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.400
 Because many people are self-study, or have teacher guidance, they will also strain their muscles. 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.700
 Also relax muscles under any circumstances 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.740
 How to forget how to relax muscles can see my past teaching 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.460
 If you want to learn by yourself and have questions and ask questions, what should you do? 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.400
 I have a suggestion for you. 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.360
 Three words
