00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760 

I<00:00:00.060> remember<00:00:00.750> when<00:00:00.810> you<00:00:00.900> used<00:00:00.989> to<00:00:01.230> post<00:00:01.410> sticky

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
I remember when you used to post sticky

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.649 
I remember when you used to post sticky
notes<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.280> your<00:00:02.340> computer<00:00:02.790> and<00:00:03.000> on<00:00:03.300> your<00:00:03.449> walls

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
notes to your computer and on your walls

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.019 
notes to your computer and on your walls
and<00:00:04.080> in<00:00:04.440> your<00:00:04.560> notebooks<00:00:05.009> that<00:00:05.370> said<00:00:05.670> when

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
and in your notebooks that said when

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.880 
and in your notebooks that said when
time<00:00:06.299> travel<00:00:06.660> exists<00:00:07.109> come<00:00:07.470> back<00:00:07.649> at<00:00:07.799> this

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
time travel exists come back at this

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.000 
time travel exists come back at this
date<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:08.760> time<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:10.139> was<00:00:10.769> always

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
date and this time and it was always

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.350 
date and this time and it was always
only<00:00:11.370> about<00:00:11.490> ten<00:00:11.730> minutes<00:00:11.820> into<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.210> future

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
only about ten minutes into the future

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.749 
only about ten minutes into the future
and<00:00:12.950> then<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.040> would<00:00:14.160> vow<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> leave<00:00:14.610> that

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
and then you would vow to leave that

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.160 
and then you would vow to leave that
note<00:00:14.940> there<00:00:15.120> forever<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.929> there's<00:00:16.109> no

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
note there forever so that there's no

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.890 
note there forever so that there's no
way<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.650> future<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.100> could<00:00:17.250> miss<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
way the future you could miss it and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.450 
way the future you could miss it and
then<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:18.990> would<00:00:19.080> wait<00:00:19.260> 10<00:00:19.439> minutes<00:00:19.619> nothing

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
then you would wait 10 minutes nothing

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.950 
then you would wait 10 minutes nothing
would<00:00:20.550> happen<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.420> decide<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.779> you

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
would happen and you decide that you

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.630 
would happen and you decide that you
must<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.289> accidentally<00:00:22.949> lost<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.400> note<00:00:23.519> at

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
must have accidentally lost the note at

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.160 
must have accidentally lost the note at
some<00:00:23.789> point<00:00:24.060> before<00:00:24.269> time<00:00:24.689> travel<00:00:25.019> was

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
some point before time travel was

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.140 
some point before time travel was
actually<00:00:25.529> invented<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.640> there<00:00:26.939> was<00:00:27.029> no<00:00:27.119> point

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
actually invented so there was no point

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.910 
actually invented so there was no point
in<00:00:27.420> keeping<00:00:27.480> out<00:00:27.720> there<00:00:27.900> now<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.619> you'd<00:00:28.710> throw

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
in keeping out there now so you'd throw

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.980 
in keeping out there now so you'd throw
it<00:00:28.980> away<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.460> then<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.480> would<00:00:30.599> figure<00:00:30.779> out

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
it away and then you would figure out

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.299 
it away and then you would figure out
that<00:00:31.289> must<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.650> been<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> time<00:00:31.859> when<00:00:32.189> you've

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
that must have been the time when you've

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.639 
that must have been the time when you've
lost<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.210> put<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.480> note<00:00:33.630> back<00:00:33.840> but

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
lost it and you put the note back but

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.930 
lost it and you put the note back but
then<00:00:34.800> you'd<00:00:34.920> figure<00:00:35.130> out<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.730> already

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
then you'd figure out that it already

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.639 
then you'd figure out that it already
didn't<00:00:36.300> work<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.660> there's<00:00:36.750> still<00:00:37.140> no<00:00:37.350> point

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
didn't work so there's still no point

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.470 
didn't work so there's still no point
keeping<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.070> note<00:00:38.219> there<00:00:38.460> then<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.120> decide

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
keeping the note there then you decide

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.299 
keeping the note there then you decide
that<00:00:39.510> time<00:00:40.140> travel<00:00:40.320> would<00:00:40.649> never<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.100> invented

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
that time travel would never be invented

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.680 
that time travel would never be invented
anyway<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:43.590> far<00:00:43.829> you're<00:00:43.950> right<00:00:44.450> there's<00:00:45.450> no

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
anyway so far you're right there's no

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.060 
anyway so far you're right there's no
way<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:45.989> come<00:00:46.289> back<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.590> talk<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.039> and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
way I can come back and talk to you and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.250 
way I can come back and talk to you and
to<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.550> day<00:00:47.789> there<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.120> only<00:00:48.360> one<00:00:48.690> reason<00:00:48.870> I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
to this day there is only one reason I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.740 
to this day there is only one reason I
ever<00:00:49.559> would<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.120> feel<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.629> i<00:00:51.719> said

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
ever would I feel like if i said

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.180 
ever would I feel like if i said
something<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.289> don't<00:00:52.680> listen<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.070> this

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
something like don't listen to this

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.979 
something like don't listen to this
person<00:00:53.430> or<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.539> instead<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.899> that

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
person or do this instead of that

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.470 
person or do this instead of that
because<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.770> wasn't<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.250> great<00:00:56.520> my<00:00:57.270> life

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
because that wasn't that great my life

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.209 
because that wasn't that great my life
wouldn't<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.840> where<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.199> now<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.379> i<00:00:59.010> love

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
wouldn't be where it is now and i love

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.520 
wouldn't be where it is now and i love
where<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.550> now<00:00:59.699> as<00:01:00.510> far<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.140> i<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
where it is now as far as i know you

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.039 
where it is now as far as i know you
never<00:01:02.219> make<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> wrong<00:01:02.730> decision<00:01:03.120> even<00:01:03.899> when

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
never make the wrong decision even when

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.359 
never make the wrong decision even when
you<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.830> would<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> easier

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
you know that that would be the easier

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.640 
you know that that would be the easier
one<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.549> make<00:01:05.729> even<00:01:06.689> when<00:01:06.990> everyone<00:01:07.500> would

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
one to make even when everyone would

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.590 
one to make even when everyone would
probably<00:01:08.040> bet<00:01:08.220> money<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.700> you'd<00:01:09.150> never<00:01:09.420> make

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
probably bet money that you'd never make

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.660 
probably bet money that you'd never make
that<00:01:09.659> choice<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.260> mean<00:01:11.250> who<00:01:11.430> would<00:01:11.580> have

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
that choice I mean who would have

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.649 
that choice I mean who would have
thought<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.909> you'd<00:01:12.180> never<00:01:12.299> joined<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
thought that you'd never joined the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.510 
thought that you'd never joined the
rugby<00:01:12.960> team<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.500> hated<00:01:13.710> sports<00:01:14.040> was

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
rugby team when you hated sports was

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.399 
rugby team when you hated sports was
always<00:01:14.850> last<00:01:15.090> pic<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.479> Jim<00:01:15.689> couldn't<00:01:16.259> talk<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
always last pic and Jim couldn't talk to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.499 
always last pic and Jim couldn't talk to
people<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.830> have<00:01:16.979> been<00:01:17.130> very<00:01:17.430> clear<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.360> mom

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
people and have been very clear to mom

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.870 
people and have been very clear to mom
that<00:01:18.540> you'd<00:01:18.900> never<00:01:19.170> play<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> sport<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.790> was

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that you'd never play a sport and it was

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.520 
that you'd never play a sport and it was
probably<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> best<00:01:21.750> decisions<00:01:22.259> of

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
probably one of the best decisions of

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.850 
probably one of the best decisions of
her<00:01:22.680> life<00:01:24.200> if<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.380> wouldn't<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.710> done<00:01:25.799> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
her life if you wouldn't have done that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.859 
her life if you wouldn't have done that
maybe<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.670> would<00:01:26.970> want<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> come<00:01:27.330> back<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.780> tell

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
maybe I would want to come back and tell
