00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.980
A  building represents growth

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.530
and one of the really great things about
any businesses is that it grows, and so to see our 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.580
college a business growing is
tremendous.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.060
We have great professors, great
curriculum,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.110
great experience at this campus and now
it's time to get

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.240
students into a building that allows all
that to flourish

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.029
and maximize as well as get better high
quality students recruited

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.270
'cause it really is a good tool to get some of the top talent in the nation to Nebraska. 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.899
For me honestly the new
building was one of the big reasons that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:37.969
I wanted to come

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.589
to the University of Nebraska. It really
represents that were a university that's

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.760
starting to trend upwards and we learn
in our investing classes that like

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.089
you wanna go in something that you
believe is currently undervalued

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.549
and will build itself up and I think the
University Nebraska is in a great place.

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.299
Seems like there is so much energy and 
a buzz among students to be

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.399
in spaces that work in spaces  that
reflect what they'll see when they're

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.789
out in the working world

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.190
and something that they can be proud of.  It  means a lot to me to be able to

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.440
be the first class to move into the new
building.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.830
I'm looking forward to seeing the
landscape of the campus change with the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.240
addition in the new building

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.320
and I'm very excited to be able to
experience the new resources the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.250
building will offer.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.450
To have areas that are specifically
built

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.480
to allow collaboration, I think will make
it a lot easier for students to work

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.970
with each other and hopefully for the

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.710
faculty to work with each other. Places
where we can go work on a group project

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.820
or even working group inside classrooms, the collaboration classrooms, I think it's gonna be

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.690
 really cool.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.690
So the college businesses is making some
great connections with the businesses

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.760
here in Nebraska...

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.020
to share their resources with the
students I mean definitely create a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.600
connection between the students of business at UNL

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.880
and the business world outside the
college. I think it's really important as

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.310
technology is changing so fast today

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.600
we really do need to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.180
have facilities to keep up with that so
that students can learn more effectively

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.750
and faculty can teach more productively.
We see with the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.860
the new business world it's really focused
on technology especially within the next

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.069
15 years

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.130
so the new technology focus will help me
learn

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.010
exactly what I'm going to be going into
within the business world.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.530
For me the building represents the commitment of the alumni 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.280
of the College of Business investing in the lives of

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.640
the students here and that's really
important to me as they partner with me in

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.750
 creating the next generation of
business leaders.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.250
And this really is going to expand our
learning opportunities.  I would say to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.840
the donors who are making this building

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.690
possible a sincere thank you and
sense of gratitude for

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.450
not just building a legacy in their name
but also creating a legacy for all

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.650
of Nebraska to enjoy. 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.030
It's essentially an investment and what
they believe that the state can do in

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.860
the future

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.900
and how business can help improve our
society as a whole.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.819
I am very excited about the new
opportunities it will present

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.959
and I'm really looking forward to using
every single inch of it. 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.959
I can't wait to get into the new
building to start something.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.620

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.870
