00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.510
 stephano who won so that made us 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.070
 pleasure we will iron follow-up fact 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.180
 and we will not end up linking a leak because 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.770
 that it is always fashionable to 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.270
 upgrade for the next a 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.080
 received what is happening soon at the palace of 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.549
 congress if it's not crazy 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.510
 exactly by the way we 'll be okay 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.170
 to be cool that's going to be cool 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.170
 here we go 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.150
 and so we start with the dreamhack 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.200
 summer 2012 then must but have already 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.520
 that it was a time when there was no 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.500
 a lot of Korean about the events 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.240
 foreigner so we often saw 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.160
 many more non-Korean finish 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.050
 final then it was also the beginning of 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.850
 the war between stephano and mana because 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.060
 that his fans or it's done it's done pi 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.860
 2 0 per mana in the semifinal and this is where 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.540
 what was the big guerrilla 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.790
 by the way he won because there he 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.650
 has won we have the art of continuation of 0 and in 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.570
 German revenge of man to dahouÃ«t that 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.970
 it's a bit of a yoyo that brings us to the 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.420
 final mana versus dimaga of the old metal 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.009
 and M 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.840
 and honestly it was fun to watch 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.580
 it's super fun to watch dimaga 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.800
 we leave the country bordering mana 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.290
 which makes us gorgeous southern effort 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.729
 with gheit romo set but not like 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.710
 knows it today which takes expand 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.000
 behind with lille and islam the warp 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.770
 prism that was less evening at the time 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.070
 works that takes three hits etc is dead 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.330
 it was still having bugs and 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.369
 so we'll have a mana 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.479
 wins event 3 to 1 and that makes it 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.950
 pleasure to see when we see 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.080
 today vying for mlg crowd 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.670
 Korean or foreigner in the final 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.519
 it's always funny and we arrive on 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.380
 the mlg pro circuit of spring then 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.330
 who saw opposing including Gregory Alicia 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.280
 so the poor alicia keys never 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.570
 managed to finally finalize who has 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.160
 never won anything in the bags ever 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.630
 concreted the finished second round in 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.010
 the major tournaments and that's enough 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.420
 sad to curse who followed him 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.250
 during all this time exactly the same 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.590
 time he falls against dongraegu so 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.700
 you who is supposed to be ben this is 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.170
 maybe what's more scary to 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.459
 Korean high level and regrets everything to 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.560
 made past is considered the 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.600
 best player in the world is not nothing 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.340
 is there he offers us race to blows 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.250
 to gorgeous luther even up 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.190
 leave an ex us miserably at 3 bp 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.110
 to say it's indecent it's horrible for 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.910
 as much for alicia for whose greg wood 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.290
 exactly because alicia and lives in 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.819
 the fear of losing his nexus and all 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.439
 tastes he just let live 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.180
 how is he going to offer us Malians 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.639
 the last one also to the last one or 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.129
 sewer tongs not six hens 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.510
 ah good alicia responds well the pylon in 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.340
 its basis for this information 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.150
 good answer from alicia but it will pass 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.620
 not and 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.060
 so I google it anyway so 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.890
 legal ones who gets up then I run a 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.150
 6pool i'm in shit but i 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.720
 wins anyway and that's good the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.700
 guy is so finally and we will move to the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.260
 finale of season 4 of the gsl that saw 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.019
 oppose a live view of his 15 years 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.349
 soaked quadruple champion holder of the 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.700
 title 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.989
 yeah then there was no need they 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.189
 were finally from murdoch we expected 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.870
 not to 15 young people want money 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.970
 reaches the final two trials and 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.379
 well even he gets there and goes 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.200
 surprise everyone and he'll put 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.730
 a pressure at amd of incredible strength 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.319
 when you have to understand in these games 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.349
 and at the technical level is what is 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.099
 pointed to death the napoli there have been 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.230
 crazy mussels 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.970
 there was fun more hangover except 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.739
 to generate friendly fire tanks to 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.409
 mountains in two perfect places see 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.290
 there was run by de and Lyon based 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.849
 I'll give it to you 20 30 drones flanks that a 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.920
 technically it was crazy 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.840
 the problem being by the problem of my 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.459
 point of view is that it's this time 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.200
 the same goals on each side and that's 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.700
 this time a commitment of 35 minutes 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.799
 so for those who like showmatch 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.849
 was a little boring by cons next to 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.530
 that at the technical level 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.750
 nothing to say and repeat what is in the game 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.489
 see again from to analyze galore 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.870
 really make fun of it 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.579
 is it still that the sap will win 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.169
 event 4 to 3 and will grab the 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.900
 fifth league title of the gsl and 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.830
 thereby the trophy g5l that the 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.539
 organizers had prepared 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.639
 especially for him we arrive on the 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.949
 nasl season 4 who sees oppose alicia 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.110
 the Provalys never win us 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.760
 last seconds against stephano 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.699
 stefano who was in his beautiful era 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.400
 this is always in its good time we have 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.110
 had a mediato hollow anyway 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.330
 everything is he that he played really well at 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.090
 that time alicia really everything 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.210
 Tried a the gun rush 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.430
 the macro game the game more offensive to 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.840
 base of eight gates nothing passes went 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.520
 punished blow on blow on the macro of 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.860
 stephano who was too perfect for 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.290
 him at the time and not what will we 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.479
 bring a 4-0 very violent and 4 0 that's 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.070
 seven days in the end it hurts 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.540
 anyway always is it that to go 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.490
 the years the organizers of the nasl 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.410
 have a little bit too ugly they've spent 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.430
 the united states line at the end of 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.229
 the event then one must know that 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.760
 the time there is a troll on stefano who 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.470
 said that stefano were American 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.580
 probably that 's American and American 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.199
 jealous 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.450
 yes but I was just jealous 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:22.800
 in any case as stefano would say 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:25.350
 himself from hairs to boots and thank you 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.220
 stefanov besides stefano who himself 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.590
 found in the new hall to 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.340
 fluids and we hope we hope that 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.990
 happiness for him 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.430
 scarlett and goes there who are the 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.840
 only foreigner what we did not have to 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.880
 the first excuse the first one 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.410
 solution is that does not leave 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.210
 the quarter-finals was crazy the Korean 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.800
 which we hope will make this year 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.160
 which gives us a nice match and a granny 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.449
 to this symbol then to love but who from 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.930
 the first games offer us 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:46.860
 showmatch 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.289
 and that's nice because it's when 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.300
 even 2500 spectators in this great rex 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.470

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.180
 we do not see at all yes that's it or 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.370

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.270

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.330
