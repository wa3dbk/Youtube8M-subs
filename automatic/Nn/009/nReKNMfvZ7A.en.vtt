00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:12.130
 briefcases a piece of luggage 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:15.160
 stop is finally the shaman that's for sure and 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.509
 after we go when sasha back there is 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.000
 she had very very bad hip pain 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.550
 and at the foot finally the leg she could 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.899
 no longer put his leg on the floor so we 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.239
 stayed a short week to 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:29.500
 shine to do a lot of analysis 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:31.660
 to do irm and scan or there they 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.640
 have they actually made a mass 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.930
 I asked them what it was 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:45.879
 mass actually this is what we 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:48.730
 called a tumor and it is like 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.010
 if I was a deputy I saw when we were 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.640
 received by the Chief of Pediatrics 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.769
 the institute on which we have been referred 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.620
 it was very solemn we were 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.679
 in a very cold room with this chef 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.510
 of pediatrics these audiences and internal 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.630
 we were told it's a stage iv 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.119
 metastatic so feet finally from 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.040
 athete to the knees 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.930
 it had stopped at the knee and 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.579
 so chances of healing very 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.460
 poor but a very good solution 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:24.120
 so a first protocol with five 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.950
 cures of chemo 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.710
 different from each other it is 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.930
 spend three weeks so here and 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.280
 thereafter after putting in remission 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.870
 so we were told there was when 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.280
 even one chance out of two she she 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.530
 respond to this treatment and that it 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.090
 can be in remission and after being 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.050
 in remission there was this famous 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.070
 China and high-dose audits so with 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.200
 with autologous cell harvesting 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.920
 so here's a chemo who could 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.150
 to be very beneficial but 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.970
 on the other hand with consequences quite 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.460
 dramatic that's about the 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.870
 growth regarding you has mostly 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.800
 talked about infertility at that time this 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.520
 that we also had to make a 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.950
 water intake to I had very very 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.600
 bad report from the beginning with the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.970
 chief of pediatrics who was responsible for iia 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.490
 and a lot of problems with 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.900
 6 to my daughter who if there were any 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.850
 respect no respect for the patient 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.310
 really no respect it was a 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.900
 new world for her to make herself a 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.930
 little tortured in quotation marks every 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.060
 days it was bites it was 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.209
 things not funny to be locked to the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.640
 parade take out the nurses the threat 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.320
 is regularly 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.420
 it was a little prison dictatorship 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.040
 it was very cold in this 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.680
 institute is neat maybe very very 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.850
 well the human body but he knew 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.160
 absolutely not what it was that being 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.530
 human and that's what I blame them 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.940
 because because they agree they are 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.920
 very good for injecting chemo 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.360
 to sting for is still good 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.590
 equestrian yes sting my hunger they know 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.090
 not talking to kids next to that 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.700
 because even if they struggled but 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.950
 it was that threats on the meals 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.910
 to eat in China too very very 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.180
 complicated eh well she had the right 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.530
 that the plateau who really 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.140
 do not have other words it's disgusting 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.400
 so she was entitled to that but me 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.810
 if I cooked dishes 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.549
 house it was banning him 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.400
 give so I had no rights so 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.019
 I gave him secretly after 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.379
 three cures already in the summer we left a 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.769
 balance sheet 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.480
 wishes already nothing and then so 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.760
 Least developed still had to 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.030
 cure to do more the operation that had 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.519
 place in December so more advanced more 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.409
 in fact we were talking about 7.6 million doses 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.250
 chief of pediatrics told me about it 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.590
 spoke regularly 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.659
 set up the levy 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.790
 cells end of all this no already I 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.720
 did not trust him too much I 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.030
 begins to have doubts 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.220
 I had already contacted the service of 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.450
 madam delépine who were against 6.7 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.220
 dose chemistry that told me that 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.540
 it was in the case of neuroblastoma 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.969
 for the useless I was against the probe 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.469
 gastric who wanted to place it and that has 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.389
 been clips because she really 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:05.870
 been treated like cattle and it was 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.519
 psychological harassment she she 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.829
 came an end they needed them 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:14.000
 come every day for weighing 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:16.130
 for here to see her skies if she 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.799
 lose 100 or 200 g 1 his joy that for 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.609
 have fun if she loses again it's over 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.229
 the business judge is called 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.789
 family rights and you are deprived of the right to 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.729
 your daughter what is that because 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:28.909
 you are a danger to her she has 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.910
 made robert debré operated to remove him 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.820
 so 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.920
 tumor everything went well 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.790
 it was perfect she had surgery 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.830
 a thursday 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.140
 no it was a broken Friday must be created 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.120
 as early as Monday wanted to make it so a 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.520
 chemo and I think that was a 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.440
 way of not giving me time to 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.550
 think though it was one connects it 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.150
 there will tac operation continues and 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.560
 ultimately 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.800
 I was against but we are still 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.200
 out of robert debré hospital and one 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.240
 was there the institute to have an appointment 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.260
 you with this doctor and it was very 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.570
 very badly spent this is the last time 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.980
 that I saw him I did not think I 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.390
 discreetly call the service of 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.740
 Madame Delépine who confirmed me 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.900
 who told me no no we prefer us 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.310
 still wait maybe 24 to 48 hours 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.880
 before doing a chemo because the 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.830
 body is going to tire a lot and bah I 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.360
 told him I was listened to I called the 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.230
 service of Madame loops again who 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.700
 confirmed to me that it was not too much 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.750
 too good to do so quickly 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.240
 so we could wait maybe 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.060
 a few days and then there it is 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.380
 pitched in tones he and then he has 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.580
 slammed the door and he told me that 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.380
 it was impossible to work with 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.370
 me that I have matted sticks all the time 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.810
 in the wheels and told me go see 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.450
 at the other 6th in the others and 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.680
 then slammed the door in my face two 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.100
 days later we are greeted at 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:48.750
