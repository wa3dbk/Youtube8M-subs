00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.710
 good to spend a quiet vacation 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.250
 in the best place you have to be more 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.250
 past 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.850
 rest take advantage of it without passing it 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.890
 as best as possible and savor everything 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.140
 we can have references of some 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.870
 friends and a few wonderful months ago and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.220
 We arrived at his house and they told us if we 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:57.120
 It would be interesting to come to the moment both 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:58.860
 happy if there is no time one has 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.270
 seven stars that ride me several 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.870
 little ones and this will be totally 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.600
 different from what I had tried 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.610
 cruises and in my opinion they are the best 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.509
 vacations there is an illusion of 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.509
 a lifetime 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.939
 we do the silver wedding and then 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.509
 We have decided to give away the 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.509
 inclusions 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.289
 wonderful 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.759
 a fantastic awesome brutal not 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.380
 I expected it well but exceeds the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.799
 expectations the truth say we had 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.360
 also talked about a cruise but 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.600
 when you see it, you see what it is 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.030
 told and more surprised us what 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.569
 great that was how new it is is very 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.909
 elegant and at the same time modern the boat 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.520
 has some presentations browsing that 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.439
 It is awesome especially the treatment of 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.780
 staff and the room every two times 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.630
 three are doing it to you and you do not give 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.009
 account shows in the smile and see if 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.079
 they are nice they come to 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.450
 ask you are always pending and 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:15.060
 not maybe you're eating and you're 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.209
 anticipate the move they keep it made 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.840
 fear you have to live many activities 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:24.480
 dance pool jacuzzi eat a lot yes 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.049
 but a lot we came to lose weight 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.049
 little but 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.000
 and there were always things to do or 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.190
 You can never get bored like a 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.230
 show on land but the best 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.090
 people stood up to clap 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.090
 because the truth was very impressive 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.110
 ay cinque terre m is the one I liked the most 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:52.870

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:55.510

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.030
 fun a lot of fun and spice 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.530
 We also liked it a lot when it 's 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.150
 approaching the school boat 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.400
 we come back that has between the 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.110
 villages in the mountains there is 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.380
 the most beautiful landscapes of the coast of 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.270
 italy the truth you imagine it in 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.310
 Photographs 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.740
 in documentaries but once you're 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.110
 there is if you press mission something that 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.480
 you come is a little village and say not very 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.209
 big and suddenly in the middle you look 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.980
 all its monuments tell you what 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.230
 do you here in the middle of this town 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.230
 so small so precious 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.030
 yes yes yes we were all saying to 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.150
 repeat it 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.370
 We not want to come home and we are 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.100
 thinking about the next 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.770
 if we would do a cruise again because 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.350
 The whole crew has behaved 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.230
 very well we liked it and the style of 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.470
 meals and everything in general or everything 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.910
