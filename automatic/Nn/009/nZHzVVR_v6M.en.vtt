00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.050
 I'll tell you what this lipstick really is 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.880
 I want to tell you about these books 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.799
 who recently struck me 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.340
 her lately i mean with 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.920
 beginning of the year we read everywhere 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.840
 plane in front with new on the road no matter 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.730
 we can read a real book can 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.779
 read on ipadian iphone on any other 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.570
 tabletbook here for example the book 1984 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.880
 I read on and come and never regret 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.170
 I read it on my way to work and did 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.930
 for yourself some marks 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.739
 this is a book about how a person tries 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.520
 break out of the totalitarian regime 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.030
 second book that really me 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.710
 struck this book the beach and principle it is about 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.559
 tom as a man tries to find heaven on 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.110
 earth and kind of finds it on what 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.660
 that time but then unfortunately destroys 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.670
 him but in principle this situation i think 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.079
 familiar to many we all often try 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.390
 find heaven on earth which is really 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.359
 there is no business with his own hands 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.650
 destroy if you watched the movie then i 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.869
 I think you should read 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.409
 book because the book is absolutely drink 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.409
 not alike 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.820
 and there is another book that is me 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.420
 loved it because in them 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.109
 there is everything 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.640
 this book is a man trying 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:23.000
 just trying he escapes from prison and 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.479
 flies in India he rolls there to find 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.310
 freedom again but find leone and me 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.799
 I think that you really should 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.959
 like the book is very cool and how are you 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.450
 understand the protagonist of all three of these 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:41.090
 books will try to find freedom and every 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.840
 in their own way and looking for someone to find someone 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.470
 no but by and large everyone aspires to 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.470
 happily 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.619
 another beautiful book that has 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.340

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.430
 red lipstick and dresser overall this 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.280

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.660
