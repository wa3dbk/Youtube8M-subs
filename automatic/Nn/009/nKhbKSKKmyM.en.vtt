I<00:00:22.050> got<00:00:23.050> this<00:00:23.230> from<00:00:23.410> one<00:00:23.560> of<00:00:23.650> my<00:00:23.740> college

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
I got this from one of my college

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.609 
I got this from one of my college
coaches<00:00:24.520> Chet<00:00:24.759> Murphy<00:00:25.180> at<00:00:25.390> Cal<00:00:25.990> Berkeley<00:00:26.200> and

coaches Chet Murphy at Cal Berkeley and

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.560 
coaches Chet Murphy at Cal Berkeley and
he<00:00:27.250> would<00:00:27.369> often<00:00:27.550> have<00:00:27.849> players<00:00:28.090> come<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.480> the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
he would often have players come to the

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.220 
he would often have players come to the
net<00:00:28.750> and<00:00:28.930> put<00:00:29.649> their<00:00:29.800> their<00:00:30.399> forearm<00:00:31.230> parallel

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
net and put their their forearm parallel

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.900 
net and put their their forearm parallel
to<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:32.890> net<00:00:33.070> and<00:00:34.140> put<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.290> racket<00:00:35.770> in<00:00:35.920> line

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
to the net and put the racket in line

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.900 
to the net and put the racket in line
with<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.329> forearm<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.890> any<00:00:39.160> say<00:00:39.430> now<00:00:39.610> hit<00:00:39.790> the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
with the forearm so any say now hit the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.200 
with the forearm so any say now hit the
net<00:00:40.090> by<00:00:40.300> twisting<00:00:40.780> your<00:00:40.870> arm<00:00:40.930> and<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
net by twisting your arm and the

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.670 
net by twisting your arm and the
leverage<00:00:43.660> is<00:00:43.870> such<00:00:44.110> that<00:00:44.320> because<00:00:44.559> the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
leverage is such that because the

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.130 
leverage is such that because the
rackets<00:00:45.100> in<00:00:45.219> line<00:00:45.430> with<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.760> arm<00:00:45.970> I<00:00:46.300> have<00:00:46.900> a

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
rackets in line with the arm I have a

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.350 
rackets in line with the arm I have a
certain<00:00:47.470> amount<00:00:47.680> of<00:00:47.860> leverage<00:00:48.070> and<00:00:48.550> then<00:00:49.240> he

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
certain amount of leverage and then he

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.180 
certain amount of leverage and then he
said<00:00:49.570> now<00:00:49.720> get<00:00:49.900> the<00:00:50.050> racket<00:00:50.440> at<00:00:50.530> right<00:00:50.740> angles

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
said now get the racket at right angles

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.180 
said now get the racket at right angles
to<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.460> arm<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:52.290> I'm<00:00:53.290> turning<00:00:53.560> my<00:00:53.770> arm<00:00:53.950> just

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
to the arm and I'm turning my arm just

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.150 
to the arm and I'm turning my arm just
as<00:00:54.310> fast<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.780> this<00:00:55.930> lever<00:00:56.320> at<00:00:56.530> right<00:00:56.740> angles

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
as fast but this lever at right angles

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.440 
as fast but this lever at right angles
to<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.400> forearm<00:00:58.170> increases<00:00:59.489> the<00:01:00.489> power<00:01:00.700> now

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
to the forearm increases the power now

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.790 
to the forearm increases the power now
you're<00:01:01.690> going<00:01:01.900> to<00:01:01.960> have<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.200> do<00:01:02.320> this<00:01:02.500> enough

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
you're going to have to do this enough

so you can feel it and all I'm doing is

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.109 
so you can feel it and all I'm doing is

like<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:17.859> and<00:01:18.130> this<00:01:18.249> was<00:01:18.460> really<00:01:18.670> Sampras

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
like that and this was really Sampras

Federer<00:01:20.170> has<00:01:20.380> a<00:01:20.439> version<00:01:20.859> of<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.310> Roddick

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:21.819 
Federer has a version of this Roddick

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.819 
Federer has a version of this Roddick
definitely<00:01:22.329> does<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:22.749> now<00:01:22.840> this<00:01:23.049> new<00:01:23.289> guy

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
definitely does and now this new guy

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.249 
definitely does and now this new guy
Melo's<00:01:24.549> roundish<00:01:25.119> from<00:01:25.299> Canada<00:01:25.749> definitely

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
Melo's roundish from Canada definitely

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.919 
Melo's roundish from Canada definitely
does<00:01:26.499> and<00:01:26.889> I<00:01:27.700> don't<00:01:27.759> think<00:01:28.090> that's<00:01:28.270> wrist<00:01:28.600> I

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
does and I don't think that's wrist I

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.499 
does and I don't think that's wrist I
think<00:01:29.200> that's<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.499> forearm<00:01:29.829> role<00:01:30.399> so<00:01:31.179> that<00:01:31.359> this

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
think that's a forearm role so that this

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.580 
think that's a forearm role so that this
action<00:01:31.990> here<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.530> could<00:01:33.340> even<00:01:33.459> hit<00:01:33.639> one<00:01:33.819> over<00:01:34.149> is

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
action here I could even hit one over is

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.359 
action here I could even hit one over is
the<00:01:35.590> same<00:01:35.889> as<00:01:36.219> this<00:01:36.939> action<00:01:37.479> here<00:01:37.899> on<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
the same as this action here on the

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.019 
the same as this action here on the
serve<00:01:39.609> and<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.829> think<00:01:42.069> if<00:01:42.189> you<00:01:42.310> want<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.579> try<00:01:42.969> to

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:43.029 
serve and I think if you want to try to

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:45.840 
serve and I think if you want to try to
unlock<00:01:43.509> this<00:01:43.920> first<00:01:44.920> off<00:01:45.219> you<00:01:45.399> have<00:01:45.429> to<00:01:45.700> come

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
unlock this first off you have to come

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.209 
unlock this first off you have to come
to<00:01:45.969> the<00:01:46.060> net<00:01:46.209> and<00:01:46.359> start<00:01:46.569> to<00:01:46.689> feel<00:01:46.869> this<00:01:47.219> and

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
to the net and start to feel this and

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.889 
to the net and start to feel this and
take<00:01:49.090> some<00:01:49.270> time<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:51.189> point<00:01:51.639> number<00:01:51.700> two<00:01:52.060> I'm

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
take some time now point number two I'm

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.809 
take some time now point number two I'm
moving<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.380> racket<00:01:53.709> forward<00:01:54.159> without<00:01:54.310> really

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
moving the racket forward without really

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.440 
moving the racket forward without really
advancing<00:01:55.569> my<00:01:55.689> arm<00:01:55.929> and<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.549> trick<00:01:57.880> on<00:01:58.090> this

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
advancing my arm and the trick on this

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.469 
advancing my arm and the trick on this
serve<00:01:58.810> is<00:01:59.229> not<00:02:00.039> to<00:02:00.279> have<00:02:00.459> the<00:02:00.639> arm<00:02:00.849> following

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
serve is not to have the arm following

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.370 
serve is not to have the arm following
through<00:02:02.279> but<00:02:03.279> have<00:02:03.459> the<00:02:03.609> arm<00:02:03.789> go<00:02:04.060> up<00:02:04.349> such<00:02:05.349> that

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
through but have the arm go up such that

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.760 
through but have the arm go up such that
it's<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.979> racket<00:02:06.520> that<00:02:07.209> comes<00:02:07.479> through

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it's the racket that comes through

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.900 
it's the racket that comes through
Sampras<00:02:08.770> knew<00:02:08.979> something<00:02:09.310> about<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.670> serve

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
Sampras knew something about the serve

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.150 
Sampras knew something about the serve
way<00:02:10.660> before<00:02:11.050> him<00:02:11.290> there<00:02:11.470> was<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.650> guy<00:02:11.770> Aaron
