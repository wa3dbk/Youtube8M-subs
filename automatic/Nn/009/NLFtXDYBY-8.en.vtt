00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 though 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.529
 Hello everyone, so that's it. 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.840
 today presents the new system 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.200
 parachute rescue for the offense and 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.349
 swiss years then it's a system 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.960
 ejection quite simple reliable and 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.590
 especially that will allow you not to 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.649
 use of pyrotechnic system 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.220
 so this system is completely 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.870
 reusable once 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.940
 deployed we recovered the machine 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.440
 only in a few minutes the machine 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.480
 is ready to go back then how's that 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.339
 is happening and well in fact the system on 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.379
 will come the graft on batteries on 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:58.089
 will replace the main board of 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.999
 battery support we will come up 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:05.530
 the system just below there 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:07.300
 like here how is this opening 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.820
 and but in fact we just have a microphone 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.640
 brain behind who will let go of 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.600
 system and we have this openness actually 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.370
 the emergency parachute will be ejected 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.760
 directly to the back of the multi 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.410
 rotor and thanks to that we will decrease the 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.150
 opening height but also the time 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.620
 deployment from the moment 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.620
 decided to trigger the system 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.450
 also the system 1 also allows 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.429
 protect batteries in case of impact 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.750
 seen that for example if we have two 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:44.399
 battles are completely encompass 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.860
 worries under the system there here we do not have 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.520
 of turrets to install on the multi 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.229
 rotor so suddenly we centered we have 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.359
 placed the system right in the center 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.100
 to keep a good middle age in the 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.799
 case we just put a basket by 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.500
 example so of tizi ouzou something 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.450
 of similar are there as with the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.950
 battery support we will see where re shifted 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.130
 the set is installed the nacelle 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.959
 in front so to keep a body that 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.190
 the brave 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.959
 well here is a little the system in these 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.760
 major axes 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:20.459
 now I will be able to directly 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.459
 cast rsa in flight 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:15.860
 come back as you see the multi is 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.060
 spotless absolutely nothing to spoil have 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.440
 now also a success to be made 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.380
 mean the parachute 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.170
 it'll take two minutes we look at the 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.430
 system and it's immediately ready is 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.430
 use
