00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.219
 Although first comes the liquid things 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.940

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.380
 Of course, that's something 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.280
 oriental for those who like that 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.170

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.250
 Unfortunately, I do not know how these cherries 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.400
 in german are called and these cores advertise 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.720
 grind and you like to use that 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.720
 to luggage in turkey 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.819
 and 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.120
 it always comes to the mail differently and 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.650

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.770
 places 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.770
 then I do not even start to knead 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.580
 it makes our day rested does take 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.580
 We are about a flat size 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:58.060
 and then as easy as I can 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.060
 the record companies 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:14.070
 Now I have my seasonally salt biscuits 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:17.670

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.830

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:41.660
 after the 1 also to refurbish the biscuits 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.190

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.400

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.640
 oven come out after half an hour 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.190
 So maybe you can watch 25 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.920
 minutes or 20 minutes remain in the oven 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.920
