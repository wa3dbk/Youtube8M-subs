00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 "Iridescent Kanojo 2d" is a description of Lysemara procedure 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Prologue skips OK 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.055
 The hero's name and first person can be freely changed later 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.000
 You can not change your birthday, but if you set it on the day, you can get 3 gacha tickets immediately 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.200
 You can change Nijikano's voice, height and skin color, but you need items and NP 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.500
 The name and first person can be changed freely 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.500
 Skip the tutorial OK 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.500
 Here you can get one MR in "No Cover MR Gacha" 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.055
 For the time being DL for voice data 

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:15.000
 If the birthday is on the day, an event occurs 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 You will get 3 tickets 

00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:33.200
 Receive a ticket for a birthday event 

00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:44.776
 At first it is "NP ガ チ ャ" 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Let's confirm the lineup by "view contents" 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.700
 You can close 1 time for the first time free, 2 times for the tutorial reward, 3 times for the birthday event 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 The next is "Damageless MR Gacha" 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 There is one ticket for the tutorial reward, so you can open it once 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.000
 (※ I restarted because I got an error) 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 It is limited time until March 4th, but as we are holding event that 3 pieces of MR gacha will get 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.000
 During the period you can pull in more by adding a serial code here 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 If you don't like the results of this part, 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.000
 Delete data from "Other" menu 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 As there is no need to uninstall or re-download data, 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 I think stress is less than other games
