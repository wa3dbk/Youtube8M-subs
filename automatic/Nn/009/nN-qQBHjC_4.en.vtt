00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
as the other snipers like the l 96 and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.720 
as the other snipers like the l 96 and
the<00:00:34.140> ps2<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.649> all<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.070> i<00:00:35.130> really<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.520> like

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.139 
shot one kill for the dragunov like what
really<00:00:52.260> makes<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.100> sniper<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.760> hard<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
really makes the sniper really hard to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.310 
really makes the sniper really hard to
use<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.600> that's<00:00:54.750> why<00:00:54.960> i<00:00:54.989> unfortunately

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320

new at the game can be almost at my
skill<00:01:55.920> level<00:01:55.950> pretty<00:01:56.460> much<00:01:57.049> with<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.079> these

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530

people<00:02:00.479> apart<00:02:00.570> even<00:02:01.530> though<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.710> spent<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.369> lot

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
people apart even though I spent a lot

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.190 
people apart even though I spent a lot
more<00:02:02.610> time<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.270> game<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.540> think<00:02:03.570> that's<00:02:03.899> kind

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
more time the game I think that's kind

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.810 
more time the game I think that's kind
of<00:02:04.290> unfortunate<00:02:04.649> if<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.070> think<00:02:05.280> about<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.520> and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
of unfortunate if you think about it and

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.550 
of unfortunate if you think about it and
the<00:02:06.210> reason<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.600> don't<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.409> because

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the reason I don't like that is because

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.340 
the reason I don't like that is because
it<00:02:07.829> takes<00:02:08.009> away<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.550> growth<00:02:08.849> of

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
it takes away the growth of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.230 
it takes away the growth of
game<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.710> takes<00:02:09.950> away<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.430> whole<00:02:10.610> point<00:02:11.000> of

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
game it takes away the whole point of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.940 
game it takes away the whole point of
trying<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.720> get<00:02:11.840> better<00:02:11.990> at<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.260> game<00:02:12.290> you

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
trying to get better at the game you

instead<00:05:29.770> of<00:05:29.920> just<00:05:30.100> using<00:05:30.340> you<00:05:30.610> know<00:05:30.640> the<00:05:30.820> easy

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
instead of just using you know the easy

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.790 
instead of just using you know the easy
weapons<00:05:31.480> and<00:05:31.630> immediately<00:05:32.200> killing<00:05:32.710> and

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
destroying everybody and so that's what

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.510 
destroying everybody and so that's what
I<00:05:34.810> think<00:05:35.140> that<00:05:35.410> should<00:05:35.590> happen<00:05:35.800> for<00:05:36.160> black<00:05:36.310> ops

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
I think that should happen for black ops

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.250 
I think that should happen for black ops
2<00:05:36.760> that<00:05:37.030> actually<00:05:37.450> the<00:05:37.540> opposite<00:05:37.960> should<00:05:38.140> have

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
2 that actually the opposite should have

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.070 
2 that actually the opposite should have
it<00:05:38.380> for<00:05:38.500> black<00:05:38.620> ops<00:05:38.830> 2<00:05:39.100> I<00:05:39.310> liked<00:05:40.060> black<00:05:40.510> ops<00:05:40.810> and

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
it for black ops 2 I liked black ops and

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.690 
it for black ops 2 I liked black ops and
that<00:05:41.200> I<00:05:41.230> thought<00:05:41.560> it<00:05:41.680> was<00:05:41.740> a<00:05:41.800> pretty<00:05:42.040> fair<00:05:42.430> game
