00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
to move this I didn't have to actually

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.029 
to move this I didn't have to actually
take<00:01:20.569> it<00:01:20.689> off<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:20.929> move<00:01:21.049> it<00:01:21.259> then<00:01:21.920> we're

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
take it off and move it then we're

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.919 
take it off and move it then we're
spying<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.429> angles<00:01:22.789> gray<00:01:23.060> is<00:01:23.329> shifts<00:01:23.659> great

the<00:01:29.929> left<00:01:30.109> side<00:01:30.319> is<00:01:30.409> definitely<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.859> easiest

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:30.889

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
system like I am for now I'm not gonna

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.849 
system like I am for now I'm not gonna
use<00:01:48.170> it<00:01:48.289> forever<00:01:48.439> so<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:51.229> stock<00:01:51.560> exhaust

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
use it forever so and so stock exhaust

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.879 
use it forever so and so stock exhaust
system<00:01:52.060> lower<00:01:53.060> setting<00:01:53.600> this<00:01:54.319> heat<00:01:54.619> shield

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:54.889 
system lower setting this heat shield

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:57.519 
system lower setting this heat shield
will<00:01:55.130> be<00:01:55.279> in<00:01:55.399> a<00:01:55.490> way<00:01:55.959> you<00:01:56.959> can<00:01:57.079> sort<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.409> get

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:57.529 
will be in a way you can sort of get

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:59.109 
will be in a way you can sort of get
around<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:57.920> like<00:01:58.039> it's<00:01:58.399> gonna<00:01:58.609> be<00:01:58.729> right<00:01:58.969> up

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
around it like it's gonna be right up

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.399 
around it like it's gonna be right up
against<00:01:59.509> it<00:01:59.600> stuff<00:01:59.840> you<00:01:59.990> might<00:02:00.109> be<00:02:00.229> able<00:02:00.289> to

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
against it stuff you might be able to

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.109 
against it stuff you might be able to
notch<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.619> out<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.310> make<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.700> fit<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.880> little

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
notch it out to make it fit a little

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.359 
notch it out to make it fit a little
cleaner<00:02:02.409> but<00:02:03.409> your<00:02:03.529> foot<00:02:03.799> when<00:02:04.279> you're

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
cleaner but your foot when you're

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.129 
cleaner but your foot when you're
resting<00:02:04.729> your<00:02:04.850> foot<00:02:05.119> unless<00:02:05.420> you're<00:02:05.600> farther

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:06.139 
resting your foot unless you're farther

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:08.290 
resting your foot unless you're farther
forward<00:02:06.529> on<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:06.889> almost<00:02:07.159> almost<00:02:07.490> heel<00:02:07.939> on<00:02:08.179> this

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
forward on it almost almost heel on this

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.290 
forward on it almost almost heel on this
thing<00:02:08.979> your<00:02:09.979> foot<00:02:10.280> your<00:02:10.520> heel<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:10.880> gonna<00:02:11.030> start

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
thing your foot your heel is gonna start

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.699 
thing your foot your heel is gonna start
hitting<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.690> right<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.200> this<00:02:12.319> area<00:02:12.500> right

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
hitting this right in this area right

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.050 
hitting this right in this area right
here<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:14.890> your<00:02:15.890> heel<00:02:16.099> will<00:02:16.340> be<00:02:16.459> like<00:02:16.700> right<00:02:16.910> up

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
here so your heel will be like right up

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.790 
here so your heel will be like right up
against<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:17.420> constantly<00:02:17.930> hitting<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:18.530> I

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
against this constantly hitting it so I

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.920 
against this constantly hitting it so I
chose<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.640> take<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.940> off<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.510> gives<00:02:20.660> me<00:02:20.780> more

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
chose to take it off that gives me more

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.690 
chose to take it off that gives me more
than<00:02:21.020> enough<00:02:21.230> room<00:02:21.470> because<00:02:21.770> all<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.490> plays

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
than enough room because all the plays

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.050 
than enough room because all the plays
right<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.120> here

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
right in here

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.150 
right in here
and<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.390> plan<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:24.750> getting<00:02:24.930> an<00:02:25.140> area<00:02:25.410> P<00:02:25.590> full

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
and I plan on getting an area P full

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.740 
and I plan on getting an area P full
exhaust<00:02:26.520> system<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:30.270> other<00:02:30.390> thing<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.720> noticed

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
exhaust system the other thing I noticed

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.420 
exhaust system the other thing I noticed
is<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.320> said<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.800> cut<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:34.170> hose<00:02:34.440> for<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
is it said to cut the hose for the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.970 
is it said to cut the hose for the
master<00:02:35.760> cylinder<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.570> rear<00:02:37.230> rear<00:02:37.740> brake

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
master cylinder for the rear rear brake

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.040 
master cylinder for the rear rear brake
I<00:02:38.280> didn't<00:02:38.910> have<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.150> cut<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.450> at<00:02:39.600> all<00:02:39.780> there

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
I didn't have to cut that at all there

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.320 
I didn't have to cut that at all there
still<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.620> mean<00:02:40.800> it's<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:41.100> kinking<00:02:41.670> if

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
still I mean it's not kinking if

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.130 
still I mean it's not kinking if
anything<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.320> think<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.459> rear<00:02:45.140> brake

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
anything I think that the rear brake

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.030 
anything I think that the rear brake
cable<00:02:46.530> itself<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.990> as<00:02:48.990> little<00:02:49.350> more<00:02:49.530> binded<00:02:49.950> I

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
cable itself is as little more binded I

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.810 
cable itself is as little more binded I
kind<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.310> wish<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:51.560> this<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:52.770> down<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.400> that

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
kind of wish this this one down so that

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.949 
kind of wish this this one down so that
might<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.000> able<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.300> be<00:02:54.420> fixed<00:02:54.720> with<00:02:54.870> some

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
might be able to be fixed with some

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.570 
might be able to be fixed with some
braided<00:02:55.320> lines<00:02:55.530> or<00:02:55.860> whatever<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.220> don't<00:02:56.489> know

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
braided lines or whatever I don't know

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.300 
braided lines or whatever I don't know
we'll<00:02:57.239> go<00:02:57.360> from<00:02:57.450> there<00:02:57.660> but<00:02:57.930> anyway<00:02:58.800> for<00:02:59.220> the

lower setting heat shields gonna be in

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.590 
lower setting heat shields gonna be in
your<00:03:09.900> way<00:03:10.820> other<00:03:11.820> than<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.090> if<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.270> use<00:03:12.420> the
