00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
does turn with the set so that's kind of

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.710 
does turn with the set so that's kind of
nice<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:05.649> have<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:06.090> very<00:02:07.090> large<00:02:07.299> flick

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
fire here I really like this kind

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.380 
fire here I really like this kind
because<00:02:10.450> they<00:02:10.690> shoot<00:02:10.959> so<00:02:11.380> so<00:02:11.680> well<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.390> you

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
because they shoot so so well and you

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:22.979 
because they shoot so so well and you
can<00:02:13.630> move<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.500> around<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:20.080> sides<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:21.989> the

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
can move this around the sides and the

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.009 
can move this around the sides and the
back<00:02:23.140> back<00:02:24.100> wheels<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.790> all<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.780> can

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
back back wheels and all and so you can

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.780

flip<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:29.800> over<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:31.080> have<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.790> different

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
flip it over and have a different

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.090 
flip it over and have a different
vehicle<00:02:34.209> back<00:02:34.780> here<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.769> said<00:02:38.799> the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
vehicle back here like I said the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.390 
vehicle back here like I said the
cockpit<00:02:39.940> turns<00:02:40.269> so<00:02:41.260> whatever<00:02:41.860> side<00:02:42.069> you<00:02:42.220> have

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
cockpit turns so whatever side you have

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.720 
cockpit turns so whatever side you have
up<00:02:42.640> is<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.150> side<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.950> cockpit<00:02:45.370> will<00:02:45.579> be

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
up is the side that the cockpit will be

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.039 
up is the side that the cockpit will be
up<00:02:46.090> on<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.980> anyway<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:52.390> is<00:02:52.510> pretty<00:02:52.720> much<00:02:52.840> all

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
up on so anyway that is pretty much all

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.199
