because<00:01:25.200> i'm<00:01:25.380> using<00:01:25.409> i<00:01:26.509> mean<00:01:27.509> all<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
because i'm using i mean all the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.520 
because i'm using i mean all the
enhancer<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.630> folder<00:01:30.630> enhancer<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.259> much

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
enhancer but folder enhancer is much

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.300 
enhancer but folder enhancer is much
better<00:01:31.799> than<00:01:32.900> infinite<00:01:33.900> folders<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:34.470> our

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
better than infinite folders because our

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.780 
better than infinite folders because our
multi<00:01:36.090> i<00:01:36.329> come<00:01:36.600> over<00:01:36.920> works<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.280> folder

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
multi i come over works with folder

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.480 
multi i come over works with folder
enhancer<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.540> doesn't<00:01:40.110> work<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.560> any

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
enhancer but doesn't work with any

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.749 
enhancer but doesn't work with any
folder<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:43.229> best<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.680> use<00:01:43.770> folder

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
folder so it's best to use folder

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.370 
folder so it's best to use folder
enhancer<00:01:46.670> like<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.820> said<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.750> could<00:01:48.899> disable
