do boats out of a cardboard and I did

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.539 
do boats out of a cardboard and I did
that<00:01:06.780> when<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> was<00:01:07.170> at<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> University<00:01:08.520> of

that when I was at the University of
Florida<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.659> when<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> taught<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.010> materials

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
Florida but when I taught the materials

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
Florida but when I taught the materials
and<00:01:11.820> construction<00:01:12.330> class<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> first

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and construction class for the first

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.520 
and construction class for the first
time<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.610> thought<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.479> my<00:01:15.630> students<00:01:16.259> could

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
time I I thought that my students could

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
time I I thought that my students could
do<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.009> little<00:01:17.549> bit<00:01:17.790> better<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.360> thought<00:01:18.659> that

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
do a little bit better I thought that

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.440 
do a little bit better I thought that
they<00:01:18.930> could<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.290> worlds<00:01:19.770> ahead<00:01:20.100> my<00:01:20.670> biggest

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
they could be worlds ahead my biggest

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.800 
they could be worlds ahead my biggest

activities to profession the teaching

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.410 
activities to profession the teaching
and<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> architecture<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.530> ultimate<00:01:34.530> joy

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420

Eureka<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:47.310> thought<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.729> was<00:01:47.909> very<00:01:48.270> unique

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
Eureka and I thought it was very unique

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.609 
Eureka and I thought it was very unique
in<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.909> sense<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.270> incidents<00:01:51.869> make<00:01:52.380> me<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
in the sense that incidents make me a

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.420 
in the sense that incidents make me a
mask<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.450> wear<00:01:54.689> many<00:01:55.170> masks<00:01:55.619> not

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
mask and we have to wear many masks not

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.029 
mask and we have to wear many masks not
only<00:01:56.790> at<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.659> university<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
only at the university but in the

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.219 
only at the university but in the
profession<00:01:59.700> so<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.240> thought<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.020> was

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
profession so I thought that it was

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.630 
profession so I thought that it was
great<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.970> mask<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:04.229> drink<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:05.130> conquer

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
great to have a mask to drink to conquer

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.040 
great to have a mask to drink to conquer
to<00:02:05.670> love<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.810> listen<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.289> speak<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.580> pure<00:02:09.050> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
to love to listen to speak to pure to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.720 
to love to listen to speak to pure to
find<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.560> many<00:02:13.769> roles<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.550> play<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:15.390> life
