00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
august 26th so where our last release I

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.890 
august 26th so where our last release I
made<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.890> limited-edition<00:00:22.890> pedal<00:00:23.779> called<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
made a limited-edition pedal called the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.290 
made a limited-edition pedal called the
poly<00:00:25.080> grace<00:00:25.380> which<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:25.920> kind<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.460> very

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
poly grace which was kind of a very

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.019 
poly grace which was kind of a very
weird<00:00:28.230> fuzz<00:00:28.680> pedal<00:00:29.039> did<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> lot<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:29.939> different

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
weird fuzz pedal did a lot of different

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.299 
weird fuzz pedal did a lot of different
things<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.929> decided<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.679> continue<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
things so I decided to continue the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.380 
things so I decided to continue the
tradition<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:36.050> for<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:38.030> release<00:00:39.030> I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
tradition and for this this release I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.930 
tradition and for this this release I
have<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> pedal<00:00:40.410> called<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.010> no<00:00:41.340> memory<00:00:41.670> which

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
have a pedal called the no memory which

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.729 
have a pedal called the no memory which
is<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> delay<00:00:42.480> pedal<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.960> I'm<00:00:43.379> going<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.620> just

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
is a delay pedal and I'm going to just

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.510 
is a delay pedal and I'm going to just
run<00:00:43.950> through<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> controls<00:00:44.579> real<00:00:45.270> quick<00:00:46.460> so<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
run through the controls real quick so I

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.840 
run through the controls real quick so I
recorded<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.090> short<00:00:48.930> loop<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.440> my<00:00:49.770> dl<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.460> with

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
recorded a short loop on my dl for with

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.130 
recorded a short loop on my dl for with
my<00:00:51.210> J<00:00:52.110> Mascis<00:00:52.350> Squire<00:00:53.250> jazzmaster<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.239> it's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
my J Mascis Squire jazzmaster and it's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.869 
my J Mascis Squire jazzmaster and it's
playing<00:00:55.410> through<00:00:55.770> my<00:00:55.949> silver<00:00:56.340> face<00:00:56.520> twin

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
playing through my silver face twin

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:12.719 
playing through my silver face twin
reverb<00:00:57.440> here's<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.680> loop

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.960 

so<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.820> pedals<00:01:14.119> on<00:01:14.240> right<00:01:14.420> now<00:01:14.450> but<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:16.909> can

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
so the pedals on right now but you can

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.950 
so the pedals on right now but you can
hear<00:01:17.500> that<00:01:18.500> now<00:01:18.920> it's<00:01:19.100> bypass<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.729> clean<00:01:20.630> slate

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
hear that now it's bypass to clean slate

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.249 
hear that now it's bypass to clean slate
clean<00:01:21.229> clean<00:01:22.130> signals<00:01:22.549> more<00:01:23.509> or<00:01:23.600> less<00:01:23.659> exactly

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
clean clean signals more or less exactly

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.990 
clean clean signals more or less exactly
the<00:01:24.350> same<00:01:26.170> there's<00:01:27.170> a<00:01:27.229> slight<00:01:27.500> boost<00:01:27.850> which<00:01:28.850> is

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
the same there's a slight boost which is

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.450 
the same there's a slight boost which is
also<00:01:29.180> available<00:01:29.600> on<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.259> delay<00:01:30.710> path<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.399> you

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
also available on the delay path so you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.749 
also available on the delay path so you
can<00:01:31.729> get<00:01:32.860> push<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.009> front<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.310> your<00:01:34.430> tube<00:01:34.580> amp

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
can get push the front of your tube amp

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.370 
can get push the front of your tube amp
or<00:01:34.940> whatever<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.759> controls<00:01:38.090> are<00:01:38.420> clean

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
or whatever so the controls are clean

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.260 
or whatever so the controls are clean
and<00:01:39.410> a<00:01:39.649> wet<00:01:39.830> volume<00:01:40.220> I<00:01:40.340> decided<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.789> forgo<00:01:41.149> the

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
and a wet volume I decided to forgo the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.469 
and a wet volume I decided to forgo the
master<00:01:41.600> volume<00:01:42.580> placing<00:01:43.580> this<00:01:43.729> I<00:01:43.910> felt<00:01:44.149> this

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
master volume placing this I felt this

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.550 
master volume placing this I felt this
was<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.690> little<00:01:44.929> more<00:01:45.170> useful<00:01:45.710> there's<00:01:46.700> also<00:01:46.940> a

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
was a little more useful there's also a

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.070 
was a little more useful there's also a
delay<00:01:48.560> time<00:01:49.270> feedback<00:01:50.950> an<00:01:51.950> amplitude

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
delay time feedback an amplitude

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.550 
delay time feedback an amplitude
controlled<00:01:54.369> modulation<00:01:55.780> on<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.840> delay<00:01:57.350> time

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
controlled modulation on a delay time

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.779 
controlled modulation on a delay time
and<00:01:57.800> a<00:01:58.729> tone<00:01:59.210> control<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.840> the<00:01:59.960> feedback<00:02:00.110> loop

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
and a tone control and the feedback loop

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.550 
and a tone control and the feedback loop
so<00:02:01.789> with<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.420> tone<00:02:02.600> control<00:02:02.960> in<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.320> brighter

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
so with the tone control in the brighter

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.440 
so with the tone control in the brighter
settings<00:02:04.039> and<00:02:04.460> you'll<00:02:04.880> get<00:02:05.030> more<00:02:05.240> feedback

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
settings and you'll get more feedback

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.180 
settings and you'll get more feedback
the<00:02:06.020> darker<00:02:06.319> settings<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:06.770> know<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:07.100> little

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
the darker settings you know a little

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.350 
the darker settings you know a little
less<00:02:07.399> feedback<00:02:07.759> so<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.030> need<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.269> adjust

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
less feedback so you need to adjust

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.490 
less feedback so you need to adjust
accordingly<00:02:08.959> i<00:02:09.200> also<00:02:09.800> have<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.069> lag<00:02:10.790> feature

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
accordingly i also have a lag feature

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.940 
accordingly i also have a lag feature
built<00:02:12.500> in<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:13.010> um<00:02:13.989> affects<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.230> delay<00:02:15.920> time

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
built in that um affects the delay time

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.330 
built in that um affects the delay time
sweep<00:02:16.549> so<00:02:16.940> when<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.180> turn<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.630> delay<00:02:18.019> knob

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
sweep so when you turn the delay knob

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.490 
sweep so when you turn the delay knob
it'll<00:02:19.340> kind<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.120> slowly<00:02:20.390> lag<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.049> catch<00:02:21.260> up

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
it'll kind of slowly lag to catch up

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.660 
it'll kind of slowly lag to catch up
just<00:02:22.070> like<00:02:22.280> older<00:02:22.640> like

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
just like older like

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.220 
just like older like
tape<00:02:24.420> tape<00:02:25.140> machines<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.840> space<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.020> code

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
tape tape machines and space that code

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.970 
tape tape machines and space that code
things<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:30.739> on<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.830> production

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
things like that and on the production

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.559 
things like that and on the production
model<00:02:32.640> there's<00:02:32.819> going<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.000> be<00:02:33.030> three<00:02:33.180> settings

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
model there's going to be three settings

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.180 
model there's going to be three settings
right<00:02:34.050> here<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.319> just<00:02:34.590> have<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.709> come<00:02:35.160> now

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
right here I just have to come now

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.850 
right here I just have to come now
because<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.180> don't<00:02:36.239> have<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.599> red<00:02:36.840> switch<00:02:37.080> so

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
because I don't have the red switch so

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.110 
because I don't have the red switch so
anyway<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.880> started<00:02:39.569> with<00:02:39.890> ad<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.880> delay

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
anyway I started with ad in the delay

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.370 
anyway I started with ad in the delay
signal<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:43.069> on<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:45.150> brightest<00:02:45.630> setting<00:02:45.840> no

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.360

repeats<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:48.080> shortest<00:02:49.080> until<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.440> time<00:02:49.650> you'll

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
repeats the shortest until a time you'll

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.100 
repeats the shortest until a time you'll
get<00:02:50.459> comb<00:02:50.700> filtering<00:02:53.269> in<00:02:54.269> all<00:02:54.450> these<00:02:54.599> high

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
get comb filtering in all these high

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.180 
get comb filtering in all these high
settings<00:02:57.200> which<00:02:58.200> when<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.800> add<00:02:58.950> some

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
settings which when you add some

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:10.270 
settings which when you add some
feedback<00:02:59.610> in<00:02:59.959> get<00:03:00.959> really<00:03:01.200> nice<00:03:01.319> residences

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.440 

here<00:03:11.280> I'm<00:03:11.370> going<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.549> roll<00:03:11.700> off<00:03:11.880> from<00:03:12.150> some<00:03:12.360> of

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
here I'm going to roll off from some of

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:32.020 
here I'm going to roll off from some of
the<00:03:12.510> high<00:03:12.600> end

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.160 

so<00:03:33.030> there's<00:03:33.209> all<00:03:33.629> sorts<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.019> beautiful

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
so there's all sorts of beautiful

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.680 
so there's all sorts of beautiful
textures<00:03:35.010> it's<00:03:35.610> like<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.659> are

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
textures it's like that that are

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.300 
textures it's like that that are
available<00:03:36.840> just<00:03:37.319> in<00:03:37.409> these<00:03:37.560> high<00:03:37.709> high<00:03:38.099> delay

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.100 
million times the filtering of the
repeats<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.489> look<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.269> lock<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.810> the

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.610 
repeats I look to the lock that the
memory<00:03:52.890> managed<00:03:54.049> to<00:03:55.049> live

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620

I<00:03:55.650> love<00:03:56.360> so<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.420> wanted<00:03:57.659> to<00:03:57.750> get<00:03:57.840> something<00:03:58.049> sort

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
I love so I wanted to get something sort

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.710 
I love so I wanted to get something sort
of<00:03:58.769> similar<00:03:59.010> it's<00:03:59.370> slightly<00:04:00.150> darker<00:04:00.599> than

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
of similar it's slightly darker than

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.030 
of similar it's slightly darker than
memory<00:04:01.409> man<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.040> has<00:04:02.250> tiny<00:04:02.970> bit<00:04:03.239> more<00:04:03.390> bass

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
memory man and has tiny bit more bass

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.720 
memory man and has tiny bit more bass
but<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.069> think<00:04:05.310> it's<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:07.340> little<00:04:08.340> bit<00:04:08.489> more

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
but I think it's a little bit more

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.820 
but I think it's a little bit more
pleasing<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.390> my<00:04:09.959> ear<00:04:10.170> at<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.409> spa<00:04:10.560> night<00:04:10.650> now

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
pleasing to my ear at the spa night now

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.680 
pleasing to my ear at the spa night now
that<00:04:11.040> i've<00:04:11.129> been<00:04:11.360> using<00:04:12.360> it<00:04:12.599> so<00:04:12.720> much<00:04:14.510> as<00:04:15.510> far

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
that i've been using it so much as far

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.650 
that i've been using it so much as far
as<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.870> delay<00:04:16.079> time<00:04:16.109> goes<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.650> can<00:04:16.769> get<00:04:16.919> into

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
as the delay time goes you can get into

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.219 
as the delay time goes you can get into
super<00:04:18.660> crusty<00:04:18.959> territory<00:04:19.709> which<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:21.780> just<00:04:22.109> a

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
super crusty territory which is just a

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.530 
super crusty territory which is just a
really<00:04:22.919> really<00:04:23.070> nice<00:04:23.280> texture

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
really really nice texture

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.420 
really really nice texture
he<00:04:25.290> had<00:04:25.380> lots<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.710> noise

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.460 

it's<00:04:28.669> you<00:04:29.479> know<00:04:29.600> someone<00:04:29.930> will<00:04:30.080> find<00:04:30.199> use<00:04:30.440> for

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
it's you know someone will find use for

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.290 
it's you know someone will find use for
that<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.699> think<00:04:31.729> it's<00:04:32.330> a<00:04:32.419> great<00:04:32.449> texture

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
that and I think it's a great texture

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.210 
that and I think it's a great texture
cut<00:04:35.300> it<00:04:35.419> out<00:04:35.509> with<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.930> tongue<00:04:36.500> control<00:04:36.800> so

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
cut it out with the tongue control so

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.790 
cut it out with the tongue control so
you<00:04:38.150> don't<00:04:38.419> even<00:04:38.509> hear<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.810> that<00:04:38.990> much<00:04:40.539> so<00:04:41.800> we

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
you don't even hear it that much so we

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.820 
you don't even hear it that much so we
show<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:43.220> lag<00:04:43.400> feature<00:04:43.759> now

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.860 

longer<00:04:50.430> setting<00:04:52.940> took<00:04:53.940> kind<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.390> second<00:04:54.720> and

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
longer setting took kind of a second and

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.560 
longer setting took kind of a second and
catch<00:04:55.110> up<00:04:55.290> there<00:04:56.600> shorter<00:04:57.600> setting<00:04:59.570> still

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
catch up there shorter setting still

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.770 
catch up there shorter setting still
does<00:05:00.720> it<00:05:00.900> but<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.140> doesn't<00:05:01.410> take<00:05:01.530> as<00:05:01.650> long<00:05:02.780> so

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
does it but it doesn't take as long so

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.380 
does it but it doesn't take as long so
now<00:05:03.900> I'll<00:05:04.050> just<00:05:04.110> show<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.800> modulation<00:05:08.390> which

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
now I'll just show the modulation which

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.050 
now I'll just show the modulation which
is<00:05:09.780> also<00:05:09.990> affected<00:05:10.440> by<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.590> lag<00:05:10.800> control<00:05:11.160> when

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
is also affected by the lag control when

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.280 
is also affected by the lag control when
you're<00:05:12.240> high<00:05:12.360> settings<00:05:12.780> you<00:05:12.990> can<00:05:13.050> get<00:05:13.260> a

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
you're high settings you can get a

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:35.810 
you're high settings you can get a
really<00:05:13.760> interesting<00:05:14.760> chorus<00:05:34.610> wishing<00:05:35.610> knows

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
really interesting chorus wishing knows

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.430 
really interesting chorus wishing knows
also<00:05:36.390> store<00:05:36.690> full<00:05:36.930> of<00:05:36.960> those<00:05:37.260> great

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
also store full of those great

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.690 
also store full of those great
residences<00:05:41.780> and<00:05:42.780> it's<00:05:43.590> just<00:05:43.740> a<00:05:43.860> bit<00:05:44.010> different

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
residences and it's just a bit different

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.010 
residences and it's just a bit different
chord<00:05:44.910> seven<00:05:47.030> normally<00:05:48.030> used<00:05:48.330> to<00:05:48.480> mean<00:05:48.630> so

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
chord seven normally used to mean so

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.550 
chord seven normally used to mean so
it's<00:05:49.770> not<00:05:49.860> just<00:05:49.920> the<00:05:50.280> stabbing<00:05:50.760> thing<00:05:51.560> going

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
it's not just the stabbing thing going

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.100 
it's not just the stabbing thing going
behind<00:05:52.710> you're<00:05:52.950> playing<00:05:53.220> it<00:05:53.840> play<00:05:54.840> with<00:05:54.870> it

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
behind you're playing it play with it

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.660 
behind you're playing it play with it
things<00:05:55.890> with<00:05:56.040> you<00:05:56.220> so

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:11.190 

poor<00:06:01.670> choice<00:06:01.910> of<00:06:02.030> words<00:06:09.220> you<00:06:10.220> can<00:06:10.370> resettle<00:06:10.760> to

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
poor choice of words you can resettle to

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.330 
poor choice of words you can resettle to

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:26.530 

modulation<00:06:19.340> gets<00:06:19.580> better<00:06:25.060> so<00:06:26.060> with<00:06:26.210> the<00:06:26.330> right

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
modulation gets better so with the right

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.830 
modulation gets better so with the right
right<00:06:27.080> settings<00:06:27.530> you<00:06:27.770> can<00:06:27.800> get<00:06:28.160> lost<00:06:29.150> tremolo

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
right settings you can get lost tremolo

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.740
