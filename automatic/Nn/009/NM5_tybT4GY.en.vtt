that's<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.900> better<00:01:40.110> post-workout<00:01:40.799> food<00:01:41.630> you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
that's the better post-workout food you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.350 
that's the better post-workout food you

acids without the middleman I'm not

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.080 
acids without the middleman I'm not
taking<00:02:46.950> full<00:02:47.160> proteins<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.670> having<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.940> break

taking full proteins and having to break
them<00:02:48.270> down<00:02:48.300> which<00:02:48.570> takes<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.840> lot<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.020> energy

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
them down which takes a lot of energy

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.320 
them down which takes a lot of energy
like<00:02:49.560> when<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:49.800> need<00:02:50.160> or<00:02:50.670> any<00:02:50.700> type<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.060> animal

create these digestive enzyme enzymes to

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.060 
create these digestive enzyme enzymes to

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
break this food down where it is when

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.890 
break this food down where it is when
you<00:02:59.190> get<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.670> amino<00:02:59.970> acids<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.540> fruits<00:03:00.750> and

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
you get the amino acids and fruits and

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.630 
you get the amino acids and fruits and
vegetables<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.160> absorb<00:03:02.489> them

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
vegetables you just absorb them

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.770 
vegetables you just absorb them
instantly<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.510> can<00:03:03.660> recover<00:03:04.019> so<00:03:04.940> fast<00:03:05.940> so

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
instantly and you can recover so fast so

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.210 
instantly and you can recover so fast so
the<00:03:07.290> whole<00:03:07.470> thing<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:07.800> where<00:03:08.010> do<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.100> get

your<00:03:08.280> protein<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.970> just<00:03:09.510> help<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.810> don't<00:03:10.019> eat

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
your protein I just help you I don't eat

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.550 
your protein I just help you I don't eat
any<00:03:10.290> protein<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:11.040> need<00:03:11.940> amino<00:03:12.209> acid<00:03:12.630> uh-huh<00:03:13.350> you

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
any protein I need amino acid uh-huh you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.670 
any protein I need amino acid uh-huh you
know<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.820> it's<00:03:15.060> like<00:03:15.239> I've<00:03:15.900> outperformed

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
know and and it's like I've outperformed

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.039 
know and and it's like I've outperformed
almost<00:03:16.920> every<00:03:17.280> single<00:03:17.459> person<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:18.269> like<00:03:18.840> in

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
America in the ultra distance so it's

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.420 
America in the ultra distance so it's

know forced hydration which is a huge

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.050 
know forced hydration which is a huge
huge<00:04:09.109> benefit<00:04:09.590> in<00:04:09.709> key<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.099> why<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.489> think<00:04:10.579> I<00:04:10.849> did

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
huge benefit in key to why I think I did

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.539 
huge benefit in key to why I think I did
so<00:04:11.239> well<00:04:11.389> eating<00:04:12.230> for<00:04:12.500> Terry<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:12.769> I<00:04:12.950> right

think is a great great tip this is a if

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.969 
think is a great great tip this is a if
you<00:05:32.880> if<00:05:33.120> instead<00:05:33.540> of<00:05:33.600> taking<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:34.139> pill<00:05:34.500> that's

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
you if instead of taking the pill that's

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.640 
you if instead of taking the pill that's
cap<00:05:35.250> pill<00:05:35.520> you<00:05:36.270> actually<00:05:36.720> let<00:05:36.990> it<00:05:37.020> dissolve<00:05:37.229> in

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
cap pill you actually let it dissolve in

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.640 
cap pill you actually let it dissolve in
your<00:05:37.800> water<00:05:38.070> bottle<00:05:38.490> and<00:05:38.750> when<00:05:39.750> this<00:05:40.110> way<00:05:40.260> you

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
your water bottle and when this way you

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.550 
your water bottle and when this way you
use<00:05:40.860> your<00:05:41.070> tongue<00:05:41.370> as<00:05:41.699> the<00:05:42.330> indicator<00:05:42.840> to

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
use your tongue as the indicator to

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.590 
use your tongue as the indicator to
whether<00:05:43.919> you<00:05:44.370> need<00:05:44.669> more<00:05:45.150> electrolytes

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
whether you need more electrolytes

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.330 
whether you need more electrolytes
because<00:05:46.080> if<00:05:46.320> you<00:05:46.530> eat<00:05:46.830> something<00:05:47.100> that's

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
because if you eat something that's

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.610 
because if you eat something that's
salty<00:05:47.850> and<00:05:48.060> it<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.690> you<00:05:48.750> and<00:05:49.080> it<00:05:49.229> tastes

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
salty and it and you and it tastes

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.010 
salty and it and you and it tastes
amazing<00:05:49.710> and<00:05:50.340> you<00:05:50.490> want<00:05:50.729> more<00:05:51.150> of<00:05:51.389> that<00:05:51.419> salty

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
amazing and you want more of that salty

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.640 
amazing and you want more of that salty
taste<00:05:53.030> then<00:05:54.030> you<00:05:54.330> definitely<00:05:54.750> need<00:05:55.139> more

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
taste then you definitely need more

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.890 
taste then you definitely need more
sodium<00:05:56.280> more<00:05:56.639> electrolytes<00:05:57.120> in<00:05:57.330> your<00:05:57.389> system

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
sodium more electrolytes in your system

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.659 
sodium more electrolytes in your system
whereas<00:05:58.470> if<00:05:58.560> you<00:05:58.620> just<00:05:58.770> take<00:05:58.860> a<00:05:58.889> pill<00:05:59.250> your

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
whereas if you just take a pill your

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.040 
whereas if you just take a pill your
tongues<00:06:00.000> not<00:06:00.180> gonna<00:06:00.360> give<00:06:00.660> you<00:06:00.720> any<00:06:00.840> feedback

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
tongues not gonna give you any feedback

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.320 
tongues not gonna give you any feedback
so<00:06:01.950> I<00:06:02.280> think<00:06:02.460> that's<00:06:02.790> something<00:06:02.970> a<00:06:03.180> lot<00:06:03.210> of

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
so I think that's something a lot of

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.510 
so I think that's something a lot of
people<00:06:03.570> could<00:06:04.410> benefit<00:06:04.770> on<00:06:04.950> is<00:06:05.130> actually

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
people could benefit on is actually

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.420 
people could benefit on is actually
tasting<00:06:06.210> the<00:06:06.750> salty<00:06:07.139> food<00:06:07.380> and<00:06:07.620> if<00:06:08.250> they

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
tasting the salty food and if they

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.310 
tasting the salty food and if they
really<00:06:08.789> like<00:06:09.150> it<00:06:09.389> then<00:06:09.660> that<00:06:09.840> means<00:06:09.900> they<00:06:10.200> need

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
really like it then that means they need

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.750 
really like it then that means they need
more<00:06:10.500> of<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:10.710> whereas<00:06:11.310> when<00:06:11.430> you<00:06:11.490> have<00:06:11.610> too

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
more of it whereas when you have too

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.830 
more of it whereas when you have too
much<00:06:11.910> salt<00:06:12.090> in<00:06:12.210> your<00:06:12.240> system<00:06:12.570> and<00:06:12.660> you<00:06:12.750> have

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
much salt in your system and you have

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.330 
much salt in your system and you have
something<00:06:13.110> salty<00:06:13.320> it<00:06:13.650> just<00:06:13.830> kind<00:06:14.010> of<00:06:14.070> tastes

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340
