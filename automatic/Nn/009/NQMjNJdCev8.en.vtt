unit<00:00:27.570> we're<00:00:28.570> replacing<00:00:28.809> that<00:00:29.110> today<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:31.000> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
unit we're replacing that today have the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.480 
unit we're replacing that today have the
plastic<00:00:32.920> harness<00:00:33.520> kit<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:34.600> antenna<00:00:34.989> and<00:00:35.490> then

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
plastic harness kit the antenna and then

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.700 
plastic harness kit the antenna and then
I<00:00:36.610> have<00:00:37.950> obviously<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.810> wiring<00:00:40.810> harness<00:00:41.170> so

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
I have obviously the wiring harness so

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.710 
I have obviously the wiring harness so
I'll<00:00:41.950> go<00:00:42.100> from<00:00:42.310> the<00:00:42.430> for<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:42.970> starters<00:00:43.360> all<00:00:43.600> it

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
just got clips and you'll just pry the

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:01.170 
just got clips and you'll just pry the
clips<00:00:52.390> off<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:58.750> we<00:00:58.870> go<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.550> it's<00:01:01.030> going<00:01:01.120> to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
clips off there we go and it's going to

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.569 
clips off there we go and it's going to
open<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.540> up<00:01:01.660> to<00:01:02.230> all<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.770> wiring<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.280> you're

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
open it up to all the wiring and you're

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.670 
open it up to all the wiring and you're
just<00:01:03.730> going<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:03.940> pretty<00:01:04.089> much<00:01:04.299> pull<00:01:04.960> apart<00:01:05.229> all

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
just going to pretty much pull apart all

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.530 
just going to pretty much pull apart all
the<00:01:05.799> clips<00:01:06.040> so<00:01:06.220> mostly<00:01:06.579> clips<00:01:06.820> are<00:01:06.970> easy<00:01:07.180> pry

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
the clips so mostly clips are easy pry

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.149 
the clips so mostly clips are easy pry
off<00:01:07.780> clips<00:01:10.470> they're<00:01:11.470> pretty<00:01:11.680> much<00:01:11.800> just<00:01:12.010> a

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
off clips they're pretty much just a

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.790 
off clips they're pretty much just a
simple<00:01:12.520> push<00:01:12.820> button<00:01:13.050> clip<00:01:14.050> off<00:01:14.229> but<00:01:14.590> as<00:01:14.710> you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
simple push button clip off but as you

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.380 
simple push button clip off but as you
can<00:01:14.920> see<00:01:15.070> this<00:01:15.190> one<00:01:15.400> here<00:01:15.670> if<00:01:16.090> you're<00:01:16.240> having

trouble all you do is you push this
little<00:01:18.490> component<00:01:18.790> right<00:01:19.450> there<00:01:19.659> you<00:01:19.870> push<00:01:20.080> it

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
little component right there you push it

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.760 
little component right there you push it
in<00:01:20.350> you'll<00:01:21.310> pull<00:01:21.549> this<00:01:21.700> back<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.320> then<00:01:26.590> it

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
in you'll pull this back and then it

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.740 
in you'll pull this back and then it
just<00:01:26.920> comes<00:01:27.100> right<00:01:27.250> out<00:01:27.400> so<00:01:28.330> that's<00:01:28.450> one<00:01:28.659> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
new one so once you have your seven mil

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.030 
new one so once you have your seven mil
just<00:01:49.260> start<00:01:50.260> them<00:01:50.350> bolting<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.830> like<00:01:50.979> so<00:01:53.040> all

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
just start them bolting it like so all

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:06.719 
just start them bolting it like so all
the<00:01:54.159> way<00:01:54.280> around

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.190 

there's<00:02:07.729> four<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:08.239> I<00:02:08.450> already<00:02:08.780> took<00:02:08.929> one<00:02:09.110> out

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
there's four but I already took one out

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.710 
there's four but I already took one out
at<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.440> bottom<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.970> once<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.270> pulled<00:02:11.480> all<00:02:11.600> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
at the bottom so once you pulled all the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.199 
at the bottom so once you pulled all the
screws<00:02:11.959> off<00:02:12.170> pretty<00:02:12.920> much<00:02:13.010> just<00:02:13.310> grab<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
screws off pretty much just grab the

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.420 
screws off pretty much just grab the
head<00:02:14.930> unit<00:02:15.140> out<00:02:15.380> it'll<00:02:16.010> have<00:02:16.250> its<00:02:16.280> whole

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
head unit out it'll have its whole

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.979 
head unit out it'll have its whole
wiring<00:02:19.430> back<00:02:19.640> here<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.330> have<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.540> just<00:02:20.720> unhook

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
wiring back here you have to just unhook

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.740 
wiring back here you have to just unhook
all<00:02:21.170> these<00:02:21.350> clips<00:02:21.620> they're<00:02:21.890> just<00:02:22.069> simple

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750
