00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
are being asked with this additional

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.740 
are being asked with this additional
workload<00:01:46.770> additional<00:01:47.610> cockpit<00:01:48.119> management

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
workload additional cockpit management

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.210 
workload additional cockpit management
with<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> pilots<00:01:49.320> having<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.799> manage<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810 
plane all the way down to the ground and
reduce<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> visibility<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.340> one<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
reduce the visibility is this one of the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.630 
reduce the visibility is this one of the
potential<00:01:54.240> factors<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.159> there<00:01:56.579> are

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
potential factors we know that there are

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.240 
potential factors we know that there are
a<00:01:56.670> lot<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.930> a320s<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> air<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.799> workhorse

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
a lot of a320s in the air the workhorse

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.399 
a lot of a320s in the air the workhorse
for<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.579> many<00:01:59.700> airlines<00:02:00.210> without<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.140> kind

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
for so many airlines without this kind

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.709 
for so many airlines without this kind
of<00:02:01.560> problem<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.159> two<00:02:02.909> incidents<00:02:03.420> even<00:02:03.630> if

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
of problem and two incidents even if

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.060 
of problem and two incidents even if
they<00:02:03.840> seem<00:02:04.049> related<00:02:04.320> are<00:02:04.710> by<00:02:04.890> themselves

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
they seem related are by themselves

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.130 
they seem related are by themselves
proof<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.969> nothing<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:06.930> still

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
proof of nothing but it's still

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.540 
proof of nothing but it's still
interesting<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.770> these<00:02:07.890> two<00:02:08.069> would<00:02:08.190> happen

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
interesting that these two would happen

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.580 
interesting that these two would happen
in<00:02:08.910> such<00:02:09.179> quick<00:02:09.360> succession<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:10.379> seem

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
in such quick succession and there seem

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.050 
in such quick succession and there seem
to<00:02:10.619> be<00:02:10.709> some<00:02:10.950> similarities<00:02:11.190> on

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
to be some similarities on

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.190 
to be some similarities on
other<00:02:12.209> thing<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.450> people<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.959> aviation

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
other thing that people in the aviation

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.630 
other thing that people in the aviation
community<00:02:13.440> are<00:02:13.950> pointing<00:02:14.220> out<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.520> know

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
community are pointing out is you know

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.750 
community are pointing out is you know
joanna<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:16.130> deals<00:02:17.130> with<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.400> airline

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
joanna is that deals with this airline

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.910 
joanna is that deals with this airline
and<00:02:18.030> potential<00:02:18.569> training<00:02:18.900> issues<00:02:19.170> yes<00:02:19.680> and

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
and potential training issues yes and

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.430 
and potential training issues yes and
again<00:02:20.130> we<00:02:20.510> literally<00:02:21.510> know<00:02:21.810> very<00:02:22.200> little

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
again we literally know very little

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.190 
again we literally know very little
tonight<00:02:23.069> but<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.910> accident<00:02:24.330> also<00:02:24.510> has<00:02:24.810> echoes

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
tonight but the accident also has echoes

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.670 
tonight but the accident also has echoes
of<00:02:25.230> another<00:02:25.680> Air<00:02:25.950> Asiana<00:02:26.250> incident<00:02:27.120> back<00:02:27.239> in

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
of another Air Asiana incident back in

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.559 
of another Air Asiana incident back in
2013<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:29.130> San<00:02:29.430> Francisco<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.269> is<00:02:30.420> where

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
2013 in San Francisco and that is where

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.350 
2013 in San Francisco and that is where
three<00:02:30.810> people<00:02:31.110> were<00:02:31.230> killed<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:32.360> ultimately

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
three people were killed and ultimately

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.360 
three people were killed and ultimately
the<00:02:33.510> US<00:02:33.720> investigators<00:02:34.140> concluded<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.010> it

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
the US investigators concluded that it

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.790 
the US investigators concluded that it
was<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.519> mismanagement<00:02:36.330> mismanaged<00:02:37.349> approach

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
was a mismanagement mismanaged approach

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.339 
was a mismanagement mismanaged approach
due<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.519> highly<00:02:38.819> automated<00:02:39.180> cockpit<00:02:40.170> that

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
due to a highly automated cockpit that

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.559 
due to a highly automated cockpit that
led<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.099> incident<00:02:41.489> so<00:02:41.700> basically<00:02:42.269> this

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
led to the incident so basically this

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.210 
led to the incident so basically this
airline<00:02:42.989> does<00:02:43.319> have<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> history<00:02:43.890> it's

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
airline does have a history it's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.920 
airline does have a history it's
training<00:02:44.670> program<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:44.970> history<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.420> having

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
training program a history of having

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.170 
training program a history of having
problems<00:02:46.560> with<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.400> pilots<00:02:47.760> taking<00:02:48.090> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
problems with the pilots taking the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.380 
problems with the pilots taking the
plane<00:02:48.420> down<00:02:49.549> hands-on<00:02:50.549> approach<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.209> in<00:02:51.299> this

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
plane down hands-on approach and in this

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.820 
plane down hands-on approach and in this
case<00:02:51.660> that's<00:02:51.930> exactly<00:02:52.470> what<00:02:52.590> they<00:02:52.680> would<00:02:52.769> have

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
case that's exactly what they would have

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.199 
case that's exactly what they would have
had<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.040> do<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.430> again<00:02:53.549> just<00:02:53.850> additional

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
had to do so again just additional

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.039 
had to do so again just additional
questions

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
questions

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.020 
questions
mechanical<00:02:55.739> failure<00:02:56.220> has<00:02:56.519> not<00:02:56.700> been<00:02:56.849> ruled

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030
