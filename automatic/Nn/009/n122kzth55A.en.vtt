this map recovery is really really good

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.610 
this map recovery is really really good
I'm<00:04:05.969> so<00:04:06.299> glad<00:04:06.479> that<00:04:06.629> they<00:04:06.870> made<00:04:07.049> a<00:04:07.079> map<00:04:07.379> that's

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
I'm so glad that they made a map that's

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.559 
I'm so glad that they made a map that's
different<00:04:08.009> like<00:04:08.189> this<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.639> split<00:04:09.030> up<00:04:09.120> into<00:04:09.299> two

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
different like this it split up into two

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.330 
different like this it split up into two
sides<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.229> halfway<00:04:10.560> through<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:11.039> game

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
sides and halfway through the game

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.640 
sides and halfway through the game
halfway<00:04:11.759> through<00:04:12.000> each<00:04:12.419> round<00:04:12.719> it<00:04:13.109> cuts<00:04:13.500> the

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
halfway through each round it cuts the

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.140 
halfway through each round it cuts the
map<00:04:13.829> in<00:04:14.039> half<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.519> switch<00:04:14.819> through<00:04:15.060> the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
map in half and you switch through the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.120 
map in half and you switch through the
other<00:04:15.359> side<00:04:15.810> so<00:04:16.079> there's<00:04:16.259> two<00:04:16.440> different<00:04:16.739> like

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
other side so there's two different like

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.770 
other side so there's two different like
maps<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.729> you<00:04:17.789> get<00:04:17.969> to<00:04:18.060> play<00:04:18.269> on<00:04:18.299> in<00:04:18.659> the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
maps that you get to play on in the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.240 
maps that you get to play on in the
single<00:04:19.139> game<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.680> think<00:04:19.859> that's<00:04:19.979> really

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
single game and I think that's really

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.920 
single game and I think that's really
cool<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.609> really<00:04:20.940> unique<00:04:21.090> thing<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.599> do<00:04:21.930> it's

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
cool a really unique thing to do it's

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.870 
cool a really unique thing to do it's
just<00:04:23.139> really<00:04:23.289> I<00:04:23.410> really<00:04:24.100> enjoyed<00:04:24.370> it<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.759> I

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
just really I really enjoyed it and I

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.700 
just really I really enjoyed it and I
enjoy<00:04:25.240> that<00:04:25.449> point<00:04:25.720> where<00:04:25.930> you're<00:04:26.080> rushing<00:04:26.620> to

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
enjoy that point where you're rushing to

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.590 
enjoy that point where you're rushing to
the<00:04:26.800> other<00:04:26.949> side<00:04:27.280> of<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.430> map<00:04:27.669> and<00:04:27.880> you<00:04:28.300> are<00:04:28.449> in

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
the other side of the map and you are in

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.810 
the other side of the map and you are in
that<00:04:28.750> situation<00:04:28.960> where<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.949> enemy<00:04:30.340> is<00:04:30.490> coming

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
that situation where the enemy is coming

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.520 
that situation where the enemy is coming
to<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.539> you<00:04:31.630> can<00:04:31.750> kind<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:31.990> pick<00:04:32.199> them<00:04:32.350> off

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
to and you can kind of pick them off

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.870 
to and you can kind of pick them off
while<00:04:32.740> they're<00:04:32.860> in<00:04:32.979> that<00:04:33.009> open<00:04:33.490> they're<00:04:33.699> just

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
while they're in that open they're just

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.830 
while they're in that open they're just
trying<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.090> get<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.419> other<00:04:34.539> side<00:04:34.660> of<00:04:34.780> the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
trying to get to the other side of the

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.469 
trying to get to the other side of the
map<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.199> they<00:04:35.350> don't<00:04:35.500> get<00:04:35.620> killed<00:04:35.860> by<00:04:36.400> the

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
map so that they don't get killed by the

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.430 
map so that they don't get killed by the
like<00:04:37.479> that<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.660> think<00:04:37.840> it's<00:04:37.930> like<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.050> volcano

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
like that I think it's like a volcano

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.290 
like that I think it's like a volcano
that<00:04:38.680> blows<00:04:38.830> everybody<00:04:39.280> up<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.880> I<00:04:40.000> think

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
that blows everybody up and I think

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.700 
that blows everybody up and I think
that's<00:04:40.419> really<00:04:40.630> cool<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:40.930> think<00:04:41.080> sledgehammer

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
that's really cool I think sledgehammer

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.620 
that's really cool I think sledgehammer
took<00:04:41.979> a<00:04:42.130> good<00:04:42.340> leap<00:04:42.699> of<00:04:42.880> faith<00:04:43.090> and<00:04:43.419> doing

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
took a good leap of faith and doing

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.999 
took a good leap of faith and doing
something<00:04:43.840> different<00:04:44.259> there<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:44.650> I'm<00:04:44.800> glad

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
something different there and I'm glad

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.499 
something different there and I'm glad
they<00:04:45.160> did<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.699> just<00:04:45.880> overall<00:04:46.120> advanced

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509
