00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.610
 Hello 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.210
 decided to shoot a short video lesson 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.210
 treatment 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.310
 So 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:26.750
 and countrywoman I liked this site 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:30.770
 its simplicity and its appearance that's it 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.100
 with a skull and of course practical 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.750
 value because firstly the strap is not 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.199
 bulky but at the same time very catchy 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:45.610
 when you get a knife out of your pocket for this 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:51.409
 lanyard it is really comfortable here 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:54.430
 the lanyard is very easy to lash them 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:01:02.449
 make different sizes smaller 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:07.070
 Now I will show how to do it as 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:11.000
 this pond make a piece about cordes needed 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.920
 completely small i can't say 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.400
 how much approximately, but now you yourself are all 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:21.400
 understand means showing how to weave 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.240
 first step 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:43.280
 Step 2 and then we just have these two 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:51.119
 remaining end of pass through 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:55.350
 holes formed alternately from 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:02:00.479
 of how many times we will sell 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.619
 these ends depend on the size of the strap or 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:08.729
 the node is the number of these rings 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:13.560
 here pay attention that this one 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:17.130
 more than this it just depends on 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.670
 How many times will I sell these ends 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:26.370
 that is, you can again and again and so 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:35.579
 further so now we just take it like this 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:38.040
 ends we end up second and here the most 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.220
 such a moment here if just tightens 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.940
 the lanyard does not work so you need it 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:49.650
 a little bit like this on this side 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:58.079
 tighten up and then tighten up 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:03:00.299
 end well here's something like that in 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.700
 Basically, I can tell you once again show 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.270
 to make it more clear 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.270
 wait a second 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.940
 So 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.510
 let's do a little more of it on 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.510
 this time 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.160
 do the same thing absolutely 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:03.420
 do more if enough now 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.420
 paracord should be enough 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:24.919
 but he can already do more 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.919
 one turn 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.870
 So 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:43.800
 here I am so big yet 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:50.610
 did you can get confused of course but how 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:54.389
 see everything is not difficult enough I would 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.569
 just said that you can wear 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:02.879
 some kind of bead skull over here and above 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:05.009
 something happens 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:08.430
 and very convenient to pull the knife out 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:14.159
 pockets so he doesn't own rai 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:19.379
 liked that and everything is so small 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:22.939
 video lesson on how it seems to me 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:26.939
 useful countryman 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:28.680
 fast is simple and most importantly everyone is comfortable 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:31.909
