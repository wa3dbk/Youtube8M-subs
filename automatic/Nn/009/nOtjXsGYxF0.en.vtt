00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.779
 holistic like they are right now in super 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.410
 super good today's video is a 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.719
 collaborative with my friend carlita that the 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.700
 her channel is chic clown that I'm going 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.190
 to leave your channel link here and 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.619
 but in the information box and 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.029
 We decided to do this collaborative 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.930
 5 labial dock for winter 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.270
 autumn-winter but it's a bit short 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.419
 for the winter so I 'm going to 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.279
 show the 5 labials that I chose 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.500
 if you are interested in knowing what my 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.899
 5 favorite lipsticks that let you know 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.410
 video the first one that I chose is one of 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:42.140
 request and is well used has left 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:48.140
 in several of my favorites and it's this 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:51.530
 caramel tone is the 151 toffee 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.070
 and I like it a lot because it's a 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.739
 neutral tone 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.020
 the whole range the cafes and they are not 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.910
 recharged and this I have occupied enough 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.160
 how can you appreciate why because 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.710
 I usually try to put on makeup 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.740
 quickest possible and leave my lips 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.229
 not very loaded not like now that I've 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.229
 walked on the lip wave super strong 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.970
 but I like it a lot because 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.759
 because if you recharge your eyes and you 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.500
 apply this lipstick fabric you do not see 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.690
 very loaded as if you were very 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.369
 makeup but if you leave a nice 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.380
 tone on the lips so this is my 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.440
 first anger that I'm going to show you is 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.710
 This lemon is a new line that 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.830
 came out of the ultra matte color 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.920
 this is the mate wine has no number that 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.600
 is the name of the labial and this is a 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.560
 very nice tone is like wine color 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.650
 burgundy and it's super nice this one of the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.710
 line mate eibar but so much mate 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.810
 it's not like nix mate lipsticks 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.530
 they leave you dry lips that are visible 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.380
 really dry this black is equal I know 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.590
 as it shines a little it does not have and does not 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.580
 is right not only that it leaves you 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.830
 that tone as well as juice cited in the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.730
 lips mind I like pretty 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.920
 ayestarán suárez 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.500
 I like it a lot because it lasts much longer 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.569
 of normal in their labials 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.849
 that normally will do well, I'll leave you 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.709
 lips last but this one does 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.900
 this usually lasted about two or 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.959
 three hours intact unless you 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.599
 bite your lips or eat something is going 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.629
 to leave but it has generally lasted 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.549
 me me pretty hard enough so 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.590
 he would recommend it if they see him in the 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.640
 catalog girls there is a variety more or 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.340
 less decent tonalities so I 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.620
 I recommend them is your third is one 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.390
 of pétriz me too and this one has become 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.480
 one of my favorites 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:59.210
 this is the 105 barry 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:02.090
 I love this lipstick it 's like a red 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.470
 intense but when bringing now in 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.260
 the lips 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.000
 I love I love this lip is 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.849
 Super super nice but it 's like a red 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.270
 dark like that is not a bright red is not a 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.550
 dark red is very very pretty 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.730
 I like it a lot this is also 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.790
 mate is well moisturizing it does not leave you 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.520
 dry lips and does not have any kind of 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.650
 satin shine is very nice the 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.260
 tone I like a lot and in which 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.210
 I'm bringing it now and if they realize 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.120
 I well marked lips and 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.120
 very natural eyes I practically have 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.950
 let's see I have my umbrella chilton 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.710
 kick me out and a little bit to mark the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.900
 basin but totally natural because 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.870
 the lips are strong enough not 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.150
 I want to look nice but I 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.220
 I recommend this life girls is super 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.120
 super good I quite like this up 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.710
 around 2100 2200 pesos and it's 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.500
 super strong so this is my third 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.680
 favorite and with lipstick this is already the 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.470
 I showed in the previous video the hall is 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.130
 the new line that took out petricio this is 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.590
 the 0-5 is almost 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.880
 and this also goes within the range of 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.890
 coffee and I really like this 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.750
 labial very much very much very much 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:30.750
 because it runs too easy 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.750
 wonderful 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.090
 special is like here 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.280
 I hope is that it is beautiful wake well 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.460
 There he had an accident if you see a 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.560
 God but I love I love that you 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.220
 they had useful for nothing to repeat me has it 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.230
 purchased the packaging is beautiful and 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.500
 It also goes within the range of coffee 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.120
 in case that same this tone is 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.180
 much stronger than the first one that 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.670
 I showed so they would also have to not 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.040
 I know neutralize my eyes a little and 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.170
 Mark your lips more so that you do not 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.930
 they look very very ornate like that 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.790
 they were too make-up but I 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.430
 they really like it if they can see the 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.770
 difference between is that I made them here with 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.440
 the one below is much clearer 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.990
 tof and request that this which is the 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:27.100
 almost and it's also a very cute lipstick 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.950
 and I would also recommend it and it's the 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.810
 fourth favorite of view the last and in 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:38.700
 fifth place but not for being less 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:44.840
 the way and wild that is the 965 cherry 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:47.639
 pinkin ss and these are either totally 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.380
 I live and because I show you these are 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.910
 Winter lipsticks means that 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.250
 it has to be a little more dull it is 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.010
 because I do not follow that rule at all or 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.560
 not because it's winter I'm not going 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.620
 to paint the colored nails does not hurt 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.300
 mint a fuchsia color on the lips I am 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.260

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.260

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:16.030
 It is a color as vivid as it looks cute 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.030
