you the key to separating chicken wings

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.499 
you the key to separating chicken wings
is<00:00:25.320> define<00:00:25.950> the<00:00:25.980> soft<00:00:26.340> spot<00:00:26.669> and<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.300> cut

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
is define the soft spot and a cut

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.850 
is define the soft spot and a cut
through<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> ligaments<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.469> cartilage

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
through the ligaments and cartilage

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.069 
through the ligaments and cartilage
versus<00:00:29.430> the<00:00:29.579> bone<00:00:29.730> think<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.540> this<00:00:30.660> wing<00:00:30.960> as

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
versus the bone think of this wing as

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.619 
versus the bone think of this wing as
your<00:00:31.230> lake<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.950> a<00:00:32.009> soft<00:00:32.489> spot<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.120> below<00:00:33.450> your
