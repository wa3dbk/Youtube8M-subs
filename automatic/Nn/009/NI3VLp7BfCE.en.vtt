on<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> comic<00:01:38.400> level<00:01:38.610> although<00:01:38.939> I'm<00:01:39.390> sort<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
on a comic level although I'm sort of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.170 
on a comic level although I'm sort of
pretty<00:01:40.020> outspoken<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.680> well<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:41.400> I've

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
pretty outspoken as well you know I've

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.630 
pretty outspoken as well you know I've
not<00:01:42.479> spent<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.200> lot<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.380> time<00:01:43.710> censoring<00:01:44.460> myself

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
not spent a lot of time censoring myself

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.060 
not spent a lot of time censoring myself
and<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> think<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:45.530> part<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.710> why<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> chose

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and I think that's part of why I chose

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.850 
and I think that's part of why I chose
to<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.490> an<00:01:47.579> artist<00:01:48.200> but<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.259> suppose<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.710> he's

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
to be an artist but I suppose if he's

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.010 
to be an artist but I suppose if he's

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
and it became a story that wasn't just

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.650 
and it became a story that wasn't just
mine<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.830> end<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.910> response<00:02:33.330> -<00:02:33.510> it's

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
mine in the end and the response - it's

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.190 
mine in the end and the response - it's
been<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.260> massive<00:02:35.420> from<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.570> media<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
been so massive from the media to the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.860 
been so massive from the media to the
public<00:02:37.550> it's<00:02:38.550> been<00:02:38.820> incredible<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.660> saw

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
public it's been incredible and I saw

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.140 
public it's been incredible and I saw
they<00:02:39.990> had<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> feeling<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.740> had<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> hope<00:02:41.220> when<00:02:42.120> I

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
they had a feeling I had a hope when I

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.140 
they had a feeling I had a hope when I
finished<00:02:43.020> writing<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.470> when<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.680> pressed<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
finished writing it when I pressed the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.699 
finished writing it when I pressed the
key<00:02:45.390> down<00:02:45.570> for<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.870> last<00:02:45.990> time<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.350> just

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
key down for the last time I just

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.770 
key down for the last time I just
thought<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.850> going<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.060> mean<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.510> lot<00:02:48.750> to

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
thought this is going to mean a lot to

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.780 
thought this is going to mean a lot to
people<00:02:48.989> other<00:02:49.440> than<00:02:49.500> just<00:02:49.830> me<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.220> my<00:02:50.340> family

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
people other than just me and my family

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.060 
people other than just me and my family
and<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.780> think<00:02:52.050> that's<00:02:52.230> why<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.470> chose<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.890> do<00:02:53.010> it

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
and I think that's why I chose to do it

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.160 
and I think that's why I chose to do it
in<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.310> end<00:02:53.400> because<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.120> was<00:02:54.930> something

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
in the end because it was something

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.979 
in the end because it was something
beneficial<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.400> others<00:02:57.030> not<00:02:57.209> just<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.690> me<00:02:57.810> it

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
beneficial to others not just to me it

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.530 
beneficial to others not just to me it
wasn't<00:02:58.170> just<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.530> vanity<00:02:58.739> project<00:02:59.070> and<00:03:00.000> what

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.550 
that have had similar stories to tell
mine<00:04:11.760> was<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.150> little<00:04:12.299> bit<00:04:12.720> more<00:04:12.930> complicated

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
mine was a little bit more complicated

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.910 
mine was a little bit more complicated
but<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.130> outcome<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:15.720> an<00:04:16.229> outcome<00:04:16.530> that

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
but the outcome is an outcome that

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.290 
but the outcome is an outcome that
women<00:04:17.310> unfortunately<00:04:17.850> have<00:04:17.940> had<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.090> lot<00:04:18.270> of

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.300 
women unfortunately have had a lot of

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.920 
women unfortunately have had a lot of
families<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.020> put<00:04:19.260> men<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.310> there<00:04:20.520> also<00:04:21.390> because

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
families I put men in there also because

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.570 
families I put men in there also because
it's<00:04:22.110> a<00:04:22.200> massive<00:04:22.560> loss<00:04:22.770> for<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.040> man<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.490> I

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
it's a massive loss for a man and I

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.280 
it's a massive loss for a man and I
suppose<00:04:23.910> in<00:04:24.120> many<00:04:24.360> ways<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.660> bigger<00:04:25.050> loss

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
suppose in many ways a bigger loss

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.840 
suppose in many ways a bigger loss
because<00:04:25.830> they<00:04:26.670> don't<00:04:26.910> have<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.360> privilege<00:04:27.810> of

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
because they don't have the privilege of

because they don't have the privilege of

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
that whether we choose to admit it or

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.560 
that whether we choose to admit it or

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
loss and grief and it might not be in

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.210 
loss and grief and it might not be in
the<00:05:39.630> forms<00:05:39.960> of<00:05:40.080> death<00:05:40.320> for<00:05:40.590> some<00:05:40.770> people<00:05:41.100> it

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
the forms of death for some people it

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.720 
the forms of death for some people it
might<00:05:41.400> be<00:05:41.460> innocence<00:05:42.150> or<00:05:42.390> dreams<00:05:43.140> or

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
might be innocence or dreams or

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.050 
might be innocence or dreams or
relationships<00:05:44.730> but<00:05:45.720> we<00:05:46.260> all<00:05:46.440> suffer<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.100> I

relationships but we all suffer and I

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.580 
relationships but we all suffer and I
think<00:05:48.300> it's<00:05:48.420> about<00:05:48.750> how<00:05:48.990> we<00:05:49.050> recover<00:05:49.410> from

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
think it's about how we recover from

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.580 
think it's about how we recover from
that<00:05:49.890> ultimately<00:05:50.690> absolutely<00:05:51.690> and<00:05:51.900> we're

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
that ultimately absolutely and we're

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.280 
that ultimately absolutely and we're
into<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:52.980> happy<00:05:53.340> part<00:05:54.030> again<00:05:54.420> yes<00:05:54.960> some
