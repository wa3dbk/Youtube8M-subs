I<00:03:23.970> think<00:03:24.180> that's<00:03:24.329> what<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.570> needs<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.900> think<00:03:25.109> you

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
I think that's what it needs I think you

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.160 
I think that's what it needs I think you
know<00:03:25.859> you<00:03:25.920> can<00:03:26.250> cover<00:03:26.549> up<00:03:26.670> flaws<00:03:27.570> in<00:03:27.810> your<00:03:27.900> game

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
know you can cover up flaws in your game

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.500 
know you can cover up flaws in your game
if<00:03:28.380> it's<00:03:28.620> just<00:03:28.859> mindless<00:03:29.549> hectic<00:03:30.030> fun<00:03:30.269> and

that's what I think this game mode will
be<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.310> that's<00:03:32.459> what<00:03:32.579> I<00:03:32.640> think<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.239> game<00:03:33.420> will

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
be and that's what I think the game will

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.090 
be and that's what I think the game will
