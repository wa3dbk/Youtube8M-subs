Drivingitalia.net presents: ARC_Team special
Episode 1 - Carbon Sequential Gear

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Drivingitalia.net is today in ARC_Team, at Pavia. We are with Stefano Pianoterra.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.900
Stefano, first of all... Good morning but, please, let you present yourself!

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.700
Good morning to everyone, specially the simracers who's coming from worldwide forums (including Drivingitalia.net)

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.589
Now I talk you about our new product: the Carbon Sequential Shifter

00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:38.085
This is one of the latest prototype but I can start to explain something about

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Actually this is the only one shifter in the market able to reproduce every kind of feeling...

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm talking about the typical feeling when you engage or disengage the gears like real cars

00:00:53.298 --> 00:01:00.298
The hardness of the "click" can be set through the spring plungers and adjusting the two striker blocks

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:06.642
You can do many settings but, for now, they are not included in the instructions

00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:14.022
and they are not covered by warranty, you do everything on own risk

00:01:14.822 --> 00:01:21.322
These kind of settings are extremely hard. For this reason is needed the necessary experience but...

00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:26.422
...you can try removing the seals. Remember: it could cause potential risks on electronics and you loose the warranty

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So... You told for the customer who wants made made modify position of this...

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:41.600
Making a simulation of shifting, before shifting up, we have a "dead zone" then the gear engage rightly

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.100
and you can feel the force of return to 0. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.500
The dead zone on center is adjusted during the  production and the lever's hardness setting

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.550
is the only regulation authorized by the warranty conditions.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The hardness engagement / disengagement is set tightening or loosening the spring splungers in both sides.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.200
So... When I did the test before, I tested the final version of this shifter into your GT car simulator...

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.500
 ..I've drove a Ferrari 458..

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.300
Yes.. The 458 haven't this kind of gearbox but it has the shift paddles behind the wheel. It's only for this test...

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:35.200
I'm enjoying, guys... a lot! And I can tell you, this is a fantastic shifter, really different from the others available on marketplace

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.600
because you have a great and "direct" feeling having big precision and so...

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.000
one of the most important things regarding your shifter is, when you drive, you forgot to shift

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.100
because, in your hand, you feel the same mechanical resistance that you have in a real race car

00:02:54.616 --> 00:02:59.620
not only when you engage/disengage the gear but also in the software!  

00:03:01.252 --> 00:03:08.250
That's right. Our target was to follow a different unique way, do something really different. Lot of competitor's shifters have the "click" sound

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
without too much resistance from the lever. We built an inside mechanical system that replicates the typical clutch gear.

00:03:15.506 --> 00:03:24.510
Please explain me one thing: during the downshift, you pull the lever stronger than the upshift

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:33.100
My feeling was very similar to have a real car transmission in my hands. How can you explain this?

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:44.800
Thanks a lot of time spent into the project, we made a standard settings focused to have the best feeling during the engagement of the gear...

00:03:44.873 --> 00:03:48.570
but, don't forget the center return of the lever.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:57.350
We made a patent internal transmission. Our solution supplies a perfect alignment of the lever at point 0. 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.380
Every time you release the lever, avoiding any kind of oscillation in both ways. Every time you release the lever, it stops!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
In this way you avoid potential troubles of double 
shifts being always precise

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.000
without any kind of oscillation and double shifts during the virtual races

00:04:14.578 --> 00:04:22.080
Yes, I seen you have a full control of the shifting, also when you use the shifter very fast or very hard

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000
In any case, if you keep the lever or you push it very hard it comes back ever without strange moves.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.300
One question: is it possible to change a knob? And the lever?

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.900
This is the basic lever and the standard height. Yes of course, you can change the knob

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
We are SPARCO Official reseller and, as optional, will be possible to install every kind of SPARCO knob

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
but, it's really important to know, the Carbon Sequential Gear will be direct supplied

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:06.500
with a lever extension of 35 mm. It isn't an option: it will be included for anyone want an higher lever

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.500
The version we tested before was higher...

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.200
Yes... That version has a SPARCO T-Rex knob

00:05:13.431 --> 00:05:20.830
so the lever height may depends by the mount position of the shifter on your own frame/table...

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.500
Obviusly, a longer lever changes the feedback received from the shifter...

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.830
...so... a short lever is recommended for formula car with a tight shift time and less travel of the lever...

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.200
.. a long lever is recomended for GT and Rally cars.
