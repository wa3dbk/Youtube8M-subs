00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.639
 new video from max because it de 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.490
 today it's about the jungle 33 31 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.769
 surfstick that is loud clock at the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.310
 smallest surfstick which is up to date 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.650
 the world is there to buy and you do not 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.000
 because this is where ultra stick meets 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.570
 sometimes quite the same again 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.010
 will see 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.150
 because he is really small to the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.219
 technical data short we have here 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.130
 a seven millimeter thin device 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.340
 a seven millimeter thin surfstick 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.950
 umts of course, and gsm umts with 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.540
 hspa plus with up to 21 6 megabits in the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.920
 download 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.079
 july channel or lte will not be 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.910
 supports 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:54.090
 It comes naturally to it clearly 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.020
 and this huawei sacred feature was me 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.500
 you also ever before in the blog presented 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.910
 So you did not have an extra 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.590
 installation of software or second 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.090
 From the pc you need to climb the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.939
 surfstick easy on and after a short time 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.100
 time when the drivers are installed 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.510
 that happens on its own then 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.310
 just open in the browser window 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.200
 you enter the pin if you have one 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.869
 have on the sim card and you cook? Yes 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.369
 not on the internet it works 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.939
 mac os and also windows 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.280
 I have with windows 7 64 bit and with 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.380
 mac os tastes works wonderfully 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:32.579
 and as I said everything very fast online 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:38.579
 Let's have a look for something nice 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:41.240
 here we directly the surfstick and here 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.189
 Below we have quick start guide 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.899
 and one more safety information both 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.759
 in english the surfstick is up to date 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.579
 not available in Germany yet 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.060
 test report then do you see when the 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.700
 will be available and if and where yes and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.100
 then we have the surfstick directly 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.479
 he looks it is extremely small here 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.130
 even this ultra stick on the back 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.350
 Back only wines on the back 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.350
 otherwise no branding of course everything 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.539
 original software from huawei and 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.340
 yes we have the usb connection is 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.870
 no full-time usb connection but so 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.739
 a kind of cut usb connection 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.120
 but of course full 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.790
 functional and in every normal 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.709
 standard usb connection also usable 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.540
 we put the sim card here 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.550
 make this flap here and then 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.590
 Let's see how nice that really is 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.989
 So there comes the sim card the rhine 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.270
 and I just go with it now 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.940
 times an ultra card from vodafone to 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:41.040
 Ultra stick fits very well 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.300
 and yes as the show then then 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.120
 I'll give you a quick look like that on the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.850
 macbook looks like that fits perfectly 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.170
 the size of ultrabooks so will 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.970
 that also thought of huawei stuck there 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.830
 we'll go in here and it really will be 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.060
 long not so big not as fat as 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.060
 like the ultrabook so we see so 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.700
 already a flashing surfstick that 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.930
 means network is being searched and me 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.150
 put that a bit spicy now 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.400
 here 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.489
 we already saw vodafone was connected 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.470
 no pin on it after a few seconds 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.370
 15 20 customers are immediately on the net and 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.819
 can then directly here 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.010
 surfing is from the speed here 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.110
 just simple hspa plus that's you 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.760
 can not the extremely high data rates 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.989
 expect however for the normal 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.739
 open up and so on should everyone 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.180
 sufficient 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.190
 I can tell you once briefly a vodafone 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.840
 map certainly does not show the best 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.069
 they also do not receive the best 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.170
 but yes 58 million ping can be 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.080
 see what new megabit im 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.019
 I already have download and upload 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.760
 about 4 megabits reached now too 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.950
 again well above 1 megabit almost 2 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.299
 megabit so to surf absolutely 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.500
 adequate and just for 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.599
 Ultrabooks wonderfully suitable if you 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.099
 surf walls then you need them 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.549
 Do not do anything here yourself 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.680
 pull out again and now I show 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.380
 Just the biggest comparison to you 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.720
 a normal stick that is normal 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.750
 So for an Lte stick zb there we have 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.560
 here the huawei 3276 so that can beside 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.520
 hpa h plus and so in the net really 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.350
 a little faster 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.810
 but who does not need that 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.210
 can really pick up cheap here 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.370
 because it would receive it from me 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.080
 say almost similar to the big del 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.639
 e3 2006 is a very small bit 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.810
 better 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.330
 Of course , there is one too 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.190
 Giant difference of the size and before 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.780
 especially if you look at someone from the 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.260
 thick ago that's half as thick 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:50.310
 again big lte stick and priced 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.280
 he will probably be the e3 3 1 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.870
 I think was a nonsense 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.160
 336 maniche was also the predecessor one 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.280
 relatively thinner but not quite so thin 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.830
 And that has at least about 50 euros 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.229
 costs it think the e3 3 1 will be too 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.680
 not much more expensive yes so 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:10.130
 much to the courbet 331 the smallest surf 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.130
 stick the world
