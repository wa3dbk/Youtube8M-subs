 hour and a half ago an hour ago and 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.170
 half to see two hours if we are 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.700
 really deep in the pool 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.800
 to be at the foot of the heights they have 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.150
 difficulties this hallway it is rather 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.970
 it is rather at the bottom of the basin of the blow 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.260
 we got it so it must be 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.730
 should be around 10:30 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.410
 and 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.210
 it was something that was spotted because 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.500
 we were in the corner was also 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.780

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.090
 locate take our time see that we have 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.520

 knows well and who does before the 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.090
 others behind to rest and then that 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.260
 turn a bit like that so it goes ahead 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.420
 pretty fast way those who are behind 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.740
 are in the trace they arrive they 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.570

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.580
 pretext good teams do that rest 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.910

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.070
 unevenness in a slope which is also 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.390
 the 45 50 and for the specialists of the 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.270
 quotation of what is not too much our 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.720

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.640

 we could say 5 3 3 or 4 in the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.540
 technical jargon that will speak will 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.790
 initiated good snow conditions in 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.570
 found in even down the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.520
 sunny part 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.340
 well it's a little more moving but the 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.350
 rest it was rather snow as close 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.690
 we did not get we did not get bac 2 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.890
 places that will unfortunately I had small 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.120
 places we wondered how that 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.860
 was going to pass the mons well to scratch a 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.570
 little bit of the board but no longer because 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.650
 that it was rock game is despite 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:04.790
 not everything to remember his reminder in any 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.890
 with the tiny chimney of the balat 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.689
 tom to duck the board though rock 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.989
 did put on his own anyway we can 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:14.599
 to say that you pass boards to yes 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.060
 it's true we put a little bit of 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.489
 Toyota recalls limit of 10 of 10 m 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.359

 who are spoiled and who have the 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.640
 chance to go for a walk in 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.870
