00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.779
 we were talking to with and is 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.940
 looking a little bit because he said this 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.519
 this is how we are in the expo recording 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.519
 early but now they start 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.170
 to fall down the leg one tries to 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.779
 hurry but good they will see all the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.960
 expo look how nice today is like a 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.109
 review of everything as if a review of what 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.539
 which was this year that from the beginning 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.550
 no thank you thank you for also giving us the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.239
 opportunity to prove it but 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.150
 basically work let's say the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.920
 objective was to emphasize the 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.339
 transparencies and that is achieved with 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.769
 fine papers like napkins with 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.920
 varnishes with special paints that are 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:49.379
 liquid without playing with the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.780
 different backgrounds and that each fund will 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.309
 suggests something let's talk about each one 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.089
 of the techniques so that really 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.019
 you can see this technique is 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.180
 awesome let's describe it a 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.660
 little to be seen because there are as 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.930
 enough 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.290
 6 secrets are actually part of a 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.410
 dark background yes that is achieved with a 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.540
 critical then you apply it with a 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.910
 paddled spatula any this is a 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.460
 design of a mural stencil when that 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.890
 dry you complete the design with pleasure 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.170
 in this case white drop so it's all 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.060
 what this thread and tell Him 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.190
 Once both these two are dry 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.920
 materials is patinated 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.500
 transparent with varnish to water and this 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600
 paint now because I see gray a little bit 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.820
 and a little bit use all kinds of colors 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.250
 the gray and the rosary that were super 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.869
 so I think I'll spectacular 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.210
 lift a little bit like they will go 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.789
 watching for when he describes it because 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.910
 we wanted to do this review so that what 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.860
 see the blue easier clear this is a 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.460
 sub two blue actually violet and 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.619
 Blue pigeon with good mix load 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.550
 of these these liquid paintings with the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.229
 varnish and having previously given a 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.660
 white base with acrylic when buzz 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.950
 color and access and the dried 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.950
 immediately crack the a 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.739
 I also love this story 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.400
 need as the color difference 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:22.120
 strange clear good that there is much of a 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.090
 background napkin itself that after you 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.640
 pass with your fingers a color of like and 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.470
 then the issue of inducing is also that 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.709
 I wanted to comment because people have 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.930
 seen in all the exhibits and these 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.030
 works went all over the country and these 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.819
 as I say next to nature because 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.849
 It really is all nature 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.370
 inspire nature so much 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.180
 like nature helps you 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.890
 inspire 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.069
 let's say I was in contact with the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.069
 nature 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.010
 good in this case the difference that 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.950
 has with the other works is that the 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.800
 add alan a reason with the mine it 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.170
 occupy yes and see that always 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.230
 feel part that sees base here that is 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.690
 napkin paper paper napkin 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.960
 this is the mine for de cubana for de 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.450
 occupy after you have the endo with 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.270
 stencil that is that it gives relief and 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.780
 gout management and integration with 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:29.390
 these bright pages I wanted to show 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.390
 this as last before closing because 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.180
 It is a beauty 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.920
 but it's not like that 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.379
 It has brightness, it shines because I see 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.019
 chose to count in this case there 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.700
 Overlay of different colors with 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.590
 the same mix that I always say the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.590
 glossy water varnish and colors 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.560
 but in the end when everything is in spite 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.629
 I already gave him a good charge nothing 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.310
 more than very bright water varnish 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.340
 well it 's there we are in the exhibition 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.530
 Today, people are starting to come 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.810
 so we still have to follow 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.510
 closing but I wanted to be with the one 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.090
 really this whole year and it's over 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.220
 for being so another artist 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.010
 person and everything but is a plastic artist 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.199
 and you are playing with an image that is 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.440
 own that an artist has to do 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:23.889
 find a synthesis so that people 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.630
 recognize your image and she is 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:33.240
 achieving and the truth that I think that 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:33.240
 it's very encouraging 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.409
 and plastic artist that best mini to everything 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.429
 barbarous all value but you have to have 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:46.739
 a synthesis then of the work all 

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:48.440
 all goes well in which we have to 

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:53.210
 recognize 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.020
 all thanks and hopefully revenge 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.020
 packaged 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.099
 plante has a very complete range 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.199
 products for painters 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.479
 better with that acrylics and for fabrics 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.180
 accessories extensible varieties and 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:28.030
 Ninth water varnishes are models in 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.780
 Napkins complete the artistic line 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.780
 of technical plan
