two things that affect our endurance how
loud<00:00:18.960> am<00:00:19.170> i<00:00:19.260> playing<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.859> how<00:00:19.980> high<00:00:20.220> am<00:00:20.400> I

playing because other things that tend
to<00:00:22.380> innovate<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.890> use<00:00:23.490> more<00:00:23.789> energy<00:00:24.410> but<00:00:25.410> you

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
to innovate you use more energy but you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.259 
to innovate you use more energy but you
know<00:00:25.680> our<00:00:25.769> endurance<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.490> often<00:00:26.670> limited

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
know our endurance is not often limited

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.349

there's no free lunch and what it means

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.709 
there's no free lunch and what it means
is<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> can't<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.850> anything<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.329> nothing

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
is you can't have anything for nothing

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
you and the reason I want you to think

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.069 
you and the reason I want you to think
about<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.820> more<00:01:33.090> energy<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.689> want<00:01:33.900> to

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
about that is the more energy we want to

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.859 
about that is the more energy we want to
create<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.560> louder<00:01:34.979> sound<00:01:35.130> has<00:01:36.030> more<00:01:36.329> energy<00:01:36.540> in

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.560 
create a louder sound has more energy in
it<00:01:36.990> we<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.040> put<00:01:38.250> more<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.180> might<00:01:39.360> say

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
it we have to put more in you might say

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.149 
it we have to put more in you might say
well<00:01:39.750> that's<00:01:39.900> obvious<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.560> I'll<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.890> blow

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
well that's obvious and I'll just blow

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.920 
well that's obvious and I'll just blow
harder<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.909> know<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> work<00:01:42.600> harder

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
harder you know I have to work harder

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.420 
harder you know I have to work harder
with<00:01:43.049> my<00:01:43.170> lips<00:01:43.350> when<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.530> want<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> play<00:01:43.950> hi<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
with my lips when I want to play hi and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.319 
with my lips when I want to play hi and
get<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.700> great<00:01:45.000> sound<00:01:45.680> yes<00:01:47.000> but<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
get that great sound yes but for the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.109 
get that great sound yes but for the
energy<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.840> we<00:01:48.960> create<00:01:49.430> 100<00:01:50.430> percent<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
energy that we create 100 percent of it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.810 
energy that we create 100 percent of it
comes<00:01:51.630> from<00:01:51.750> our<00:01:51.930> body<00:01:52.200> how<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.070> divided

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
comes from our body how is it divided

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.429 
comes from our body how is it divided
and<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> thing<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.990> want<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.259> talk

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
and that's the thing I want to talk

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.280 
and that's the thing I want to talk
about<00:01:55.619> because<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> do<00:01:56.939> more<00:01:57.270> work<00:01:57.630> with

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
about because if you do more work with

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.440 
about because if you do more work with
one<00:01:58.560> part<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.070> body<00:01:59.250> that<00:02:00.030> means<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
one part of your body that means the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.230 
one part of your body that means the
other<00:02:00.600> part<00:02:00.930> only<00:02:01.829> needs<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.399> less<00:02:02.640> because

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
other part only needs to do less because

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.280 
other part only needs to do less because
you<00:02:03.329> don't<00:02:03.509> need<00:02:03.689> more<00:02:03.869> than<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.079> hundred

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
you don't need more than a hundred

percent okay I'm sure you've had a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.520 
percent okay I'm sure you've had a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
bandura course I wanted to give more

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.919 
bandura course I wanted to give more
than<00:02:07.619> 100<00:02:07.920> percent<00:02:08.190> at<00:02:08.310> 110%<00:02:08.849> every<00:02:09.239> one<00:02:09.450> not

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
necessary 100 will be fine here's what

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.760 
necessary 100 will be fine here's what
we<00:02:12.989> do<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.410> lot

the<00:02:13.860> time<00:02:14.100> if<00:02:14.280> we've<00:02:14.430> got<00:02:14.580> an<00:02:14.670> endurance

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
the time if we've got an endurance

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.880 
the time if we've got an endurance

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
endurance problem if you say oh it just

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.530 
endurance problem if you say oh it just
I'd<00:02:18.630> like<00:02:18.900> more<00:02:19.200> endurance<00:02:20.000> then<00:02:21.000> you're

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
I'd like more endurance then you're

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.270 
I'd like more endurance then you're
probably<00:02:21.750> working<00:02:22.440> one<00:02:22.680> part<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.010> your<00:02:23.130> body

just increased because while ever I'm
still<00:03:29.610> breathing<00:03:30.060> I'm<00:03:30.150> playing<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.709> of

still breathing I'm playing and and of
course<00:03:32.100> I've<00:03:32.520> always<00:03:32.850> still<00:03:33.090> breathing<00:03:33.510> you

get<00:03:34.080> to<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.290> stage<00:03:34.560> where<00:03:34.800> you'll<00:03:34.890> have

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
get to the stage where you'll have

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.500 
get to the stage where you'll have
enough<00:03:35.250> endurance<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.030> can<00:03:36.209> play

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
enough endurance that you can play

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.810 
enough endurance that you can play
longer<00:03:36.930> than<00:03:37.590> anybody<00:03:37.800> wants<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.370> listen<00:03:38.670> to

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
longer than anybody wants to listen to

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.850 
longer than anybody wants to listen to
it<00:03:38.970> once<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:39.990> can<00:03:40.170> do<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.410> you've<00:03:40.620> got<00:03:40.740> all

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
it once you can do that you've got all

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.650 
it once you can do that you've got all
the<00:03:40.980> endurance<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.459> need<00:03:41.640> obviously<00:03:42.510> all<00:03:42.630> of

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
the endurance you need obviously all of

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.420 
the endurance you need obviously all of
us<00:03:42.870> run<00:03:43.110> out<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.320> don't<00:03:43.560> know<00:03:43.680> how<00:03:43.860> many<00:03:44.010> hours<00:03:44.100> I

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
us run out I don't know how many hours I

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.560 
us run out I don't know how many hours I
can<00:03:44.580> play<00:03:44.760> for<00:03:44.820> but<00:03:45.090> there<00:03:45.240> would<00:03:45.360> come<00:03:45.390> a

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
can play for but there would come a

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.410 
can play for but there would come a
point<00:03:45.870> with<00:03:46.080> my<00:03:46.230> lips<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.770> a<00:03:46.800> finished<00:03:47.430> but

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
point with my lips to a finished but

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.060 
point with my lips to a finished but
it's<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:48.840> much<00:03:49.020> longer<00:03:49.260> than<00:03:49.470> anyone<00:03:49.770> wants<00:03:49.980> to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
it's so much longer than anyone wants to

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.820 
it's so much longer than anyone wants to
listen<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.430> me<00:03:50.550> play<00:03:50.790> for<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:51.330> have<00:03:52.020> virtually

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
listen to me play for I have virtually

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.190 
listen to me play for I have virtually
unlimited<00:03:53.240> endurance<00:03:54.240> I<00:03:54.420> can<00:03:54.600> play<00:03:54.780> as<00:03:54.930> long

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
unlimited endurance I can play as long

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.550 
unlimited endurance I can play as long
as<00:03:55.410> any<00:03:55.530> gig<00:03:55.860> I'll<00:03:56.040> ever<00:03:56.190> have<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.459> play<00:03:57.560> partly

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
as any gig I'll ever have to play partly

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.320 
as any gig I'll ever have to play partly
this<00:03:58.709> comes<00:03:58.920> from<00:03:59.100> lots<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.430> practice<00:03:59.940> or<00:04:00.090> lots

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
this comes from lots of practice or lots

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.120 
this comes from lots of practice or lots
of<00:04:00.480> playing<00:04:00.870> over<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.320> years<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.709> longer

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
of playing over the years and the longer

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.920 
of playing over the years and the longer
the<00:04:02.250> gig<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.580> that<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.880> regularly<00:04:03.090> do<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.750> get

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
the gig is that you regularly do you get

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.260 
the gig is that you regularly do you get
used<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.830> can<00:04:04.980> play<00:04:05.160> longer<00:04:05.459> but<00:04:06.120> it's

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
used to it you can play longer but it's

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.199 
used to it you can play longer but it's
mostly<00:04:06.870> due<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.980> fact<00:04:08.100> that<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.459> do<00:04:08.580> as<00:04:08.820> much

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
mostly due to the fact that I do as much

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.190 
mostly due to the fact that I do as much
work<00:04:09.720> as<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:10.170> can<00:04:10.590> with<00:04:11.340> my<00:04:11.520> air<00:04:11.790> supply<00:04:12.209> now<00:04:12.959> use

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
work as I can with my air supply now use

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.170 
work as I can with my air supply now use
the<00:04:13.380> word<00:04:13.590> before<00:04:13.830> I<00:04:14.070> said<00:04:14.310> support<00:04:14.940> your

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
the word before I said support your

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.949 
the word before I said support your
sound<00:04:15.480> with<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.870> air<00:04:15.989> what<00:04:16.980> does<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.190> mean

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
sound with the air what does that mean

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.330 
sound with the air what does that mean
well<00:04:18.959> in<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.140> chapter<00:04:19.500> on<00:04:19.530> breathing<00:04:20.190> I

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
well in the chapter on breathing I

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.210 
well in the chapter on breathing I
talked<00:04:21.000> about<00:04:21.120> focusing<00:04:21.690> on<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.290> air<00:04:22.830> as<00:04:23.040> it

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
talked about focusing on the air as it

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.280 
talked about focusing on the air as it
comes<00:04:23.490> out<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:24.060> take<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.300> relaxed<00:04:24.810> breath<00:04:25.020> in

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
comes out you take a relaxed breath in

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.200 
comes out you take a relaxed breath in
and<00:04:25.500> then<00:04:25.530> really<00:04:26.190> focus<00:04:26.640> on<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.850> air<00:04:26.970> as<00:04:27.120> it

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
and then really focus on the air as it

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.740 
and then really focus on the air as it
comes<00:04:27.450> out

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
comes out

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.570 
comes out
through<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:27.990> trumpet<00:04:28.350> you<00:04:28.890> know<00:04:28.980> we<00:04:29.160> do<00:04:29.340> that

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
through the trumpet you know we do that

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.690 
through the trumpet you know we do that
we<00:04:30.210> add<00:04:30.420> a<00:04:30.480> lot<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:31.110> energy<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.370> air<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.520> lot

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
we add a lot of energy to the air a lot

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.370 
we add a lot of energy to the air a lot
of<00:04:32.760> speed<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.630> Airstream

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
of speed to the Airstream

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.620 
of speed to the Airstream
and<00:04:34.470> this<00:04:35.250> is<00:04:35.370> what<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.490> mean<00:04:35.700> by<00:04:35.850> supporting

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
and this is what I mean by supporting

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.930 
and this is what I mean by supporting
your<00:04:36.780> sound<00:04:37.110> with<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.590> air<00:04:37.740> rather<00:04:38.490> than<00:04:38.700> just

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
your sound with the air rather than just

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.410 
your sound with the air rather than just
breathing<00:04:39.480> out<00:04:39.660> now<00:04:40.560> what<00:04:41.010> this<00:04:41.190> does<00:04:41.250> is<00:04:41.820> it

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
breathing out now what this does is it

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.940 
breathing out now what this does is it
means<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:42.660> lot<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.990> work<00:04:43.410> that's<00:04:43.740> being

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
means a lot of the work that's being

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.400 
means a lot of the work that's being
done<00:04:44.100> is<00:04:44.790> being<00:04:45.210> done<00:04:45.270> now<00:04:45.630> by<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.870> air<00:04:46.110> and

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
done is being done now by the air and

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.800 
done is being done now by the air and
your<00:04:46.860> lips<00:04:47.070> will<00:04:47.340> do<00:04:47.520> less<00:04:47.700> work<00:04:47.940> when<00:04:48.540> we<00:04:48.630> blow

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
your lips will do less work when we blow

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.960 
your lips will do less work when we blow
through<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.050> trumpet<00:04:49.440> it's<00:04:49.980> unlike<00:04:50.490> anything

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
through a trumpet it's unlike anything

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.940 
through a trumpet it's unlike anything
else<00:04:51.300> we<00:04:51.480> do<00:04:51.660> breathing<00:04:51.990> out<00:04:52.290> speaking

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
else we do breathing out speaking

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.130 
else we do breathing out speaking
nothing<00:04:53.490> like<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.150> you<00:04:54.660> might<00:04:54.840> think<00:04:55.020> all

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
nothing like it you might think all

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.780 
nothing like it you might think all
blowing<00:04:55.410> up<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:55.710> balloon<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:56.220> blow<00:04:56.460> really<00:04:56.670> hard

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
blowing up a balloon I blow really hard

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.090 
blowing up a balloon I blow really hard
you<00:04:57.570> blow<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:57.810> lot<00:04:58.170> of<00:04:58.230> air<00:04:58.530> but<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:58.920> don't

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
you blow a lot of air but you don't

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.580 
you blow a lot of air but you don't
focus<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.940> airstream<00:05:00.510> like<00:05:01.050> we<00:05:01.200> do<00:05:01.350> through<00:05:01.560> a

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
focus the airstream like we do through a

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.950 
focus the airstream like we do through a
trumpet<00:05:02.040> and<00:05:02.580> nothing<00:05:02.970> quite<00:05:03.270> like<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.840> and

trumpet and nothing quite like it and

trumpet and nothing quite like it and
the<00:05:04.380> amount<00:05:04.620> of<00:05:04.680> energy<00:05:05.040> you<00:05:05.160> can<00:05:05.520> apply<00:05:05.880> to

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
the amount of energy you can apply to

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.630 
the amount of energy you can apply to
the<00:05:06.090> air<00:05:06.330> creates<00:05:07.200> that<00:05:07.410> huge<00:05:07.740> sound<00:05:08.100> that<00:05:08.490> we

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
the air creates that huge sound that we

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.990 
the air creates that huge sound that we
hear<00:05:08.940> if<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:10.260> put<00:05:10.530> less<00:05:10.800> energy<00:05:11.340> into<00:05:11.880> your

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
hear if you put less energy into your

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.400 
hear if you put less energy into your
air<00:05:12.120> stream<00:05:12.330> if<00:05:12.419> you<00:05:12.540> back<00:05:12.780> off<00:05:12.990> if<00:05:13.140> you<00:05:13.260> get

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
air stream if you back off if you get

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.110 
air stream if you back off if you get
lazy<00:05:13.620> if<00:05:13.919> you<00:05:14.040> slump<00:05:14.490> in<00:05:14.640> your<00:05:14.760> chair<00:05:15.000> when

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
lazy if you slump in your chair when

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.720 
lazy if you slump in your chair when
you're<00:05:15.270> playing<00:05:15.980> then<00:05:16.980> the<00:05:17.130> works<00:05:17.310> got<00:05:17.580> to<00:05:17.669> be

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
you're playing then the works got to be

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.070 
you're playing then the works got to be
done<00:05:17.910> somewhere<00:05:18.300> if<00:05:18.510> you<00:05:18.630> can<00:05:18.750> still<00:05:18.900> going<00:05:19.020> to

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
done somewhere if you can still going to

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.650 
done somewhere if you can still going to
create<00:05:19.290> the<00:05:19.470> sound<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:20.910> work<00:05:21.090> then<00:05:21.330> falls

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
create the sound and the work then falls

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.690 
create the sound and the work then falls
to<00:05:22.050> something<00:05:22.440> up<00:05:22.590> here<00:05:22.890> and<00:05:23.100> sometimes<00:05:23.610> we

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
to something up here and sometimes we

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.400 
to something up here and sometimes we
use<00:05:23.880> muscles<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.480> our<00:05:24.540> throat<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.080> all<00:05:25.140> sorts

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
use muscles and our throat and all sorts

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.620 
use muscles and our throat and all sorts
of<00:05:25.470> other<00:05:25.620> things<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:26.520> help<00:05:26.700> add<00:05:26.940> energy<00:05:27.180> and

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
of other things to help add energy and

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.140 
of other things to help add energy and
those<00:05:28.350> things<00:05:28.800> are<00:05:29.160> almost<00:05:29.580> certainly<00:05:30.060> a

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
those things are almost certainly a

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.969 
those things are almost certainly a
smaller<00:05:30.690> muscle<00:05:30.960> than<00:05:31.530> your<00:05:31.650> diaphragm

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
smaller muscle than your diaphragm

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.340 
smaller muscle than your diaphragm
particularly<00:05:32.940> your<00:05:33.030> lips<00:05:33.240> they<00:05:33.900> just<00:05:34.110> can't

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
particularly your lips they just can't

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.670 
particularly your lips they just can't
do<00:05:34.560> that<00:05:34.740> much<00:05:34.979> work<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:35.550> then<00:05:36.540> they<00:05:37.260> run<00:05:37.500> out

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
do that much work and then they run out

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.710 
do that much work and then they run out
so<00:05:38.100> to<00:05:38.160> speak<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.669> your<00:05:39.000> endurance<00:05:39.419> is<00:05:39.600> all

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
so to speak and your endurance is all

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.020 
so to speak and your endurance is all
over<00:05:40.020> okay<00:05:40.919> so<00:05:40.979> to<00:05:41.220> get<00:05:41.460> that<00:05:41.669> longer

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
over okay so to get that longer

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.540 
over okay so to get that longer
endurance<00:05:42.710> do<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:43.860> work<00:05:44.070> with<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.370> big

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
endurance do the work with the big

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.400 
endurance do the work with the big
muscles<00:05:44.760> do<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:45.270> work<00:05:45.479> where<00:05:45.690> you<00:05:45.780> can<00:05:46.169> do<00:05:46.380> it

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
muscles do the work where you can do it

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.340 
muscles do the work where you can do it
which<00:05:46.800> is<00:05:46.830> with<00:05:47.100> your<00:05:47.250> air<00:05:47.460> supply<00:05:48.030> and<00:05:48.350> your

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
which is with your air supply and your

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.650 
which is with your air supply and your
embouchure<00:05:49.669> we'll<00:05:50.669> have<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:51.030> do<00:05:51.180> less<00:05:51.390> work

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
embouchure we'll have to do less work

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.180 
embouchure we'll have to do less work
then<00:05:51.900> because<00:05:52.110> remember<00:05:52.410> we<00:05:52.530> don't<00:05:52.650> need<00:05:52.919> more

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
then because remember we don't need more

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.610 
then because remember we don't need more
than<00:05:53.460> a<00:05:53.790> hundred<00:05:54.210> percent<00:05:54.330> of<00:05:54.810> what<00:05:54.900> we<00:05:55.380> need

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
than a hundred percent of what we need

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.210 
than a hundred percent of what we need
to<00:05:56.130> make<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.490> sound<00:05:56.790> in<00:05:57.060> a<00:05:57.510> nutshell

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
to make the sound in a nutshell

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.010 
to make the sound in a nutshell
endurance<00:05:59.220> is<00:05:59.460> not<00:06:00.240> about<00:06:00.450> any<00:06:00.660> particular

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
endurance is not about any particular

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.080 
endurance is not about any particular
tricks<00:06:01.470> or<00:06:01.650> ways<00:06:01.830> of<00:06:02.040> playing<00:06:02.340> it's<00:06:02.610> about<00:06:02.880> do

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
tricks or ways of playing it's about do

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.840 
tricks or ways of playing it's about do
as<00:06:03.210> much<00:06:03.479> of<00:06:03.690> the<00:06:03.810> work<00:06:03.990> as<00:06:04.169> you<00:06:04.320> can<00:06:04.850> where

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
as much of the work as you can where

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.760 
as much of the work as you can where
it's<00:06:05.970> easiest<00:06:06.330> to<00:06:06.450> do<00:06:06.660> it<00:06:06.780> with<00:06:07.140> the<00:06:07.260> airstream

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
it's easiest to do it with the airstream

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.390 
it's easiest to do it with the airstream
and<00:06:07.950> you'll<00:06:08.460> be<00:06:08.520> able<00:06:08.580> to<00:06:08.729> play<00:06:08.910> for<00:06:08.970> longer
