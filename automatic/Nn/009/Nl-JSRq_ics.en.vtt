00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
don't have the heat shield since when

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.950 
don't have the heat shield since when
does<00:01:50.230> and<00:01:50.620> that<00:01:51.430> right<00:01:51.580> there<00:01:51.640> is<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:52.150> big<00:01:52.750> deal

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
right here rather than being along the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.550 
right here rather than being along the
top<00:02:13.209> be<00:02:13.390> number<00:02:13.629> one<00:02:13.750> along<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.170> top<00:02:14.349> because

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
top be number one along the top because

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
going to go ahead and see heat mirages

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.290 
going to go ahead and see heat mirages
every<00:02:18.160> time<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.519> go<00:02:18.670> ahead<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.910> look<00:02:19.060> at<00:02:19.150> your

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.920 
nice design even as it is like that you
can<00:02:32.769> see<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.550> got<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.730> unique<00:02:34.060> profile<00:02:34.569> to<00:02:34.810> it

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
can see it's got a unique profile to it

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.710 
can see it's got a unique profile to it
for<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.500> top<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:36.100> unique<00:02:37.030> profile<00:02:37.420> for<00:02:37.630> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
for the top and unique profile for the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.950 
for the top and unique profile for the
bottom

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
bottom

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.470 
bottom
and<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.320> really<00:02:40.190> like<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.790> know<00:02:40.820> as<00:02:41.060> a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
and I really like it and you know as a

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.530 
and I really like it and you know as a
first<00:02:41.810> look<00:02:42.310> I'm<00:02:43.310> really<00:02:43.580> impressed<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.240> also

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
first look I'm really impressed it also

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.530 
first look I'm really impressed it also
has<00:02:44.750> tabs<00:02:45.470> in<00:02:45.740> here<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.850> make<00:02:47.000> sure<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
has tabs in here to make sure that the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.310 
has tabs in here to make sure that the
top<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.560> bottom<00:02:48.680> make<00:02:49.490> together<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.320> they

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
top and bottom make together and they

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.020 
top and bottom make together and they
don't<00:02:51.440> rattle<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:52.100> that's<00:02:52.760> one<00:02:52.910> of<00:02:52.940> the

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
don't rattle and that's one of the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.490 
don't rattle and that's one of the
problems<00:02:53.210> I<00:02:53.510> see<00:02:53.540> with<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.870> lot<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.230> them<00:02:54.350> you

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
problems I see with a lot of them you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.430 
problems I see with a lot of them you
know<00:02:54.560> they<00:02:54.620> they<00:02:55.400> fit<00:02:55.670> really<00:02:56.140> good<00:02:57.140> on<00:02:57.320> the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
know they they fit really good on the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.670 
know they they fit really good on the
weapon<00:02:57.590> but<00:02:57.920> they'll<00:02:58.790> rock<00:02:59.360> side<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.690> side<00:03:00.020> and

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
weapon but they'll rock side to side and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.530 
weapon but they'll rock side to side and
that<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.010> don't<00:03:01.160> like<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:01.910> if<00:03:02.420> you

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
that you don't like that in that if you

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.440 
that you don't like that in that if you
have<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.720> any<00:03:03.350> kind<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.590> optics<00:03:04.040> on<00:03:04.220> there<00:03:04.460> here

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
have a any kind of optics on there here

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.510 
have a any kind of optics on there here
you'll<00:03:06.050> get<00:03:06.170> wandering<00:03:06.710> zeros<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.310> things

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
you'll get wandering zeros and things

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.190 
you'll get wandering zeros and things
like<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:08.120> what's<00:03:08.780> this<00:03:08.930> right<00:03:09.140> here

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
like that and what's this right here

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.440 
like that and what's this right here
because<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.710> locks<00:03:09.950> in<00:03:10.160> place<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.640> in<00:03:10.760> such<00:03:11.240> a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
because it locks in place and in such a

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.720 
because it locks in place and in such a
fine<00:03:11.930> manner<00:03:12.310> you're<00:03:13.310> not<00:03:13.400> going<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.610> have

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
fine manner you're not going to have

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.110 
fine manner you're not going to have
that<00:03:13.760> same<00:03:14.060> problem<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:15.230> there<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:15.560> go<00:03:16.120> that's

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
that same problem so there you go that's

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.820 
that same problem so there you go that's
right<00:03:17.330> here<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.600> quick<00:03:17.930> first<00:03:18.170> look<00:03:18.530> at<00:03:18.710> the

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
right here is a quick first look at the

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.460 
right here is a quick first look at the
a<00:03:18.860> B<00:03:19.160> arms<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:21.910> by<00:03:22.910> looking<00:03:23.390> at<00:03:23.600> it<00:03:23.870> just<00:03:24.260> from

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
a B arms and by looking at it just from

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.210 
a B arms and by looking at it just from
here<00:03:24.740> and<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.870> know<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.200> by<00:03:27.800> looking<00:03:27.950> at<00:03:28.100> the

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
here and you know that by looking at the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.440 
here and you know that by looking at the
texture<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:28.670> stuff<00:03:28.910> like<00:03:29.000> that<00:03:29.090> all<00:03:29.420> the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
texture and stuff like that all the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.870 
texture and stuff like that all the
things<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:29.840> like<00:03:30.020> I<00:03:30.980> think<00:03:31.580> I'm<00:03:31.700> going<00:03:31.790> to

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
things I like I think I'm going to

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.370 
things I like I think I'm going to
really<00:03:32.060> enjoy<00:03:32.120> doing<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.780> review<00:03:33.050> on<00:03:33.200> this

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
really enjoy doing the review on this
