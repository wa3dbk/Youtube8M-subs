00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.269
 Hello 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.050
 we are here now outside the university we blocked the rector's office for a 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.440
 whole day in which to give notice of the arrests that occurred throughout 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.770
 italy yesterday morning at g8 in turin we all know we are all for 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.690
 contest a legitimate university summit 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.220
 air following that demonstration on the life of ventus without charity of 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.650
 twenty-one students from the wave 21 students like us and we say the costs of the arrests 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.010
 they are illegitimate in the first place because they go a month and a half away 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.280
 respect and facts 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.760
 and that a political aberration is precisely unclear an action 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.970
 preventive like the one of yesterday which issues in a state of preventive detention 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.729
 incensed student activists in prison 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.509
 should also shake the minds of the switch of the teaching staff 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:30.460
 castles 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.450
 he makes these arrests in the middle of summer of the two mountains in the first place because there 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.869
 plays at the doors that we will conquer today 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.759
 secondly because in summer it is easier to try to disconnect the 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.709
 movement for yesterday's response instead of re-compacting even more 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:47.790
 movement so we say that the strategy is already going up the hill 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.799
 entirely when we succeed in obtaining the release of the twenty-one students 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.020
 but then for hour for hour for hour 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.020
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.289
 burp 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:28.039
 but we left the city 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.659
 university ahahah 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:30.749
 we have 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:35.429
 we made some roadblocks of the symbolic blocks ea 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:40.489
 this point, however, we had a seat reaction. broken apart nervous 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.719
 the police because they are even cut off with the 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.499
 trucks at the risk of hurting too 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.060
 but different versions from
