00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.630
 Yes 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.289
 do 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.300
 Hello, hello and welcome 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.430
 dear spectators out there I have 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.610
 new project planned that is called there 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.010
 gaming pc self construction 2015 we build 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.530
 together an itx board that means the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.730
 smallest form factor the skip and me 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.560
 imagine the video in this video 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.560
 components in this respect 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.920
 mainboard is a svk 97 mrt xrc 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.870
 for use 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.420
 We have all the connections we have 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.880
 may need the graphics card on it 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.370
 build two runs lotz use 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.590
 All in all, that's a word, after all 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.010
 already relatively good 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.190
 exhibition options for this 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.640
 form factor offers as the eu comes one 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:41.110
 intel core i5 44 60 for use 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.750
 this cpu clocks with 4 x 3.2 gigahertz 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.050
 he is for the base 11.50 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.540
 designed and he as a kid, I have me 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.210
 thinking about ending the box throw 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.600
 or they can be with the bigger one 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.400
 to 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.930
 I just have to look up the times 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.030
 after what we do for it and performance 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.190
 It may be that temperature data 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.460
 will integrate them later 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:08.250
 this year operating system will find place 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.350
 on a 128 gigabyte big kruse in the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.330
 x100 is just very important says 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.830
 operating system on it and the necessary 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.270
 programs make it really fast 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.489
 and runs smoothly 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.310
 a ssd very good is very good 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.260
 benchmark completes us for 2015 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.730
 every case is more than sufficient and 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.920
 even for the next years of mine 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.360
 opinion 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.440
 your remaining data will find space 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.270
 a 500 gigabyte hdd is here 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.280
 stop the question namely a terabyte or 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.570
 Of course you can do five gigabytes as well 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.790
 upgrade later 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.600
 But that's not the problem in itself 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.780
 on the other hand, we have eight gigabytes 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.850
 main memory ballistix with 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.480
 the pc3 12800 to 1 5 volt so 1000 600 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.850
 megahertz 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.680
 it is so on this mainboard that we 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.090
 only integrate two main memories 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.340
 That's why I have one 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.010
 eight gigabytes briskly taken so that me 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.630
 later upgrade to 16 gigabytes 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.860
 can 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:12.670
 the graphics unit is a geforce gtx 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.730
 550 ti of emediate to use is one 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.800
 graphics card is not currently still data 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.799
 is no longer the newest model 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.150
 I know you can do it then 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.319
 in this case, if it is also new 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.319
 released a new graphics card 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.860
 will integrate a new graphics card 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.950
 currently such as the 79 then a whole 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.500
 nice offer for example from msi gameforge 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.329
 or you take alive to the other card 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.019
 that means you can of course still there 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.849
 accordingly, their entire play 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.030
 data and are supplied with power and 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:49.030
 this is the be quiet pure power 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.090
 with 400 watts in use a very nice 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.190
 Power adapter is not it should be 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.959
 definitely enough 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.959
 enough connections for the graphics card 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.540
 for the cpu also for the mainboard so 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.730
 All in all, very, very good, of course 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.470
 may not in a pc on a drive 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.180
 missing for this reason comes here 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.019
 normal commercial drive 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.480
 still to use 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.459
 there is just always like to have 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.530
 to have one more drive integrated 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.380
 so now present had the 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.299
 final question in which housing 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.070
 everything is integrated and you secretly 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.150
 a very special case and 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.250
 Although a poison green 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.260
 it was a very bitfenix prodigy 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.500
 cool housing a relatively small 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.050
 housing what even here sideways usb 3.0 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.699
 and also just like you said 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.990
 Be this green is just 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:43.030
 hammer hammer so that you can 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.070
 components for the new videos would be me 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.539
 I'm already looking forward to the installation and we 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.340
 See us at the next video come 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.320
 then again normal in porz and in 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.030
 interested in this sense a million times 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.120
 what you write about the components says 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.139
 below, I'm going in through that 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.000
 configuration also relocate that 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.710
 is that about are what makes it so about 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.620
 of course, it always costs the prices 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.300
 also depending on the day a piece far what 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.110
 me is still very important in the end 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.930
 the communes are variable if 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.419
 you never take satisfaction with the cdu 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.349
 another if it is a big one 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.270
 other housing 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.610
 if I the video card is too weak 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:23.440
 takes me new graphics card that is up 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.849
 every case very clear and then 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.440
 I thank you for watching how 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.630
 we'll see you in the assembly 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.740
 I am looking forward again and again 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:35.560
 on a wonderful and 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.560
 Happy 2015 makes you feel good
