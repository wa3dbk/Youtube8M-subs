 because you know who I am the 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.150
 developer of apple.com in this blog 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.190
 today to start a very news 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.110
 important since we're going to go into the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.629
 world of learning to bleed in this nest 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.460
 where will I show you how to update 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.290
 your applications if you have ever 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.370
 had any update we started 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.620
 with this video where I'm going to teach you 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.550
 many sessions in the world of what 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.620
 filthy from iphone we plucked 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.300
 The first thing we are going to do is touch the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.399
 home button that if you do not know what it is 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.980
 this is the start button in the 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.750
 iphone world so just in 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.120
 the iphone 5 s we put what is the finger 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.520
 on all other phones 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.680
 we put what is the password but in 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.479
 this case I will put what is the finger 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.390
 we introduce what is the finger and 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.280
 we connect to what is itunes and then 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.630
 give us an icon that I do not know what is 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.640
 because I want you to tell me 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.670
 that you know of course that I know that 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.470
 it is clear that demanding had already touched 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.660
 a lot of experience with what the world is 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.729
 of apple and we find an icon 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.580
 called art store where we know it is 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.320
 number 6 and that is that we are going to open that 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.090
 icon that icon inform us the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.160
 updates and we're going to teach them 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.420
 how to do it on the 3g network by 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.850
 course we simply give it in 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.910
 update and automatically we would be 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.649
 leaving that little circle what it means 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.310
 that square that is there is that it is 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.460
 updating these to page 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.740
 and you'll see that if you see that hairline 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.740
 that is loading these titles is 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.990
 updating these cars and you know that if 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.780
 You have a support device, so you 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.100
