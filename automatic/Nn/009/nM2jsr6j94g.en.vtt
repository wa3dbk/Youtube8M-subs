little<00:00:30.859> features<00:00:31.279> of<00:00:31.519> this<00:00:32.149> car<00:00:32.480> but<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:33.289> far

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
little features of this car but so far

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.660 
little features of this car but so far
I've<00:00:33.559> not<00:00:33.739> been<00:00:33.890> real<00:00:34.070> impressed<00:00:34.430> with<00:00:34.520> the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
I've not been real impressed with the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.410 
I've not been real impressed with the
performance<00:00:34.789> of<00:00:35.270> it<00:00:36.190> it's<00:00:37.190> just<00:00:37.520> not<00:00:37.579> it's

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
performance of it it's just not it's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.970 
performance of it it's just not it's
like<00:00:38.930> they<00:00:39.230> have<00:00:39.260> built<00:00:39.859> a<00:00:40.510> performance<00:00:41.510> car

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
like they have built a performance car

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.439 
like they have built a performance car
it's<00:00:42.980> it's<00:00:43.250> like<00:00:43.340> a<00:00:43.430> performance<00:00:43.969> car<00:00:44.000> that

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
it's it's like a performance car that

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:45.790 
it's it's like a performance car that
the<00:00:44.600> seats<00:00:44.899> are<00:00:45.079> very<00:00:45.109> hard<00:00:45.559> they're

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
the seats are very hard they're

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.189 
the seats are very hard they're
comfortable<00:00:46.670> enough<00:00:46.969> but<00:00:47.269> I<00:00:47.449> think<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:47.870> along

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
comfortable enough but I think it along

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.540 
comfortable enough but I think it along
and<00:00:48.679> a<00:00:49.160> long<00:00:50.620> trip<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:51.859> would<00:00:52.010> probably<00:00:52.250> get<00:00:52.429> on

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
and a long trip it would probably get on

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.369 
and a long trip it would probably get on
your<00:00:52.699> nerves<00:00:52.910> or<00:00:53.600> at<00:00:53.719> least<00:00:53.870> if<00:00:53.989> we<00:00:54.050> get<00:00:54.170> on<00:00:54.260> my

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
your nerves or at least if we get on my

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.700 
your nerves or at least if we get on my
nerves<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:58.820> sits<00:00:59.149> lower<00:00:59.480> as<00:01:00.289> compared<00:01:00.649> to

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
nerves the it sits lower as compared to

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.189 
nerves the it sits lower as compared to
this<00:01:01.399> it's<00:01:02.120> almost<00:01:02.269> like<00:01:02.480> this<00:01:02.660> cars<00:01:02.899> has<00:01:03.170> a

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
this it's almost like this cars has a

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.700 
this it's almost like this cars has a
little<00:01:03.620> bit<00:01:03.769> of<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:04.509> identity<00:01:05.509> crisis<00:01:05.990> it

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
little bit of a identity crisis it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.590 
little bit of a identity crisis it
doesn't<00:01:06.979> really<00:01:07.130> know<00:01:07.280> what<00:01:07.310> it<00:01:07.490> is<00:01:07.610> they

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
doesn't really know what it is they

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.390 
doesn't really know what it is they
wanted<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.170> build<00:01:09.320> something<00:01:09.409> I<00:01:09.710> think<00:01:09.890> near

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
wanted to build something I think near

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.480 
wanted to build something I think near
something<00:01:11.119> like<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.450> Z<00:01:11.740> but<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:13.009> little<00:01:13.369> bit

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
something like the Z but a little bit

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.370 
something like the Z but a little bit
fancier<00:01:13.970> but<00:01:14.299> what<00:01:14.540> they've<00:01:14.689> done<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:15.110> they

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
fancier but what they've done is they

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.590 
fancier but what they've done is they
built<00:01:15.649> something<00:01:16.000> fancier<00:01:17.000> they've<00:01:17.210> they

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
built something fancier they've they

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
interesting this is like a normal

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.879 
interesting this is like a normal
optimal<00:05:29.199> engine<00:05:30.300> you<00:05:31.300> know<00:05:31.389> and<00:05:31.780> just<00:05:31.960> me<00:05:32.470> and

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
optimal engine you know and just me and

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.420 
optimal engine you know and just me and
I<00:05:32.949> think<00:05:33.250> it<00:05:33.340> it's<00:05:33.880> like<00:05:35.190> it's<00:05:36.190> like<00:05:36.310> a

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
I think it it's like it's like a

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.020 
I think it it's like it's like a
commuter<00:05:37.000> car<00:05:37.270> engine<00:05:37.659> in<00:05:38.199> a<00:05:38.320> sports<00:05:38.590> car<00:05:39.030> and

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
then throw you know he put in some fancy

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.640 
then throw you know he put in some fancy
it's<00:05:42.849> okay<00:05:43.120> to<00:05:43.180> have<00:05:43.360> a<00:05:43.389> fancy<00:05:43.690> sports<00:05:44.080> car<00:05:44.260> but

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
it's okay to have a fancy sports car but

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.040 
it's okay to have a fancy sports car but
go<00:05:45.430> ahead<00:05:45.460> and<00:05:45.729> make<00:05:45.849> it<00:05:46.000> to<00:05:46.120> sports<00:05:46.389> car<00:05:46.630> go

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.280 
four-door you don't feel the bumps at
all<00:06:29.280> here<00:06:30.090> in<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.450> two-door<00:06:30.810> you<00:06:30.990> feel<00:06:31.169> the

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
all here in the two-door you feel the

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.129 
all here in the two-door you feel the
bumps<00:06:31.940> again<00:06:32.940> they<00:06:33.120> stiffen<00:06:33.510> the<00:06:33.570> suspension

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
bumps again they stiffen the suspension

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:35.750 
bumps again they stiffen the suspension
so<00:06:35.010> if<00:06:35.070> you're<00:06:35.160> going<00:06:35.250> to<00:06:35.340> have<00:06:35.430> a<00:06:35.460> stiff

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
so if you're going to have a stiff

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.050 
so if you're going to have a stiff
suspension<00:06:36.770> hard<00:06:37.770> seats<00:06:40.100> move<00:06:41.100> the<00:06:41.400> writing

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
suspension hard seats move the writing

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.520 
suspension hard seats move the writing
physician<00:06:42.510> down<00:06:42.810> a<00:06:42.840> little<00:06:43.139> bit<00:06:43.320> which

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
physician down a little bit which

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.080 
physician down a little bit which
actually<00:06:43.770> makes<00:06:44.010> it<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.220> little<00:06:44.310> bit<00:06:44.490> hard<00:06:45.030> to

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
actually makes it a little bit hard to

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.840 
actually makes it a little bit hard to
see<00:06:45.330> on<00:06:45.360> the<00:06:45.630> weird<00:06:45.900> the<00:06:46.169> windows<00:06:46.729> then<00:06:47.729> you

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850 
see on the weird the windows then you

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.820 
see on the weird the windows then you
might<00:06:48.030> as<00:06:48.060> well<00:06:48.360> just<00:06:48.660> gone<00:06:49.110> ahead<00:06:49.260> and<00:06:49.470> put<00:06:49.740> it

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
might as well just gone ahead and put it

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.529 
might as well just gone ahead and put it
a<00:06:49.889> little<00:06:49.919> bit<00:06:50.250> better<00:06:50.400> engine<00:06:50.789> or<00:06:50.970> or<00:06:51.449> at

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
a little bit better engine or or at

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.340 
a little bit better engine or or at
least<00:06:51.720> two<00:06:51.900> and<00:06:52.020> this<00:06:52.080> one<00:06:52.139> up<00:06:52.410> some

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350
