00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.930
 yes and that build and now a fact 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.029
 other car and deep go around 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.580
 Sonic runs so how does not have a team 5 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.580
 so controlled 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.460
 and now I have to do it myself 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.460
 kept sending 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.360
 so I give gas 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.430
 Yes, go on 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.470
 yes, I think I have to do it that way 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:58.460
 so I can do it that's clear 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.460
 that's is classic 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.070
 So more video games than that does not work 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.890
 as it is now still open 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.750
 Therefore, we offer quite a lot of power in the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.680
 alpen wars win 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.930
 that's awesome, that's not easy 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.630
 that this is not easy quite possible 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.310
 so that I had like me 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.200
 racer on the left must steer 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.369
 you have to make tvister but in the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.490
 It may be that way in the future 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.110
 you have to get used to it 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.240
 you brake what the water 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.860
 difficult is that you brake 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.930
 So you use the same hand 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.690
 everything with one and you think 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.190
 automatically to a second thing so if 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.190
 you what you do so synonymous in the automatic 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.140
 tense that really is you 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.760
 Of course you have not quite reached that 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.890
 works very well because sometimes 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.900
 you think already these conversions 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.300
 The person can be fast accordingly 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.160
 I almost say that you react 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:36.540
 initiate emergency braking faster 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:38.190
 can than in the normal car you say to 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.110
 tension as I said we want you 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.570
 that shows that other types of customers 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.940
 There are other types of cars and 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.190
 that everyone has fun with it more 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:56.250
 power to drive the foot with 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:03:02.130
 ambush the hand gas performance 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:05.460
 make but we now have here say 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.990
 and write 60 ps and about 25 830 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.990
 base or russia 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.870
 flying in Vorwerk here what cool 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.170
 now the performance is good 470 newton meters 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.140
 are rather 30 ps more two and a half tdi 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.640
 130 base but what a blatant thing you do now 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.640
 the performance really is that way here 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.959
 risk so full of that 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.680
 we just want to show it to you yes that 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.689
 I every day that knows only very 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.390
 express for in between 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:50.069
 just rebuilt in the lunch break 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.099
 and t5 on 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.440
 your head with whom you start from the head 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.770
 you away 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.770
 whose
