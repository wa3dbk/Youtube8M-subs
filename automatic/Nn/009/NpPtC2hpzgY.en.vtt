they<00:04:38.850> run<00:04:39.060> into<00:04:39.240> these<00:04:39.420> ports<00:04:39.810> here<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.290> then

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
they run into these ports here and then

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.100 
they run into these ports here and then
my<00:04:41.130> tail<00:04:41.340> lights<00:04:41.610> will<00:04:42.420> plug<00:04:42.630> into<00:04:42.810> another

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
my tail lights will plug into another
