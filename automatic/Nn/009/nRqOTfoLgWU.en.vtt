00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.740
 Welcome to a natural papercraft 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.199
 I'm felipe blast and in today's video 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.669
 saizar before starting I want to 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.470
 thank support and comments 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.419
 positive you've had and also 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.010
 tell them that I need them to do more 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.410
 questions on how to do for in 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.730
 question because this time I'll make another video 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.100
 explaining all those things that do not 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.180
 they were clear first now if still 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.040
 you can model 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.809
 this is a bit of difficult difficulty 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.989
 with a construction time of 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.170
 approximately 8 hours is printed in 11 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.239
 pages and has a total of 96 pieces the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.000
 animation of this model are 30 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.910
 centimeters high 27 points 9 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.010
 centimeters wide and 36 centimeters 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.019
 long for this background to know the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.449
 first paper cuts that I did in that 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.280
 color printer time so I had 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.960
 print it in black and white on the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.210
 images that are going to have after 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.520
 realize that it is printed in white and 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.369
 black and I had to paint it between 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.110
 tempera and that is why this take hoist 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.120
 it will not have the same colors as 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.530
 has the charly be from the official website 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.790
 here we are in the deep and we are going to 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.790
 open the charice file 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.240
 if they are fixed you have to use this 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.240
 interior schilling 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.659
 let's teach how to change the texture 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.659
 let's go to settings 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.530
 textures settings 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.530
 our teams 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.150
 now we go to the folder and although it 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.940
 downloaded the video file 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.130
 and without saying we will measure the two textures 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.960
 that were made sex coloccini 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.960
 normal normal 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.470
 it is equal to understand the color lung 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.480
 original 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.450
 now we go with the model 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.800
 The first thing we will do is make the 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.870
 hands and legs of the lung we will begin 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.819
 with the nails of the hands 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.140
 he liked to do it up does not 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.910
 You can see here 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.210
 until we get to the part of the 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.210
 shoulder 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.230
 for legs 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.150
 we'll start at the bottom 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.030
 it is about 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.540
 and we will be putting up 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.220
 in this step we can live together 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.080
 very assertive we can save them for 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.560
 the end 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.510
 this is so that we do not have problems 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.510
 from the back 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.750
 once we have ready this we will go to 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.150
 the part of the tail 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.360
 for the tail we'll start with this piece 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.520
 that will be 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.380
 we will close and then we will uniting 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.340
 the others until we get to the end 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.340
 until this piece 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.260
 which is what according to the body 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.570
 for the tail flame we will leave it 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.240
 for the end as it is the same as the 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.400
 We can pass it on to carry 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.240
 I break it again 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.550
 the next thing we will do will be the wings 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.470
 The first thing we are going to do is paste 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.470
 this piece to this one 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.380
 and then we're going to start hitting from 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.000
 the tip of the wing 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.590
 here 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.069
 until we get to the part that is 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.109
 one the back 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.450
 in the room they are going to take too much 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.620
 weather 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.900
 in some of the most difficult parts 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.390
 I wanted the pokemon and once we have 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.470
 ready the hands the legs the tail and the 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.180
 wings 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.550
 we will start with the construction of the 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.680
 head of the polygon is also the 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.720
 very difficult part it is necessary that there 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.880
 looking good is not hitting each piece 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.840
 in the structure 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.430
 to be able to give the perfect shape to the 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.440
 head is to say that all the pieces 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.530
 fit correctly 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.720
 has many details of the head like this 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.700
 that it is necessary that they see where 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.550
 they are but this company 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.010
 we always start with this piece of the 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.780
 from the shore and we are approaching 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.520
 get to the nose as you can see 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.230
 also in the other photo that I'm going to 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.080
 add here to the side 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.770
 for the teeth or for the hand to 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.140
 the jaw we can leave the tongue and 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.320
 teeth for the end since that we 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.360
 will influence anything 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.550
 and we will continue working until completing 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.680
 The chef's whole head is once 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.960
 we have ready the head we will work in 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.600
 the neck and we will go down from this 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.390
 piece until we get to this data 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.030
 which is where the wings stretch 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.310
 you have to explain how important the gala 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.810
 of this pokemon are very heavy then 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.950
 what it does is that it falls down and looks 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.500
 this form 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.990
 if they are fixed it will not be the same as in the 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.450
 image of the page so when I 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.420
 I made this lung about three years ago 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.169
 I happened to put cardboard here 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:26.800
 so that the birds that do so 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.800
 but after a while I was dropped again 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.980
 so I reopened it and this time 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.740
 I put wire now has wire by 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.710
 inside but then you can burn a 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.240
 year the wire was also given and returned to 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.949
 Fall down 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.569
 so as a task they have to 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.430
 how can you make the 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.220
 wings are the same as in the image of 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.990
 official polygon at least mine I 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.819
 I 'll leave it like that, going back to the model 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.880
 once we have the wings attached 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.950
 we will stick our arms 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.960
 then they continued down to reach 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.030
 the parties once wanted to try the 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.220
 legs we will reach the most difficult part 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.409
 of the little one wants to raise the tail with the 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:10.949
 body and where to start the whole problem 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:13.229
 for this we are going to paste all the pieces 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.749
 except for those that we are going to leave 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:20.449
 in oblivion here so we can poke 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:20.449
 the finger and be able to paste the rap pieces 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.000
 once all the pieces are 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.180
 sunken and the tail is already firm 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.080
 we'll put the piece here for this 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.009
 let's join first this one goes 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.039
 then it's lapel 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.749
 and finally this room so 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:43.449
 only pieces that will not remain unpainted 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:45.669
 will be this saga 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:49.300
 how is the last piece to close it 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:51.430
 here from nagua throw a lot of silicone 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.289
 and try to put together the pieces that is what 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.910
 more even possible 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:07:00.690
 now we only have details 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:02.670
 we will make the nails and the teeth that are 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.860
 pieces well easy is the only 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.920
 complexity is that they are very pieces 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.550
 small the tongue also that does not have 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.550
 no difficulty 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:17.009
 and we have only the fire of the 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:21.080
 tail is a rather difficult piece that 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:21.080
 here we need 100 opening help 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.710
 we have to paste as indicated by the 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.470
 program starting with the pieces that 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.990
 they go higher until we finish with 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.210
 the piece that goes below 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:37.060
 If you look here, there's going to be a 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:39.040
 rollito once we finish the fire 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.220
 to paste it this we are going to be 

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.190
 silicone on the tip of the tail and 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:47.320
 let's put the whole fire going to 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:50.009
 hold it there for a few minutes until 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.509
 be well stuck 

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:52.979
 Any doubt they have leave a 

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:55.710
 comment here below and I just 

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:58.520
 I will answer you say goodbye to fer and candles and we 

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.520
 we see the next video 

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.440
 ah 

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.919
 look
