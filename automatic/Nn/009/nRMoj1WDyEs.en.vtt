00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
are a couple of guys at my local track

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.219 
are a couple of guys at my local track
that<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.570> been<00:01:03.660> running<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.019> stuff

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that have been running this stuff

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.219 
that have been running this stuff
specifically<00:01:05.100> my<00:01:05.220> buddy<00:01:05.400> Jared<00:01:06.020> chairs<00:01:07.020> got<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
specifically my buddy Jared chairs got a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
specifically my buddy Jared chairs got a
couple<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> kids<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.979> would<00:01:08.040> guess<00:01:08.790> his

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
couple of kids and I would guess his

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.700 
couple of kids and I would guess his
pride<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.240> his<00:01:09.330> late<00:01:09.450> 20s<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.080> probably

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
pride in his late 20s and probably

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
pride in his late 20s and probably
doesn't<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:11.070> truckloads<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.060> money<00:01:12.210> to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
doesn't have truckloads of money to

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.050 
doesn't have truckloads of money to
spend<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.689> electronics<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:14.340> even<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.880> he<00:01:14.939> does

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
spend on electronics and even if he does

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
spend on electronics and even if he does
have<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> money<00:01:15.420> he<00:01:15.540> probably<00:01:15.689> don't<00:01:15.840> want<00:01:16.049> to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
have the money he probably don't want to

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.270 
have the money he probably don't want to
spend<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.380> electronics<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.130> don't

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
spend it on electronics I really don't

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.859 
spend it on electronics I really don't
know<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.520> none<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> my<00:01:17.729> business<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.810> do

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
know it's none of my business but I do

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.210 
know it's none of my business but I do
know<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.110> he<00:01:19.290> runs<00:01:19.409> these<00:01:19.590> speed<00:01:19.860> controls

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
know that he runs these speed controls

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.730 
know that he runs these speed controls
and<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:21.360> had<00:01:21.900> seen<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.140> he's<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.590> been

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.960 
things like that but I just thought it'd
be<00:02:49.260> cool<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.530> do<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.709> budget<00:02:49.890> build<00:02:50.220> overall

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
be cool to do a budget build overall

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.059 
be cool to do a budget build overall
overall<00:02:51.959> I'm<00:02:52.080> really<00:02:52.110> impressed<00:02:52.530> with<00:02:52.860> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
speed control for 42 bucks it's really

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.280 
speed control for 42 bucks it's really
hard<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.739> go<00:02:55.830> wrong<00:02:56.060> one<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.209> downsides<00:02:57.420> to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
hard to go wrong one of the downsides to

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
this stuff is that there is absolutely

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.420 
this stuff is that there is absolutely
no<00:03:00.510> instruction<00:03:00.989> whatsoever<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.220> doesn't

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
no instruction whatsoever so it doesn't

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.410 
no instruction whatsoever so it doesn't
even<00:03:02.489> tell<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.730> how<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.850> calibrate<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.390> to

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
even tell you how to calibrate it to

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.949 
even tell you how to calibrate it to
your<00:03:03.569> speedo

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
your speedo

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.840 
your speedo
luckily<00:03:04.680> Jared<00:03:05.190> knew<00:03:05.310> how<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.489> don't<00:03:05.670> know<00:03:05.760> if

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
luckily Jared knew how I don't know if

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.520 
luckily Jared knew how I don't know if
you<00:03:05.910> found<00:03:06.060> out<00:03:06.209> online<00:03:06.390> but<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.049> calibrates

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
you found out online but it calibrates

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.020 
you found out online but it calibrates
just<00:03:07.860> like<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.130> old<00:03:08.250> speed<00:03:08.459> patch<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.850> stuff

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
just like the old speed patch and stuff

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.090 
just like the old speed patch and stuff
you<00:03:09.540> just<00:03:09.569> hold<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.049> set<00:03:10.260> button<00:03:10.290> turn<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:10.860> on

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
you just hold the set button turn it on

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.830 
you just hold the set button turn it on
it<00:03:12.030> will<00:03:12.150> go<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.360> neutral

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
it will go to neutral

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.990 
it will go to neutral
hit<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.140> button<00:03:13.470> full<00:03:14.430> throttle<00:03:14.640> hit<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
hit the button full throttle hit the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.160 
hit the button full throttle hit the
button<00:03:15.239> full<00:03:15.450> brake<00:03:15.630> hit<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.810> button<00:03:16.049> it's

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
button full brake hit the button it's

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.870 
button full brake hit the button it's
really<00:03:16.530> really<00:03:16.739> simple<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.220> then<00:03:17.700> when<00:03:17.820> you

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
really really simple and then when you

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.280 
really really simple and then when you
plug<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.120> card<00:03:18.329> in<00:03:18.510> that's<00:03:18.690> really<00:03:18.930> simple<00:03:19.200> as

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
plug the card in that's really simple as

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.220 
plug the card in that's really simple as
well<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.739> overall<00:03:20.190> for<00:03:20.579> 42<00:03:21.209> bucks<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.989> just

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
well so overall for 42 bucks you just

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.990 
well so overall for 42 bucks you just
it's<00:03:22.859> hard<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.250> argue<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:23.549> that

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
it's hard to argue with that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.509 
it's hard to argue with that
so<00:03:24.630> let<00:03:24.870> me<00:03:24.959> let<00:03:25.470> me<00:03:25.500> show<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.130> quick<00:03:26.190> video

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:05.860 

a<00:03:54.330> lot<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.540> good

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:15.630 

little

Oh

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:34.560 

I<00:04:27.780> did

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.210 

okay<00:04:35.570> so<00:04:35.900> you've<00:04:36.140> seen<00:04:36.350> you've<00:04:36.920> heard<00:04:37.100> my

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
okay so you've seen you've heard my

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.410 
okay so you've seen you've heard my
opinion<00:04:37.250> on<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:37.760> speed<00:04:37.940> control

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
opinion on the speed control

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.880 
opinion on the speed control
you've<00:04:38.660> seen<00:04:38.870> me<00:04:38.990> open<00:04:39.170> the<00:04:39.260> box<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:39.590> see<00:04:39.770> what

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
you've seen me open the box you see what

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.210 
you've seen me open the box you see what
you<00:04:40.010> get<00:04:40.190> so<00:04:40.760> here's<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.090> question<00:04:42.160> why<00:04:43.160> would

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
you get so here's the question why would

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.830 
you get so here's the question why would
anybody<00:04:43.760> spend<00:04:45.040> $200<00:04:46.040> on<00:04:46.220> a<00:04:46.280> speed<00:04:46.520> control

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
anybody spend $200 on a speed control

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.840 
anybody spend $200 on a speed control
when<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:47.960> could<00:04:48.140> spend<00:04:48.380> forty<00:04:49.220> two<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:49.640> get

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
when you could spend forty two and get

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.050 
when you could spend forty two and get
something<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:50.300> works<00:04:50.780> nearly<00:04:51.560> as<00:04:51.850> good<00:04:52.850> if

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
something that works nearly as good if

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.160 
something that works nearly as good if
if<00:04:53.330> not<00:04:53.600> as<00:04:53.840> good<00:04:54.170> I<00:04:54.670> really<00:04:55.670> don't<00:04:55.850> know

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
if not as good I really don't know

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.200 
if not as good I really don't know
technology<00:04:57.170> is<00:04:57.200> just<00:04:57.320> coming<00:04:57.620> so<00:04:57.950> far<00:04:58.190> so<00:04:58.940> fast

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
technology is just coming so far so fast

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.720 
technology is just coming so far so fast
and<00:04:59.630> so<00:05:00.290> many<00:05:00.440> more<00:05:00.650> people<00:05:01.040> have<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.400> ability

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
and so many more people have the ability

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.720 
and so many more people have the ability
to<00:05:01.760> import<00:05:02.360> stuff<00:05:02.660> from<00:05:02.870> China<00:05:03.230> and<00:05:03.500> from

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
to import stuff from China and from

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.640 
to import stuff from China and from
Japan<00:05:04.730> that<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.780> technology<00:05:06.440> is<00:05:06.620> just

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
Japan that the technology is just

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.020 
Japan that the technology is just
getting<00:05:07.070> cheaper<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:07.580> cheaper<00:05:07.640> and<00:05:07.910> cheaper

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.790 
getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper
so<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:10.280> you<00:05:10.700> literally<00:05:11.150> could<00:05:11.420> buy<00:05:11.800> five

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
so the you literally could buy five

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.610 
so the you literally could buy five
these<00:05:13.250> be<00:05:13.460> controls<00:05:13.820> for<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.000> cost<00:05:14.240> of<00:05:14.390> one

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
these be controls for the cost of one

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.320 
these be controls for the cost of one

lrp flow work steam which by the way is

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.940 
lrp flow work steam which by the way is

mile<00:05:19.310> RP<00:05:19.520> speed<00:05:19.730> controls<00:05:20.080> but<00:05:21.080> are<00:05:21.200> they

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
mile RP speed controls but are they

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.930 
mile RP speed controls but are they
really<00:05:21.650> worth<00:05:21.920> is<00:05:22.190> it<00:05:22.370> really<00:05:22.580> worth<00:05:22.670> buying

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
really worth is it really worth buying

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.840 
really worth is it really worth buying

file<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.110> you<00:05:33.230> order<00:05:33.500> another<00:05:33.710> one<00:05:33.800> it's<00:05:34.100> just

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
file and you order another one it's just

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.760 
file and you order another one it's just
that<00:05:34.430> simple<00:05:34.690> support<00:05:35.690> that<00:05:36.230> really<00:05:36.500> doesn't

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
that simple support that really doesn't

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.820 
that simple support that really doesn't
exist<00:05:36.830> either<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:38.000> it<00:05:38.390> has<00:05:38.690> it's<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.410> upside

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
exist either so it has it's the upside

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.200 
exist either so it has it's the upside
is<00:05:40.040> that<00:05:40.070> it's<00:05:40.280> really<00:05:40.430> cheap<00:05:40.730> and<00:05:40.940> that<00:05:41.090> it's

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
is that it's really cheap and that it's

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.930 
is that it's really cheap and that it's
really<00:05:41.300> functional<00:05:42.020> the<00:05:42.320> downside<00:05:42.800> is<00:05:42.980> there

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
really functional the downside is there

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.120 
really functional the downside is there
really<00:05:44.420> is<00:05:44.720> no<00:05:44.960> warranty<00:05:45.380> there<00:05:45.590> really<00:05:45.740> is<00:05:45.950> no

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
really is no warranty there really is no

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.800 
really is no warranty there really is no

function<00:05:48.140> I<00:05:48.440> would<00:05:48.500> imagine<00:05:48.770> that<00:05:49.040> hobbyking

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
function I would imagine that hobbyking

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.220 
function I would imagine that hobbyking
would<00:05:49.910> probably<00:05:50.330> send<00:05:50.600> you<00:05:50.750> a<00:05:50.780> new<00:05:51.020> one

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
would probably send you a new one

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.130 
would probably send you a new one
or<00:05:51.430> at<00:05:52.430> least<00:05:52.460> refund<00:05:52.970> your<00:05:53.090> money<00:05:53.150> if<00:05:53.990> you

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
mail it back but depending on where you

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.070 
mail it back but depending on where you
get<00:05:56.390> it<00:05:56.450> from<00:05:56.510> if<00:05:56.690> you<00:05:56.750> get<00:05:56.870> it<00:05:56.930> from<00:05:57.020> the

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.270 
get it from if you get it from the
United<00:05:57.230> States<00:05:57.440> warehouse<00:05:57.800> that's<00:05:57.950> not<00:05:58.100> a<00:05:58.130> big

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
United States warehouse that's not a big

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.620 
United States warehouse that's not a big
deal<00:05:58.310> but<00:05:58.670> if<00:05:58.730> you<00:05:58.820> order<00:05:59.030> it<00:05:59.090> from<00:05:59.120> overseas

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
deal but if you order it from overseas

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.080 
deal but if you order it from overseas
like<00:05:59.870> I<00:06:00.050> ended<00:06:00.290> up<00:06:00.350> doing<00:06:00.500> on<00:06:00.770> accident<00:06:01.490> then

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
like I ended up doing on accident then

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.850 
like I ended up doing on accident then
it<00:06:02.720> would<00:06:02.900> just<00:06:02.930> be<00:06:03.140> too<00:06:03.290> expensive<00:06:03.470> to<00:06:03.680> mail

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
it would just be too expensive to mail

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.190 
it would just be too expensive to mail
back<00:06:04.040> probably<00:06:04.550> so<00:06:04.850> anyways<00:06:05.810> I<00:06:05.900> hope<00:06:06.020> you<00:06:06.110> guys
