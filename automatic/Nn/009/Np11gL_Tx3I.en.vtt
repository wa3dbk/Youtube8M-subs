YouTube so we're here to explain it to
you<00:00:10.710> first<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.309> all<00:00:11.429> most<00:00:12.120> people<00:00:12.269> aren't

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
you first of all most people aren't

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.749 
you first of all most people aren't
capable<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.650> hip<00:00:13.769> cleaning<00:00:14.130> it's<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.549> very

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
capable of hip cleaning it's a very

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.490 
capable of hip cleaning it's a very
small<00:00:15.000> percentage<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.630> does<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.960> that's<00:00:16.230> why

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
small percentage that does it that's why

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830 
small percentage that does it that's why
most<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.430> time<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:18.000> do<00:00:18.090> not<00:00:18.270> teach<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.720> hip

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
most of time you do not teach the hip

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.410 
most of time you do not teach the hip
clean<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.109> anybody<00:00:19.410> it's<00:00:19.619> usually<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.670> natural

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
clean to anybody it's usually a natural

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.320 
clean to anybody it's usually a natural
movement<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.650> real<00:00:22.980> hip<00:00:23.189> cleaner<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:24.060> if

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
movement for a real hip cleaner so if

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.640 
movement for a real hip cleaner so if
you<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.600> someone<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:24.930> naturally<00:00:25.320> does<00:00:25.500> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
you have someone that naturally does it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.710 
you have someone that naturally does it
that's<00:00:25.800> okay<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.400> recommend<00:00:27.060> not<00:00:27.330> teaching<00:00:27.630> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
that's okay I recommend not teaching it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.380 
that's okay I recommend not teaching it
to<00:00:27.810> anybody<00:00:28.080> though

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.500 

the<00:00:31.050> reason<00:00:31.440> why<00:00:31.790> people<00:00:32.790> hit<00:00:32.940> clean<00:00:33.180> like

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the reason why people hit clean like

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.479 
the reason why people hit clean like
myself<00:00:33.720> and<00:00:34.050> Spencer<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:35.010> generates<00:00:35.400> more

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
myself and Spencer is it generates more

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.930 
myself and Spencer is it generates more
force<00:00:36.060> to<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.480> hips<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.130> with<00:00:38.130> more<00:00:38.280> force<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
force to the hips and with more force it

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.910 
force to the hips and with more force it
increases<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.450> speed<00:00:39.630> of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> bars<00:00:40.050> faster

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
increases the speed of the bars faster

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.800 
increases the speed of the bars faster
you<00:00:41.040> calendar

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.870 

reasons<00:00:44.810> a<00:00:44.960> lot<00:00:44.990> of<00:00:45.110> people<00:00:45.200> can't<00:00:45.880> physically

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
reasons a lot of people can't physically

reasons a lot of people can't physically
hip<00:00:47.870> clean<00:00:48.110> is<00:00:48.320> because<00:00:48.950> it<00:00:49.100> takes<00:00:49.280> a<00:00:49.340> certain

a<00:00:58.360> common<00:00:59.360> misconception<00:00:59.720> that<00:01:00.580> people<00:01:01.580> think

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
a common misconception that people think

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.729 
a common misconception that people think
is<00:01:02.060> that<00:01:02.360> you're<00:01:02.570> pulling<00:01:02.870> with<00:01:03.110> your<00:01:03.290> arms

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
is that you're pulling with your arms

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.330 
is that you're pulling with your arms
the<00:01:04.070> whole<00:01:04.190> time<00:01:04.400> which<00:01:05.330> is<00:01:05.660> a<00:01:06.290> big<00:01:07.160> mistake

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
the whole time which is a big mistake

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.310 
the whole time which is a big mistake
you're<00:01:08.240> not<00:01:08.420> really<00:01:08.690> pulling<00:01:09.050> with<00:01:09.140> your<00:01:09.170> arms

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
you're not really pulling with your arms

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.990 
you're not really pulling with your arms
is<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.590> slight<00:01:09.890> band<00:01:10.190> to<00:01:10.430> generate<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:10.880> power

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
is a slight band to generate the power

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.570 
is a slight band to generate the power
from<00:01:11.330> hips<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.530> what<00:01:12.800> we're<00:01:12.920> going<00:01:13.010> to<00:01:13.070> do<00:01:13.250> is

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
we're going to discuss the difference

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.719 
we're going to discuss the difference
between<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:15.020> regular<00:01:15.200> cleaning<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:15.860> I<00:01:16.580> hip

once<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.530> bar<00:02:06.680> hits<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.100> hips<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.549> he<00:02:07.760> wraps

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
once the bar hits the hips and he wraps

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.020 
once the bar hits the hips and he wraps
so<00:02:08.720> there's<00:02:08.929> only<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.229> small<00:02:09.619> pool<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.459> get<00:02:10.640> to

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
so there's only a small pool to get to

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.640 
so there's only a small pool to get to
the<00:02:11.120> hip<00:02:11.299> now<00:02:11.600> we're<00:02:11.780> going<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:11.959> show<00:02:12.140> regular

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
the hip now we're going to show regular

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.280 
the hip now we're going to show regular
clean<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.160> show<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.549> difference<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:14.810> regular

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
clean and show the difference so regular

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.050 
clean and show the difference so regular
clean<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.799> only<00:02:16.100> real<00:02:16.280> difference<00:02:16.459> is<00:02:16.850> he's

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
clean the only real difference is he's

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.060 
clean the only real difference is he's
going<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.269> keep<00:02:17.420> his<00:02:17.570> arms<00:02:17.930> straight<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.440> the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
going to keep his arms straight and the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.009 
going to keep his arms straight and the
bar<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:19.549> going<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.760> hit<00:02:19.880> high<00:02:20.180> by<00:02:20.510> instead

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
bar is just going to hit high by instead

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:40.210 
bar is just going to hit high by instead
of<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.200> hip<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.170> notice<00:02:39.620> with<00:02:39.739> Spencer

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
of the hip so you notice with Spencer

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.310 
of the hip so you notice with Spencer
the<00:02:40.610> bar<00:02:40.850> when<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.480> heat<00:02:41.720> regularly<00:02:42.110> cleans

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
the bar when the heat regularly cleans

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.740 
the bar when the heat regularly cleans
and<00:02:42.440> hip<00:02:42.650> cleans<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.130> only<00:02:43.610> about<00:02:43.970> an<00:02:44.329> inch<00:02:44.510> and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
and hip cleans is only about an inch and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.509 
and hip cleans is only about an inch and
a<00:02:44.780> half<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:45.110> two<00:02:45.260> inches<00:02:45.290> difference<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.489> a

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
a half to two inches difference so a

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.670 
a half to two inches difference so a
real<00:02:46.910> hip<00:02:47.150> cleaner<00:02:47.390> hits<00:02:47.750> actually<00:02:48.019> really

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
real hip cleaner hits actually really

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.410 
real hip cleaner hits actually really
high<00:02:48.829> thigh<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.400> lot<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.880> people<00:02:50.120> think<00:02:50.299> is<00:02:50.390> a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
high thigh a lot of people think is a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.729 
high thigh a lot of people think is a
big<00:02:50.660> difference<00:02:50.810> because<00:02:51.260> they<00:02:51.350> tend<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.590> hit

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
big difference because they tend to hit

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.830 
big difference because they tend to hit
a<00:02:51.769> little<00:02:51.980> lower<00:02:52.280> but<00:02:53.150> they<00:02:53.390> should<00:02:53.660> be

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
a little lower but they should be

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:05.160 
a little lower but they should be
hitting<00:02:54.019> -<00:02:54.500> naturally

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.630 

a<00:03:05.200> lot<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.740> people<00:03:06.040> when<00:03:06.190> they<00:03:06.280> try<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.490> hit

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
a lot of people when they try to hit

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.850 
a lot of people when they try to hit
plate<00:03:06.880> I'm<00:03:07.120> going<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.020> do<00:03:08.140> what<00:03:08.350> we<00:03:08.440> call<00:03:08.620> kind

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
plate I'm going to do what we call kind

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.340 
plate I'm going to do what we call kind
of<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.070> bent<00:03:09.280> over<00:03:09.430> row<00:03:09.670> clean<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.810> from<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
of a bent over row clean so from the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.930 
of a bent over row clean so from the
knee<00:03:11.530> they're<00:03:11.920> going<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.130> stop<00:03:12.310> raising<00:03:12.850> the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
knee they're going to stop raising the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.050 
knee they're going to stop raising the
chest<00:03:13.210> and<00:03:13.390> just<00:03:14.080> pull<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.590> with<00:03:14.710> all<00:03:14.980> arms<00:03:15.580> and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
chest and just pull it with all arms and

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.430 
chest and just pull it with all arms and
what<00:03:16.240> happens<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:16.810> when<00:03:16.960> you<00:03:17.080> pull<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.350> with

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
what happens is when you pull it with

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.070 
what happens is when you pull it with
all<00:03:17.620> arms<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.520> decrease<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.570> force<00:03:19.720> from<00:03:19.930> the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
all arms you decrease the force from the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.990 
all arms you decrease the force from the
hips<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.590> that's<00:03:21.220> why<00:03:21.370> we<00:03:21.520> don't<00:03:21.610> teach<00:03:21.820> the

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
hips and that's why we don't teach the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.880 
hips and that's why we don't teach the
hip<00:03:22.120> clean<00:03:22.300> no<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.450> lot<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.660> people<00:03:22.900> so<00:03:23.500> expense
