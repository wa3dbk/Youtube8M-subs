00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.109 
or program files x86 but for me it's a
normal<00:02:02.369> program<00:02:02.759> files<00:02:03.000> go<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> max<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:05.119> and

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
normal program files go to max on and

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.240 
normal program files go to max on and
then<00:02:06.360> set<00:02:06.899> off<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.200> D<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.560> then<00:02:08.099> go<00:02:08.220> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
then set off for D and then go to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.690 
then set off for D and then go to
plugins<00:02:08.750> but<00:02:09.750> uh<00:02:09.800> that's<00:02:10.800> actually<00:02:11.310> not<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
plugins but uh that's actually not the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.670

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
thing we're going to use and actually

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.080 
thing we're going to use and actually
this<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.950> plugin<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.700> supposed<00:02:14.940> to

this is the plugin that is supposed to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.699 
this is the plugin that is supposed to
go<00:02:15.209> in<00:02:15.360> here<00:02:15.540> I'll<00:02:15.780> put<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.290> link<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
want to do you don't want to put it in

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.449 
want to do you don't want to put it in
here<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:21.000> mean<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.599> can<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.319> mean<00:02:22.980> do<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
here I mean you can but I mean do that

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.970 
here I mean you can but I mean do that
first<00:02:23.730> if<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.270> plugin<00:02:24.540> doesn't<00:02:24.810> show<00:02:24.959> up<00:02:24.989> then

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
first if the plugin doesn't show up then

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.680 
first if the plugin doesn't show up then
you<00:02:26.099> have<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.340> do<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:26.700> way<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.239> this<00:02:27.569> is

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
you have to do it this way so this is

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.729 
you have to do it this way so this is
going<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.840> be<00:02:27.959> kind<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.230> second<00:02:28.470> resort

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
going to be kind of a second resort

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.530 
going to be kind of a second resort
otherwise<00:02:29.520> what<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.760> do<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.209> drag

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
otherwise what you do is you just drag

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.900 
otherwise what you do is you just drag
this<00:02:30.750> into<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.319> folder<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.430> what<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.790> want

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910

4d

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.920 

so<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.269> got<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.540> go<00:02:39.599> through<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:41.900> 64-bit<00:02:42.900> or

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
so I got to go through this 64-bit or

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.920 
so I got to go through this 64-bit or
32-bit<00:02:43.049> depending<00:02:43.920> on<00:02:43.980> your<00:02:44.040> computer<00:02:44.459> and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
32-bit depending on your computer and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.030 
32-bit depending on your computer and
just<00:02:45.930> wait<00:02:46.049> for<00:02:46.079> it<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.290> load<00:02:46.469> this<00:02:46.739> might<00:02:46.920> take

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
just wait for it to load this might take

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.759 
just wait for it to load this might take
a<00:02:47.099> little<00:02:47.159> while<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:48.469> don't<00:02:49.469> think<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.680> will

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
a little while but I don't think it will

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.039 
a little while but I don't think it will
because<00:02:50.189> they'll<00:02:50.370> have<00:02:50.519> much<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.879> I<00:02:50.939> but
