claims to be a Rubik's Cube whiz Hey
look<00:00:12.840> at<00:00:12.990> that

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259

was I have him show us how fast he can
solve<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.830> rubik's<00:00:20.130> cube<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.400> how<00:00:20.550> fast<00:00:20.820> can<00:00:21.090> you

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
solve a rubik's cube so how fast can you

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.779 
solve a rubik's cube so how fast can you
solve<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> rubik's<00:00:21.869> cube<00:00:22.020> my<00:00:22.740> record<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.220> 3<00:00:23.250> 7

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
solve a rubik's cube my record is 3 7

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.519 
solve a rubik's cube my record is 3 7
seconds<00:00:24.359> ok<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.660> here's<00:00:24.960> what<00:00:25.080> I've<00:00:25.170> got<00:00:25.199> I've

got my iPhone which has got a timer and
then<00:00:28.199> obviously<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.830> rubik's<00:00:29.250> cube<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:30.029> could

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
then obviously a rubik's cube you could

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.630 
then obviously a rubik's cube you could
see<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.380> properly<00:00:31.800> shuffled<00:00:32.430> you
