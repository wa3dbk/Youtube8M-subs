00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
us from plugging in banana plugs and

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.399 
us from plugging in banana plugs and
it's<00:00:21.550> quite<00:00:21.789> simple<00:00:22.240> I<00:00:22.449> tend<00:00:22.929> to<00:00:22.960> use<00:00:23.050> a<00:00:23.140> wood

screw half a turn and then just pull and
air<00:00:26.319> they<00:00:26.439> become<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:28.060> actual<00:00:28.329> connections

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
air they become the actual connections

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
to the high frequency of the tweeter now

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.450 
to the high frequency of the tweeter now
the<00:01:47.080> first<00:01:47.380> thing<00:01:47.530> we<00:01:47.650> need<00:01:47.800> to<00:01:47.830> do<00:01:48.100> is<00:01:48.340> to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
the first thing we need to do is to

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.100 
the first thing we need to do is to
actually<00:01:48.730> remove<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.360> bridging<00:01:49.750> links<00:01:49.990> of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
actually remove the bridging links of

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.590 
actually remove the bridging links of
the<00:01:50.230> speaker<00:01:50.650> if<00:01:50.860> we<00:01:50.950> don't<00:01:51.430> you<00:01:51.970> could<00:01:52.300> cause

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
the speaker if we don't you could cause

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.810 
the speaker if we don't you could cause
damage<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.140> amplifier<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:54.430> now<00:01:54.760> the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
damage to the amplifier and now the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.160 
damage to the amplifier and now the
links<00:01:55.120> are<00:01:55.240> gone<00:01:55.420> we're<00:01:55.660> ready<00:01:55.870> to<00:01:55.930> actually

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
links are gone we're ready to actually

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.170 
links are gone we're ready to actually
connect<00:01:56.710> up<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.010> speakers<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.640> amplifier

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
connect up the speakers to the amplifier

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.550 
connect up the speakers to the amplifier
and<00:01:58.480> what<00:01:58.660> I'm<00:01:58.750> going<00:01:58.930> to<00:01:58.960> do<00:01:59.140> here<00:01:59.440> is

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
and what I'm going to do here is

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.280 
and what I'm going to do here is
actually<00:01:59.710> use<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.640> front<00:02:01.060> smart<00:02:01.480> speakers

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
actually use the front smart speakers

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.660 
actually use the front smart speakers
I'm<00:02:02.500> actually<00:02:02.710> going<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.040> run<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.490> base

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
I'm actually going to run to the base

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.790 
I'm actually going to run to the base
drivers<00:02:04.180> now<00:02:04.660> technically<00:02:05.140> there's<00:02:05.620> no

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
drivers now technically there's no

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.460 
drivers now technically there's no
reason<00:02:06.310> why<00:02:06.880> I<00:02:06.910> should<00:02:07.300> use<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.750> front<00:02:08.050> right

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
reason why I should use the front right

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.820 
reason why I should use the front right
or<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:10.119> bio<00:02:10.360> mode<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.260> surround<00:02:11.620> back

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
or in the bio mode the surround back

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.130 
or in the bio mode the surround back
right<00:02:12.160> because<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.060> signal<00:02:13.450> from<00:02:13.960> the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
right because the signal from the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.980 
right because the signal from the
amplifier<00:02:14.770> is<00:02:15.010> exactly<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.970> same<00:02:16.210> over<00:02:16.810> both

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
amplifier is exactly the same over both

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.729 
amplifier is exactly the same over both
outputs

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.770 
outputs
the<00:02:17.920> only<00:02:18.069> difference<00:02:18.579> happens<00:02:19.060> inside<00:02:19.569> the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
the only difference happens inside the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.020 
the only difference happens inside the
speaker<00:02:20.200> where<00:02:20.409> the<00:02:20.500> crossover<00:02:21.189> separates

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
speaker where the crossover separates

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.209 
speaker where the crossover separates
the<00:02:22.239> relevant<00:02:22.719> frequency<00:02:23.409> for<00:02:23.859> the<00:02:23.980> relevant

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219 
the relevant frequency for the relevant

the relevant frequency for the relevant
driver<00:02:24.549> and<00:02:25.450> then<00:02:25.599> with<00:02:25.840> our<00:02:25.870> other<00:02:26.140> amplifier

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
driver and then with our other amplifier

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.069 
driver and then with our other amplifier
channel<00:02:27.159> which<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:27.549> the<00:02:28.120> right-hand<00:02:28.659> surround

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
channel which is the right-hand surround

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.140 
channel which is the right-hand surround
back<00:02:29.379> I'm<00:02:29.709> going<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.459> run<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.939> the<00:02:31.030> high

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
back I'm going to run to the high

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.660 
back I'm going to run to the high
frequencies<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:31.989> then<00:02:32.439> that's<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:33.370> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
frequencies and then that's it the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.879 
frequencies and then that's it the
actual<00:02:34.000> speaker<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.750> configured<00:02:35.409> in<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.620> by

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:35.889 
actual speaker is configured in a by

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.339 
actual speaker is configured in a by
wire<00:02:36.310> configuration<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.810> we<00:02:37.959> are<00:02:38.109> by

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
wire configuration but we are by

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.979 
wire configuration but we are by
amplifying<00:02:39.099> it<00:02:39.400> from<00:02:39.939> the<00:02:40.209> amplifier<00:02:40.719> the

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
amplifying it from the amplifier the

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.500 
amplifying it from the amplifier the
sonic<00:02:41.590> benefit<00:02:42.099> of<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.579> is<00:02:42.879> the<00:02:43.150> fact<00:02:43.389> that

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
sonic benefit of this is the fact that

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.660 
sonic benefit of this is the fact that
each<00:02:43.840> drive<00:02:44.230> unit<00:02:44.709> now<00:02:44.950> has<00:02:45.189> its<00:02:45.400> own

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
each drive unit now has its own

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.729 
each drive unit now has its own
dedicated<00:02:46.530> amplifier

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
dedicated amplifier

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.369 
dedicated amplifier
therefore<00:02:48.250> dynamics<00:02:48.849> openness<00:02:49.659> and<00:02:49.930> detail

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
therefore dynamics openness and detail

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.390 
therefore dynamics openness and detail
are<00:02:50.560> greatly<00:02:50.799> improved

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
are greatly improved

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.220 
are greatly improved
now<00:02:51.819> mechanically<00:02:52.450> we're<00:02:52.750> all<00:02:52.870> actually

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
now mechanically we're all actually

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.960 
now mechanically we're all actually
connected<00:02:53.709> now<00:02:53.919> we've<00:02:54.189> got<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.459> amplifier

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
connected now we've got the amplifier

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.030 
connected now we've got the amplifier
connected<00:02:55.419> to<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.290> base<00:02:56.530> part<00:02:56.889> of<00:02:56.950> the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
connected to the base part of the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.979 
connected to the base part of the
speaker<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.730> on<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.419> second<00:02:58.780> set<00:02:58.930> of

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
speaker and on the second set of

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.170 
speaker and on the second set of
channels<00:02:59.409> we've<00:02:59.980> got<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.669> tweeters

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
channels we've got the tweeters

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.330 
channels we've got the tweeters
connected<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.959> amplifier<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.620> then<00:03:03.069> all

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
connected to the amplifier and then all

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.759 
connected to the amplifier and then all
you<00:03:03.489> need<00:03:03.639> to<00:03:03.760> do<00:03:03.939> is<00:03:04.209> mimic<00:03:04.689> the<00:03:05.109> set<00:03:05.349> up<00:03:05.560> on

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
you need to do is mimic the set up on

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.129 
you need to do is mimic the set up on
the<00:03:06.310> other<00:03:06.430> speaker<00:03:06.909> and<00:03:07.090> that's<00:03:07.480> it<00:03:07.750> will

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
the other speaker and that's it will

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.470 
the other speaker and that's it will
actually<00:03:08.409> done<00:03:08.950> as<00:03:09.280> far<00:03:09.669> as<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.939> hook-up<00:03:10.419> is

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
actually done as far as the hook-up is

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.790 
actually done as far as the hook-up is
concerned

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.740 

now<00:03:16.340> we<00:03:16.400> need<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:16.970> actually<00:03:17.060> change<00:03:17.270> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
now we need to actually change the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.400 
now we need to actually change the
settings<00:03:18.230> within<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:19.160> setup<00:03:19.640> of<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.300> TX<00:03:20.660> NR<00:03:21.020> 6
