00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.720
 Every second German has shoulder pain at least once a year 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.800
 or neck pain you even know every day 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:12.429
 and in many cases it is not enough to simply take one tablet 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.669
 Man is just as diverse as his pain 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.160
 the one tablet 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.779
 mostly the anti-inflammatory drug solves the aspirin or something similar that 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.119
 not all problems there are quite different types of pain 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.360
 Anti-inflammatory drugs only make sense when inflammation is used 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.749
 Various other causes of muscle tension can be cause 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.530
 Dysfunction of the ligaments of the muscles of the joints can cause 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.120
 his 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.210
 Mental problems can cause his or her muscular system to become so 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.470
 Seismograph for our soul and reflects what is with us each 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.120
 walk and where it all wants to solve with a tablet there 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.870
 It fails simply and simply it means pain therapy had causes 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.760
 analyze and it must be based on the targeted APIN 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.540
 to offer 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.230
 at the two first southwest German pain days at 23 Schmandt 24 Stockton 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.780
 one of the Wertinger Stadthalle 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.000
 it turns that too has mainly around the shoulder and shoulder 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Neck pain and possible therapies 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.369
 already in the week before the pain will be days from 19 to 22 7 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.000
 Patients in open surgery Pain therapies offered to touch 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.990
 For example, shock wave therapy will be presented 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 she actually wanted to develop and smash gallstones or kidney stones 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.520
 if parents are seen it too, they could work in a rudimentary way 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.250
 therefore it is increasingly learned 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.650
 that one is generated by this mechanical pressure wave and the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.480
 Body is transported and indeed very deeply transported in the body 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.090
 can 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.160
 that one can activate with this pressure wave of the receptors in the scenes 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.610
 which trigger a relaxation course flex of the muscles and thus occurred 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.540
 All muscular disorders treat very effectively without that only 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.450
 A sting must be stung without having to inject 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.119
 on the other hand, the patient will have acupuncture in acupuncture 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.600
 Pain medicine has now found a permanent place 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 Interested parties can try the Bio Feedback procedure themselves 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.880
 Here, the muscle tension is made visible and we then work with the 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.879
 Patient that he learns what makes the tension high 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.199
 but that too we can reduce the tension 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.199
 So for example by targeted tension of the muscles 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:25.659
 a 20 second holder then relax for those with deep relaxation or 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.219
 The thoughts control muscles in the moment that closes the eyes 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:34.979
 always something pleasant thinks the voltage can be significantly reduced 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:38.819
 Of course you can learn or control this feedback and no 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.659
 learn to harness this for daily life so much 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.179
 Feedback is not easy, let's see how it goes for beer feedback 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.279
 we have the possibility that the patient is on himself 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:54.019
 How he can influence all the help he creates creates help 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.659
 to help yourself that you can control yourself better that is the goal of 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:58.849
 you feedback 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.549
 If pain stays online, it means one for the affected 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.949
 enormous loss of quality of life 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:09.099
 Therefore, the quality of life and not necessarily the freedom from pain that is 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.729
 The goal of sensible pain therapies 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:16.279
 the patient forum at the 23th Snoek Thoma in the GÃ¶ppinger Stadthalle begins at 18 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.119
 Clock
