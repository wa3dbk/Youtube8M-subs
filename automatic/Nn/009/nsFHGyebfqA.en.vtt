00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
another anime with a Tokyo ghoul I guess

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.430 
another anime with a Tokyo ghoul I guess
hashtag<00:00:40.610> Tokyo<00:00:40.910> ghoul<00:00:41.120> even<00:00:41.899> though<00:00:42.050> it

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
hashtag Tokyo ghoul even though it

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.979 
hashtag Tokyo ghoul even though it
wasn't<00:00:42.560> all<00:00:42.739> right<00:00:42.950> out<00:00:43.100> of<00:00:43.130> Miami<00:00:43.989> season

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
wasn't all right out of Miami season

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.930 
wasn't all right out of Miami season
sooo<00:00:45.260> they<00:00:45.860> didn't<00:00:46.100> really<00:00:46.190> show<00:00:46.399> kaneki<00:00:46.820> all

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
sooo they didn't really show kaneki all

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.819 
sooo they didn't really show kaneki all
that<00:00:47.060> much<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:47.540> kaneki<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:48.380> really<00:00:48.649> didn't

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
that much and kaneki you really didn't

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.049 
that much and kaneki you really didn't
really<00:00:48.980> do<00:00:49.130> anything<00:00:49.340> in<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:49.640> first<00:00:49.790> season

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
really do anything in the first season

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.790 
really do anything in the first season
and<00:00:50.329> they<00:00:50.480> kind<00:00:50.660> of<00:00:50.720> switched<00:00:50.960> through<00:00:51.620> a<00:00:51.680> lot

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
and they kind of switched through a lot

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.200 
and they kind of switched through a lot
of<00:00:51.920> characters<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:52.340> I<00:00:52.520> think<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.820> little<00:00:53.030> bit

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
of characters that I think a little bit

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.030 
of characters that I think a little bit
too<00:00:53.329> much<00:00:53.540> nation<00:00:54.230> is<00:00:54.320> pretty<00:00:54.530> cool<00:00:54.649> but

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
too much nation is pretty cool but

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.979 
too much nation is pretty cool but
anyway<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:55.969> what<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.210> server<00:00:56.420> is<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.960> server

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
anyway so what the server is a server

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.290 
anyway so what the server is a server
that<00:00:57.920> has<00:00:58.219> everything<00:00:58.579> to<00:00:58.760> do<00:00:58.880> it<00:00:58.910> out<00:00:59.090> of<00:00:59.210> me

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
that has everything to do it out of me

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.209 
that has everything to do it out of me
without<00:00:59.690> any<00:00:59.840> on<00:01:00.050> here<00:01:00.290> so<00:01:00.770> they<00:01:00.920> have<00:01:00.950> data
