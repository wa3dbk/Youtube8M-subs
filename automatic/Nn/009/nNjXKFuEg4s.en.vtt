flower boxes way down there and then if

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.650 
flower boxes way down there and then if
you<00:00:24.750> wait<00:00:24.990> up<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.849> you<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:27.000> get<00:00:27.119> off<00:00:27.300> quite<00:00:27.630> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.120 

and<00:00:38.050> even<00:00:38.260> though<00:00:38.350> you're<00:00:38.530> white<00:00:38.740> out<00:00:38.920> in<00:00:39.040> the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
open the helicopter won't shoot you so

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.910 
open the helicopter won't shoot you so
give<00:00:43.360> your<00:00:43.480> teammates<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.050> command<00:00:44.380> to<00:00:44.620> shoot

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
shooting it yourself and it usually

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.140 
shooting it yourself and it usually
doesn't<00:00:50.470> go<00:00:50.500> down<00:00:50.590> that<00:00:50.830> quickly<00:00:51.070> which<00:00:51.880> means

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
doesn't go down that quickly which means

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.380 
doesn't go down that quickly which means
that<00:00:52.270> my<00:00:52.540> teammates<00:00:53.020> actually<00:00:53.800> shot<00:00:54.130> it<00:00:54.390> with

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
that my teammates actually shot it with

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.600

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
checkpoint here because I didn't take

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.430 
checkpoint here because I didn't take
out<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.530> helicopter<00:01:26.770> on<00:01:27.130> my<00:01:27.280> first<00:01:27.490> try<00:01:27.729> so

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
out the helicopter on my first try so

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.500 
out the helicopter on my first try so
those<00:01:29.440> two<00:01:29.680> teeth<00:01:29.890> those<00:01:30.220> two<00:01:30.430> enemies<00:01:30.790> which

those two teeth those two enemies which

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.469 
those two teeth those two enemies which
I<00:01:31.690> killed<00:01:32.050> in<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:33.010> last<00:01:33.160> video<00:01:33.479> have

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
I killed in the last video have

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.240 
I killed in the last video have
reappeared<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:37.440> it's<00:01:38.440> just<00:01:38.650> a<00:01:38.740> weird<00:01:38.920> glitch

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
reappeared and it's just a weird glitch

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.930 
reappeared and it's just a weird glitch
that<00:01:39.460> happens<00:01:39.759> in<00:01:39.910> this<00:01:39.940> in<00:01:40.690> this<00:01:40.929> level<00:01:41.170> and

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
that happens in this in this level and

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.550 
that happens in this in this level and
there's<00:01:42.940> one<00:01:43.179> more<00:01:43.240> section<00:01:43.660> I<00:01:43.869> think<00:01:44.140> in<00:01:44.410> the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
there's one more section I think in the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.010 
there's one more section I think in the
video<00:01:44.830> or<00:01:45.330> in<00:01:46.330> this<00:01:46.630> level<00:01:46.960> in<00:01:47.140> my<00:01:48.100> videos<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
video or in this level in my videos that

00:01:50.020 --> 00:02:08.930 
video or in this level in my videos that
that<00:01:50.590> happens

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.540 

so<00:02:09.570> send<00:02:10.020> your<00:02:10.080> cipher<00:02:10.350> over<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.190> water

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
so send your cipher over to the water

00:02:11.550 --> 00:03:19.340 
so send your cipher over to the water
facility<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.540> scan<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.930> top<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.290> building

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.050 

there's<00:03:19.980> going<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.190> be<00:03:20.220> two<00:03:20.520> guys<00:03:20.730> in<00:03:20.940> that

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
there's going to be two guys in that

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.880 
there's going to be two guys in that
little<00:03:21.330> shack<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.960> your<00:03:22.080> left<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
little shack to your left that the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.570 
little shack to your left that the
cypher<00:03:23.370> didn't<00:03:23.670> pick<00:03:23.880> up<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:25.190> that's<00:03:26.190> two

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
cypher didn't pick up and that's two

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.130 
cypher didn't pick up and that's two
more<00:03:26.790> enemies<00:03:27.210> that<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:27.810> going<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.960> have<00:03:28.050> to

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
more enemies that I'm going to have to

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.700 
more enemies that I'm going to have to
kill<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.440> second<00:03:28.890> time<00:03:29.040> because<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.510> died<00:03:31.080> after

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
kill a second time because I died after

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.540 
kill a second time because I died after
the<00:03:31.740> end<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.100> video<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:35.280> it's<00:03:35.460> just

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
the end of this video so it's just

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.470 
the end of this video so it's just
something<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:35.940> keep<00:03:36.060> in<00:03:36.180> mind

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.420 

luckily<00:03:42.379> they're<00:03:42.650> not<00:03:42.830> too<00:03:42.980> difficult<00:03:43.159> to

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
luckily they're not too difficult to

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.089 
luckily they're not too difficult to
kill<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:44.230> try<00:03:45.230> not<00:03:45.349> to<00:03:45.409> shoot<00:03:45.650> your<00:03:45.739> teammate

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
kill and try not to shoot your teammate

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:56.430 
kill and try not to shoot your teammate
in<00:03:46.159> the<00:03:46.220> process<00:03:46.640> which<00:03:47.150> I<00:03:47.330> think<00:03:47.599> I<00:03:47.690> just<00:03:47.720> did

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:07.410 

let's<00:03:57.070> go

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.030 

take<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.450> cover
