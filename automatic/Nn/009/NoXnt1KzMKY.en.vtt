00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.830
 The books that bacteria are formally very rapidly 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.680
 So, the KFDA can make only enough 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 We recommend eating 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:26.330
 Of course , it may be cumbersome and worn out , but the day after that, 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.330
 It seems to be necessary to play with the restaurant owners to provide

 Here are the domestic and import dreams , respectively .

 Yes, it looks pretty good. 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.190
 There are a lot of bad beans in the middle of the import park . 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.190
 There's a lot of difference at first glance. 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:07.280
 But if you change the bean, it will not be good for 9000 or 9 minutes. 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:13.090
 It 's a good thing that I put my own beans in the grind. 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.090
 In most restaurants, you make a study of beans and rules made with the factory. 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.390
 It's soy sauce, soy sauce . 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.590
 I will make soy beans in water and make bean google.

 Even when you look at the relationship graph is also visible 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.890
 And this is a soybean soup made by directly grinding soy beans . 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.890
 Yes 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.509
 It does not make much difference from the eyes. 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.509
 I'll try it. 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.520
 It is soybean paste that made soybean flour first. 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.140
 I mush 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.420

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.310
 Next time, I will try to make a supply of soy beans. 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.040
 I'm completely bored. 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.480
 The difference between the two flavors is totally sue. 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.069
 It looks like 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.069
 There is no sweet taste or anything like that. 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.889
 0 degree horizontal geotinde grated think what to do anyway, such as soybeans 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.060
 May be 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:15.910
 But if you change soybeans , good vegetable fat should be easy to live. 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.910
 I will 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.600
