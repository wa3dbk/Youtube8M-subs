00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.820
 hello everyone so I'm going to make a 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.040
 little tutorial to explain how 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.520
 to make a small workbench with little 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.160
 equipment 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.410
 so there among others I 'll do so 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.950
 a workbench with three low pallets of 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.329
 paypal type 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.900
 so I chose this type of pallets 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:18.490
 because she was pretty sturdy enough 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.080
 count three whole palettes and 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.300
 then after bomb at two small ends 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.789
 just to actually have this type of 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.550
 board that will allow you to do in 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.080
 made a plateau three years ago to have 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.330
 a lot of material just by 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.079
 example of bad a jigsaw a 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.520
 screwdriver a few screws to do it 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.670
 roll up your establishment I took 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.520
 so four casters so two fixed and 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.910
 then a rotary wheel with 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.960
 with a brake and then well this type of 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.270
 pallets have of course we can 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.489
 take other pallets from range 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.710
 lower is just after question 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.750
 weight and then good bah ease of having 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.760
 this type of pallets so to start 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.449
 it's simple we're going to put together these 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.719
 three pallets 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.730
 so I'll show them to you so here we go 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.110
 and to dispose them as well ie 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.659
 so you take a palette that you 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.670
 so put it horizontally full and 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.310
 then your two palettes you the 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.659
 so put vertically you put 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.909
 for example so feet towards 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.200
 inside and flanks of the pallet 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.520
 inside so in fact that makes you 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.570
 have a kind of good what if you 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.979
 Then then want with a 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.020
 two with big cities so you 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.149
 take 4 for example you come to you 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.280
 put here you can do a before 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.229
 holes like I 'm doing you put a 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.990
 vi and then you try to put 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.560
 it's just to have a happiness that quid 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.560
 so 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.460
 so that's once it's done in 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.520
 does you already have a structure when 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.259
 even stiff enough that moves a lot 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.819
 less and after in fact you just need to 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.039
 cut out so compared to your pallets 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.479
 take actually to actually 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.850
 little trays so good bah you 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.350
 measure roughly and then so you 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.049
 actually cut out just a part 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.360
 top of a plateau to get in 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.290
 makes strips to affix them 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.290
 between the toilets 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.049
 so that gives you pretty much this type of 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.819
 result so you see I just 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.410
 has two platters cut that I am 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.900
 come to ask so on the lower part and 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.989
 the inner part thus maintained already 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.280
 a name that thanks to the foot of the pallet 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.900
 is then then the two trays do not 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.510
 will not allow to store either the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.180
 material simply to store 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.829
 business then you have more than 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.930
 life so these two parts ensure 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.880
 feet so that's good here you go 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.880
 Take screws nails matter 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.239
 so good bah for me so tarpaulin vs 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.230
 name that I rather opt for screws 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:16.360
 my heart story to get a 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.459
 pretty solid structure good me me I 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.660
 am made a small room 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.940
 extra with notches since 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.260
 bomb to the thickness of my pallet does 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.400
 did not really correspond to our co 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.459
 plateau so I'm going to life that's all 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.510
 just like that 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.250
 so that's why I passed you the 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.930
 detail I did not pose so but of screws 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.459
 I cut so we already get a 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.930
 structure so that much more rigid 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.170
 who already looks a bit more like a little 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.030
 apron a small workshop dreaming fishing 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.230
 to put squares or other whose 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.269
 you go from a structure so that 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.410
 is still pretty sturdy who does not 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.420
 do not move sincerely 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.799
 in addition if you opt for the type of 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.660
 pallets and pale you have a structure 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.430
 stiff enough aulas I'm just going 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.260
 return the workbench so here I am 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.700
 read it nice to me back and so I 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.150
 let's start so affixed down but 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.310
 castors 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.910
 so I 'm going to just put some rigid 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.940
 next door and then bamert wheels 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.780
 so rotating with the brake all 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.780
 simply from the other 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.920
 so here are my four wheels are 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.630
 asked therefore my two fixed and my two 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.320
 rotary with brakes I still have more 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.320
 than to return the palette 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.400
 and here it is, so it's over with 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.720
 my little wheels with the brakes a 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.000
 little sander a little bit of 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.700
 azure no matter poorly established and then 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.010
 So here we go to establish 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.520
 helmand have gone for 20 to 25 minutes 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.600
 to do it 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.240
 it's going very fast so it rolls no 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.680
 problem it turns right on the left a 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.750
 small established a little shot of the measure 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.530
 to import it's over here go good 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.530
 courage to all goodbye
