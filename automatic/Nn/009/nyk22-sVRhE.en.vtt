the magnet ring so I'll now need to

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.260 
the magnet ring so I'll now need to
measure<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.960> gap<00:03:12.170> at<00:03:12.380> its<00:03:12.530> largest<00:03:12.830> point<00:03:13.270> now

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
measure the gap at its largest point now

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.780

if the gap is greater than 60,000 s you

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.160 
if the gap is greater than 60,000 s you
want<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.060> remove<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.510> gear<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.900> place<00:03:18.140> a
