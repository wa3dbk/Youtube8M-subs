00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
is Sharpedo now the reason this Pokemon

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.770 
is Sharpedo now the reason this Pokemon
is<00:00:57.420> important<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.620> because<00:00:59.570> look<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.660> his

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
is important is because look at his

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.870 
is important is because look at his
stats<00:01:02.239> where<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.359> nature<00:01:03.780> nothing<00:01:04.229> special

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
stats where is nature nothing special

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:18.990 
stats where is nature nothing special
but<00:01:07.189> sorry<00:01:08.189> start

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.480 

the<00:01:20.000> solids<00:01:20.360> trading<00:01:20.720> over<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.490> electabuzz

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
the solids trading over and electabuzz

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.070 
the solids trading over and electabuzz
from<00:01:23.330> my<00:01:24.170> leafy<00:01:24.500> version<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:26.630> he<00:01:26.900> was<00:01:27.050> a

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
from my leafy version and so he was a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.430 
from my leafy version and so he was a
little<00:01:27.230> about<00:01:27.530> 57<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:29.420> what<00:01:29.930> sucks<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.380> that

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
little about 57 and what sucks is that

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.070 
little about 57 and what sucks is that
was<00:01:30.970> holding<00:01:31.970> an<00:01:32.060> amulet<00:01:32.480> coin<00:01:32.870> I<00:01:33.760> traded<00:01:34.760> him
