00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:11.790
 Kyocera was founded in 1959 in Kyoto Japan 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:16.840
 founded and therefore comes the name 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.540
 kyoto ceramics kyoto ceramics doctors 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.790
 scientists and engineers use 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.180
 ceramic components for bones 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.820
 implants space vehicles racing cars and 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.950
 other extreme applications where components 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.850
 made of metal the loads are not 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.040
 have grown 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.120
 but let's start with that first 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.219
 material itself 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.120
 The raw material is stored in storage facilities 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.390
 won 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.100
 cleaned and especially as this mass 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.219
 then dried and it emerges 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.859
 extremely fine powder this pure loose 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.420
 Powder is now filled in molds and 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.510
 under an extremely high mechanical 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.909
 pressure of up to 300 tons too 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.640
 knife blades pressed at special 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:00.069
 sound hp can sound even pressure 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.870
 go up to 20,000 tons 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:03.670
 the found parts become then 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.040
 stacked and burned 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.920
 prepared at temperatures of over 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.460
 1000 degrees becomes the material in the oven 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.159
 burned 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.380
 This process is called one can see 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.479
 exact control of the burning time as well 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.850
 the burning temperature is there 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.680
 crucial for the later quality 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.659
 the sound will eventually be the 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.700
 sound in rotating with 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.159
 silicon carbide filled containers 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.920
 polished old familiar are rounded off 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.140
 and the kyocera logo comes with a 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.570
 laser blade on the applied ceramic 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.670
 with a diamond band is now the 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.710
 schneide knew about one 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.079
 continuously constant angle 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.689
 achieving it is a precise 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.430
 rhythmic movement becomes important afterwards 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.830
 they sound like an extremely one 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.600
 diamond sparkle world 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.940
 nod and for safe handling 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.890
 Be the top and the end 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.410
 rounded off to the conclusion is the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.670
 Cutting edge worked around the extreme 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.490
 to achieve sharpness 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.950
 every finished kyocera knife has to be done now 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.700
 an extremely strict quality control 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.130
 run through 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.650
 The shock test ensures that the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.200
 the bell is perfect and error free 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.020
 cutting test shows a kyocera 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.370
 knife is continuous 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.740
 razor-sharp and at the end 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.810
 another important test every knife 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.970
 Must be from the usual at airports 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.340
 metal detectors are detected 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.560
 Only now can the knives be for the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.480
 Transport to be packed to you 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.850
 let's get a knife closer 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.890
 consider taking it in hand and 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.180
 grab hold of the creates so that 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.030
 the fingers enclose him 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.000
 so they cut evenly at all times 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.970
 and without effort and they feel like 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.130
 light and comfortable the knife is whether 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.830
 Now you have a simple salad for two 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.920
 or prepare a lavish feast 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.300
 the kyocera ceramic products save you 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.920
 time and effort 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.440
 they are an amazing new one 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.360
 experience for you discover which

 new versatile advantages to them 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.000
 Ceramics can now become universal 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.230
 planel hold him firmly by the handle and 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.070
 push it lightly on the 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.440
 working surface 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.170
 This product is one of the bestsellers 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.180
 from the kyocera kitchens accessories it

 like to expand the range 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.700
 also with the ceramic sailer from kyocera 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.500
 the blade is made of the same 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.870
 high quality ceramics 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.090
 as with the measuring while working 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.360
 they use him as they want to 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.490
 body away or away from the body you see 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.520
 how easy the blade is over the carrot 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.250
 this kitchen tool makes that slip 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.650
 which has so far been laboriously easy and fast 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.380
 and simple and all that, too 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.450
 still dishwasher safe ceramic is 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.180
 completely insensitive to in 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.390
 food- grade acids 16 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.030
 oiling or salting ceramics does not rust 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.550
 and is tasteless and in the 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.250
 Contrary to stainless steel there 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.260
 ceramic no metal ions or others 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.720
 contaminants to the food 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.650
 so it does not change their smell 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.260
 taste or appearance ceramics is level
