00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:09.990
 and found what peta teaches peace 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.090
 well yes that piet indeed indeed it 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.400
 seems really easy 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.639
 his legs were busser happened to him 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.639
 for a while 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.030
 another four and a half kilometers 35 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:35.190
 Seconds therefore assume that they do 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.190
 hold for at least 20 25 seconds 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.140
 also gets something starting here 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.140
 extra support with the camp of astana 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.829
 report the net with a day of rest as well 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.609
 seen or taken over from an acquisition 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:56.379
 Durbridge curd cheese which is not there anymore 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.379
 further on are those meanwhile clare 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.729
 you have people that and uh yes I think 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.729
 that we have a little 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.869
 three man as I thought then seen 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.060
 still have park resistant for 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.440
 we also saw vermote zig zag 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.750
 very special was that he let himself be 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.490
 therefore bass drum just drive away 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.979
 look again there are fewer moments 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.750
 because of letting something run then the other must 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.899
 with dissolving 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.990
 and that also happens when you 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.149
 tries to squeeze some in between 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.340
 Jacob when Iessa Patina is now on 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:38.750
 they like the wheel of the lamprei man 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.250
 of course not too much to each other 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.530
 start looking because there is at the back 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.210
 still something slightly more courses 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.200
 the men from lampre merida are there 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.539
 with perhaps at bottle of cimolai 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.630
 will indeed both be modulo 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:56.630
 n all the time been old 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.719
 milan-san remo not disputed 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.740
 The question is whether you are all sufficient 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.460
 level 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.460
 calms to participate 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.660
 yes already a couple and tappers in the 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.670
 three-day history to his name 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.200
 still writes music by name 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.340
 the front runners 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.989
 and are not that especially the men of 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.000
 katusha who was allowed to do the turn 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.230
 I like the bie I would be downright 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.810
 my chances 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.000
 yes you have to do it once in your life 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.200
 do a lot for simba go and wait 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.670
 I think so 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.590
 which was an acceleration of the hearing 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.780
 flow to the ear, the money was 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.340
 obviously created by i knew on the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.420
 beagle that was immediately seen with 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.680
 one on the wheel 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.930
 and in this way that is now one 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.250
 react a little bit to each other 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.250
 very very alert 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.209
 the bie together with jasper stuyven a 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.890
 little door the best of his direction 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.870
 who show up from that unclear euro 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.349
 that and uncle danny that are in your eye 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.349
 to watch 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.370
 counter from backwards in the camp of 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.370
 bmc 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.209
 we will respond quickly 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:12.030
 is that q 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.920
 that should be possible and ate yes and bake 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.870
 did you demarcate what is that too little 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.389
 on that is still the toll for that 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.430
 effort from just now with a crystall 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.040
 on the wheel it can all be redone 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.689
 and bleeding again yes there will come 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.599
 a few turns 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.310
 you could possibly benefit from it 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.790
 if you have good cornering technology and 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.590
 the week and he has that with that bass 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.079
 drum thereby thinking that that is a man 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.129
 these things must have had together together 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:44.099
 a bringing together well now have the self 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:47.389
 pace so I assume they will 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.389
 draw the buster cards 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.389
 it is also fast 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.159
 we are tram and two puppies 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.819
 the bie now stay it and determine the 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.980
 Next behind this is going extremely fast now 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:02.519
 what will remain at the back quickly a 30 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:07.290
 seconds you see of well below 2 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:12.690
 km and km 7 yet what is the peace tram too 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:16.410
 now you can approach the border now 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.459
 200 but we shouldn't have that 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.490
 my bass drum goes through y I think 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.110
 until the job coming 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.060
 we try not to go too fast 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.920
 lose no risk of bright 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.360
 get damn damn base and salt the 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.360
 order in store 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.430
 all the way and km 3 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:41.160
 then has to switch again or he already has 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:44.490
 crystal again in the wheel and the buster the 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.980
 still in sixth place 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.850
 buffering that in gent-wevelgem fifth 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.260
 works 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.730
 yes that is the questions is logical 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.960
 shopping and you can go in for a while 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.410
 the wheel doesn't have food but then 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.130
 'm fresh you still much sitting can 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.130
 disappoint 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.490
 bistro shelf gas 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.969
 by no means the flickr lamp that way 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.499
 they can also orientate extra 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.349
 but again what is the third time that 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:20.219
 they are coming now we will be in the wheel 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.219
 from kristof 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.680
 just need to see that it comes on time 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.509
 to guess your dust not late not late 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.099
 leaving is definitely one 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.930
 very difficult situation here 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.490
 it's a falling line then you are 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.099
 seen 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.939
 you should be anticipating times, the 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:39.639
 pace now take a very tight turn 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:41.650
 then we go to the last bend and 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.180
 do you come across a note that 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.990
 you indeed go together there 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.360
 inside by christoph catches him 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.169
 debusschere against crystall the door or the 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.419
 Belgian champion 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.129
 it is the norwegian which is 100 meters from the 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.289
 pull the strip strongly forward and 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:58.120
 debusschere he fails it's alexander 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.469
 Kristoff's figure is going to win in Sat. 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.169
 none for debusschere and the roller and 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:05.439
 with the die and grab and not the head here 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.509
 bass drum that enjoyed the sixth place 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:09.129
 line and now seconds counter 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.110
 important seconds they come the 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:13.900
 do not recommend it we are a piece or 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.150
 eleven twelve away from your will could 10 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.689
 seconds boy modification that are already 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.870
 within 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:22.419
 that too sad or like that 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.029
 can participate a good times 3 I think 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.740
 that you can is who is coming 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:28.750
 can he still stay out of the grip yes that 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.800
 will of course do that or 25 meters from 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.920
 The battle is now in here 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:38.010
 indeed then 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:41.430
 and d but then taking the measure of the 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.550
 rest of it all tons can still peter the 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.550
 young ones
