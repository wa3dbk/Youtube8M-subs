00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
the division division is like the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.020 
the division division is like the
typical<00:02:39.390> technique<00:02:40.020> used<00:02:40.440> by<00:02:40.730> those<00:02:41.730> who

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
typical technique used by those who

typical technique used by those who
governess<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.770> they're<00:02:44.370> dividing<00:02:44.910> every<00:02:45.360> at

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
governess and they're dividing every at

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.540 
governess and they're dividing every at
every<00:02:45.840> possible<00:02:46.290> level<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.830> now<00:02:47.040> they<00:02:47.520> have

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
every possible level and now they have

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.630 
every possible level and now they have
reached<00:02:48.030> our<00:02:48.630> very<00:02:49.020> family<00:02:49.470> circles<00:02:49.980> at<00:02:50.520> the
