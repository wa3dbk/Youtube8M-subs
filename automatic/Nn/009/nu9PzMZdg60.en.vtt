is often what they're referring to now

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.870 
is often what they're referring to now
this<00:00:17.200> bloom<00:00:17.529> these<00:00:17.950> things<00:00:18.220> I<00:00:18.400> just<00:00:18.430> picked

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
this bloom these things I just picked

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.880 
this bloom these things I just picked
these<00:00:19.000> up<00:00:19.060> from<00:00:19.420> a<00:00:19.510> friend<00:00:19.630> of<00:00:19.810> mine<00:00:20.020> and<00:00:20.289> I'm

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
these up from a friend of mine and I'm

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.179 
these up from a friend of mine and I'm
actually<00:00:21.160> going<00:00:21.430> to<00:00:21.490> propagate<00:00:21.789> this<00:00:22.919> so<00:00:23.919> that

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
actually going to propagate this so that

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.519 
actually going to propagate this so that
the<00:00:24.340> bloom<00:00:24.610> is<00:00:24.840> usually<00:00:25.840> really<00:00:26.230> really

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
the bloom is usually really really

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.170 
the bloom is usually really really
really<00:00:26.890> white<00:00:27.220> and<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.640> only<00:00:27.759> reason<00:00:28.000> that

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
really white and the only reason that

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.970 
really white and the only reason that
this<00:00:28.300> one<00:00:28.509> is<00:00:28.630> not<00:00:28.869> is<00:00:29.140> because<00:00:29.529> in<00:00:29.829> the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
this one is not is because in the

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.800 
this one is not is because in the
nursery<00:00:30.400> they<00:00:30.550> were<00:00:30.610> packed<00:00:30.939> together<00:00:31.119> so

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
nursery they were packed together so

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.780 
nursery they were packed together so
this<00:00:32.019> thing<00:00:32.230> hasn't<00:00:32.650> seen<00:00:32.890> any<00:00:33.100> Sun<00:00:33.489> all

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790

really really white I mean spectacular

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.619 
really really white I mean spectacular
white<00:00:44.470> and<00:00:44.710> then<00:00:45.370> as<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.970> bloom<00:00:46.180> starts<00:00:46.540> to

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
white and then as the bloom starts to

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.539 
white and then as the bloom starts to
fail<00:00:46.839> it<00:00:47.140> turns<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:47.500> little<00:00:47.769> bit<00:00:47.890> pink<00:00:48.159> and<00:00:48.460> then

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:48.549 
fail it turns a little bit pink and then

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.460 
fail it turns a little bit pink and then
will<00:00:48.729> get<00:00:48.850> brown<00:00:49.150> a<00:00:49.479> lot<00:00:49.839> of<00:00:49.930> people<00:00:50.229> collect

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
will get brown a lot of people collect

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.410 
will get brown a lot of people collect
these<00:00:50.620> things<00:00:50.680> and<00:00:51.159> they<00:00:51.250> actually<00:00:51.699> let<00:00:52.299> them

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
these things and they actually let them

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.780 
these things and they actually let them
dry<00:00:52.720> this<00:00:53.320> one<00:00:53.559> is<00:00:53.710> broke<00:00:54.010> off<00:00:54.250> so<00:00:54.519> I'm<00:00:54.580> going

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
dry this one is broke off so I'm going

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.170 
dry this one is broke off so I'm going
to<00:00:54.820> snap<00:00:55.180> that<00:00:55.210> off<00:00:55.720> but<00:00:56.140> again<00:00:56.850> very<00:00:57.850> very

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
to snap that off but again very very

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.200 
to snap that off but again very very
white<00:00:58.540> big<00:00:58.960> snowball<00:00:59.830> type<00:01:00.129> flower<00:01:00.430> now

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
white big snowball type flower now

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.590 
white big snowball type flower now
Annabelle<00:01:01.720> hydrangea<00:01:02.470> is<00:01:02.650> in<00:01:03.400> the<00:01:03.850> like<00:01:04.420> in

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
Annabelle hydrangea is in the like in

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.000 
Annabelle hydrangea is in the like in
the<00:01:04.720> PG<00:01:05.110> paniculata

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
the PG paniculata

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.490 
the PG paniculata
family<00:01:06.580> and<00:01:06.820> it's<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.600> it's<00:01:08.140> one<00:01:08.350> of<00:01:08.439> the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
family and it's a it's one of the

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.010 
family and it's a it's one of the
hydrangeas<00:01:09.070> that<00:01:09.100> blooms<00:01:09.610> on<00:01:10.000> on<00:01:10.390> current

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
hydrangeas that blooms on on current

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.109 
hydrangeas that blooms on on current
growth<00:01:11.320> so<00:01:11.650> in<00:01:11.740> other<00:01:11.860> words<00:01:12.189> all<00:01:12.610> of<00:01:12.970> this

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
growth so in other words all of this

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.170 
growth so in other words all of this
growth<00:01:13.479> is<00:01:13.810> new<00:01:14.770> growth<00:01:15.070> this<00:01:15.520> growing<00:01:15.820> season

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
growth is new growth this growing season

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.840 
growth is new growth this growing season
so<00:01:16.840> on<00:01:16.990> this<00:01:17.229> particular<00:01:17.409> stem<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.400> can<00:01:18.580> see

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
so on this particular stem you can see

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.240 
so on this particular stem you can see
this<00:01:19.420> grew<00:01:19.750> from<00:01:19.960> all<00:01:20.109> the<00:01:20.229> way<00:01:20.320> down<00:01:20.590> here<00:01:21.100> and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
this grew from all the way down here and

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.899 
this grew from all the way down here and
then<00:01:21.310> in<00:01:22.030> August<00:01:22.240> it<00:01:22.960> stops<00:01:23.469> growing<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.460> then

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
then in August it stops growing and then

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.120 
then in August it stops growing and then
it<00:01:25.060> starts<00:01:25.420> making<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.990> flower<00:01:26.229> button<00:01:26.799> that's

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
it starts making a flower button that's

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.709 
it starts making a flower button that's
the<00:01:27.280> advantage<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.939> these<00:01:28.090> is<00:01:28.390> that<00:01:28.570> they

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
the advantage of these is that they

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.469 
the advantage of these is that they
always<00:01:28.990> bloom<00:01:29.560> because<00:01:30.549> your<00:01:30.850> flower<00:01:31.119> buds

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
always bloom because your flower buds

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.359 
always bloom because your flower buds
don't<00:01:31.780> freeze<00:01:32.170> over<00:01:32.499> the<00:01:32.590> winter<00:01:32.890> like<00:01:33.100> like

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
don't freeze over the winter like like

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.730 
don't freeze over the winter like like
they<00:01:33.490> do<00:01:33.549> with<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.820> macrophylla<00:01:34.740> varieties

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
they do with the macrophylla varieties

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.910 
they do with the macrophylla varieties
like<00:01:36.810> nickel<00:01:37.810> blue<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.320> some<00:01:38.499> of<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.710> reds

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
like nickel blue and some of the reds

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.649 
like nickel blue and some of the reds
and<00:01:39.189> really<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:39.820> know<00:01:39.880> some<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.299> those<00:01:40.359> unique

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
and really you know some of those unique

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.349 
and really you know some of those unique
varieties<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:42.189> that<00:01:42.429> that's<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.850> big

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:43.359 
varieties so that that's a big

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.480 
varieties so that that's a big
difference<00:01:43.749> this<00:01:43.869> is<00:01:44.079> they<00:01:44.469> bloom<00:01:44.859> on<00:01:45.039> current

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
difference this is they bloom on current

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.660 
difference this is they bloom on current
growth<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:47.200> propagating<00:01:48.069> this<00:01:48.249> thing<00:01:48.490> is

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
growth so propagating this thing is

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.660 
growth so propagating this thing is
really<00:01:49.090> easy<00:01:49.329> to<00:01:49.630> do<00:01:50.069> we're<00:01:51.069> going<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.310> remove

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
really easy to do we're going to remove

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.940 
really easy to do we're going to remove
the<00:01:51.880> flower<00:01:52.119> bud<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:55.719> can<00:01:56.200> actually<00:01:56.409> get<00:01:56.890> a

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
the flower bud and I can actually get a

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.679 
the flower bud and I can actually get a
couple<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.579> cuttings<00:01:57.969> out<00:01:58.179> of<00:01:58.329> here<00:01:58.509> that

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
couple of cuttings out of here that

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.919 
couple of cuttings out of here that
really<00:01:59.079> is<00:01:59.259> going<00:01:59.679> to<00:01:59.770> be<00:01:59.889> a<00:01:59.920> cutting<00:02:00.399> now<00:02:01.149> if<00:02:01.719> I

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
really is going to be a cutting now if I

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.109 
really is going to be a cutting now if I
but<00:02:02.229> I'm<00:02:02.319> really<00:02:02.619> going<00:02:02.799> to<00:02:02.829> do<00:02:03.100> these<00:02:03.310> because

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
but I'm really going to do these because

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.539 
but I'm really going to do these because
it's<00:02:04.929> almost<00:02:05.289> September<00:02:05.859> I'm<00:02:06.009> going<00:02:06.189> to<00:02:06.249> treat

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
it's almost September I'm going to treat

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.880 
it's almost September I'm going to treat
them<00:02:06.789> like<00:02:06.819> hardwood<00:02:07.479> cuttings<00:02:07.719> so<00:02:08.080> I'm<00:02:08.560> what

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
them like hardwood cuttings so I'm what

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.559 
them like hardwood cuttings so I'm what
I'm<00:02:09.039> going<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.310> do<00:02:09.520> we're<00:02:10.000> going<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.210> take<00:02:10.420> this

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
I'm going to do we're going to take this

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.420 
I'm going to do we're going to take this
whole<00:02:10.810> stock<00:02:11.170> off<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.800> then<00:02:11.920> right<00:02:12.190> below

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
whole stock off and then right below

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.580 
whole stock off and then right below
every<00:02:13.120> leaf<00:02:13.360> node<00:02:13.690> like<00:02:14.110> right<00:02:14.319> here<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.560> a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
every leaf node like right here is a

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.309 
every leaf node like right here is a
leaf<00:02:14.830> no<00:02:15.069> we're<00:02:15.730> going<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:15.910> cut<00:02:16.209> below<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.959> so

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
leaf no we're going to cut below that so

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.390 
leaf no we're going to cut below that so
basically<00:02:17.920> on<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:18.459> one<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.650> this<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.220> your

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
basically on this one so this is your

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.950 
basically on this one so this is your
leaf<00:02:21.580> node<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:22.240> I'm<00:02:22.390> going<00:02:22.569> to<00:02:22.660> make<00:02:22.810> my

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
leaf node so I'm going to make my

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.010 
leaf node so I'm going to make my
cutting<00:02:23.380> right<00:02:23.590> below<00:02:24.070> that<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:24.820> leave<00:02:25.780> my

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
cutting right below that and leave my

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.350 
cutting right below that and leave my
leaves<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.650> I'll<00:02:27.130> probably<00:02:27.370> typically<00:02:28.210> end

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
leaves and I'll probably typically end

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.500 
leaves and I'll probably typically end
up

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
up

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.119 
up
I<00:02:28.540> don't<00:02:28.989> want<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.200> ruin<00:02:29.409> a<00:02:29.500> bunch<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.769> cuttings

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
I don't want to ruin a bunch of cuttings

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.449 
I don't want to ruin a bunch of cuttings
because<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:30.370> want<00:02:30.640> them<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.470> basically<00:02:32.709> I

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
because I want them so so basically I

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.780 
because I want them so so basically I
would<00:02:34.209> cut<00:02:34.510> right<00:02:34.810> here<00:02:35.680> let<00:02:36.220> me<00:02:36.250> get<00:02:36.400> my<00:02:36.519> hand

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
would cut right here let me get my hand

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.059 
would cut right here let me get my hand
out<00:02:36.879> of<00:02:36.939> the<00:02:37.060> way<00:02:37.180> right<00:02:37.930> below<00:02:38.409> where<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:38.890> bud

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
out of the way right below where the bud

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.160 
out of the way right below where the bud
break<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.970> that's<00:02:40.510> going<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.810> be<00:02:40.959> my

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
break is and that's going to be my

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.600 
break is and that's going to be my
cutting<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.739> then<00:02:41.799> I'll<00:02:41.980> cut<00:02:42.189> it<00:02:42.280> right<00:02:42.459> up

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
cutting and then I'll cut it right up

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.970 
cutting and then I'll cut it right up
here<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:43.569> we'll<00:02:43.780> have<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> cutting<00:02:44.409> up<00:02:44.560> here<00:02:44.860> as

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
here so we'll have a cutting up here as

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.680 
here so we'll have a cutting up here as
well<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:45.489> let<00:02:45.640> me<00:02:45.730> let<00:02:46.000> me<00:02:46.090> cut<00:02:46.329> it<00:02:46.450> cuz<00:02:46.569> we're

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
well so let me let me cut it cuz we're

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.800 
well so let me let me cut it cuz we're
going<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.870> make<00:02:47.019> these<00:02:47.230> today<00:02:48.329> so<00:02:49.329> I'm<00:02:49.659> going

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
to remove the flower bud but maybe if I

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.399 
to remove the flower bud but maybe if I
remove<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:53.980> selectively<00:02:58.049> there's<00:02:59.049> Leafs

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.559 
these two leaves and then this will be
my<00:03:10.930> cutting<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:11.579> I'm<00:03:12.579> gonna<00:03:12.730> pop<00:03:12.940> these<00:03:13.239> two

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
my cutting so I'm gonna pop these two

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.319 
my cutting so I'm gonna pop these two
