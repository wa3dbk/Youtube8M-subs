00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.100 
can unroll this while we're here and
that<00:01:23.910> when<00:01:24.910> it's<00:01:25.090> glitching<00:01:25.360> away<00:01:25.720> from<00:01:25.960> the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
that when it's glitching away from the

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.359 
that when it's glitching away from the
wall<00:01:26.289> it<00:01:26.470> really<00:01:26.710> looks<00:01:26.890> like<00:01:27.070> they're<00:01:27.220> just

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
wall it really looks like they're just

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.350 
wall it really looks like they're just
humping<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.789> air

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.810 

so<00:01:35.360> I<00:01:35.900> absolutely<00:01:36.890> no<00:01:37.070> idea<00:01:37.220> where<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.640> bomb

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
so I absolutely no idea where the bomb

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.520 
so I absolutely no idea where the bomb
rocks<00:01:38.120> are<00:01:38.330> in<00:01:38.420> this<00:01:38.510> level<00:01:38.720> which<00:01:38.990> is<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.140> real

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
rocks are in this level which is a real

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.440 
rocks are in this level which is a real
shame<00:01:39.560> because<00:01:40.010> they're<00:01:40.580> like<00:01:40.760> thousands

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
shame because they're like thousands

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.360 
shame because they're like thousands
upon<00:01:41.720> thousands<00:01:42.410> of<00:01:42.530> bomb<00:01:42.740> rock<00:01:43.010> doors

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
upon thousands of bomb rock doors

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.710 
upon thousands of bomb rock doors
everywhere<00:01:45.310> ok<00:01:46.310> maybe<00:01:46.460> not<00:01:46.730> thousands<00:01:47.510> oh

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
everywhere ok maybe not thousands oh

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.690 
everywhere ok maybe not thousands oh
this<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.170> just<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.440> ramp<00:01:48.710> down<00:01:48.980> that's<00:01:49.370> pretty

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
this is just a ramp down that's pretty

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.220 
this is just a ramp down that's pretty
useful<00:01:49.940> I<00:01:50.270> think<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:50.600> need<00:01:50.720> it<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:51.020> bring

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
useful I think you need it to bring

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.110 
useful I think you need it to bring
treasures<00:01:51.680> up<00:01:51.860> or<00:01:52.040> something<00:01:52.490> or<00:01:52.820> at<00:01:53.090> least

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
treasures up or something or at least

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.950 
treasures up or something or at least
shortens<00:01:53.930> that<00:01:54.200> way<00:01:56.260> maybe<00:01:57.260> this<00:01:57.530> will<00:01:57.710> help

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
shortens that way maybe this will help

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.270 
shortens that way maybe this will help
it's<00:01:59.960> another<00:02:00.230> ramp<00:02:00.560> down<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:01.670> looks<00:02:01.850> like<00:02:01.970> it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
it's another ramp down it looks like it

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.350 
it's another ramp down it looks like it
all<00:02:04.280> right<00:02:04.490> so<00:02:04.640> now<00:02:04.760> we<00:02:04.820> have<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.060> pretty<00:02:05.300> clear

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
all right so now we have a pretty clear

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.520 
all right so now we have a pretty clear
path<00:02:05.870> up<00:02:07.420> it's<00:02:08.420> much<00:02:08.720> clearer<00:02:09.050> after<00:02:09.290> that

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
path up it's much clearer after that

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.290 
path up it's much clearer after that
bomb<00:02:09.740> Rock<00:02:10.010> door<00:02:10.250> is<00:02:10.369> done<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.820> course<00:02:11.060> I

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
bomb Rock door is done and of course I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.300 
bomb Rock door is done and of course I
like<00:02:11.510> in<00:02:11.780> my<00:02:11.840> initial<00:02:12.260> playthrough<00:02:12.950> got<00:02:13.130> that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
like in my initial playthrough got that

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.580 
like in my initial playthrough got that
on<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.580> very<00:02:13.760> last<00:02:14.060> day<00:02:15.970> but<00:02:16.970> whatever<00:02:17.590> we're

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
on the very last day but whatever we're

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.010 
on the very last day but whatever we're
making<00:02:18.950> acceptable<00:02:19.790> progress<00:02:20.390> here<00:02:23.020> really

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
making acceptable progress here really

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.449 
making acceptable progress here really
get<00:02:24.260> an<00:02:24.470> abundance<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.280> tarts<00:02:25.910> but<00:02:27.459> I'm

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
get an abundance of tarts but I'm

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.460 
get an abundance of tarts but I'm
certainly<00:02:29.030> clearing<00:02:29.570> things<00:02:29.750> out<00:02:30.080> and

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
certainly clearing things out and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.050 
certainly clearing things out and
although<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.250> would<00:02:31.340> have<00:02:31.430> been<00:02:31.520> nice<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.760> get

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
although it would have been nice to get

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.910 
although it would have been nice to get
the<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:34.340> thing<00:02:34.870> it's<00:02:35.870> not<00:02:36.350> really<00:02:36.709> going<00:02:36.800> to

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
the this thing it's not really going to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
the this thing it's not really going to
make<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.130> huge<00:02:37.220> difference

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.440 

so<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.750> gave<00:02:44.930> her<00:02:45.020> killing<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.530> picnic<00:02:48.010> first

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
so you gave her killing a picnic first
