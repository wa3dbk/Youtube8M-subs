 andré to keep on the market what is 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.829
 that the entrepreneur should keep in mind 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.479
 first is to know the product a lot 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.400
 time to sell a product and not 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:17.269
 meet and every flower 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.549
 each plant has its own 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.870
 specializations are appropriate in a plant 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.940
 and plant for the sun the plant for 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.919
 plant shade that can cause a lot of 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.430
 then you have to know how to sell the 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.250
 product with 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.800
 both for the customer who is at home 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.169
 has that vein of entrepreneur you 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.639
 advises to enter the market and open a 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.710
 flower shop 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.690
 first you have to like the product as 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.570
 I said just when the flower and the 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.880
 plant, but a living being, then it is a 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.220
 market that has room for everyone 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.979
 which is a market that has its profit 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.930
 sure but it's more interesting study is 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.560
 know and enjoy taking care of plants and 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.750
 flowers and will start what is the value is 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.860
 investment that must take place there 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.720
 contribution 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.820
 this depends very much on the structure 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.380
 you will ride with but I believe there 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.620
 20 thousand and you can open a 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.620
 flower shop
