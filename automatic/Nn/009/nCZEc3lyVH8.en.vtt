let us get our hands on up just a little

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.300 
let us get our hands on up just a little
bit<00:02:42.930> earlier<00:02:43.350> than<00:02:43.530> everybody<00:02:43.769> else<00:02:44.100> out

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
bit earlier than everybody else out

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.670 
bit earlier than everybody else out
there<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.790> world<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.360> put<00:02:46.260> through<00:02:46.590> their

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
there the world and put through their

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.190 
there the world and put through their
paces<00:02:46.739> here<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.760> i<00:02:48.120> think<00:02:48.600> they<00:02:48.720> figure<00:02:49.080> if

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
paces here and I i think they figure if

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.670 
paces here and I i think they figure if
they<00:02:49.350> can<00:02:49.500> survive<00:02:49.680> here<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:52.140> our<00:02:52.440> work

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
they can survive here and our work

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.259 
they can survive here and our work
environment<00:02:53.400> there's<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.760> pretty<00:02:54.030> good<00:02:54.120> chance
