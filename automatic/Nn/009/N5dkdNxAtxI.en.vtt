00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.119 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.630> that<00:00:00.810> it's<00:00:00.960> only<00:00:01.110> normal<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.920> feel

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
I think that it's only normal to feel

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.970 
I think that it's only normal to feel
this<00:00:02.190> way<00:00:02.689> sometimes<00:00:03.689> it<00:00:03.990> is<00:00:04.110> better<00:00:04.350> not<00:00:04.740> to

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
this way sometimes it is better not to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.070 
this way sometimes it is better not to
have<00:00:05.009> an<00:00:05.279> alternative<00:00:05.910> so<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:06.930> are

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
have an alternative so that you are

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.650 
have an alternative so that you are
forced<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.529> do<00:00:07.740> one<00:00:08.010> thing<00:00:08.280> only<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:09.599> is

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
forced to do one thing only and this is

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.990 
forced to do one thing only and this is
something<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.469> would<00:00:10.679> love<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:11.040> do<00:00:11.190> because<00:00:11.969> I

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
something I would love to do because I

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.600 
something I would love to do because I
would<00:00:12.150> still<00:00:12.660> be<00:00:12.809> part<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.380> club<00:00:13.610> training

the<00:00:14.700> youngsters<00:00:15.240> would<00:00:15.719> be<00:00:15.870> an<00:00:15.990> immense

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
the youngsters would be an immense

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.859 
the youngsters would be an immense
satisfaction<00:00:17.330> especially<00:00:18.330> at<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.510> beginning

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
satisfaction especially at the beginning

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.710 
satisfaction especially at the beginning
but<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.100> other<00:00:20.220> hand<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:20.910> still<00:00:21.510> have

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
but on the other hand I do still have

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.810 
but on the other hand I do still have
the<00:00:21.869> option<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.260> keep<00:00:22.560> playing<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.130> Serie<00:00:23.369> Rd

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the option to keep playing in Serie Rd

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.700
