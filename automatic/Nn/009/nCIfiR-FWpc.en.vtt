00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
preference pane right down there and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.000 
preference pane right down there and
when<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> click<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.020> get<00:00:46.410> all<00:00:46.620> my<00:00:46.649> options

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
when I click on it I get all my options

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.910 
when I click on it I get all my options
for<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.520> program<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.660> all<00:00:49.050> these<00:00:49.379> options<00:00:49.800> i'm

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
for the program so all these options i'm

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.080 
for the program so all these options i'm
not<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.219> go<00:00:50.280> through<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.610> some<00:00:50.969> them

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
not going to go through but some them

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.430 
not going to go through but some them
are<00:00:51.210> blanked<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.629> because<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.199> don't<00:00:52.350> have

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
are blanked out because you don't have

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.830 
are blanked out because you don't have
the<00:00:52.649> full<00:00:52.800> version<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.420> right<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> can

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the full version and right here you can

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.029 
the full version and right here you can
purchase<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.170> license<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> full<00:00:55.949> version

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
purchase a license for the full version

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.540 
purchase a license for the full version
and<00:00:58.399> so<00:01:00.500> pretty<00:01:01.500> much<00:01:01.590> these<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> only

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and so pretty much these are the only

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.889 
and so pretty much these are the only
two<00:01:02.760> options<00:01:02.789> i<00:01:03.239> think<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.690> need<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
two options i think you really need to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.420 
two options i think you really need to
mess<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.350> beginning<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.280> need

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
mess with at the beginning is you need

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.649 
mess with at the beginning is you need
to<00:01:05.460> make<00:01:05.610> sure<00:01:05.640> these<00:01:05.970> both<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.360> checked<00:01:06.540> off

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
to make sure these both are checked off

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.660 
to make sure these both are checked off
because<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.380> want<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.710> be<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.520> make<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
because you want it to be it to make it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.039 
because you want it to be it to make it
easy<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.689> double-click

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
easy so that you can just double-click

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.649 
easy so that you can just double-click
on<00:01:10.290> any<00:01:10.350> video<00:01:10.799> that's<00:01:11.070> WMV<00:01:11.670> format<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.570> is

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
on any video that's WMV format and it is

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.980 
on any video that's WMV format and it is
unlikely<00:01:13.200> open<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:15.390> want<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> play<00:01:15.869> it

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
unlikely open and you want it to play it

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.270 
unlikely open and you want it to play it
avi<00:01:16.259> files<00:01:16.560> probably<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:18.439> so<00:01:19.439> that's<00:01:19.740> not

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
avi files probably and so that's not

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.039 
avi files probably and so that's not
that<00:01:20.640> important<00:01:21.150> now<00:01:21.659> I'm<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.679 
that important now I'm just going to
show<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.380> guys<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.979> actually<00:01:23.220> works

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
show you guys that it actually works

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.060 
show you guys that it actually works
