00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.890

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.120
 welcome to my channels i am nicco 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.110
 it will submerge 1 and I only want you want 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.289
 bring you my video on the channel let's say 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.720
 through my phone 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.330
 I know that almost everyone likes Nintendo is 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.160
 even the phone of course but we can 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.240
 you can see both things 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.310
 just in the phone just to do 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.550
 that is why I only know 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.899
 these losses for the android I now 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.170
 I do n't know anything 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:45.829
 go to the play store and go write 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:47.879
 precisely the king to tighten and walled game 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.289
 list 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.789
 after looking for it, it will load 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.100
 is where to download this I was already 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.899
 installed the star spots that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.579
 just click on the button on your shoulder 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.629
 however after installing it we can 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.250
 to have 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.400
 let's say an emulator for the game 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.409
 boy but this is not that a bit in 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.840
 sorry my boy never want to do this that 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.280
 even if it arose at the atom I repeat to you 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.259
 only for games 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.390
 asks the game boy and game boy color e 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:34.460
 if you want the games must be understood as 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:41.310
 are the most requested 23 sts redone 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:46.280
 drastic ds mason however obviously 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.229
 costs 5 euros for a fee but me 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.240
 smart memories instead of star downloading 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.710
 the demo for only half an hour 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.610
 to play a game and then 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.390
 you only have to go about 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.280
 this then download aptosid that 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.330
 is an application 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:14.980
 which is called a store and download all 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:18.520
 applications that pay things 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.190
 free should open auto id point 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.060
 on chrome or any other engine 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.770
 however, here I give you to say I already have 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.580
 downloaded the intent to fuck in 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.100
 very short time 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:37.690
 it will end and then after that it will start 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.070
 and now we are pleased with reasoning 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.700

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.830
