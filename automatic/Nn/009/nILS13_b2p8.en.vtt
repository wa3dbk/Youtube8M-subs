at<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.379> top<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.339> also<00:01:05.519> duplicate<00:01:06.299> ideas

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
at the top you can also duplicate ideas

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.240 
at the top you can also duplicate ideas
so<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.590> tap<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.670> button<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:10.040> it<00:01:11.040> gives

you<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> option<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.790> duplicate<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.080> can

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you the option to duplicate so you can

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.330 
you the option to duplicate so you can
tap<00:01:13.560> tap<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.580> many<00:01:15.299> as<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.659> want<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.020> choose

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
duplicate and it will create additional

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.070 
duplicate and it will create additional
copies<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.570> how<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.750> can

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
copies of that so this is how you can

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.410 
copies of that so this is how you can
start<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> single<00:01:23.340> idea<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.299> make

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
start with a single idea and then make

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.410 
start with a single idea and then make
revisions<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.200> versions<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.970> there's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
revisions and versions of it and there's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.170 
revisions and versions of it and there's
also<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.689> trashcan<00:01:27.990> icon<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:29.030> which<00:01:30.030> you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
also a trashcan icon up here which you

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.380 
also a trashcan icon up here which you
can<00:01:30.329> use<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.570> tap<00:01:31.409> again<00:01:32.060> delete<00:01:33.060> multiple

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
can use to tap again delete multiple

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.359 
can use to tap again delete multiple
ideas<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:35.460> sequence<00:01:39.680> so<00:01:40.680> I'm<00:01:40.829> leaning<00:01:41.250> over

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
ideas in a sequence so I'm leaning over

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.060 
ideas in a sequence so I'm leaning over
the<00:01:41.610> camera<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.840> sometimes<00:01:43.259> i<00:01:43.409> miss<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the camera so sometimes i miss the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.670 
the camera so sometimes i miss the
tapping<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> button<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.409> we'll<00:01:46.409> get<00:01:46.500> used

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
tapping of the button but we'll get used

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.730 
tapping of the button but we'll get used
to<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.860> pretty<00:01:47.040> quickly<00:01:48.380> let's<00:01:49.380> take<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> look

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
to that pretty quickly let's take a look

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.889 
to that pretty quickly let's take a look
inside<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> sketching<00:01:50.549> screen<00:01:50.880> i'm<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.840> to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
inside the sketching screen i'm going to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.630 
inside the sketching screen i'm going to
tap<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.259> one<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:52.979> i've<00:01:53.070> done<00:01:53.220> actually

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
tap this one and what i've done actually

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.340 
tap this one and what i've done actually
is<00:01:53.729> I've<00:01:53.880> drawn<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> big<00:01:54.390> black<00:01:54.630> background<00:01:55.170> so

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
is I've drawn a big black background so

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.380 
is I've drawn a big black background so
it'll<00:01:55.530> make<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> little<00:01:56.280> bit<00:01:56.340> less<00:01:56.549> contrast<00:01:57.119> on

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
it'll make a little bit less contrast on

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.679 
it'll make a little bit less contrast on
the<00:01:57.540> video<00:01:57.750> capture<00:01:59.299> you<00:02:00.299> can<00:02:00.450> see<00:02:00.570> that

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the video capture you can see that

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.690 
the video capture you can see that
there's<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.960> toolbar<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.530> left<00:02:01.670> with<00:02:02.670> a

make the black background to draw on top

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.699 
make the black background to draw on top
of<00:03:13.700> switching<00:03:14.700> over<00:03:14.790> here<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.390> opacity<00:03:15.750> if<00:03:16.530> i

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
of switching over here to opacity if i

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.380 
of switching over here to opacity if i
change<00:03:16.920> my<00:03:17.130> apache<00:03:17.459> i'm<00:03:17.730> currently<00:03:17.940> at<00:03:18.299> one

change my apache i'm currently at one
hundred<00:03:18.450> percent<00:03:18.630> but<00:03:19.079> i<00:03:19.170> can<00:03:19.320> lower<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.590> and

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
hundred percent but i can lower it and

hundred percent but i can lower it and
then<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:20.549> see<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.730> can<00:03:21.000> make<00:03:21.120> actually

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
then you can see I can make actually

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.170 
then you can see I can make actually

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
still zoom and in and out in this view

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.670 
still zoom and in and out in this view
as<00:03:57.989> well<00:03:58.489> and<00:04:00.140> finally<00:04:01.140> down<00:04:01.410> on<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.590> bottom

here<00:04:02.040> there's<00:04:02.970> access<00:04:03.569> for<00:04:03.810> layers<00:04:04.049> so<00:04:05.010> you

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
here there's access for layers so you

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.000 
here there's access for layers so you
can<00:04:05.370> optionally<00:04:06.299> turn<00:04:07.049> on<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.230> photo<00:04:07.739> layer

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
can optionally turn on a photo layer

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.099 
can optionally turn on a photo layer
before<00:04:08.609> I<00:04:08.819> do<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.000> let<00:04:09.180> me<00:04:09.359> zoom<00:04:09.630> out<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:09.840> you

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
before I do that let me zoom out so you

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.770 
before I do that let me zoom out so you
can<00:04:10.230> see<00:04:10.410> where<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.739> photo<00:04:11.190> gets<00:04:11.459> placed<00:04:11.780> it's

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
can see where the photo gets placed it's

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.020 
can see where the photo gets placed it's
going<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:12.930> go<00:04:13.079> behind<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:13.769> drawing<00:04:14.400> layer<00:04:14.700> so

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
going to go behind this drawing layer so

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.520 
going to go behind this drawing layer so
