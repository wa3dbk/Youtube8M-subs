00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.139
 condenen panthers the popular real-time strategy saga for pc and 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.450
 already has a new delivery but with the novelty that for the first time 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.980
 this wave of the period of the Second World War to now focus on 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.759
 the one of the cold war precisely under the title in this occasion of consumption 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.950
 in particular, one argues, it now situates the year 1949 right in the 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.400
 beginning of the so-called cold war that took place after the end of the second 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.210
 world war which caused great military tensions between the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.520
 superpowers of the united states and the soviet union 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.880
 however this time all these events occurred in a somewhat 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.870
 different, giving rise to an alternative past in which the two countries 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.460
 they have formally declared war 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.950
 after a Soviet fighter fighter hit a plane of 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.690
 of the Allied side without it being known exactly what the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.590
 causes being this fact accidentally in principle but sufficient to ignite 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.770
 the fuse of conflict the wind and to both nations the perfect excuse that 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.770
 they were waiting to attack each other 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.660
 in spite of the radical also the plot of the game distancing itself even in great 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.250
 measure of historical reality its playability is and will continue to be very 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.300
 similar to what we already knew that is to say it is a strategy title in 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.170
 real time and that bets above all for the tactical component so 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.790
 that we must overcome each mission with the troops we have at the beginning 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.280
 there was in its absence with the reinforcements that we got during the course of the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.720
 same 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.220
 in this sense the most remarkable fact is the great interaction of the three 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.490
 units have with the own scenario being very important to look for coverage to 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.740
 his entrenching himself in any of the elements of the mapping even 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.570
 take refuge inside the papis buildings or even steal vehicles 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.770
 abandoned by the enemy if we have opportunity c 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.270
 since anything goes to get a tactical superiority that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.270
 give us an advantage in front of the three enemies 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.669
 the realism reaches such a point that in fact the vehicles will not be able to move 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:20.349
 if you did not enter tenth previously it's one of our infantry units in 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.170
 them but that's not all since we continue for example we want a 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.650
 vehicle in addition to moving cross wall we will have to introduce in it a 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.079
 second or third unit that is in charge of the machine gun the cannon or of 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.259
 any other auction that the vehicle has 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:37.259
 inc 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.870
 In addition each unit has an excellent different therapies that can 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:45.430
 be independent of those that have another output that this is the same type 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.780
 being also able to gain experience 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.569
 start as we go overcoming each of the phases with them well off is 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.230
 elections again the same unit facing the next mission always 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.230
 that they remain alive 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.479
 It is also equally possible to improve them with new skills 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:09.829
 and a better explanation for example in a combat tank we can equip 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.269
 a loose flamethrower in a more powerful engine that increases its speed 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.549
 while on the other hand an infantry platoon can be improved with bazookas 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.099
 with mortar fire with doctors who quryna followed by removing only some 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.689
 of the many options that we will have to choose always when we have 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.689
 of the points that prestige needed 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.669
 technically, despite not reaching the level of the most recent titles 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.549
 thrown in this genre in the visual part of the game is a pretty level 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.160
 with the 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.980
 2 showing us some very detailed units and some great effects 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.510
 quality like the fact that all pop structures and buildings 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.889
 tropical Andes can itself 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.329
 although we see cycles of day and night in the middle of a phase so we can 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.659
 witness as a scenario that we had started in the dark 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.359
 little by little it becomes illuminated with the sunrise at dawn ap 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:26.580
 the March 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.590
 before this 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.130
 and from this analysis that refers to the different game modes that 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.080
 It prevents the pre-school, since in addition to the motorcycle, it will also be available 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.840
 other important options such as being able to play in an engine take away what will be 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.740
 possible to configure all the parameters of the battle to our liking challenging to 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.840
 the cc oo we will also have the multiplayer mode for up to eight your goodbye 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.940
 simultaneous online having three possible modalities cooperative mode a 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.940
 internal domination mode is by teams 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.660
 in his mentor of militants with goals and good game of strategy and tact 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.559
 disappoint those who enjoyed themselves with entities among which this would be 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:11.090
 Although it does not imply any revolution in gender 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.490
 in the case of a title to be taken into account by any amateur if 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.120
 we add the very attractive price with which it has been put on sale in this 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.250
 country only 19 with 95 euros
