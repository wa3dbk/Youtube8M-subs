00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
little confused by why this is 1 over 2

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.629 
little confused by why this is 1 over 2
and<00:00:09.160> not<00:00:09.849> the<00:00:10.000> usual<00:00:10.120> MSR<00:00:10.929> quickscoping<00:00:11.679> or<00:00:12.009> 43

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
and not the usual MSR quickscoping or 43

rate<00:00:12.849> at<00:00:13.030> which<00:00:13.210> I<00:00:13.480> know<00:00:13.750> you<00:00:13.870> guys<00:00:14.049> love<00:00:14.259> so

rate at which I know you guys love so
much<00:00:14.639> well<00:00:15.639> there's<00:00:15.969> a<00:00:16.029> reason<00:00:16.119> for<00:00:16.420> this<00:00:16.539> and

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779 
much well there's a reason for this and

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.590 
much well there's a reason for this and
it's<00:00:16.960> because<00:00:17.050> my<00:00:17.260> hdmi<00:00:18.039> splitter<00:00:18.460> broke<00:00:18.970> now

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
it's because my hdmi splitter broke now

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.910 
it's because my hdmi splitter broke now
if<00:00:19.750> you<00:00:19.840> don't<00:00:20.020> know<00:00:20.080> what<00:00:20.199> an<00:00:20.289> hdmi<00:00:20.710> splitter

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
if you don't know what an hdmi splitter

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.040 
if you don't know what an hdmi splitter
is<00:00:21.310> it's<00:00:21.670> basically<00:00:21.880> what<00:00:22.510> allows<00:00:22.720> me<00:00:22.869> to

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
is it's basically what allows me to

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.960 
is it's basically what allows me to
record<00:00:23.590> my<00:00:23.920> gameplay<00:00:23.980> because<00:00:24.519> it<00:00:24.760> allows<00:00:24.939> me

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
record my gameplay because it allows me

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.269 
record my gameplay because it allows me
to<00:00:25.240> take<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.630> one<00:00:25.840> hdmi<00:00:26.470> cable<00:00:26.769> coming<00:00:26.949> on<00:00:27.130> my

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
to take the one hdmi cable coming on my

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.060 
to take the one hdmi cable coming on my
ps3<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:28.269> split<00:00:28.660> it<00:00:28.689> into<00:00:28.960> two<00:00:29.260> so<00:00:29.679> then<00:00:29.859> one

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
ps3 and split it into two so then one

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.100 
ps3 and split it into two so then one
can<00:00:30.279> go<00:00:30.400> to<00:00:30.460> my<00:00:30.640> Meyer<00:00:30.849> where<00:00:31.269> I<00:00:31.300> can<00:00:31.570> play<00:00:31.810> and

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
can go to my Meyer where I can play and

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.260 
can go to my Meyer where I can play and
the<00:00:32.349> other<00:00:32.469> one<00:00:32.680> can<00:00:32.829> go<00:00:32.980> into<00:00:33.160> my<00:00:33.309> pc<00:00:33.550> so<00:00:34.030> i<00:00:34.090> can

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
the other one can go into my pc so i can

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.270 
the other one can go into my pc so i can

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
days but anyway so that'll feel free

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.180 
days but anyway so that'll feel free
right<00:01:44.140> I've<00:01:44.290> been<00:01:44.410> wanting<00:01:44.680> to<00:01:44.710> get<00:01:44.860> it<00:01:45.010> for<00:01:45.160> a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
right I've been wanting to get it for a

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.710 
right I've been wanting to get it for a
while<00:01:45.370> because<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:45.940> looks<00:01:46.120> like<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.300> really<00:01:46.540> fun

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
while because it looks like a really fun

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.140 
while because it looks like a really fun
game<00:01:46.900> right<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.400> wasn't<00:01:48.670> really<00:01:48.790> sure<00:01:48.880> it's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
game right but I wasn't really sure it's

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.480 
game right but I wasn't really sure it's
gonna<00:01:49.270> be<00:01:49.450> very<00:01:49.480> compatible<00:01:49.990> with<00:01:50.440> how<00:01:51.040> I<00:01:51.070> play

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
gonna be very compatible with how I play

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.560 
gonna be very compatible with how I play
home<00:01:51.780> warfare<00:01:52.780> 3<00:01:53.050> and<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:53.320> on<00:01:53.350> so<00:01:53.980> I<00:01:54.400> was<00:01:55.300> you

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
home warfare 3 and so on so I was you

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.000 
home warfare 3 and so on so I was you
know<00:01:55.660> a<00:01:55.690> little<00:01:55.960> mature<00:01:56.050> but<00:01:56.440> I<00:01:56.470> finally<00:01:56.710> saw

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
know a little mature but I finally saw

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.340 
know a little mature but I finally saw
it<00:01:57.100> for<00:01:57.310> something<00:01:57.820> like<00:01:57.970> 33<00:01:58.570> euros<00:01:58.870> and<00:01:59.290> I

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
it for something like 33 euros and I

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.480 
it for something like 33 euros and I
figured<00:01:59.620> you<00:01:59.680> know<00:01:59.740> you<00:01:59.830> can't<00:02:00.100> really<00:02:00.280> go

know my recording setup and all that but
yeah<00:02:12.610> quick<00:02:12.940> impression<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.720> very<00:02:13.990> fun

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
yeah quick impression it is a very fun

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.500 
yeah quick impression it is a very fun
game<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.980> one<00:02:15.190> thing<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.610> was<00:02:15.760> afraid<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.209> which

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
game the one thing I was afraid of which

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.449 
game the one thing I was afraid of which
turn<00:02:16.870> out<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.140> be<00:02:17.260> true<00:02:17.410> is<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:18.160> the

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
turn out to be true is that the

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.550 
turn out to be true is that the
mechanics<00:02:18.760> are<00:02:19.090> very<00:02:19.510> different<00:02:19.780> as<00:02:20.080> it

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
mechanics are very different as it

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.410 
mechanics are very different as it
doesn't<00:02:20.800> give<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.250> all<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.580> mobility<00:02:21.880> with

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
doesn't give you all that mobility with

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.180 
doesn't give you all that mobility with
turning<00:02:22.810> around<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.709> like<00:02:23.950> just

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
turning around and so on like just

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.940 
turning around and so on like just
looking<00:02:24.490> around<00:02:24.580> feels<00:02:25.510> slower<00:02:26.200> even<00:02:26.830> though

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
looking around feels slower even though

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.680 
looking around feels slower even though
it<00:02:27.160> can<00:02:27.280> go<00:02:27.370> up<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.580> high<00:02:27.670> sensitivities<00:02:28.360> it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
it can go up to high sensitivities it

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.960 
it can go up to high sensitivities it
still<00:02:29.410> feels<00:02:29.440> slower<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.190> responsibility<00:02:30.940> is

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
still feels slower the responsibility is

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.670 
still feels slower the responsibility is
not<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.600> know<00:02:31.630> it's<00:02:31.840> not<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.140> same<00:02:32.470> like

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
not you know it's not the same like

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.010 
not you know it's not the same like
modern<00:02:33.010> warfare<00:02:33.190> 3<00:02:33.640> or<00:02:34.090> any<00:02:34.330> cog<00:02:34.630> game<00:02:34.840> for

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
modern warfare 3 or any cog game for

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.990 
modern warfare 3 or any cog game for
that<00:02:35.140> matter<00:02:35.350> but<00:02:35.950> it's<00:02:36.130> still<00:02:36.310> enjoyable<00:02:36.459> and

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
that matter but it's still enjoyable and

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.199 
that matter but it's still enjoyable and
why<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.930> can't<00:02:38.380> use<00:02:38.560> snipers<00:02:39.010> exactly<00:02:39.850> in

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
why you can't use snipers exactly in

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.210 
why you can't use snipers exactly in
your<00:02:40.750> normal<00:02:40.959> quickscoping<00:02:41.620> ways<00:02:41.800> or<00:02:42.040> it's

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
your normal quickscoping ways or it's

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.190 
your normal quickscoping ways or it's
much<00:02:42.489> much<00:02:42.670> much<00:02:42.880> harder<00:02:43.150> I'm<00:02:43.720> also<00:02:43.959> getting

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
much much much harder I'm also getting

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.900 
much much much harder I'm also getting
getting<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.620> hang<00:02:44.769> of<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.010> already<00:02:45.700> got

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
getting the hang of that already got

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.810 
getting the hang of that already got
some<00:02:46.090> fees<00:02:46.300> so<00:02:46.930> anyway<00:02:47.860> once<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.550> get<00:02:48.700> those

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
some fees so anyway once I get those

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.670 
some fees so anyway once I get those
recorded<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.840> guys<00:02:50.080> would<00:02:50.230> be<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.440> first<00:02:50.560> to

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.970 
about is black ops 2 and I don't what
I've<00:03:01.630> been<00:03:01.780> hearing<00:03:01.989> about<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.620> what<00:03:02.860> my

I've been hearing about that what my
general<00:03:03.430> thoughts<00:03:03.670> are<00:03:03.910> but<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.920> basically

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
general thoughts are but it basically

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.860 
general thoughts are but it basically
boils<00:03:06.430> down<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:06.940> what<00:03:07.630> I've<00:03:07.750> been

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
hearing about black ops 2 is that

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.280 
hearing about black ops 2 is that
Treyarch<00:03:09.940> is<00:03:10.120> kind<00:03:10.330> of<00:03:10.420> gonna<00:03:10.570> stick<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:10.930> their

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
Treyarch is kind of gonna stick to their

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.370 
Treyarch is kind of gonna stick to their
ooh<00:03:11.560> we<00:03:12.519> don't<00:03:12.760> like<00:03:13.030> quickscoping<00:03:13.870> type<00:03:14.200> of

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
ooh we don't like quickscoping type of

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
again gonna try and probably handicapped
