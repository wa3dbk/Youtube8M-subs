00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
on my work at that point and I'd started

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.570 
on my work at that point and I'd started
out<00:00:59.210> studying<00:00:59.629> anthropology<00:01:00.049> and<00:01:00.710> I'd

out studying anthropology and I'd

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.030 
out studying anthropology and I'd
learned<00:01:01.820> about<00:01:02.360> mythology<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:03.320> eventually

learned about mythology and eventually

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.430 
learned about mythology and eventually
went<00:01:04.220> into<00:01:04.400> film<00:01:04.640> but<00:01:05.449> I<00:01:05.479> was<00:01:05.659> able<00:01:05.810> to<00:01:06.110> sort<00:01:06.350> of
