00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.830
 Halli Hello people have come as a short film 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:03.960
 BÃ¼rkl an info 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.420
 or have video 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.320
 Per cent actually I'm concerned about the foot 12 instead of the pockets but the 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.259
 Of course, try anyway 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.059
 yes what is it about 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.300
 I'll probably be next 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.579
 yes this is video will be a video 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.829
 but where you will see me percent where I imagine 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.349
 That's a video answer to a small lottery that's one 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.179
 Percentage point more not a netbook 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.370
 and yes, but since I'm still trying to get involved or win something 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.830
 in case somehow it should win, of course, relatively 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.240
 unlikely 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.190
 but if it really should be the case that I win there which 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.420
 Open Sweepstakes do what you will certainly like and no me 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.850
 I will not go straight to the netbook 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 I really really like that myself 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.700
 So there's a little raffle from their honeymoon if I get it 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.880
 but since I'm relatively unlikely 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.350
 otherwise there's a raffle starting around 2000 anyway and then hope 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.070
 I like that a little bit 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.300
 Make money at all 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.950
 a yes, but I will be happy if you in the video what then stay high 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.610
 I'll see it 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.020
 So that Willie one before the raffle that they give it 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.660
 Alone about high mountains worry that would be very nice and the flair 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.020
 a bazooka support for me 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 all the more great as that fight go 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.000
 high attendance of a short then all are so Velden super nice if you then 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.840
 but still give for it 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.390
 to camp for some ten days if I am always very happy 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.660
 because they are happy 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.180
 and there it is then in any case even then 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.400
 It is a real competition 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400
 which some may look forward to 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.930
 so z zT so 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.630
 80 percent of the clientele are dodging and legs are put 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.819
 that's pure 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.819
 three times +80 that's great 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.699
 here 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:21.719
 now about a new gun in the store though 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.719
 This is not really that much better that is that it would be worth it 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.179
 Prof the read system prevents this 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.209
 yes, that does not really matter anymore 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.019
 Emons opportunity their relatively much more chic 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.839
 meanwhile, stamina was tested 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.849
 for a year the water is still a bit like the hare Stock Market video 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.349
 the said goes up in the lines around this completely at or so on 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.939
 definitely in the boxes 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.939
 Percent that the Godoy is going on like Goldbach 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.469
 around here that's how every big club is said 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.340
 if I win for tips from me also a really cool sweepstakes 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.899
 Around Here 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:11.229
 I can guarantee everything that will please everyone 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:15.089
 apn because there is also something great to bring which I have not yet 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:16.769
 be betrayed 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.369
 for Euro look times the request even won five times 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.670
 what so long and of course there are still some videos about the 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.099
 Netbooks so I actually believe that I win that but I'm just saying 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.579
 if so, then 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.179
 Surely it is really relatively low percentage 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:38.889
 it depends 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.529
 the many of the contributing percentages everyone in the video must have an outpost 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:45.169
 So imagine yourself briefly forced 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.679
 so do not be surprised about the next video 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:50.889
 Percent of the world I also imagine a little bit why that 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.259
 Netbook percent 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.259
 good for me or why 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.049
 according to circumstances for them 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.999
 what could use for now yes so now I have it around 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.760
 Warren Ackerman was born right for gold so we see 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.459
 yes, and that includes just the next given but what you see 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.949
 make the water 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.699
 and now know what is the village where something great is prepared 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.400
 Ott that the chip division 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.740
 could do so 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.410
 and with these help face I have now times and see you at 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.860
 next time Westend Euro
