matriculated<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> ball<00:00:53.129> down<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> court<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
matriculated the ball down the court and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.060 
matriculated the ball down the court and
these<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.750> high<00:00:54.960> percentage<00:00:55.530> works<00:00:55.770> well<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
these are high percentage works well I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.130 
these are high percentage works well I
think<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> key<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.180> their<00:00:57.360> scoring<00:00:58.050> in

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
think this is a key to their scoring in

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.569 
think this is a key to their scoring in
this<00:00:58.260> first<00:00:58.500> quarter<00:00:58.829> they<00:00:58.980> weren't<00:00:59.250> just

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
this first quarter they weren't just

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.729 
this first quarter they weren't just
getting<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.329> transition<00:01:00.899> off<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> turnovers

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
getting in transition off the turnovers

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.349 
getting in transition off the turnovers
they<00:01:01.890> were<00:01:01.949> doing<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.340> off<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.640> misses<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.180> well

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
they were doing it off of misses as well

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.479 
they were doing it off of misses as well
I<00:01:03.390> mean<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.830> championship

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489

plays<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.060> also<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.540> some<00:01:39.720> good<00:01:39.930> breaks<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
plays but also just some good breaks and
