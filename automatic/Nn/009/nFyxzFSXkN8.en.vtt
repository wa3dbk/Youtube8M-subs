equals 15

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.990 
equals 15
not<00:01:01.500> anymore<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.550> course<00:01:02.789> you

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
so our young learners might not be

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.150 
way to subtraction that's how it's
easier<00:02:28.140> tell<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.410> how<00:02:31.590> that's

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
easier tell you so this is how that's

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.060 
easier tell you so this is how that's
this<00:02:32.790> way<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.510> actually<00:02:33.930> how<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.140> actually<00:02:34.530> did

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
this way is actually how I actually did

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.200 
this way is actually how I actually did
it<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.520> school<00:02:36.770> so<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:37.830> erase<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.340> 3<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:39.030> make

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
it in school so you erase the 3 to make

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.830 
it in school so you erase the 3 to make
2<00:02:39.420> minus<00:02:39.750> 1<00:02:39.960> I<00:02:40.410> just<00:02:40.620> put<00:02:41.430> down<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.640> 2<00:02:41.970> on<00:02:42.180> its<00:02:42.300> way

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
2 minus 1 I just put down a 2 on its way

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.440 
2 minus 1 I just put down a 2 on its way
well<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.200> thought<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.890> if<00:02:44.340> i<00:02:44.460> had<00:02:44.730> just<00:02:44.760> not

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
well I thought of that if i had just not

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.950 
well I thought of that if i had just not
on<00:02:45.660> paper<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:47.190> why<00:02:47.550> don't<00:02:47.760> do<00:02:47.910> questions<00:02:48.660> like

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
on paper so why don't do questions like

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.460 
on paper so why don't do questions like
12<00:02:49.290> minus<00:02:49.770> 3<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:50.600> always<00:02:51.600> thought<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.080> like<00:02:52.260> this

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
12 minus 3 I always thought it like this

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
12 minus 3 I always thought it like this
is<00:02:52.740> my<00:02:53.010> life<00:02:53.520> so<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.420> thought<00:02:54.720> 12<00:02:55.170> minus<00:02:55.500> 2<00:02:55.830> and

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
is my life so I thought 12 minus 2 and

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.020 
is my life so I thought 12 minus 2 and
then<00:02:56.850> subtract<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.870> little<00:02:58.440> 2<00:02:58.850> as<00:02:59.850> I

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
then subtract that little 2 as I

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.560 
then subtract that little 2 as I
subtract<00:03:00.750> one<00:03:01.500> more<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:03.030> 9<00:03:04.430> that's

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
subtract one more and it's 9 that's

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.100 
subtract one more and it's 9 that's
that's<00:03:06.570> how<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.900> basically<00:03:07.500> did<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:08.750> why<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:09.780> was

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
that's how I basically did it why I was

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.750 
that's how I basically did it why I was
originally<00:03:10.260> 12<00:03:10.709> minus<00:03:11.040> 3<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.489> then<00:03:11.580> she

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
originally 12 minus 3 and then she

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.670 
originally 12 minus 3 and then she
changed<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.300> 2<00:03:12.510> she<00:03:12.959> said<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.200> was<00:03:13.290> easier

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
changed it to 2 she said it was easier

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.460 
changed it to 2 she said it was easier
and<00:03:13.980> then<00:03:14.640> she<00:03:14.940> realized<00:03:15.270> when<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.600> 10<00:03:15.840> minus<00:03:16.170> 1

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
and then she realized when is 10 minus 1

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.590 
and then she realized when is 10 minus 1
it<00:03:17.040> becomes<00:03:17.310> 9<00:03:17.550> which<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.090> answer

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
it becomes 9 which is the answer

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.800 
it becomes 9 which is the answer
uh-huh<00:03:19.350> what<00:03:19.770> he<00:03:19.890> called<00:03:20.130> up<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.790> well<00:03:21.780> that

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
uh-huh what he called up that well that

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.330 
uh-huh what he called up that well that
what<00:03:22.170> they're<00:03:22.320> teaching<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:22.980> common

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
what they're teaching this is common

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.979 
what they're teaching this is common
core<00:03:23.550> because<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.090> know<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:24.570> do<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.810> number

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
core because you know you do a number

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.020 
core because you know you do a number
that's<00:03:25.320> not<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.680> original<00:03:26.100> one<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.580> then

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
that's not the original one and then

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.300 
that's not the original one and then
it's<00:03:27.690> easier<00:03:28.110> number<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.530> she<00:03:28.590> knows<00:03:28.830> 2<00:03:29.040> minus

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
it's easier number so she knows 2 minus

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.840 
it's easier number so she knows 2 minus
2<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.550> 0

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
2 is 0

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.300 
2 is 0
mm-hmm<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.420> when<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.810> add<00:03:30.989> these<00:03:31.290> it'll<00:03:32.130> be

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
mm-hmm and when you add these it'll be

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.400 
mm-hmm and when you add these it'll be
the<00:03:32.459> night

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.840 

why<00:03:36.190> do<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.490> do<00:03:36.760> weird<00:03:37.330> seven<00:03:37.990> again<00:03:38.320> okay<00:03:39.130> do

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
why do you do weird seven again okay do

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.850 
why do you do weird seven again okay do
that<00:03:39.880> okay<00:03:40.540> show<00:03:41.110> uncle<00:03:41.470> Gary<00:03:41.620> how<00:03:41.800> you

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
that okay show uncle Gary how you

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.840 
that okay show uncle Gary how you
subtract<00:03:42.250> uh-huh<00:03:42.910> so<00:03:43.900> there's<00:03:44.320> not<00:03:44.680> enough<00:03:45.100> to

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
subtract uh-huh so there's not enough to

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.740 
subtract uh-huh so there's not enough to
subtract<00:03:46.390> but<00:03:47.070> not<00:03:48.070> enough<00:03:48.520> love<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.910> subtract

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
subtract but not enough love to subtract

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.550 
subtract but not enough love to subtract
bacon

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
bacon

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:58.620 
bacon
so<00:03:50.770> basically<00:03:51.580> put<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:51.970> big<00:03:52.180> croc<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:57.270> that<00:03:58.270> one

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
so basically put a big croc so that one

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.000 
so basically put a big croc so that one
becomes<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.800> seven<00:04:01.050> at<00:04:02.050> Stettin<00:04:02.560> don't

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
becomes a seven at Stettin don't

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.120 
becomes a seven at Stettin don't
subtract<00:04:03.490> anything<00:04:04.000> on<00:04:04.600> this<00:04:05.440> one<00:04:05.710> you<00:04:06.100> just

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
subtract anything on this one you just

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.840 
subtract anything on this one you just
put<00:04:06.520> the<00:04:06.670> center<00:04:07.000> right<00:04:07.180> duck<00:04:08.190> did<00:04:09.190> this<00:04:09.490> one

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
put the center right duck did this one

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.780 
put the center right duck did this one
become<00:04:10.540> a<00:04:12.300> ten<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.720> nine<00:04:14.470> because<00:04:15.250> it

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
become a ten and a nine because it

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.590 
become a ten and a nine because it
that's<00:04:16.120> head<00:04:16.540> you<00:04:17.170> subtract<00:04:18.010> one<00:04:18.310> so<00:04:18.910> it<00:04:19.150> goes

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
that's head you subtract one so it goes

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
that's head you subtract one so it goes
this<00:04:19.840> is<00:04:20.100> 14<00:04:21.100> it<00:04:21.400> should<00:04:21.610> be<00:04:21.730> 13<00:04:22.240> now<00:04:22.620> remember

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
this is 14 it should be 13 now remember

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.960 
this is 14 it should be 13 now remember
you<00:04:23.920> add<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.130> 1<00:04:24.570> right<00:04:26.370> once<00:04:27.370> you're<00:04:27.520> in<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:27.850> way

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
you add a 1 right once you're in a way

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.870 
you add a 1 right once you're in a way
board<00:04:28.180> 0<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:28.810> then<00:04:29.100> there's<00:04:30.100> your<00:04:30.370> than<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.550> 0

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
board 0 and then there's your than a 0

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.000 
board 0 and then there's your than a 0
shoot<00:04:31.270> you<00:04:31.450> just<00:04:31.750> seem<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.140> put<00:04:32.320> in<00:04:32.410> I<00:04:32.560> use<00:04:32.770> them

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
shoot you just seem to put in I use them

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.700 
shoot you just seem to put in I use them
because<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.000> usually<00:04:34.360> put<00:04:34.810> 10<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.350> then<00:04:35.470> 9

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
because you usually put 10 and then 9

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.490 
because you usually put 10 and then 9
and<00:04:36.130> you<00:04:36.250> subtract<00:04:36.610> again<00:04:36.910> okay<00:04:37.900> so<00:04:38.700> this<00:04:39.700> one

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
and you subtract again okay so this one

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.270 
and you subtract again okay so this one
so<00:04:41.500> this<00:04:41.800> one<00:04:42.310> because<00:04:42.880> it's<00:04:43.120> 7<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:44.280> that

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
so this one because it's 7 and that

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.550 
so this one because it's 7 and that
subtraction<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.360> showed<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:46.960> was<00:04:47.230> 12<00:04:47.650> 1<00:04:47.920> is<00:04:48.070> 3

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
subtraction I showed you was 12 1 is 3

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.110
