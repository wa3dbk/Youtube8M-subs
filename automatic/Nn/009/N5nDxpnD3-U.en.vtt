from laying around in my shop the tenon

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.170 
from laying around in my shop the tenon
is<00:01:05.970> composed<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.689> two<00:01:06.990> cuts<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:08.610> cheek<00:01:08.880> cut

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
is composed of two cuts the cheek cut

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.830 
is composed of two cuts the cheek cut
and<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.979> shoulder<00:01:11.430> cut<00:01:14.420> begin<00:01:15.420> by<00:01:15.630> making

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and the shoulder cut begin by making

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
and the shoulder cut begin by making
lines<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:16.770> will<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.189> length<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
lines for what will be the length of the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.899 
lines for what will be the length of the
tenon<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:19.170> will<00:01:19.439> also<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.040> line<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
tenon this will also be the line for the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.840 
tenon this will also be the line for the
shoulder<00:01:21.299> cut<00:01:21.540> later<00:01:25.280> then<00:01:26.280> I'll<00:01:26.640> use<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
shoulder cut later then I'll use the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.270 
shoulder cut later then I'll use the
marking<00:01:27.390> gauge<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:28.229> make<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.590> width<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
marking gauge to make the width of the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:40.539 
marking gauge to make the width of the
tenant<00:01:32.659> now<00:01:33.659> let's<00:01:34.229> put<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.619> jig<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.670> work<00:01:35.939> I

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.880 

begin<00:01:41.549> by<00:01:41.790> clamping<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> workpiece<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
begin by clamping the workpiece to the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.120 
begin by clamping the workpiece to the
jig<00:01:44.189> making<00:01:45.000> sure<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.360> flat<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.960> square

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.539 

I<00:01:53.450> then<00:01:54.450> raise<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.750> blade<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.950> height<00:01:56.250> of

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
I then raise the blade to the height of

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.100 
I then raise the blade to the height of
the<00:01:56.759> tenon<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:58.970> move<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.119> fence<00:02:00.360> over<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.960> my

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the tenon I move the fence over to my

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.649 
the tenon I move the fence over to my
first<00:02:01.409> mark<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.040> I'll<00:02:02.790> make<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.119> first<00:02:03.330> cut

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
first mark and I'll make the first cut

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.620 
first mark and I'll make the first cut
now<00:02:04.649> note<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.610> guard<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.000> removed<00:02:06.420> from

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
now note that the guard is removed from

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.169 
now note that the guard is removed from
the<00:02:06.780> table<00:02:06.990> saw<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.740> extreme<00:02:08.340> caution<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.149> to

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179

the table saw so extreme caution is to
be<00:02:09.450> used

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.490 

turning<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.700> saw<00:02:21.880> off<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.510> flip<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.320> board

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
turning the saw off I flip the board

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.800 
turning the saw off I flip the board
around<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.160> I'll<00:02:24.610> check<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.150> alignment<00:02:25.360> mark

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
around and I'll check the alignment mark

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:40.430 
around and I'll check the alignment mark
to<00:02:26.470> make<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.130> other<00:02:27.280> cut<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:38.500> good

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
good fit one before you make your tenon

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.530 
good fit one before you make your tenon
make<00:04:22.600> your<00:04:22.780> mortise<00:04:23.290> first<00:04:23.970> see<00:04:24.970> your<00:04:25.150> mortise

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
make your mortise first see your mortise

done after you've cleaned up the inside
with<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.650> chisel<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:30.880> it's<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.090> good<00:04:31.270> idea<00:04:31.420> that

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
with the chisel so it's a good idea that
