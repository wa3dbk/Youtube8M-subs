00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
village here obviously you can build a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.539 
village here obviously you can build a
car<00:01:33.350> probably<00:01:34.350> not<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.799> greatest<00:01:34.950> car<00:01:35.520> I

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
thing I think it's kind of cool and I

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.720 
thing I think it's kind of cool and I
was<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:26.530> was<00:04:26.710> interested<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:27.250> thought<00:04:27.430> I'd<00:04:27.550> maybe

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
was I was interested I thought I'd maybe

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.910 
was I was interested I thought I'd maybe
try<00:04:27.970> to<00:04:28.030> create<00:04:28.300> something<00:04:28.570> similar<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:29.800> or

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
try to create something similar to it or

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.320 
try to create something similar to it or
make<00:04:30.040> it<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.340> little<00:04:30.460> better<00:04:30.670> but<00:04:30.880> I'm<00:04:31.030> like<00:04:31.150> I

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
make it a little better but I'm like I

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.240 
make it a little better but I'm like I
might<00:04:31.480> just<00:04:31.660> make<00:04:31.750> this<00:04:31.930> just<00:04:32.110> for<00:04:32.260> fun<00:04:32.320> so

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
might just make this just for fun so

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.280

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.820 
pretty cool addition here you'll see the
the<00:04:40.060> cover<00:04:40.270> again<00:04:40.480> and<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:41.350> different

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
variation of it and setups so they don't

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.210 
variation of it and setups so they don't

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.180 
really give you directions on how to
build<00:04:45.430> this<00:04:45.700> or<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.990> castle<00:04:47.440> or<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.770> little

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
build this or the castle or the little

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.770 
build this or the castle or the little
house<00:04:48.370> in<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.580> background<00:04:48.760> but<00:04:49.210> I'm<00:04:49.540> sure<00:04:49.690> you

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
house in the background but I'm sure you

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.970 
house in the background but I'm sure you
can<00:04:49.900> figure<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.290> out<00:04:50.470> or<00:04:50.650> make<00:04:50.770> something

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
can figure that out or make something

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.590 
can figure that out or make something
pretty<00:04:51.280> close<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.730> it<00:04:51.820> as<00:04:52.180> long<00:04:52.330> as<00:04:52.420> you<00:04:52.510> have

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
pretty close to it as long as you have

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.210 
pretty close to it as long as you have
the<00:04:52.720> picture<00:04:53.020> here<00:04:53.050> and<00:04:53.410> then<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:54.070> have<00:04:54.160> the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
the picture here and then you have the

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.770 
the picture here and then you have the
underwater<00:04:54.580> scene<00:04:54.850> which<00:04:55.030> we<00:04:55.150> saw<00:04:55.330> earlier

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
underwater scene which we saw earlier

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.660 
underwater scene which we saw earlier
they<00:04:56.410> don't<00:04:56.590> give<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:56.830> any<00:04:56.980> directions<00:04:57.520> on

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
they don't give you any directions on

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.550 
they don't give you any directions on
how<00:04:57.700> to<00:04:57.820> build<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.240> that<00:04:58.450> is<00:04:58.630> just<00:04:58.660> simply

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
how to build that that is just simply

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.160 
how to build that that is just simply
what<00:05:00.280> you<00:05:00.310> can<00:05:00.610> do<00:05:00.790> so<00:05:00.820> again<00:05:01.540> looking<00:05:01.990> at<00:05:02.080> the

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
what you can do so again looking at the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.690 
what you can do so again looking at the
pictures<00:05:02.500> it's<00:05:02.740> not<00:05:02.890> too<00:05:03.070> hard<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.400> figure<00:05:03.550> out

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
pictures it's not too hard to figure out

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.180 
pictures it's not too hard to figure out
how<00:05:04.030> they<00:05:04.210> did<00:05:04.270> things<00:05:04.630> on<00:05:04.900> here<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:05.260> if<00:05:06.040> you

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
how they did things on here and if you

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.280 
how they did things on here and if you
have<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:07.150> know<00:05:07.180> some<00:05:07.480> experience<00:05:07.930> with<00:05:07.990> Lego

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
have you know some experience with Lego

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.270 
have you know some experience with Lego
you<00:05:08.350> make<00:05:08.530> sure<00:05:08.650> you'll<00:05:08.800> be<00:05:08.950> able<00:05:09.010> to<00:05:09.160> make

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
you make sure you'll be able to make

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.100 
you make sure you'll be able to make
some<00:05:09.460> of<00:05:09.490> these<00:05:09.610> things<00:05:09.910> maybe<00:05:10.630> even<00:05:10.840> making

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
some of these things maybe even making

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.060 
some of these things maybe even making
your<00:05:11.260> own<00:05:11.290> and<00:05:11.560> make<00:05:11.650> them<00:05:11.770> better

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
your own and make them better

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.120 
your own and make them better
so<00:05:12.640> finally<00:05:13.090> you<00:05:13.120> got<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:14.130> advertisements

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
so finally you got the advertisements

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.720 
so finally you got the advertisements
and<00:05:15.280> then<00:05:15.880> again<00:05:17.190> different<00:05:18.190> pieces<00:05:18.340> that<00:05:18.490> are

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
and then again different pieces that are

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.030 
and then again different pieces that are
inside<00:05:19.060> here<00:05:19.300> once<00:05:20.080> again<00:05:20.380> which<00:05:20.560> you<00:05:20.830> get<00:05:20.980> a

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
inside here once again which you get a

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.710 
inside here once again which you get a
better<00:05:21.160> look<00:05:21.400> here<00:05:21.610> than<00:05:21.790> what<00:05:21.940> I<00:05:21.970> was<00:05:22.450> able<00:05:22.690> to

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
better look here than what I was able to

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.110 
better look here than what I was able to
do<00:05:22.840> by<00:05:23.020> getting<00:05:23.230> the<00:05:23.440> bags<00:05:23.620> out<00:05:23.890> so<00:05:24.730> that<00:05:24.910> is

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
do by getting the bags out so that is

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.860 
do by getting the bags out so that is
that<00:05:25.600> is<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.930> entire<00:05:26.200> set<00:05:26.890> right<00:05:27.760> there<00:05:27.970> that

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
that is the entire set right there that

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.780 
that is the entire set right there that
concludes<00:05:29.169> my<00:05:29.350> review<00:05:29.530> of<00:05:29.710> lego<00:05:30.100> set<00:05:30.490> for

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
concludes my review of lego set for

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.140 
concludes my review of lego set for
six-30<00:05:31.480> I<00:05:32.050> think<00:05:32.650> for<00:05:32.830> $42<00:05:33.580> this<00:05:33.760> is<00:05:33.910> a<00:05:33.940> no

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
six-30 I think for $42 this is a no

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.580 
six-30 I think for $42 this is a no
brainer<00:05:34.180> you<00:05:34.540> have<00:05:34.750> to<00:05:34.900> pick<00:05:35.050> this<00:05:35.200> set<00:05:35.440> up

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
brainer you have to pick this set up

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.620 
brainer you have to pick this set up
thousand<00:05:36.340> pieces<00:05:36.640> I<00:05:36.669> mean<00:05:36.940> look<00:05:37.120> at<00:05:37.180> that<00:05:37.240> pile

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
thousand pieces I mean look at that pile

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.110 
thousand pieces I mean look at that pile
of<00:05:37.930> stuff<00:05:38.169> that<00:05:38.380> I<00:05:38.410> got<00:05:38.710> there<00:05:38.950> for<00:05:39.250> such<00:05:39.850> a<00:05:39.880> low

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
of stuff that I got there for such a low

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.630 
of stuff that I got there for such a low
cost<00:05:40.390> mainly<00:05:41.169> common<00:05:41.470> pieces<00:05:41.800> but<00:05:42.010> you<00:05:42.250> can

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
cost mainly common pieces but you can

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.920 
cost mainly common pieces but you can
see<00:05:42.820> you<00:05:42.970> can<00:05:43.120> do<00:05:43.240> a<00:05:43.270> lot<00:05:43.479> of<00:05:43.600> stuff<00:05:43.780> with

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
see you can do a lot of stuff with

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.870 
see you can do a lot of stuff with
common<00:05:44.229> pieces<00:05:44.560> and<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:45.250> think<00:05:45.520> this<00:05:45.640> is<00:05:45.790> just

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
common pieces and I think this is just

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.700 
common pieces and I think this is just
going<00:05:46.060> to<00:05:46.150> be<00:05:46.210> a<00:05:46.240> lot<00:05:46.419> of<00:05:46.450> fun<00:05:46.720> to<00:05:46.900> make<00:05:47.380> things

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
going to be a lot of fun to make things
