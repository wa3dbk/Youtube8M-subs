in it and then we drove for about 10

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.120 
in it and then we drove for about 10
miles<00:01:29.120> guess<00:01:29.720> what<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.409> Leonard<00:01:30.680> late<00:01:30.890> popped

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
miles guess what the Leonard late popped

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.970 
miles guess what the Leonard late popped
up<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:31.550> i<00:01:31.580> reset<00:01:31.940> again<00:01:32.090> now<00:01:33.020> or<00:01:33.170> later<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:33.680> we
