00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.529
 for and girls so today I want 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:07.720
 show how I made this manicure 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.430
 super simple on the theme of Christmas 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.130
 here it is simple and fast like 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.349
 so always of a man is at stake but 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.540
 my base we do not change the good 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.480
 habits because as I'm a varnish 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:24.010
 red it will avoid tinting the nail in 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.900
 red then I put my red so 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.980
 laying horizontally near 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.019
 cuticles because I found that 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.000
 this technique makes it allow me 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.940
 on demand m - everywhere because it's 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.519
 where I have my fault in fact by all 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.059
 at the level of critics and so lo 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.650
 so I put only one layer in fact 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.659
 what we are going to add glitter 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.629
 thereafter 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:48.460
 so that it does not make a pile of 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.720
 matter actually like ahmed after one 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.760
 will put glitter we will hand out a 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.400
 second layer of red like that its 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.220
 embossed nail strokes such means of 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.750
 materials must so here is then done 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.170
 that I put my red and that it is 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.570
 know that we go to the top coat only in 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.390
 the angle in one of the angles or does its 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.800
 sides you see and I do a slight 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.820
 diagonal 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.090
 then I take glitter 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.680
 silvered and I lay them down so must 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.900
 it saves me from finally putting myself in 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.410
 put everywhere around me and in addition 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.020
 it really makes me a payet effect 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.640
 so it's full of glitter 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.380
 So now it looks like 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.420
 not much I'm still trying to 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:36.430
 to follow 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:39.610
 where I put the top coat yes it is 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.350
 very simple I pass my base I wait 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.070
 she knows a little impressive 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.450
 alcohol on my finger and I do not like that and 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.650
 less glitter adhere more 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.920
 when she is meanwhile slightly 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.830
 it's choosing slightly so 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.659
 then once but payet are 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.159
 almost dry but I take a brush and 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.040
 I clean I retrace maggia gonelle a 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.290
 little as I can to make it more 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.200
 clean 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.960
 here I clean up to avoid 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.330
 that it makes the effect amat payet 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.890
 is at the very beginning and that's where jérôme 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.090
 to be the second layer of red so in 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.910
 did the second layer had me 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.730
 allows to 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.570
 redo my diagonal right because 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.910
 it's true that glitter is not 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.000
 obvious to make a straight line 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.390
 so I cheat a little pop but I 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.620
 redo a straight line 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.260
 it's going to make bones cleaner but have 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.230
 though that is not to be everywhere 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.730
 it's not very clean 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.980
 once these dries once 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.320
 it's dry pardon I'll drop some 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.300
 little dots so I find that it's 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.040
 the little dots that really make the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.870
 christmas theme actually I do not know 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.240
 why but that you take the time 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.530
 it's less bad that we see there the 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.720
 girls you do the little dots 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.850
 especially the fingers then you forget 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.220
 not put on top coat because 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.720
 otherwise the glitter will go for a walk 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.790
 on the red and that to be less pretty 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.350
 name here are the threads the tutorial is 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.210
 completed and I hope they will have you 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.740
 and I wish you happy holidays 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.240
 I also wanted to thank everyone 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.850

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.320
