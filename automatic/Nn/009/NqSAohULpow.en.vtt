00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:09.050
 We stuff cabbage and fried ginger in deep-fried tofu and bake with toaster 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:12.309
 We will continue to seasoning of your favorite grilled wind to finish 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.309
 Perfect for snacks 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:26.500
 First cut the cabbage cut the hard part of the core 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.500
 And please slice this part 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.090
 It is a part of the remaining end, but this will continue to shred 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:44.449
 It is easy to cut it after cutting it from the side after rounding like this 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.449
 There Yes 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:54.490
 Fried this way, in the press down with a paper towel because there are still that oil 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:59.680
 Wipe off oil 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:03.300
 Then use a cotton swab to roll like this to make it easy to open 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.300
 Make a notch on the side 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:16.070
 Please open so as not to tear so that stuffing material is easy to pack the rest 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:22.440
 It is packed in this way opened we were here immediately 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:30.070
 Ingredients add this to the shredded cabbage with roughly chopped red ginger 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:37.870
 It will become the seasoning of that taste grilled considerably by the red ginger entering 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:39.340
 It will be packed in the deep-fried tofu, so when it is easier to pack it by hand, it will be like this with the left hand 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.560
 While suppressing the rise 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.560
 Please stuff the cabbage with your right hand 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:54.690
 Since I think whether there is a case where considerable cabbage is difficult to enter by the size of the Abura gain 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:01.560
 In that case , please add 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:04.070
 This about but I join that Pampanga push this Te 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.070
 Please give me 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.290
 I will lightly hold the rest and burn with this 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.790
 You don't have to stop it with a toothpick. 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:24.540
 The rest is just to bake it with a toaster, but it's time to bake it on a poster 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:26.069
 I put it on a toaster top plate, covered with aluminum foil, and packed with fried oil like this on it 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.230
 Please put things on 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:35.420
 It is also recommended to use a bad like this 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.560
 I will burn it for 6 minutes with Sudo Star. 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.760
 Here is the first thing to put in the toaster 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:49.790
 Bake 6 minutes later, but depending on the temperature of your home toaster 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.550
 If it is easy to burn it, turn it over halfway and burn it on both sides. 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.440
 To make it easier 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.440
 I will cut into four equal parts 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.490

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.490
 We will serve 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:13.190
