00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.890 
before when I was there the doctors and
had<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.650> sit<00:03:56.859> an<00:03:57.040> edge<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.819> chair<00:03:57.900> because

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.619 
had to sit an edge of the chair because
I<00:03:59.500> couldn't<00:04:00.340> get<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.879> delight<00:04:01.150> immature
