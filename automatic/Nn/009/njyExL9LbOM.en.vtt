00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.960 

once<00:04:10.440> everything<00:04:10.890> was<00:04:10.920> dry<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.280> took<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:11.670> glue

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
once everything was dry I took a glue

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.670 
once everything was dry I took a glue
gun<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.420> put<00:04:12.690> glue<00:04:12.870> on<00:04:12.959> each<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.500> animals

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
gun and put glue on each of the animals

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.580 
gun and put glue on each of the animals
feet<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:14.819> I<00:04:15.300> found<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.720> this<00:04:15.959> kind<00:04:16.500> of

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
feet and I found that this kind of

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.340 
feet and I found that this kind of
didn't<00:04:16.829> work<00:04:16.889> as<00:04:17.040> well<00:04:17.160> so<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.430> used<00:04:17.820> superglue

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
didn't work as well so I used superglue

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.390 
didn't work as well so I used superglue
and<00:04:19.350> that's<00:04:19.560> definitely<00:04:19.769> gonna<00:04:20.040> hold<00:04:20.310> them

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
and that's definitely gonna hold them

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.949 
and that's definitely gonna hold them
for<00:04:20.609> longer<00:04:20.820> but<00:04:21.090> then<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.269> just<00:04:21.510> placed<00:04:21.750> them

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
for longer but then I just placed them

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.960 
for longer but then I just placed them
on<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.139> lid<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.680> I'll<00:04:23.040> let<00:04:23.250> them<00:04:23.430> dry

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.710 

I<00:04:29.950> just<00:04:30.950> use<00:04:31.250> these<00:04:31.490> on<00:04:31.670> my<00:04:31.880> nightstand<00:04:32.480> to

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
I just use these on my nightstand to

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.170 
I just use these on my nightstand to
hold<00:04:33.020> my<00:04:33.290> most<00:04:33.560> used<00:04:33.950> chopsticks<00:04:34.640> but<00:04:34.880> you<00:04:35.030> can

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180
