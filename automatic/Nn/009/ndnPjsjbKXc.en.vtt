00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.540 
very bad area a real pointed edge or
even<00:02:36.970> like<00:02:37.150> here<00:02:37.620> because<00:02:38.620> you're<00:02:38.890> it's<00:02:39.160> the

even like here because you're it's the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.910 
even like here because you're it's the
clear<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:40.090> thinner<00:02:40.330> there<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:41.530> because<00:02:41.830> it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
clear is thinner there it because it

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.000 
clear is thinner there it because it
