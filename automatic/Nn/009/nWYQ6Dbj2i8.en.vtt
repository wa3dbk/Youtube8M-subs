okay I'm gonna give a explanation of how
my<00:00:05.629> homemade<00:00:06.629> filters<00:00:07.410> work<00:00:07.649> for<00:00:07.950> my<00:00:08.040> pond

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
my homemade filters work for my pond

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.870 
my homemade filters work for my pond
again<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.490> not<00:00:12.110> my<00:00:13.110> idea<00:00:13.139> I've<00:00:13.920> taken

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
again this is not my idea I've taken

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.359 
again this is not my idea I've taken
several<00:00:15.269> things<00:00:15.599> off<00:00:15.839> at<00:00:16.049> YouTube<00:00:16.440> mainly

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
several things off at YouTube mainly

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.210 
several things off at YouTube mainly
bird<00:00:17.699> man<00:00:17.910> filter<00:00:18.800> and<00:00:19.800> made<00:00:20.010> some

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
bird man filter and made some

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.759 
bird man filter and made some
modifications<00:00:20.369> just<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.539> suit<00:00:21.990> my<00:00:22.199> individual

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
modifications just to suit my individual

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.029 
modifications just to suit my individual
means<00:00:23.840> so<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.140> got<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.720> 50<00:00:27.720> 100<00:00:28.050> gallon<00:00:28.830> per<00:00:28.980> hour

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
means so I got a 50 100 gallon per hour

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.049 
means so I got a 50 100 gallon per hour
pump<00:00:29.310> coming<00:00:30.029> from<00:00:30.439> my<00:00:31.439> skimmer<00:00:31.920> box<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.759> it

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
pump coming from my skimmer box and it

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.410 
pump coming from my skimmer box and it
goes<00:00:33.239> into<00:00:33.920> both<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.190> first<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> second

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
goes into both the first and second

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.310 
goes into both the first and second
barrels<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.790> original<00:00:39.390> thought<00:00:39.750> was<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> have

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
barrels the original thought was to have

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.619 
barrels the original thought was to have
it<00:00:40.350> coming<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.860> first<00:00:41.100> barrel<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.329> then

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it coming in the first barrel and then

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.869 
it coming in the first barrel and then
gravity<00:00:43.170> feed<00:00:43.680> down<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> second<00:00:44.670> barrel

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
gravity feed down to the second barrel

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.700 
gravity feed down to the second barrel
and<00:00:45.270> gravity<00:00:45.629> speed<00:00:46.020> down<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> third

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and gravity speed down to the third

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.010 
and gravity speed down to the third
barrel<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> flow<00:00:48.120> couldn't<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
barrel but the flow couldn't get the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.610 
barrel but the flow couldn't get the
flow<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.570> put<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> Y<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:54.620> now

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
flow right so I just put a Y in and now

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.279 
flow right so I just put a Y in and now
I<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:56.210> people<00:00:57.210> water<00:00:57.690> running<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.140> each

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
I have people water running to each

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.290 
I have people water running to each
barrel<00:00:58.940> and<00:01:00.020> as<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.760> cleaned

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
barrel and as you can see I just cleaned

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
barrel and as you can see I just cleaned
out<00:01:03.539> these<00:01:03.750> barrels<00:01:04.170> today<00:01:05.479> this<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.900> air

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
out these barrels today this is the air

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.370 
out these barrels today this is the air
manifold<00:01:07.979> where<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.790> blow<00:01:09.030> down<00:01:09.270> blow<00:01:10.170> air

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
manifold where you blow down blow air

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.820 
manifold where you blow down blow air
down<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.210> shop<00:01:12.210> vac<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.470> brings<00:01:13.619> all

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
down with a shop vac and it brings all

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.920 
down with a shop vac and it brings all
the<00:01:13.979> muck<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> top<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.030> cleans<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.630> back

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
the muck to the top and cleans out back

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.030 
the muck to the top and cleans out back
through<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.759> drain<00:01:17.759> back<00:01:18.180> there<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.770> water

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
through that drain back there so water

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.420 
through that drain back there so water
comes<00:01:20.340> up<00:01:20.600> gravity<00:01:21.600> feeds<00:01:22.040> comes<00:01:23.040> out<00:01:23.220> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
comes up gravity feeds comes out this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.710 
comes up gravity feeds comes out this
piping<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:24.479> back<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.500> my<00:01:25.939> third<00:01:26.939> barrel<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
piping here back to my third barrel and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.319 
piping here back to my third barrel and
the<00:01:28.200> third<00:01:28.409> barrels<00:01:28.860> got<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> 30<00:01:29.520> 100<00:01:29.729> gallon

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the third barrels got a 30 100 gallon

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.870 
the third barrels got a 30 100 gallon
per<00:01:30.509> hour<00:01:30.570> pump<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.460> control

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
per hour pump in it and I can control

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.770 
per hour pump in it and I can control
the<00:01:33.060> flow<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.680> these<00:01:35.270> fall<00:01:36.270> valves

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the flow with the with these fall valves

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.039 
the flow with the with these fall valves
that<00:01:36.990> I've<00:01:37.079> installed<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:39.210> again<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> second

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that I've installed and again the second

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.530 
that I've installed and again the second
barrel<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:42.299> gravity<00:01:42.840> feeds<00:01:43.140> up<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:44.540> this

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
barrel that gravity feeds up to this

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.609 
barrel that gravity feeds up to this
outlet<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.680> third<00:01:46.979> barrel<00:01:48.619> once

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
outlet to the third barrel once

outlet to the third barrel once
everything<00:01:50.040> gets<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> third<00:01:50.729> barrel<00:01:51.060> it

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
everything gets to the third barrel it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.620 
everything gets to the third barrel it
comes<00:01:52.259> through<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.829> 3100<00:01:53.700> gallon<00:01:54.450> per<00:01:54.600> hour

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
comes through the 3100 gallon per hour

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.770 
comes through the 3100 gallon per hour
pump<00:01:55.670> goes<00:01:56.670> into<00:01:57.390> my<00:01:57.829> UV<00:01:58.829> filter<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.700> then<00:02:00.450> out

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
pump goes into my UV filter and then out

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.139 
pump goes into my UV filter and then out
to<00:02:00.840> my<00:02:01.560> 30<00:02:02.189> gallon<00:02:03.920> barrel<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.880> some

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
to my 30 gallon barrel that I have some

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.410 
to my 30 gallon barrel that I have some
filter<00:02:06.540> mats<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.200> some<00:02:07.649> activated<00:02:08.190> carbon<00:02:08.640> in

and<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.679> spills<00:02:11.130> out<00:02:11.340> into<00:02:11.400> my<00:02:11.850> waterfall

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
and that spills out into my waterfall

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.630 
and that spills out into my waterfall
you<00:02:15.090> see<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.390> still<00:02:15.569> got<00:02:15.930> some<00:02:16.490> touch-up<00:02:17.490> work

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
you see I still got some touch-up work

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.470 
you see I still got some touch-up work
to<00:02:17.850> do<00:02:18.030> cleaning<00:02:18.660> up<00:02:18.900> my<00:02:19.080> lines<00:02:20.390> burying<00:02:21.390> the

needs<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.650> finish<00:02:31.650> being<00:02:31.980> rocked

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
needs to finish being rocked

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.750 
needs to finish being rocked
I<00:02:34.070> made<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.220> rocket<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:37.040> use<00:02:38.040> some<00:02:38.280> expanding

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
I made the rocket and use some expanding

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.630 
I made the rocket and use some expanding
foam<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.330> between<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.989> layers<00:02:40.340> but<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.459> you

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
foam in between the layers but as you

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.430 
foam in between the layers but as you
can<00:02:41.730> see<00:02:41.940> it's<00:02:42.120> got<00:02:42.300> pretty<00:02:42.480> good<00:02:42.630> flow<00:02:43.080> there

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440

compilation<00:04:08.360> of<00:04:09.400> several<00:04:10.400> different<00:04:10.910> filters

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
compilation of several different filters

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.170 
compilation of several different filters
I<00:04:11.420> saw<00:04:11.630> on<00:04:11.780> YouTube<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.680> I'm<00:04:13.280> still<00:04:13.610> tweaking

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
I saw on YouTube and I'm still tweaking

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.259 
I saw on YouTube and I'm still tweaking
it<00:04:14.540> here<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:14.900> there<00:04:15.110> just<00:04:15.470> to<00:04:15.940> get<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.060> flow

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
it here and there just to get the flow

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.460 
it here and there just to get the flow
right<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:18.130> get<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.250> best<00:04:19.430> filtration<00:04:20.090> I<00:04:20.180> can

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
right and get the best filtration I can

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.770 
right and get the best filtration I can
but<00:04:21.470> as<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.769> can<00:04:21.950> see<00:04:22.160> this<00:04:22.610> this<00:04:23.419> is<00:04:23.480> work

but as you can see this this is work

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.470 
but as you can see this this is work
better<00:04:24.050> than<00:04:24.350> any<00:04:24.940> filter<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:25.970> tried<00:04:26.330> to

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
better than any filter I tried to

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.760 
better than any filter I tried to
purchase<00:04:28.030> any<00:04:29.030> kind<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.360> chemicals<00:04:29.900> only
