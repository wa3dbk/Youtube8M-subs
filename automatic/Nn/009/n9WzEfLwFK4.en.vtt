00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
underneath it and and it was mostly just

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.329 
underneath it and and it was mostly just
sort<00:00:58.250> of<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.400> weedy<00:00:58.699> area<00:00:59.449> that<00:00:59.989> was<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:01.250> know

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
sort of a weedy area that was you know

sort of a weedy area that was you know
been<00:01:01.580> dumped<00:01:02.210> on<00:01:02.360> with<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.629> lot<00:01:02.989> of<00:01:03.259> pine

been dumped on with a lot of pine

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.730 
been dumped on with a lot of pine
material<00:01:04.670> now<00:01:05.330> pine<00:01:05.689> material<00:01:06.229> is<00:01:06.320> supposed

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
material now pine material is supposed

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.920 
material now pine material is supposed
to<00:01:06.860> be<00:01:07.009> very<00:01:07.159> acidic<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:08.360> that<00:01:08.509> might<00:01:08.750> be<00:01:08.780> a

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
to be very acidic so that might be a

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
to be very acidic so that might be a
problem<00:01:09.880> we<00:01:10.880> will<00:01:11.180> see<00:01:11.659> this<00:01:12.079> I'm<00:01:12.350> just<00:01:12.530> doing

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
problem we will see this I'm just doing

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.300 
problem we will see this I'm just doing
an<00:01:13.040> experiment<00:01:13.460> here<00:01:14.380> yesterday<00:01:15.380> I<00:01:15.409> dug<00:01:15.920> down

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
an experiment here yesterday I dug down

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.850 
an experiment here yesterday I dug down
to<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.790> soil<00:01:17.090> level<00:01:17.420> on<00:01:17.810> those<00:01:18.049> in<00:01:18.350> this<00:01:18.560> mulch

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
to the soil level on those in this mulch

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.670 
to the soil level on those in this mulch
and<00:01:20.380> then<00:01:21.380> planted<00:01:22.040> some<00:01:22.280> pumpkins<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:23.689> I'll

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
and then planted some pumpkins so I'll

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.210 
and then planted some pumpkins so I'll
hopefully<00:01:24.920> have<00:01:25.399> pumpkins<00:01:25.970> this<00:01:26.210> year<00:01:26.890> but<00:01:27.890> if

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
hopefully have pumpkins this year but if

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.980 
hopefully have pumpkins this year but if
the<00:01:28.490> soil<00:01:28.670> is<00:01:28.940> too<00:01:29.150> acidic

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
the soil is too acidic

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.690 
the soil is too acidic
I<00:01:30.220> might<00:01:31.220> not<00:01:33.370> over<00:01:34.370> here<00:01:35.979> added<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.250> few<00:01:37.460> things

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
I might not over here added a few things

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.350 
I might not over here added a few things
to<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.000> hygge<00:01:38.330> culture<00:01:38.750> bed<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:41.000> have<00:01:41.210> the

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.330 
to the hygge culture bed and I have the
same<00:01:41.600> problem<00:01:41.810> or<00:01:42.409> I<00:01:42.440> might<00:01:42.770> have<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.130> same

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
same problem or I might have the same

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.789 
same problem or I might have the same
problem<00:01:43.760> here<00:01:43.790> I<00:01:45.580> threw<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.640> couple<00:01:46.880> of

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
problem here I threw a couple of

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.140 
problem here I threw a couple of
heirloom<00:01:48.799> style<00:01:49.310> tomato<00:01:49.850> plants<00:01:50.390> in<00:01:50.510> there<00:01:51.040> a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
heirloom style tomato plants in there a

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.740 
heirloom style tomato plants in there a
couple<00:01:53.150> more<00:01:53.330> acorn<00:01:54.140> squash<00:01:55.090> lettuces<00:01:58.750> the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
couple more acorn squash lettuces the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.160 
couple more acorn squash lettuces the
lettuces<00:02:00.440> I<00:02:00.770> put<00:02:01.369> them<00:02:01.460> in<00:02:01.640> like<00:02:01.880> five<00:02:02.869> or<00:02:03.140> six

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
lettuces I put them in like five or six

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.429 
lettuces I put them in like five or six
days<00:02:03.560> ago<00:02:04.180> some<00:02:05.180> of<00:02:05.330> them<00:02:05.510> seem<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.869> be<00:02:06.140> growing

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
days ago some of them seem to be growing

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.889 
days ago some of them seem to be growing
and<00:02:06.830> some<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.250> them<00:02:07.400> seems<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:08.000> have<00:02:08.239> slowed

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
and some of them seems to have slowed

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.539 
and some of them seems to have slowed
down<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:10.280> we<00:02:10.580> shall<00:02:10.939> see<00:02:11.299> if<00:02:11.720> if<00:02:12.680> they<00:02:12.950> if<00:02:13.189> these

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
down so we shall see if if they if these

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.979 
down so we shall see if if they if these
things<00:02:13.879> fail<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:15.280> will<00:02:16.280> test<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.269> soil<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.810> see

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
things fail I will test the soil and see

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.170 
things fail I will test the soil and see
if<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:18.260> too<00:02:18.439> acidic<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:19.189> might<00:02:19.549> need<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.790> add

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
if it's too acidic I might need to add

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.280 
if it's too acidic I might need to add
some<00:02:20.480> amendments<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:23.000> beans<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:23.959> put

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
some amendments the beans that I put

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.259 
some amendments the beans that I put
underneath<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.890> squash<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.610> mean<00:02:25.909> underneath

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
underneath the squash I mean underneath

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.030 
underneath the squash I mean underneath
the<00:02:27.010> mulch<00:02:28.030> never<00:02:29.030> came<00:02:29.989> up

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
the mulch never came up

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.569 
the mulch never came up
so<00:02:31.639> I<00:02:31.669> went<00:02:32.060> ahead<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.450> bought<00:02:32.629> some<00:02:32.900> starts

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
so I went ahead and bought some starts

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.190 
so I went ahead and bought some starts
planted<00:02:34.579> cucumber

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
planted cucumber

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.500 
planted cucumber

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
all three of which will hopefully be

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.089 
all three of which will hopefully be
climbing<00:02:44.390> up<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.720> fence

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.470 

sometimes<00:02:49.099> cucumbers<00:02:49.760> need<00:02:49.970> help<00:02:50.269> in

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
sometimes cucumbers need help in

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.259 
sometimes cucumbers need help in
climbing<00:02:51.019> so<00:02:51.200> I'll<00:02:51.319> have<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.680> probably<00:02:52.269> attach

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
climbing so I'll have to probably attach

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.259 
climbing so I'll have to probably attach
them<00:02:53.599> manually<00:02:54.080> but<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.890> beans<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.239> peas

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
them manually but the beans and the peas

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.320 
them manually but the beans and the peas
should<00:02:56.780> have<00:02:56.989> no<00:02:57.170> problems<00:02:57.650> my<00:02:58.310> potatoes<00:02:59.000> have

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
should have no problems my potatoes have

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.979 
should have no problems my potatoes have
not<00:02:59.569> come<00:02:59.959> up<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:00.830> I'm<00:03:01.099> gonna<00:03:01.340> have<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:02.269> mean

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
places where I mean they are starting to

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.910 
places where I mean they are starting to
sprout<00:03:09.739> I<00:03:10.160> don't<00:03:11.150> know<00:03:11.269> if<00:03:11.390> those<00:03:11.920> potatoes

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
seed potatoes were very good though they

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.850

had<00:03:15.410> no<00:03:15.620> visible<00:03:16.220> sprouts<00:03:16.730> on<00:03:17.120> them<00:03:17.829> when<00:03:18.829> I

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
had no visible sprouts on them when I

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:26.770

got acorn squash again I'm that's my
favorite<00:03:46.120> problem<00:03:47.120> is<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:48.260> mulch<00:03:48.620> gives<00:03:49.100> the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
favorite problem is the mulch gives the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.420 
favorite problem is the mulch gives the
slugs<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:50.030> lot<00:03:50.359> of<00:03:50.510> places<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.959> hide

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
slugs a lot of places to hide

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.910 
slugs a lot of places to hide
and<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:53.090> poor<00:03:53.480> acorn<00:03:54.049> squash<00:03:54.290> there<00:03:54.799> is

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
and that poor acorn squash there is

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.370 
and that poor acorn squash there is
getting<00:03:55.190> eaten<00:03:55.370> alive<00:03:55.790> by<00:03:55.850> slugs<00:03:56.980> so<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:59.380> might

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
getting eaten alive by slugs so I might

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.090 
getting eaten alive by slugs so I might
have<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.650> cover<00:04:01.040> it<00:04:01.220> with<00:04:01.459> something<00:04:02.030> I<00:04:03.100> mean
