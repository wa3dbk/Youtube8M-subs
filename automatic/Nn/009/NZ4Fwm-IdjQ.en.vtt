all these you can sell these cards back

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.170 
all these you can sell these cards back
and<00:01:28.920> make<00:01:29.070> coins<00:01:29.340> off<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.560> um

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
and make coins off of it so you just um

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.700 
and make coins off of it so you just um
basically<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.720> way<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.380> way<00:01:34.500> they<00:01:34.650> should

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
basically the way the way they should

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.230 
basically the way the way they should
work<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.520> get<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
work is if you get one of the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.870 
doesn't have a lot of elite cards in it
like<00:03:45.900> these<00:03:46.110> collections<00:03:46.290> over<00:03:46.890> here<00:03:47.220> do

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
like these collections over here do

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.789 
like these collections over here do
these<00:03:48.390> ones<00:03:48.660> with<00:03:48.810> 40<00:03:49.140> know<00:03:49.260> they<00:03:49.410> have<00:03:49.560> like

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
these ones with 40 know they have like

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.949 
these ones with 40 know they have like
three<00:03:50.010> four<00:03:50.820> elite<00:03:51.180> cards<00:03:51.570> I'm<00:03:51.720> not<00:03:51.840> sure

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
three four elite cards I'm not sure

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.330 
three four elite cards I'm not sure
about<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.230> ones<00:03:52.380> with<00:03:52.500> 30<00:03:52.739> in<00:03:52.920> them<00:03:53.070> we<00:03:53.190> can

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
about the ones with 30 in them we can

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.060 
about the ones with 30 in them we can
actually<00:03:53.580> check<00:03:53.940> real<00:03:54.180> quick<00:03:54.739> I'm<00:03:55.739> pretty

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
actually check real quick I'm pretty

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.220 
actually check real quick I'm pretty
sure<00:03:56.190> they<00:03:56.340> only<00:03:56.580> have<00:03:56.820> like<00:03:57.060> yeah<00:03:57.959> they

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
sure they only have like yeah they

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.199 
sure they only have like yeah they
actually<00:03:58.769> have<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.190> actually<00:03:59.700> had<00:03:59.790> like<00:03:59.910> five

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
actually have the actually had like five

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.690 
actually have the actually had like five
to<00:04:00.480> six<00:04:00.720> collector<00:04:01.170> Ark<00:04:01.440> elite<00:04:02.160> cards<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.610> them

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
to six collector Ark elite cards in them

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.979 
to six collector Ark elite cards in them
so<00:04:02.850> those<00:04:03.000> aren't<00:04:03.180> really<00:04:03.450> good<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.870> get

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
so those aren't really good to get

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.000 
so those aren't really good to get
schnapps<00:04:04.350> for<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.830> stuff<00:04:04.980> like<00:04:05.100> that<00:04:05.160> but

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
schnapps for and stuff like that but

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.990 
schnapps for and stuff like that but
definitely<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.190> ones<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.580> are<00:04:08.670> profitable

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
definitely the ones that are profitable

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.660 
definitely the ones that are profitable
to<00:04:09.450> do<00:04:09.600> if<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.260> have<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.769> cards<00:04:11.160> form<00:04:11.519> and

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
to do if you have the cards form and

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.410 
to do if you have the cards form and
stuff<00:04:11.880> is<00:04:12.030> these<00:04:12.690> ones<00:04:12.989> that<00:04:13.170> say<00:04:13.350> 18<00:04:13.799> 18<00:04:14.280> 20<00:04:14.760> 18

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
stuff is these ones that say 18 18 20 18

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.499 
interceptions the 700 total yards that
one<00:06:14.070> gives<00:06:14.340> a<00:06:14.430> big<00:06:14.610> payout<00:06:14.849> but<00:06:15.210> I<00:06:15.240> don't<00:06:15.419> think

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
one gives a big payout but I don't think

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.200 
one gives a big payout but I don't think
it's<00:06:15.659> going<00:06:15.780> to<00:06:15.840> happen<00:06:16.820> Seattle's<00:06:17.820> defense

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
it's going to happen Seattle's defense

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.360 
it's going to happen Seattle's defense
is<00:06:18.389> elite<00:06:18.750> so<00:06:19.080> I<00:06:19.110> doubt<00:06:19.590> that<00:06:19.770> that<00:06:19.800> that<00:06:20.159> one's

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
is elite so I doubt that that that one's

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.430 
is elite so I doubt that that that one's
going<00:06:20.550> to<00:06:20.580> happen<00:06:21.000> and<00:06:21.210> then<00:06:21.719> the<00:06:21.930> five<00:06:22.139> plus

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
going to happen and then the five plus

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.990 
going to happen and then the five plus
field<00:06:22.710> goals<00:06:22.889> if<00:06:23.130> five<00:06:23.280> or<00:06:23.490> more<00:06:23.610> field<00:06:23.849> goals

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
field goals if five or more field goals

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.180

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.560 
snowing I seriously doubt that will
happen<00:06:27.960> so<00:06:28.560> i<00:06:28.909> might<00:06:29.909> get<00:06:30.000> screwed<00:06:30.330> on<00:06:30.449> all

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
happen so i might get screwed on all

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.999 
happen so i might get screwed on all
these<00:06:30.690> collectibles<00:06:31.320> except<00:06:31.590> for<00:06:31.710> maybe<00:06:31.860> the

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
these collectibles except for maybe the

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.459 
these collectibles except for maybe the
two<00:06:32.280> plus<00:06:32.550> interceptions<00:06:33.300> and<00:06:33.509> the<00:06:34.259> div<00:06:34.440> or

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469 
two plus interceptions and the div or
