straight<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:02.840> it's<00:01:03.840> got<00:01:03.989> limited

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
straight up and down it's got limited

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
pose ability and it's limited like it's
pretty<00:01:06.720> much<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.049> poses<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.409> they<00:01:07.680> select

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
pretty much the poses that they select

pretty much the poses that they select
for<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:09.110> legs<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.030> that's<00:01:12.030> what<00:01:12.150> the

for you legs that is that's what the
legs<00:01:12.450> look<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.750> fully<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:14.909> know<00:01:15.020> fully

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
legs look like fully you know fully

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230 
legs look like fully you know fully
extended<00:01:16.560> they<00:01:17.369> don't<00:01:17.549> go<00:01:17.670> straight<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
extended they don't go straight up and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.570 
extended they don't go straight up and
down<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.960> joint<00:01:19.409> actually<00:01:19.890> makes<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.430> legs

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
down the joint actually makes the legs

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.020 
down the joint actually makes the legs
go<00:01:20.909> at<00:01:21.090> an<00:01:21.180> angle<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.400> because<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
go at an angle and because of that you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.070 
go at an angle and because of that you
know<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> feet<00:01:24.540> are<00:01:24.659> nicely<00:01:24.960> articulated

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
know the feet are nicely articulated

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.480 
know the feet are nicely articulated
they<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:26.000> side<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> side<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.860> knees<00:01:29.040> actually

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
they go side to side the knees actually

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.200 
they go side to side the knees actually
like<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.540> for<00:01:30.750> example<00:01:31.490> bends<00:01:33.140> like<00:01:34.140> so

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
like this one for example bends like so

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.020 
like this one for example bends like so
and<00:01:36.439> goes<00:01:37.439> about<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.100> far<00:01:38.340> extended<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.880> see

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
and goes about that far extended you see

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.280 
and goes about that far extended you see
the<00:01:39.119> screws<00:01:39.420> there<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.729> one<00:01:42.259> extends<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the screws there and this one extends a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.480 
the screws there and this one extends a
bit<00:01:43.409> more<00:01:44.149> you<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.270> about<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.750> much<00:01:46.369> but<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
bit more you get about that much but you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.760 
bit more you get about that much but you
only<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:47.880> about<00:01:47.909> 90<00:01:48.659> degrees<00:01:48.780> worth<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
only get about 90 degrees worth of a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.010 
only get about 90 degrees worth of a
bend<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.049> legs<00:01:52.049> do<00:01:52.320> go<00:01:52.560> 360<00:01:53.369> degrees<00:01:54.020> open

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
bend on the legs do go 360 degrees open

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.940 
bend on the legs do go 360 degrees open
them<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.540> don't<00:01:57.990> know<00:01:58.320> why<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.530> need<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> do

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
them so I don't know why you need to do

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.840 
them so I don't know why you need to do
that<00:01:59.159> but<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.710> nice<00:02:02.040> pose<00:02:02.399> ability<00:02:02.759> at

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that but you get a nice pose ability at

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.280 
that but you get a nice pose ability at
the<00:02:02.939> waist<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.299> waist<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.659> actually<00:02:04.110> one

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the waist the waist is actually one

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.740 
the waist the waist is actually one
solid<00:02:04.710> piece<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> exception<00:02:05.939> after<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
solid piece with the exception after the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.900 
solid piece with the exception after the
hand<00:02:06.990> falls<00:02:07.229> off<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:08.149> that<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:10.640> waist<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
hand falls off of that the waist is a

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.430 
hand falls off of that the waist is a
design<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.870> turn

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
design to turn

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.720 
design to turn
that's<00:02:13.650> what<00:02:13.860> it's<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.040> doesn't<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.460> up<00:02:14.580> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
that's what it's for doesn't go up and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.610 
that's what it's for doesn't go up and
down<00:02:14.820> but<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.270> turn<00:02:15.450> quite<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.750> bit<00:02:15.960> the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
down but it is turn quite a bit the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.000 
down but it is turn quite a bit the
shoulders<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:18.660> whole<00:02:19.290> thing<00:02:19.560> moves<00:02:19.770> pretty

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
shoulders the whole thing moves pretty

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.390 
shoulders the whole thing moves pretty
much<00:02:20.270> it's<00:02:21.270> kind<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.540> stiff<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:23.010> shoulders

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
much it's kind of stiff so the shoulders

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.040 
much it's kind of stiff so the shoulders
do<00:02:23.730> pivot<00:02:24.660> side<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.440> side<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.750> get<00:02:27.870> that

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
do pivot side to side so you get that

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.210 
do pivot side to side so you get that
little<00:02:28.430> kind<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.520> like<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> new<00:02:31.160> models<00:02:32.160> that

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
little kind of like the new models that

Bandai's doing all the shoulders do that

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.500 
Bandai's doing all the shoulders do that
and<00:02:35.600> this<00:02:36.710> part<00:02:37.710> of<00:02:37.890> here<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:39.180> shoulder

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
and this part of here the the shoulder

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.470 
and this part of here the the shoulder
garden<00:02:39.840> does<00:02:39.990> not<00:02:40.490> move<00:02:41.490> like<00:02:41.820> some<00:02:42.270> of<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
garden does not move like some of the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.570 
garden does not move like some of the
like<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.900> rebel<00:02:43.140> texts<00:02:43.410> move<00:02:43.590> these<00:02:44.370> do<00:02:44.550> not

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
like the rebel texts move these do not

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.960 
like the rebel texts move these do not
so<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.600> arm<00:02:45.780> you're<00:02:46.110> also<00:02:46.260> limited<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:46.980> the

so the arm you're also limited in the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.890 
so the arm you're also limited in the
positioning<00:02:50.210> it's<00:02:51.210> kind<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.510> weird<00:02:51.690> it

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
positioning it's kind of weird it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.520 
positioning it's kind of weird it
rotates<00:02:52.730> along<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.940> axis<00:02:54.390> here<00:02:54.660> just<00:02:55.260> above

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
rotates along the axis here just above

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.910

the elbow below the shoulder it's it's
kind<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.220> awkward<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.820> it<00:02:59.910> doesn't<00:03:00.120> always<00:03:00.240> go

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
kind of awkward and it doesn't always go

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.480 
kind of awkward and it doesn't always go
360<00:03:00.660> because<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.350> can't<00:03:01.530> pop<00:03:01.740> out<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:03.420> the

to<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.800> position<00:03:08.220> him<00:03:08.340> properly<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:08.910> guys

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
to to position him properly so you guys

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.630 
to to position him properly so you guys
can<00:03:09.210> see<00:03:09.360> but<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:12.090> kind<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:13.310> twists<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.400> little

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
can see but it kind of twists a little

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.260 
can see but it kind of twists a little
bit<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.970> then<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.230> elbow

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
bit and then the elbow

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.570 
bit and then the elbow
it's<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:19.290> elbows<00:03:19.650> weird<00:03:19.980> it's<00:03:20.190> not<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.370> regular

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
it's the elbows weird it's not a regular

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.760 
it's the elbows weird it's not a regular
elbow<00:03:21.060> joint<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.480> actually<00:03:21.870> goes<00:03:22.050> along<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.350> peg

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
elbow joint it actually goes along a peg

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.790 
elbow joint it actually goes along a peg
and<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.550> peg<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.910> curved<00:03:24.320> so<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.380> get<00:03:25.620> all

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
and the peg is curved so you get all

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.060 
and the peg is curved so you get all
sorts<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.190> crazy<00:03:27.290> directional<00:03:28.290> turning<00:03:29.300> see

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
sorts of crazy directional turning see

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.500 
sorts of crazy directional turning see
it's<00:03:32.070> not<00:03:32.220> like<00:03:32.280> straight<00:03:32.760> like<00:03:33.000> regular

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
it's not like straight like regular

it's not like straight like regular
elbow<00:03:33.750> go<00:03:33.990> here<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.500> this<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.330> elbow<00:03:36.330> noises

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
elbow go here and this is elbow noises

elbow go here and this is elbow noises
go<00:03:36.780> ahead<00:03:36.990> and<00:03:37.200> just<00:03:37.500> just<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.070> know<00:03:38.220> in

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
go ahead and just just so you know in

case you're unaware of that and then

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.690 
case you're unaware of that and then
neck<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:43.070> separate<00:03:44.070> you<00:03:44.190> can<00:03:44.220> take<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.550> neck

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
neck is separate you can take the neck

neck is separate you can take the neck
off<00:03:44.910> apart<00:03:45.630> from<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.840> head<00:03:45.959> but<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:47.040> does

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
off apart from the head but it does

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.070 
off apart from the head but it does
rotate<00:03:47.489> like<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:47.670> serge<00:03:48.390> wrist<00:03:48.720> back<00:03:48.900> and

rotate like that serge wrist back and

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.310 
rotate like that serge wrist back and
forth<00:03:49.290> not<00:03:49.560> go<00:03:49.739> up<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.070> down<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:51.150> head<00:03:51.360> you
