00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.400
 groups beetles battery 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:43.220

 in F sharp major in B minor 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:01.330
 we set barre on the seventh fret to the nameless 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:08.810
 finger we clamp 9 fret 5 strings and 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:13.330

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:17.290
 us seminar further goes in A major 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.290

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.290
 Nameless and pinky on 7 and add 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.600

 and we get in A major 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.820
 now the same code is transferable by 3 and 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.820
 get g major 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:48.760
 and now the same chord is transferred to 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.760
 old fret and we get in F sharp major 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:08.230
 we clamp the workshop and play bust 6 3 2 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:08.230

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:24.550
 gram this brute- time once we put 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.550
 A major and same brute force 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.120
 then we put in G major and the same 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.120
 bust 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.670
 and now we put in F sharp major and the same 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.670
 brute force 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.660
 chord sequence all 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.030
 i'm salt fa sharp this square is playing on 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.950
 throughout the first verse that is but 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:09.400
 the introduction comes next chorus chorus we 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:18.120
 we will play fight we clamp the workshop 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:25.390
 first chord and with our right hand we beat 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:29.709
 bason strings two times down after that 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:40.090
 we beat down also on the first three 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:43.480
 strings but with a slight accent after 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.810
 We let this chord but do not remove it 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:52.959
 just jam the strings in it to 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:59.340
 it was such a sound and we beat it down up 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.340
 fast that is 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:15.379
 so we dismantled the battle now add 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.859
 same chord sequence 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:29.800
 and get what we need to play 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:33.860
 chorus time in G major workshop useful 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.500
 now we proceed to the analysis of the third part 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:44.740
 who like during the second 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:44.740
 verse we press a seminar we play 6 third 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.479
 why beat the first three strings 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:00.910
 then 6 3 at the same time that is what 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.910
 should get 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:15.659
 now just substitute all the chords 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:19.280
 play this brute force and get what we 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.280
