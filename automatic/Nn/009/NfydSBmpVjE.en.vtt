00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
surface in here and see if I can squish

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.229 
surface in here and see if I can squish
him<00:02:51.540> at<00:02:51.660> something<00:02:51.959> I'll<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.709> right<00:02:52.860> back<00:02:53.239> well

three feet but I'm going to stand

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.920 
three feet but I'm going to stand
further<00:03:01.769> back<00:03:01.950> I'm<00:03:02.370> almost<00:03:02.730> like<00:03:02.940> reshaping

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
further back I'm almost like reshaping

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.530 
further back I'm almost like reshaping
him<00:03:04.230> by<00:03:04.380> making<00:03:04.560> him<00:03:04.799> into<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.100> ball<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.760> then

him by making him into a ball and then
this<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.959> glass<00:03:07.459> cutting<00:03:08.459> board<00:03:08.790> which<00:03:08.970> I've

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
this is a glass cutting board which I've

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.940 
this is a glass cutting board which I've
used<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.450> other<00:03:09.600> videos<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.200> helps<00:03:10.470> out<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:10.859> a

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
used in other videos it helps out it's a

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.220 
used in other videos it helps out it's a
nice<00:03:11.100> smooth<00:03:11.940> surface<00:03:11.970> I'm<00:03:12.600> gonna<00:03:12.720> stand<00:03:13.019> back

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
nice smooth surface I'm gonna stand back

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.440 
nice smooth surface I'm gonna stand back
and<00:03:13.560> just<00:03:13.799> whip<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.730> look<00:03:18.000> at<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.209> it

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
and just whip it and look at that it

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.349 
and just whip it and look at that it
does<00:03:18.660> stick<00:03:19.049> check<00:03:19.760> him<00:03:20.760> out<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.060> sticks

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
so that's what I'm going for right in

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.379 
so that's what I'm going for right in
the<00:03:36.299> center<00:03:36.630> for<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.310> here<00:03:38.310> we<00:03:38.430> go<00:03:40.010> not<00:03:41.010> bad

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
the center for you here we go not bad

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.640 
the center for you here we go not bad
and<00:03:42.389> I'm<00:03:42.569> actually<00:03:42.720> whipping<00:03:43.319> it<00:03:43.470> like<00:03:43.620> a

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
and I'm actually whipping it like a

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.059 
and I'm actually whipping it like a
baseball<00:03:44.840> let's<00:03:45.840> see<00:03:46.109> I'll<00:03:46.650> tell<00:03:46.799> you<00:03:46.920> what

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
baseball let's see I'll tell you what

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.559 
baseball let's see I'll tell you what
I'm<00:03:47.280> just<00:03:47.430> gonna<00:03:47.549> let<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:47.819> sit<00:03:48.239> there<00:03:48.269> I'm

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
I'm just gonna let that sit there I'm

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.759 
I'm just gonna let that sit there I'm
gonna<00:03:48.690> let<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.930> camera<00:03:49.230> run<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.500> we'll<00:03:49.590> see

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
gonna let the camera run and we'll see

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.949 
gonna let the camera run and we'll see
how<00:03:49.889> long<00:03:49.950> before<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.579> actually<00:03:50.910> falls<00:03:51.540> off

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
how long before it actually falls off

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.620 
how long before it actually falls off
all<00:03:52.560> right<00:03:52.769> so<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.190> still<00:03:53.639> sticking<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:54.510> is

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
all right so it is still sticking it is

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.170 
all right so it is still sticking it is
not<00:03:54.840> coming<00:03:55.200> off<00:03:55.319> it's<00:03:55.790> doing<00:03:56.790> great<00:03:57.000> on<00:03:57.150> that

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
not coming off it's doing great on that

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.420 
not coming off it's doing great on that
glass<00:03:57.599> surface<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:58.440> maybe<00:03:58.650> other<00:03:58.889> surfaces

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
glass surface so maybe other surfaces

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.830 
glass surface so maybe other surfaces
will<00:03:59.609> have<00:03:59.880> a<00:03:59.910> different<00:04:00.329> effect<00:04:00.389> that's

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
will have a different effect that's

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.900 
will have a different effect that's
something<00:04:01.170> you're<00:04:01.319> gonna<00:04:01.410> have<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.920> test<00:04:02.190> but

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
something you're gonna have to test but

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.479 
something you're gonna have to test but
let<00:04:03.030> me<00:04:03.120> just<00:04:03.329> whip<00:04:03.599> it<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.840> few<00:04:04.049> more<00:04:04.230> times<00:04:04.489> I'm

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
let me just whip it a few more times I'm

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.360 
let me just whip it a few more times I'm
gonna<00:04:05.609> step<00:04:05.940> back<00:04:06.410> line<00:04:07.410> up<00:04:07.650> here<00:04:07.950> hopefully

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
gonna step back line up here hopefully

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.009 
gonna step back line up here hopefully
everything<00:04:08.729> doesn't<00:04:08.910> fall<00:04:09.269> off<00:04:09.509> right<00:04:09.750> hit<00:04:09.900> my

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
everything doesn't fall off right hit my

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.059 
everything doesn't fall off right hit my
camera<00:04:10.500> here<00:04:10.680> we<00:04:10.739> go

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.960 

I<00:04:13.329> would<00:04:14.329> say<00:04:14.480> that's<00:04:14.689> pretty<00:04:14.959> cool<00:04:15.940> let<00:04:16.940> me

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
I would say that's pretty cool let me

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.659 
I would say that's pretty cool let me
see<00:04:17.509> if<00:04:17.600> I<00:04:17.690> can<00:04:17.870> whip<00:04:18.530> this<00:04:18.769> so<00:04:19.039> that<00:04:19.160> is<00:04:19.310> faced

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
see if I can whip this so that is faced

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.510 
see if I can whip this so that is faced
by<00:04:20.169> an<00:04:21.169> somewhere<00:04:21.620> right<00:04:21.859> here<00:04:22.100> for<00:04:22.400> you
