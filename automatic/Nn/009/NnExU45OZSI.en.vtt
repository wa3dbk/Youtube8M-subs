00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
effect you can see here when I push my

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.799 
effect you can see here when I push my
power<00:00:49.890> button<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.940> kind<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.539> little

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
power button this kind of that little

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.779 
power button this kind of that little
window<00:00:52.590> comes<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.129> little<00:00:53.280> bit<00:00:53.430> different

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
window comes in a little bit different

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.189 
window comes in a little bit different
and<00:00:53.940> disappears<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> little<00:00:54.750> bit<00:00:54.840> different<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
and disappears a little bit different to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.840 
and disappears a little bit different to
how<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.320> does<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.680> stock<00:00:55.920> again<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.610> zoom

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
how it does on stock again that is zoom

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
how it does on stock again that is zoom
mode<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.270> let's<00:00:57.300> go<00:00:57.570> ahead<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.840> check<00:00:58.170> out

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
mode so let's go ahead and check out

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.599 
mode so let's go ahead and check out
these<00:00:58.469> settings<00:00:58.890> okay<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.280> we're<00:00:59.460> going<00:00:59.550> to

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
these settings okay so we're going to

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.310 
these settings okay so we're going to
jump<00:00:59.820> straight<00:00:59.879> into<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> animation<00:01:00.780> section

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
jump straight into the animation section

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.840 
jump straight into the animation section
because<00:01:01.559> that's<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> only<00:01:01.980> part<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.370> zuy<00:01:02.579> mod

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
because that's the only part of zuy mod

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.240 
because that's the only part of zuy mod
I<00:01:03.059> actually<00:01:03.300> use<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.019> we'll<00:01:04.949> start<00:01:05.159> off<00:01:05.220> with

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
I actually use and we'll start off with

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.920 
I actually use and we'll start off with
ListView<00:01:05.760> animation<00:01:06.210> here<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.630> we'll<00:01:06.810> go

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
ListView animation here and we'll go

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.289 
ListView animation here and we'll go
ListView<00:01:07.380> animation<00:01:07.799> again<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.280> I've<00:01:09.119> got

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
ListView animation again and I've got

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.090 
ListView animation again and I've got
mine<00:01:09.450> set<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> scale<00:01:10.080> that's<00:01:10.350> my<00:01:10.619> favorite<00:01:11.010> one

mine set to scale that's my favorite one

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.530 
mine set to scale that's my favorite one
I've<00:01:11.280> tried<00:01:11.520> them<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> one

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
I've tried them all but that is the one

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.899 
I've tried them all but that is the one
that<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.840> think<00:01:13.229> looks<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> best<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that I think looks the best and the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.880 
that I think looks the best and the
interpolator<00:01:15.450> I've<00:01:15.689> got<00:01:15.840> set<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.110> anticipate

an<00:01:16.979> overshoot<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.180> animation<00:01:18.780> duration

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
an overshoot the animation duration

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.140 
an overshoot the animation duration
I<00:01:19.439> changed<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> 304<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> think<00:01:21.000> by<00:01:21.090> default

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
I changed the 304 I think by default

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.780 
I changed the 304 I think by default
it's<00:01:21.689> 500<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.740> was<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.040> too<00:01:23.220> slow<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.700> me

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
it's 500 and it was just too slow for me

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.630 
it's 500 and it was just too slow for me
so<00:01:24.000> 300<00:01:24.600> ish<00:01:24.750> was<00:01:25.470> uh<00:01:25.500> was<00:01:26.070> better<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.520> it's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so 300 ish was uh was better and it's

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.999 
so 300 ish was uh was better and it's
just<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.909> little<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.180> faster<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:28.439> persistent

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
just a little bit faster the persistent

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.530 
just a little bit faster the persistent
cache<00:01:29.189> I've<00:01:29.400> actually<00:01:29.520> got<00:01:29.759> set<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.060> animation

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
cache I've actually got set to animation

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.999 
cache I've actually got set to animation
scrolling<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.229> felt<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.710> made<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
scrolling I just felt like it made it a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.010 
scrolling I just felt like it made it a
little<00:01:32.130> bit<00:01:32.310> quicker<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.790> use<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.659> had<00:01:33.840> both

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
little bit quicker to use if I had both

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.060 
little bit quicker to use if I had both
those<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.409> I'm<00:01:34.500> not<00:01:34.619> sure<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:34.829> that's<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
those on I'm not sure if that's a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.950 
those on I'm not sure if that's a
placebo<00:01:35.340> effect<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.150> leave<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.630> anyway

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
placebo effect but I leave it on anyway

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.810 
placebo effect but I leave it on anyway
obviously<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.920> test<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> dispute<00:01:38.700> here

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
obviously you can test the dispute here

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.039 
obviously you can test the dispute here
you<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.150> exactly<00:01:39.390> what<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.689> looks<00:01:39.869> like

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you can see exactly what it looks like

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.870 
you can see exactly what it looks like
so<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.380> nice<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.710> responsive<00:01:40.979> nice<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
so it's nice and responsive nice and

animation if we dive into this I only

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.179 
animation if we dive into this I only
change<00:02:00.689> two<00:02:00.960> things<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.799> them<00:02:01.979> is

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
change two things in here one of them is

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.859 
change two things in here one of them is
the<00:02:02.340> animation<00:02:02.820> controls<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> other<00:02:03.479> one<00:02:03.689> is

window transitions if we tap this you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.570 
window transitions if we tap this you
can<00:02:07.049> see<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.320> little<00:02:07.469> animation<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.459> way

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
can see that little animation the way

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.100 
can see that little animation the way
the<00:02:08.729> window<00:02:09.000> popped<00:02:09.239> up<00:02:09.450> that's<00:02:09.750> what<00:02:09.989> we're

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
the window popped up that's what we're

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.300 
the window popped up that's what we're
going<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.259> be<00:02:10.349> changing<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.890> I've<00:02:11.039> got<00:02:11.190> that

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
going to be changing and I've got that

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.610 
going to be changing and I've got that

looks<00:02:14.069> kind<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.370> cool<00:02:14.520> right<00:02:14.880> now<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.450> actually

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
looks kind of cool right now it actually

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.210 
looks kind of cool right now it actually
changes<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.140> few<00:02:16.230> other<00:02:16.560> things<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.100> don't

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
changes a few other things that I don't

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.920 
changes a few other things that I don't
really<00:02:17.550> like<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.240> see<00:02:18.390> those<00:02:18.540> here

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
really like and you can see those here

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.449 
really like and you can see those here
if<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.200> go<00:02:19.350> into<00:02:19.470> animation<00:02:20.040> controls<00:02:20.340> it

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
if I go into animation controls it

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.030 
if I go into animation controls it
changes<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.080> in-app<00:02:22.080> transition<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.890> that

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
changes the in-app transition to that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.650 
changes the in-app transition to that
and<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.280> changes<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.670> back<00:02:23.819> transition<00:02:24.420> to

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
and it changes the back transition to

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.870 
and it changes the back transition to
that<00:02:25.110> which<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.740> don't<00:02:26.010> really<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.730> looks

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that which I don't really like it looks

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.010 
that which I don't really like it looks
a<00:02:26.940> little<00:02:27.120> bit<00:02:27.209> slow<00:02:27.450> looks<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.750> little<00:02:27.840> bit

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
a little bit slow looks a little bit

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.960 
a little bit slow looks a little bit
weird<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.890> what<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.160> need<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.400> do<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.700> dive

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
weird so what you need to do is dive

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.600 
weird so what you need to do is dive
into<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.330> animation<00:02:30.900> controls<00:02:31.400> turn<00:02:32.400> these

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
into the animation controls turn these

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.210 
into the animation controls turn these

on click prevent app overrides and I

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.059 
on click prevent app overrides and I
change<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.700> animation<00:02:36.150> duration<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.709> 241<00:02:37.709> m/s

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
change the animation duration to 241 m/s

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.830 
change the animation duration to 241 m/s
to<00:02:38.250> make<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.550> little<00:02:38.730> bit<00:02:38.819> quicker<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.270> then

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
to make it a little bit quicker and then

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.540 
to make it a little bit quicker and then
you<00:02:40.110> need<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.380> change<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.830> open<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.400> app

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
you need to change the open in app

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.640 
you need to change the open in app
activity<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.450> close<00:02:42.720> in<00:02:42.959> app<00:02:43.110> activity

to<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.069> fade<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.880> can<00:02:45.060> see<00:02:45.209> what<00:02:45.480> once<00:02:45.720> I've

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.960 
to a fade and you can see what once I've
turned<00:02:46.110> those<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.500> when<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.310> go<00:02:47.489> back<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:47.910> just

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
turned those on when I go back it's just

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.820 
turned those on when I go back it's just
a<00:02:48.180> fade<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.570> when<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.690> go<00:02:48.870> back<00:02:49.019> in<00:02:49.230> again<00:02:49.410> it's

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
a fade and when I go back in again it's

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.290 
a fade and when I go back in again it's
just<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.100> fade<00:02:50.310> which<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.730> me<00:02:50.850> just<00:02:51.060> looks<00:02:51.209> a

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
just a fade which to me just looks a

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.490 
just a fade which to me just looks a
little<00:02:51.330> bit<00:02:51.570> more<00:02:51.720> elegant<00:02:52.019> looks<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.410> little

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
little bit more elegant looks a little

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.350 
little bit more elegant looks a little
bit<00:02:52.680> more<00:02:52.860> normal<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.670> think<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.269> a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
bit more normal and I think it's a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.170 
bit more normal and I think it's a
little<00:02:54.510> bit<00:02:54.600> quicker<00:02:54.840> as<00:02:55.080> well<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:56.070> yeah<00:02:56.760> now<00:02:57.150> I

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
little bit quicker as well so yeah now I

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.820 
little bit quicker as well so yeah now I
also<00:02:57.450> change<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.050> launch<00:02:58.260> from<00:02:58.530> in<00:02:58.709> app

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
also change the launch from in app

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.500 
also change the launch from in app
animation<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.519> grow<00:02:59.730> in<00:02:59.880> left<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.330> there's<00:03:00.480> a

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
animation to grow in left and there's a

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.120 
animation to grow in left and there's a
reason<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.200> if<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.440> turn<00:03:01.650> these<00:03:01.830> off<00:03:01.950> I'll

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
reason for that if I turn these off I'll

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.040 
reason for that if I turn these off I'll
show<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.340> what<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:02.760> mean<00:03:03.060> if<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.690> use<00:03:03.870> my

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
show you what I mean if I use my

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.540 
show you what I mean if I use my
switcher<00:03:04.410> application<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.040> change<00:03:05.310> to

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
switcher application to change to

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.309 
switcher application to change to
Twitter<00:03:05.790> you'll<00:03:06.360> see<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:06.690> animation<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.290> that

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
Twitter you'll see the animation is that

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.199 
Twitter you'll see the animation is that
kind<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.800> rotating<00:03:08.370> effect<00:03:08.670> which<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:09.030> don't

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
kind of rotating effect which I don't

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.370 
kind of rotating effect which I don't
really<00:03:09.360> like<00:03:09.569> and<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.840> looks<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.110> little<00:03:10.200> bit

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
really like and it looks a little bit

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.830 
really like and it looks a little bit
clunky<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.800> little<00:03:11.040> bit<00:03:11.130> slow<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.430> me<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.910> so

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
clunky a little bit slow to me and so

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.120 
clunky a little bit slow to me and so
that's<00:03:13.019> what<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.350> thing<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.590> want<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.890> change

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
that's what the thing I want to change

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.190 
that's what the thing I want to change
so<00:03:14.550> if<00:03:14.790> we<00:03:14.970> turn<00:03:15.120> these<00:03:15.300> back<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:15.480> I've<00:03:15.900> got<00:03:16.080> it

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
so if we turn these back on I've got it

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.900 
so if we turn these back on I've got it
set<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.500> grow<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.830> left<00:03:17.069> if<00:03:17.280> we<00:03:17.310> now<00:03:17.549> try<00:03:17.850> and

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
set to grow in left if we now try and

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.670 
set to grow in left if we now try and
change<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.299> application<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.870> Twitter<00:03:19.110> it

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
change the application to Twitter it

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.870 
change the application to Twitter it
grows<00:03:19.890> in<00:03:20.040> from<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.220> left<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:20.579> see<00:03:20.700> just

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
grows in from the left you can see just

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.580 
grows in from the left you can see just
how<00:03:21.000> quick<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.570> is<00:03:21.690> it's<00:03:21.870> much<00:03:22.049> quicker<00:03:22.290> and

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
how quick that is it's much quicker and

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.400 
how quick that is it's much quicker and
faster<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:23.190> looks<00:03:23.400> more<00:03:23.820> fluid<00:03:24.269> than<00:03:24.450> the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
faster and looks more fluid than the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.620 
faster and looks more fluid than the
than<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.100> default<00:03:26.280> animation<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.150> also

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
than the default animation I also

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.960 
than the default animation I also
changed<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.530> move<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.070> front<00:03:29.280> animation<00:03:29.850> to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
changed the move to front animation to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.550 
changed the move to front animation to
grow<00:03:30.150> in<00:03:30.299> left<00:03:30.540> as<00:03:30.750> well<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.079> if<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.230> turn<00:03:31.440> those

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
grow in left as well and if I turn those

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.920 
grow in left as well and if I turn those
off<00:03:31.739> if<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.400> go<00:03:32.579> for<00:03:32.880> example<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.480> settings

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
off if I go for example to settings

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.780 
off if I go for example to settings
which<00:03:34.260> pulls<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.040> front<00:03:35.220> again<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.640> has

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
which pulls it to the front again it has

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.390 
which pulls it to the front again it has
that<00:03:35.820> weird<00:03:36.180> rotating<00:03:36.900> animation<00:03:37.380> same<00:03:38.160> as<00:03:38.310> if

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
that weird rotating animation same as if

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.160 
that weird rotating animation same as if
we<00:03:38.519> open<00:03:38.730> up<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.910> module<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.299> has<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.630> again<00:03:39.930> so

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
we open up a module it has it again so

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.990 
we open up a module it has it again so
I'm<00:03:40.410> not<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.590> massive<00:03:40.950> fan<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.370> pretty

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
I'm not a massive fan of that pretty

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.940 
I'm not a massive fan of that pretty
much<00:03:42.180> anywhere<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.260> if<00:03:43.320> we<00:03:43.410> turn<00:03:43.590> those<00:03:43.769> on

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
much anywhere so if we turn those on

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.560 
much anywhere so if we turn those on
I've<00:03:44.130> also<00:03:44.310> got<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.910> move<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.390> front

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
I've also got the move to front

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.330 
I've also got the move to front
animation<00:03:46.109> set<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.470> growing<00:03:46.680> left<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.130> if<00:03:47.190> we

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
animation set to growing left and if we

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.460 
animation set to growing left and if we
now<00:03:47.519> open<00:03:47.700> settings<00:03:48.239> you'll<00:03:48.930> see<00:03:49.019> it's<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.320> lot

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
now open settings you'll see it's a lot

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.590 
now open settings you'll see it's a lot
quicker<00:03:49.650> if<00:03:50.100> we<00:03:50.190> open<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.489> module<00:03:50.640> boom<00:03:51.390> it's

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
quicker if we open the module boom it's

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.050 
quicker if we open the module boom it's
it's<00:03:51.900> much<00:03:52.170> quicker<00:03:52.440> there<00:03:52.799> so<00:03:53.220> get

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
it's much quicker there so get

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.220 
it's much quicker there so get
everything<00:03:54.269> else<00:03:54.480> here<00:03:54.690> I've<00:03:54.780> got<00:03:54.930> set<00:03:55.109> to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
everything else here I've got set to

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.810 
everything else here I've got set to

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
default guys and that's pretty much all

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.090 
default guys and that's pretty much all
I<00:03:56.880> change<00:03:57.359> on<00:03:57.600> my<00:03:57.810> zoom<00:03:58.049> mode<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:58.620> yeah<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:58.950> hope
