00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.490
 hello my name is dan and a flaw or 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.260
 breakdown that is very frequent in almost 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.630
 all computers is when the spv 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.900
 turn on but the screen does not show 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.420
 videos usually this fault or breakdown 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.190
 occurs for four reasons 1 the 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.539
 memory now is not badly installed in 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:30.039
 this case we remove ram memory 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.039
 and we install them again 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.730
 2 when they go do they are dirty in 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.040
 this case we remove the memory 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.260
 and we're going to clean the contacts with a 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.260
 pencil gum in this way 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.160
 the language the memory contacts 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.160
 ram and we'll install it again 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.020
 3 when the actual memory is defective 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:01.350
 in this case we remove ram memory 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.180
 and we're going to replace it with a new 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.860
 we replace it with a new one and we return it 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.860
 to install 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.170
 4 when the memory touches is 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.170
 defective may 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.340
 one of these two softwares is not 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.470
 reaching electric current either 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.960
 that these two regulators are crossed 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.160
 or open so you must try in the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.160
 another touch of memory 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.020
 maybe it's just that it's defective 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.970
 and be that what is working 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.030
 normally then you tests in the 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:41.560
 another shock but if still testing the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.360
 two sockets does not give you video then what 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.800
 what you have to do is buy a 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.229
 new mother because a new plate 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.660
 mother then also to opt for 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.060
 replace the two regulators but not 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.180
 I advise it may last a month or two 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.890
 months and have to replace again 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.780
 the regulators so I advise 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.899
 buy a new motherboard but 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.550
 previously try on the two sockets 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.700
 maybe one of them is working 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.920
 normally what happens if the memory is 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.760
 poorly installed or absent then 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.270
 I'm going to turn on the cpu and the gpu that emits 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.760
 a sound that tells us a few beeps that 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.440
 it tells us that ram memory is wrong 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.440
 installed or is absent not 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.700
 I reinstall ram memory 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.330
 and it does not sound like that pib that lifts 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.060
 that tells us to sound like that gib tells us 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.000
 that the pc has started normally but 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.870
 in this case 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.240
 does not show us video and neither does it 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.370
 we hear that classic beep, that's not it 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.590
 been everything I hope you liked the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.450
 video and he said his friend of danny and 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.450
 see you in the next video by
