00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.880
 hello I'm Nestor the arcade geek 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.090
 antonomasia and today I'm going to present you 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.450
 video that is a kind of challenge is something 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:36.350
 different something special let's say and that is 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:40.520
 the other day the go the seris of the channel 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.800
 of wright project sent me a command 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.559
 mail in which I put that was 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.390
 preparing a kind of return challenge and 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.520
 hard to say 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.530
 between several channels and see if I wanted to 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.149
 participate that good that I was going a little 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.400
 late but to continue I felt like it and such 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.989
 and well, this email was sent to me by 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.420
 Wednesday at noon and when I get to 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.430
 home after work well then 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.780
 be noticed a couple of times then I have 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.990
 I could finish the video and well I'll 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.250
 go up to see how good is the challenge 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.659
 consists of the following play the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.659
 first screen of golden ax 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.509
 and do it as quickly as possible without 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.819
 cast magic is to say a kind of 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.020
 speed drum of the first screen and without 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:25.229
 magic so nothing in the challenge I know that 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.579
 they also participate apart from the own 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.560
 great my project then at night 666 and the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.579
 another channel is power bazinga I'm going to 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.500
 leave the links to their channels in the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.590
 the part of let's say of him 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.820
 of the part of text that went down in the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.650
 video in the description and good like 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.120
 they are also now appearing in 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.890
 the video so that the in case in our 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.360
 channels if I know how to do it for a fact 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.920
 in life I edit the video and put 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.510
 links so if I got it 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.050
 to do so you will also be seeing that 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.600
 I'm sure if then I'll get it and 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.580
 Well, without more than what I have 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.080
 explained everything about the good challenge I know 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.289
 One more thing they also told me 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.350
 in case the time was the same 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.660
 because the challenge would win the least harm 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.970
 have received but good to take into account 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.310
 which is a challenge in which you can go to 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.620
 millisecond let's say almost almost then it 's 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.200
 very difficult times are the same 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.090
 but hey good without more than this is going to 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.730
 be a short video that is so 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.500
 come on I'll give the play to the video and he 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.480
 He continued commenting well, he has already 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.610
 come to the play this is going to be fast 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.940
 I told the dwarf, he told me 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.770
 because I think it's the most life 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.210
 removes from the enemies although it is also not 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.850
 the fastest but good indeed more or 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.770
 less to good egg well here this 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.080
 first picket to kill the fast 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.850
 second picket to kill him fast with 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.350
 these are not going out so fast kill them to 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.810
 picket so he hit them normal punches 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.080
 and then the jump hit triggers the time 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.270
 that turns out to be quite a life pulled p'alante 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.650
 Matalena I take the magic or not the 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.060
 I do not care, but if I do not 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.090
 advance the screen and here tried to do 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.710
 a picket send this guy lightning and go 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.090
 great but the good thing is that with the 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.980
 next picket I'll take care of both 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.360
 I say good as I usually have to 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.310
 make two pickets to kill I tell them 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.230
 it goes then it measures more or less in good weather 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.630
 here advanced as quickly as possible 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.570
 to kill that uncle of magic you're 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.090
 two magic and now a machete or 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.750
 for them but like crazy but like crazy 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.610
 ie with angel with cost pÃ¡jara 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.500
 of the tail give them as soon as they get up 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.570
 there as you can see there is some blow 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.270
 have done something faster but good 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.980
 I think I'm going pretty fast 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.020
 and here is the last and for more 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.340
 the time is over I think it has been 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.340
 pretty fast enough 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.269
 well here you have the time 5408 the 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.579
 I'm really happy 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.670
 with this time because I thought that in 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.410
 less than a minute could not be done 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.790
 good to see how others have done 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.690
 and at this moment I have no idea 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.130
 because I do not know about others 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.490
 I know that the videos have to be 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.190
 uploaded for this Friday day 6 the day 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.380
 of the constitution before 4 o'clock in the 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.750
 late and I think so as it occupies poquillo 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.960
 then I'll put it up at about 3 3 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:19.820
 and you can upload this video and then 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:22.430
 that for another that the retro retouching mount 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.110
 in these kids or with more channels than 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.880
 sign up here let's go I'm going 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.410
 head because these things I love 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.800
 that the important thing is not to win or lose 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.100
 but it could happen I'm going to pass it a 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.410
 have a good time to chop healthy and it is already 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.930
 and above, if they are retro things, then a lot 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.030

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.340
