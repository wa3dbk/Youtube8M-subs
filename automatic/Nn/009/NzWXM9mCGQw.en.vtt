00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.940
 I'm with a new unlocking 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.309

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.230
 unlocking hamelin and for this 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.270
 unlocking then we're going to 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.949
 and sungard that is the stone of the map that 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.840
 nearest is this character worth 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.020
 because the same as always we entered 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.960
 again on our map and we mark the 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.800
 destination until this character is worth 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:41.230
 we have to go through the mud forest 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.230
 it's perfect or we're hitting jumps 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.950

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.190

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.610
 mud 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.640
 in our previous unlocking also 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.520

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.760
 of krishna 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.470

 unlocking hamelin you have to 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.290

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.360
