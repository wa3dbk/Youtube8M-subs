out half one one-and-a-half exactly back
to<00:00:21.369> where<00:00:21.490> factory<00:00:21.849> was<00:00:22.029> this<00:00:22.509> right<00:00:22.720> here

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
to where factory was this right here

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.300 
to where factory was this right here
this<00:00:23.140> screw<00:00:23.349> right<00:00:23.380> here<00:00:23.679> is<00:00:23.769> actually<00:00:23.949> your

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
this screw right here is actually your

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.390 
this screw right here is actually your
your<00:00:25.150> idle<00:00:25.660> adjustment<00:00:26.080> and<00:00:26.289> that<00:00:26.349> just<00:00:26.619> sets

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
your idle adjustment and that just sets

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.029 
your idle adjustment and that just sets
how<00:00:27.550> far<00:00:27.820> that<00:00:28.060> slide<00:00:28.509> sits<00:00:29.140> in<00:00:29.289> there<00:00:29.439> so<00:00:29.980> you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
how far that slide sits in there so you

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.169 
how far that slide sits in there so you
really<00:00:30.429> don't<00:00:30.579> you<00:00:30.789> don't<00:00:30.939> need<00:00:31.060> to<00:00:31.119> do

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:31.179 
really don't you don't need to do

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.000 
really don't you don't need to do
anything<00:00:31.449> with<00:00:31.599> that<00:00:31.839> you<00:00:32.619> spray<00:00:32.829> out<00:00:32.890> the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
anything with that you spray out the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.650 
anything with that you spray out the
inside<00:00:33.280> now<00:00:33.730> let's<00:00:33.940> deal<00:00:34.210> with<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.449> choke

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
inside now let's deal with the choke

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.139 
inside now let's deal with the choke
circuit<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:36.460> right<00:00:36.670> here<00:00:36.789> this<00:00:36.940> tube

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
circuit and this right here this tube

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.910 
circuit and this right here this tube
right<00:00:37.270> here<00:00:37.300> picks<00:00:37.690> up<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.350> fuel<00:00:38.620> for<00:00:38.800> the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
right here picks up the fuel for the

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.490 
right here picks up the fuel for the
choke<00:00:39.100> circuit<00:00:39.489> and<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:43.059> sprays<00:00:43.960> right<00:00:44.320> up

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
choke circuit and it sprays right up

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.660 
choke circuit and it sprays right up
directly<00:00:44.800> through<00:00:45.039> you'll<00:00:45.250> notice<00:00:45.460> there's<00:00:45.609> a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
directly through you'll notice there's a

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.729 
directly through you'll notice there's a
couple<00:00:45.879> holes<00:00:46.180> on<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:47.050> outside<00:00:47.079> because<00:00:47.620> this

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
couple holes on the outside because this

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.170 
couple holes on the outside because this
is<00:00:47.859> things<00:00:48.070> this<00:00:48.340> whole<00:00:48.519> thing<00:00:48.699> is<00:00:48.789> submerged

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
is things this whole thing is submerged

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.220 
is things this whole thing is submerged
in<00:00:49.300> fuel<00:00:49.600> so<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:52.629> there's<00:00:52.870> one<00:00:52.989> two<00:00:53.199> three

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
in fuel so know there's one two three

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.340 
in fuel so know there's one two three
four<00:00:53.489> little<00:00:54.489> holes<00:00:54.870> make<00:00:55.870> sure<00:00:55.989> they<00:00:56.140> spray

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
four little holes make sure they spray

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.009 
four little holes make sure they spray
if<00:00:56.530> they<00:00:56.620> don't<00:00:56.859> take<00:00:57.219> a<00:00:57.250> fine<00:00:57.489> copper<00:00:57.789> wire

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
if they don't take a fine copper wire

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.169 
if they don't take a fine copper wire
take<00:00:59.019> it

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
take it

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.930 
take it
it's<00:01:01.179> hurt<00:01:01.420> it<00:01:01.570> in<00:01:01.690> them<00:01:01.809> and<00:01:01.989> just<00:01:02.199> make<00:01:02.379> sure

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
it's hurt it in them and just make sure

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.720 
it's hurt it in them and just make sure
they're<00:01:03.940> all<00:01:04.089> clear<00:01:05.400> that's<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.550> choke

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
they're all clear that's the choke

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.230 
they're all clear that's the choke
passage<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:08.200> does<00:01:08.500> pull<00:01:09.160> fuel<00:01:09.580> from<00:01:12.240> right

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
passage it does pull fuel from right

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.260 
passage it does pull fuel from right
here<00:01:13.510> or<00:01:13.690> pulls<00:01:14.050> air<00:01:14.380> from<00:01:15.010> right<00:01:15.160> here<00:01:15.640> see

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
here or pulls air from right here see

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.260 
here or pulls air from right here see
bigger<00:01:16.510> air<00:01:16.780> bleed<00:01:17.110> right<00:01:17.770> up<00:01:17.920> in<00:01:18.070> here<00:01:18.270> that's

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
bigger air bleed right up in here that's

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.700 
bigger air bleed right up in here that's
just<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.540> direct<00:01:19.780> that<00:01:19.900> it's<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.230> really<00:01:20.590> large

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
just to direct that it's a really large

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.550 
just to direct that it's a really large
passage<00:01:21.190> I<00:01:21.280> won<00:01:21.550> over<00:01:21.670> get<00:01:21.820> clogged<00:01:22.090> up<00:01:22.270> but

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.980 

make<00:01:26.560> sure<00:01:26.590> that's<00:01:26.830> all<00:01:28.620> clear<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.990> then

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
make sure that's all clear and then

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.830 
make sure that's all clear and then
there's<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.260> large<00:01:33.100> hole<00:01:33.460> that<00:01:34.330> this<00:01:34.480> connects

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
there's a large hole that this connects

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.320 
there's a large hole that this connects
to<00:01:35.050> directly<00:01:35.920> on<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.190> inside<00:01:36.460> right<00:01:36.580> here<00:01:36.790> you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
to directly on the inside right here you

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.670 
to directly on the inside right here you
can<00:01:37.450> always<00:01:37.630> tell<00:01:37.780> where<00:01:37.960> holes<00:01:38.170> are<00:01:38.380> because

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
can always tell where holes are because

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.860 
can always tell where holes are because
they<00:01:39.490> where<00:01:40.120> they've<00:01:40.240> drilled<00:01:40.540> them<00:01:40.690> because

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
they where they've drilled them because

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.660 
they where they've drilled them because
they<00:01:40.960> plug<00:01:41.200> them<00:01:41.320> up<00:01:41.350> with<00:01:41.500> BB<00:01:41.860> so<00:01:42.130> they've

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
they plug them up with BB so they've

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.950 
they plug them up with BB so they've
drilled<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:43.030> hole<00:01:43.060> directly<00:01:43.390> in<00:01:43.660> here<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:43.870> they

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
drilled a hole directly in here and they

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.450 
drilled a hole directly in here and they
plugged<00:01:44.260> it<00:01:44.380> up<00:01:44.470> so<00:01:44.620> if<00:01:44.710> you<00:01:44.770> look<00:01:44.980> directly<00:01:45.130> on

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
plugged it up so if you look directly on

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.930 
plugged it up so if you look directly on
inside<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:46.000> there's<00:01:46.120> a<00:01:46.180> huge<00:01:46.480> hole<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:48.400> that

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
inside and there's a huge hole and that

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.520 
inside and there's a huge hole and that
stuff<00:01:49.120> never<00:01:49.270> gets<00:01:49.480> plugged<00:01:50.050> up<00:01:50.230> you<00:01:50.440> know

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
stuff never gets plugged up you know

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.960 
stuff never gets plugged up you know
maybe<00:01:50.710> this<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:52.060> may<00:01:52.480> be<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.690> very<00:01:52.870> bottom

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
maybe this this may be the very bottom

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.929 
maybe this this may be the very bottom
passage<00:01:54.970> for<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.300> fuel<00:01:55.930> pickup

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.010 

that's<00:02:01.749> all<00:02:01.899> clear<00:02:02.140> that's<00:02:02.859> clean<00:02:04.020> that's

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
that's all clear that's clean that's

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.410 
that's all clear that's clean that's
basically<00:02:05.530> cleaning<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.490> carb<00:02:06.700> there's

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
basically cleaning the carb there's

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.369 
basically cleaning the carb there's
really<00:02:07.539> not<00:02:07.689> much<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.899> it

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
really not much to it

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.469 
really not much to it
there's<00:02:08.769> not<00:02:08.890> not<00:02:09.039> many<00:02:09.310> circuits<00:02:09.670> just<00:02:09.819> look

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
there's not not many circuits just look

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.180 
there's not not many circuits just look
at<00:02:10.569> all<00:02:10.660> your<00:02:10.810> passages<00:02:11.319> I<00:02:11.500> mean<00:02:11.769> we<00:02:11.860> got<00:02:12.010> some

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
at all your passages I mean we got some

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.630 
at all your passages I mean we got some
some<00:02:12.970> air<00:02:13.180> vents<00:02:13.569> here<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.959> just<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:15.370> bleed

some air vents here that just just bleed
air<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:19.599> can<00:02:19.750> see<00:02:20.250> there's<00:02:21.250> one<00:02:22.620> there's<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
air you can see there's one there's the

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.110 
air you can see there's one there's the
other<00:02:25.709> all<00:02:26.709> they<00:02:26.920> do<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.129> bleed<00:02:27.370> air<00:02:27.549> to<00:02:28.000> help

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
other all they do is bleed air to help

other all they do is bleed air to help
the<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.680> carb<00:02:30.250> vent

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
the the carb vent

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:31.920 
the the carb vent
you<00:02:30.970> know<00:02:31.090> because<00:02:31.360> otherwise<00:02:31.599> it<00:02:31.870> would

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
you know because otherwise it would

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.150 
you know because otherwise it would
create<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.200> suction<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.620> never<00:02:32.860> be<00:02:32.980> able<00:02:33.099> to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
create a suction you never be able to

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.860 
create a suction you never be able to
gas<00:02:33.640> would<00:02:33.849> never<00:02:34.000> keep<00:02:34.180> flowing<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.629> but

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
gas would never keep flowing in but

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.199 
gas would never keep flowing in but
that's<00:02:35.410> basically<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.129> let's<00:02:36.910> put<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.120> back

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
that's basically it let's put it back

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.619 
that's basically it let's put it back
together<00:02:38.069> we<00:02:39.069> have<00:02:39.250> our<00:02:39.489> Idol<00:02:40.360> jet<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:43.060> make

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.970 

sprays<00:02:52.480> out<00:02:52.629> all<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.810> little<00:02:52.900> side<00:02:53.140> holes

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.770 

drop<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.129> in<00:02:59.760> make<00:03:00.760> sure<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.060> always<00:03:01.540> clean

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
like that snug that back in make sure

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.510 
like that snug that back in make sure
the<00:03:39.880> fuel<00:03:40.030> in<00:03:40.240> light<00:03:40.390> is<00:03:40.510> clean<00:03:40.720> here<00:03:44.520> that's

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
the fuel in light is clean here that's

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.550 
the fuel in light is clean here that's
good<00:03:45.730> now<00:03:46.540> let's<00:03:46.750> take<00:03:46.900> our<00:03:48.810> our<00:03:49.810> float<00:03:50.080> lever

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.940 

again<00:03:53.560> this<00:03:53.710> little<00:03:53.920> tab<00:03:54.810> faces<00:03:55.810> up<00:03:56.440> here<00:03:56.830> or

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
again this little tab faces up here or

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.650 
again this little tab faces up here or
down<00:03:57.070> into<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.430> body<00:03:57.520> of<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.820> carb<00:03:58.000> I'll<00:03:58.540> have

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
down into the body of the carb I'll have

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.350 
down into the body of the carb I'll have
to<00:03:58.750> move<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.020> so<00:03:59.170> our<00:03:59.440> tip<00:04:00.070> our<00:04:00.310> needle<00:04:01.210> I

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
to move that so our tip our needle I

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.790 
to move that so our tip our needle I
don't<00:04:01.510> like<00:04:01.630> really<00:04:01.870> spray<00:04:02.230> this<00:04:02.410> very<00:04:02.590> much

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
don't like really spray this very much

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.710 
don't like really spray this very much
because<00:04:03.300> carburetor<00:04:04.300> cleaner<00:04:04.450> is<00:04:04.660> a

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
because carburetor cleaner is a

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.020 
because carburetor cleaner is a
plasticizer<00:04:05.080> so<00:04:05.440> it<00:04:05.500> will<00:04:05.650> swell<00:04:06.190> certain

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
plasticizer so it will swell certain

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.330 
plasticizer so it will swell certain
things<00:04:07.270> but<00:04:08.080> I<00:04:08.110> just<00:04:08.290> like<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.740> I'm<00:04:09.100> just

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
things but I just like to I'm just

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.510 
things but I just like to I'm just
rubbing<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.700> on<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:10.410> lightly<00:04:11.410> soaked<00:04:11.770> surface

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
rubbing it on a lightly soaked surface

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.890 
rubbing it on a lightly soaked surface
and<00:04:13.420> then<00:04:13.540> we'll<00:04:13.690> just<00:04:13.900> reattach<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:16.600> needle

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
and then we'll just reattach the needle

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.580 
and then we'll just reattach the needle
onto<00:04:17.170> that<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.780> we'll<00:04:19.930> just<00:04:19.959> set<00:04:20.200> it<00:04:20.320> back<00:04:20.410> on

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
onto that and we'll just set it back on

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.420 
onto that and we'll just set it back on
there<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.910> we'll<00:04:22.210> just<00:04:22.240> put<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.600> pin<00:04:23.280> all<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
there and we'll just put the pin all the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:34.620 
there and we'll just put the pin all the
way<00:04:24.520> back<00:04:24.670> through<00:04:33.240> that's<00:04:34.240> it

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
way back through that's it

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.960 
way back through that's it
now<00:04:35.340> we've<00:04:36.340> got<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.550> bottom<00:04:36.820> of<00:04:36.910> the

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
now we've got the bottom of the

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.230 
now we've got the bottom of the
carburetor<00:04:37.590> with<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.680> float<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:39.190> what<00:04:40.120> we're

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
carburetor with the float and what we're

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.790 
carburetor with the float and what we're
going<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.390> do<00:04:40.540> is<00:04:40.660> just<00:04:40.810> kind<00:04:40.960> of<00:04:43.560> just<00:04:44.560> spray

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
going to do is just kind of just spray

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.550 
going to do is just kind of just spray
it<00:04:44.830> out<00:04:45.040> and<00:04:45.870> you'll<00:04:46.870> notice<00:04:47.080> there's<00:04:47.500> a

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
it out and you'll notice there's a

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.650 
it out and you'll notice there's a
couple<00:04:47.710> there's<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.460> pickup<00:04:48.760> well<00:04:49.360> this<00:04:49.510> is

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
couple there's a pickup well this is

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.130 
couple there's a pickup well this is
this<00:04:49.960> one<00:04:50.169> is<00:04:50.350> actually<00:04:50.650> an<00:04:50.770> overflow<00:04:51.390> so<00:04:52.390> if<00:04:52.990> I

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
this one is actually an overflow so if I

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
this one is actually an overflow so if I
spray<00:04:53.410> through<00:04:53.590> here<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:53.890> should<00:04:54.010> actually

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
spray through here it should actually

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.800 
spray through here it should actually
flow<00:04:54.669> out<00:04:54.820> this<00:04:54.940> little<00:04:55.150> overflow<00:04:55.390> tube

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
flow out this little overflow tube

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.030 
flow out this little overflow tube
that's<00:04:56.770> what<00:04:56.919> the<00:04:57.010> fuel<00:04:57.310> gets<00:04:57.400> too<00:04:57.669> high<00:04:59.040> so

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
that's what the fuel gets too high so

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.400 
that's what the fuel gets too high so
nothing<00:05:00.340> really<00:05:00.370> there<00:05:03.810> this<00:05:04.810> is<00:05:05.020> where<00:05:05.200> your

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
nothing really there this is where your

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.320 
nothing really there this is where your
choke<00:05:05.740> actually<00:05:06.310> this<00:05:06.850> is<00:05:07.000> where<00:05:07.150> this<00:05:07.270> little

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
choke actually this is where this little

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.159 
choke actually this is where this little
tube<00:05:07.690> right<00:05:08.440> here<00:05:08.860> this<00:05:09.100> choke<00:05:10.050> fuel<00:05:11.050> pickup

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
tube right here this choke fuel pickup

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.890 
tube right here this choke fuel pickup
actually<00:05:12.160> sits<00:05:12.370> in<00:05:12.460> this<00:05:12.550> little<00:05:12.610> passage<00:05:14.160> so

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
actually sits in this little passage so

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.850 
actually sits in this little passage so
spray<00:05:16.900> that<00:05:17.080> out<00:05:17.200> and<00:05:17.320> sometimes<00:05:17.620> this<00:05:17.710> little

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
spray that out and sometimes this little

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.640 
spray that out and sometimes this little
hole<00:05:18.400> down<00:05:18.430> here<00:05:18.610> will<00:05:18.850> get<00:05:18.940> clogged<00:05:19.180> up<00:05:19.650> make

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
hole down here will get clogged up make

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.590
