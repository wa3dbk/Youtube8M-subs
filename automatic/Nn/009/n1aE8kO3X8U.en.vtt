00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
external design of this Sony it's a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.220 
external design of this Sony it's a
beautiful<00:00:27.300> look<00:00:27.510> Sony<00:00:27.900> calls<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
beautiful look Sony calls it a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.960 
beautiful look Sony calls it a
monolithic<00:00:28.769> display<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> lot<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
monolithic display like a lot of the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.120 
monolithic display like a lot of the
other<00:00:30.119> previous<00:00:30.599> high-end<00:00:31.199> Sony<00:00:31.470> TVs<00:00:31.920> this

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
other previous high-end Sony TVs this

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.590 
other previous high-end Sony TVs this
one's<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.520> little<00:00:32.790> bit<00:00:33.000> different<00:00:33.390> with<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
one's a little bit different with the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.120 
one's a little bit different with the
stand<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.200> actually<00:00:34.530> has<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.829> sort<00:00:35.040> of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
stand it actually has this sort of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.799 
stand it actually has this sort of
circular<00:00:35.489> stand<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> bottom<00:00:36.600> here<00:00:36.780> you

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
circular stand on the bottom here you

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.869 
circular stand on the bottom here you
can<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.410> chrome-plated<00:00:38.190> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> in

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
can see it's chrome-plated kind of in

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.420 
can see it's chrome-plated kind of in
circles<00:00:39.360> thus<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.200> platform<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.190> on

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
circles thus the platform that it's on

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.520 
circles thus the platform that it's on
and<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.820> really<00:00:41.969> makes<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.360> nice<00:00:42.809> accent<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and it really makes a nice accent to the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.500 
and it really makes a nice accent to the
TV<00:00:43.860> itself<00:00:44.100> which<00:00:44.280> seems<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> float<00:00:45.180> above<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
TV itself which seems to float above the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.610 
TV itself which seems to float above the
stand<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.989> course<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> other

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
stand of course like the other

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.650 
stand of course like the other
monolithic<00:00:47.160> sets<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> also<00:00:47.640> has<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.270> black

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
monolithic sets it also has a black

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.389 
monolithic sets it also has a black
bezel<00:00:49.020> looks<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> black<00:00:49.800> slab<00:00:50.160> when

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
bezel looks like a black slab when

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.700 
bezel looks like a black slab when
turned<00:00:50.610> completely<00:00:50.820> off<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:52.199> pane<00:00:52.559> of

turned completely off and one pane of
glass<00:00:52.739> along<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> front<00:00:53.699> completes<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
glass along the front completes the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.810 
glass along the front completes the
really<00:00:54.809> nice<00:00:54.960> design<00:00:55.309> Sony's<00:00:56.309> remote<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
really nice design Sony's remote on the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.130 
really nice design Sony's remote on the
other<00:00:56.969> hand<00:00:57.149> isn't<00:00:57.300> quite<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.690> nice<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:58.020> on
