00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 we come to a new text review 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.830
 this time it's about the rustic texture 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.700
 pack is a 16 16 texture pack and more 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.700
 to after the intro 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:24.570
 we wanted 16 16 sec I offer you is 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.430
 and indeed with these quite actually 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.349
 interesting and cool textures the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.949
 a bit standard are still because 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.599
 still had a lot 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.759
 but it has to be 416 for it 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.949
 combat fresh out and they still have 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.809
 many textures in front of you otherwise 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.790
 I like cool cool texture pack 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.879
 very good for the normal Russian 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.000
 Style as it should be 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.760
 and in 16 times 16 style like you 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.620
 just as it was said 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.300
 that's just six tours here you can 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.710
 then again see the water and stuff 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.120
 security are still standard out of here 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.320
 a few things open as you can see 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.370
 The tools look very interesting 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.510
 We can keep us all up short 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.359
 then you look at a few 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.920
 shader pictures and there I would too 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.869
 already say what is actually synonymous 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.310
 soon minusgrade again 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.929
 a bit late in the evening so not 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.940
 I'm surprised because of my hecticness 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:13.530
 Of course, we also want video tomorrow 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.929
 Can deliver if I do not 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.039
 really have time so that's for 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:19.649
 example the tools you can already see the 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.429
 are a bit too drawn out 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.770
 a little bit 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.750
 well, a bit cruz style 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.070
 Of course, krupp is again struggling 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.310
 See so schenner sees of course again 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.979
 I am very horny 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.649
 mentions that the seelower and the also 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.479
 from cooler more comments china around 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.909
 Of course, thank you for the review 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.890
 a cool thing, of course , again 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.509
 everyone should see me or 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.240
 you how humor I should say 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.640
 of course, the damage happens 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.930
 Every case is very good and I have to say 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.149
 Let's go out and see 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.079
 the whole time out here 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.610
 other blocks 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.380
 that definitely has been here 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.600
 outside but you had to see here 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.250
 I already believe so much 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.219
 getting used to it is not that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.299
 normal it has 16 16h the textures 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.880
 are still a bit 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.310
 well restrained not so 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.760
 Excessively ill how to stop it 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.200
 knowledge is so bad 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.939
 maybe like a nice photo for 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.400

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:21.549

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.450
 and yes we fly through the area 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.489
 so that you get a glimpse again 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.440

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.659
