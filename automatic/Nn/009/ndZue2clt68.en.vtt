 the evening the little kiss to the west face 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:56.430
 but it is therefore as usual we believe 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.460
 no big post-match speeches to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.059

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.230
 at 12 years 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.910

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.250

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.280
 a little bit of ideas finally ideas not 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.350
 require certainty but here is 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.350
 limits in a half time 40 to 0 the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.980
 second half 16-12 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.530
 I could not case by cable 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.420
 it's not the goal 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.380
 just think about it 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.380
 just think about it 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.299

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.210
 things more or less way was very 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:56.590
 good thing it was not grazed excellence 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.050
 to say perfection is good to take these 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.950
 mutants of the pretty much it has to be that 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.500
 me his position took 50 anyway his 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.509
 police and his accountant and that I have 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.540
 nor to find the money 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.540
 necessary 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.110
 we had good things and my hat 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.090
 satisfaction and the players who show 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.220
 more frankly there are some players who 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.060
 are going to others we knew so 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.709
 others and 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.420
 not make case by case on this for me 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.519
 it's a spell to all I have to say 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.769

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.629
 the coming deadline and imagine a lot 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.430
 care a drawing we will not have ground 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.170
 versatile and if it was actually a 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:44.130
 second half as mediocre them I 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.780

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.340
