how could with this piece on the road

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.910 
how could with this piece on the road
let's<00:01:27.959> have<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.079> look<00:01:28.200> inside<00:01:28.319> as<00:01:28.590> well<00:01:28.740> because

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
let's have a look inside as well because

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.769 
let's have a look inside as well because
it's<00:01:29.039> really<00:01:29.279> really<00:01:29.579> cool<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:30.029> if

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:30.779 
it's really really cool in there if

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:31.849 
it's really really cool in there if
you're<00:01:30.899> going<00:01:30.929> to<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.169> an<00:01:31.259> exterior<00:01:31.560> as

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
you're going to have an exterior as

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.529 
you're going to have an exterior as
beautiful<00:01:32.279> as<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:33.029> suppose<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
beautiful as that then I suppose the

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.599 
beautiful as that then I suppose the
interiors<00:01:33.990> got<00:01:34.109> to<00:01:34.229> live<00:01:34.349> up<00:01:34.469> to<00:01:34.499> it<00:01:34.709> and<00:01:34.859> and

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
interiors got to live up to it and and

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.080 
interiors got to live up to it and and
it<00:01:36.029> does<00:01:36.209> the<00:01:37.109> whole<00:01:37.139> floating<00:01:37.859> -<00:01:38.310> takes<00:01:38.880> its

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it does the whole floating - takes its

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.709 
it does the whole floating - takes its
inspiration<00:01:39.240> from<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.259> 5000<00:01:40.979> GT<00:01:41.569> Maserati

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.510 
inspiration from the 5000 GT Maserati
another<00:01:42.990> classic<00:01:43.349> Maserati<00:01:43.709> but<00:01:44.099> I<00:01:44.189> think<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
another classic Maserati but I think the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.370 
another classic Maserati but I think the
centrepiece<00:01:44.969> has<00:01:45.179> to<00:01:45.329> be<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.719> steering

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
centrepiece has to be this steering

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.729 
centrepiece has to be this steering
wheel<00:01:46.529> which<00:01:46.950> has<00:01:47.489> these<00:01:47.759> amazing<00:01:48.739> aluminium

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
sculptural sort of spokes in it and it's
