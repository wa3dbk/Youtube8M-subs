00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
okay so at this point here just go

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.010 
okay so at this point here just go
around<00:01:29.549> before<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.150> insulate<00:01:30.420> because<00:01:30.900> it's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
around before you insulate because it's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.440 
around before you insulate because it's
a<00:01:31.079> lot<00:01:31.229> easier<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.740> notice<00:01:32.490> or<00:01:32.880> tweak<00:01:33.270> any

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
things or any plugs that you may have to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.830 
things or any plugs that you may have to
move<00:01:35.460> rain<00:01:35.759> pot<00:01:36.030> lights<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
move rain pot lights that you have to

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.010 
move rain pot lights that you have to
move<00:01:37.460> before<00:01:38.460> that's<00:01:38.640> insulated<00:01:38.970> drywall<00:01:39.810> in

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
move before that's insulated drywall in

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.200 
move before that's insulated drywall in
our<00:01:40.470> case<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.220> move<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.520> light<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.970> the
