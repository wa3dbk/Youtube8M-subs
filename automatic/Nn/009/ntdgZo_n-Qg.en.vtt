00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 during filming I asked gordon 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.640
 ramsay if a waiter in yours 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.440
 restaurant turned to you with it 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.960
 same attitude as katy you do not 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.000
 licenses remain and he replied no 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.559
 this shows me that I am in the kitchen 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.780
 I respect you have been 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.970
 criticized for that good I gave him 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.560
 of the co for the same reason I have 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.359
 called those who insult us on 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.400
 help and the people who throw the stone on 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.920
 internet and then hides the hand 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.269
 the mafia of the jocks are have no le 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.740
 balls because otherwise they would have the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.810
 dare to tell us in the face of all the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.940
 falsehood the slanders the wickedness that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.130
 publish online without telling us who they are 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.500
 I said so many offensive things but 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.750
 when a person is attacked at 360 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.160
 degrees it happens so sorry i would like 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.600
 be able to control mine 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.579
 language as befits one 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.829
 lady and instead I was impressed 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.300
 from the tourette syndrome it's all the fault 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.010
 of stress 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.949
 I gave him things because it's one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.170
 poor loser yes I called it right 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.980
 so because if one attacks me 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.350
 I react 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.440
 I'm not going to stop I don't 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.480
 I'm one like them in the episode 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.430
 part where he tries to protect you 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.020
 from criticism when gordon has 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.010
 criticized the dishes he had been to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.470
 served 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.270
 you decided not to tell her anything because 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.380
 you behaved this way with her 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.320
 denies it is not true 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.720
 my wife's food is great 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.610
 they appreciate it very much it has no seeds 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.229
 reported that all my dishes were 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.390
 been rejected because he understood that 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.180
 gordon ramsay says a bunch of assholes 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.060
 semi tells me everything i say everything to him 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.790
 we confide we have no secrets 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.590
 protect me I protect him people there 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.780
 he loves us because we are united 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.740
 Me and seeds will fight until the end 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.689
 for the other 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.210
 if someone attacks us I react like 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.220
 a lioness against anyone who tries to 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.079
 discredit my husband or ours 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.350
 activity your business has 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.270
 suffered customers are coming back to 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.880
 it comes a different clientele 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.770
 they are all very satisfied and surprised 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.869
 of what gordon brown supports 6 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.579
 I have enough money to resist 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.979
 until the stupid ones come to his senses noe 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.820
 will return to our restaurant first or 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.040
 then it will happen 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.600
 we are not as he described us 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.539
 gordon ramsay 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.720
 we are completely different we are not 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.850
 two gangsters 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.890
 I changed I gave up some 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.860
 attitudes, however, you said to the di 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.050
 not that you are a gangster at the bed and so 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.390
 I will say again if necessary why between 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.400
 the two of us the strongest is me not him 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.360
 I will not be intimidated or by ramsay or 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.000
 from all those people 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.060
 I assure you and you said that I am 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.950
 ready to repeat it sure I am not afraid 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.290
 I would like people to understand that me and mine 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.490
 husband we are very united this is for me 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.710
 the coolest thing 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.780
 We are not two psychotic madmen 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.550
 they wait an hour for a dish and 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.860
 then they call the police if you protest 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.500
 because you don't need us we don't scream 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.030
 customers to leave but if one comes in 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.030
 our restaurant to make war with us 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.800
 then we chase it 95 percent of the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.270
 things that are said about us is false 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.000
 are statements that make us laugh 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.280
 because they are absurd you have a message for 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.200
 gordon ramsay chef ramsey i will 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.140
 I respected a lot but now you have to say the 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.480
 truth you have to give two entrepreneurs the 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.000
 real possibility to be able to do it 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.310
 split to destroy us you can see 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.260
 what interests you is who put it there 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.390
 standing two is not fault no leaves 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.850
 losing all of america thinks we are 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.010
 two psychotics for smartphones presented 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.080
 be crushed already believe that now comes 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.450
 to say he had joked you should 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.239
 doing it you should work better ask 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.950
 too can not and I ask for it suffers 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.170
 his transmission would end and he 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.510
 should change a life is impossible 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.800
 it's over it will never do it will never tell the 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.800
 truth if it will keep it for itself 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.610
 help homeowners fix their 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.200
 nightmare kitchens is 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.390
 a rewarding experience 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.520
 I face every test with enthusiasm and 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.650
 I dedicate myself passionately to what it is 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.570
 success in scottsdale surprised me 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.160

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.130

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.930
