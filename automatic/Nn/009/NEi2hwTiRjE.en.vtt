00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
packs and the reason I do that is

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.460 
packs and the reason I do that is
because<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.240> wanted<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.509> see<00:00:15.599> if<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.929> can<00:00:15.990> get<00:00:16.289> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
reason why he's rated 86 is because he

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.070

in<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.470> calendar<00:00:28.830> year<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> new<00:00:29.490> record<00:00:29.820> is

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
in a calendar year so the new record is

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.299 
in a calendar year so the new record is
now<00:00:30.119> 86<00:00:30.779> goals<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.890> course<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.250> said

more<00:00:35.040> goals<00:00:35.219> I'm<00:00:35.460> sure<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.600> he<00:00:36.899> is

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
should have done the bottle in the other

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.330 
should have done the bottle in the other
direction<00:02:19.689> so<00:02:20.079> he<00:02:20.200> gets<00:02:20.409> the<00:02:20.590> ball<00:02:20.950> quite

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
direction so he gets the ball quite

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.890 
direction so he gets the ball quite
easily<00:02:21.549> with<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:22.030> keeper<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.569> another

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
easily with the keeper and another

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.990 
easily with the keeper and another
chance<00:02:23.260> i<00:02:23.469> miss<00:02:23.739> and<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.519> end<00:02:24.640> he<00:02:24.700> will

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
chance i miss and in the end he will

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.959 
chance i miss and in the end he will
score<00:02:25.329> to<00:02:25.569> make<00:02:25.599> it<00:02:25.900> 1-1<00:02:26.560> in<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:27.069> 88th<00:02:27.700> minute

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
score to make it 1-1 in the 88th minute

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.539 
score to make it 1-1 in the 88th minute
and<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.989> is<00:02:29.139> just<00:02:29.319> my<00:02:29.620> bad<00:02:29.829> for<00:02:30.010> not<00:02:30.069> taking

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
and that is just my bad for not taking

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.879 
and that is just my bad for not taking
my<00:02:30.819> chances<00:02:31.030> when<00:02:31.389> I<00:02:31.420> had<00:02:31.719> them<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.260> we<00:02:32.379> go<00:02:32.590> into

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889 
my chances when I had them so we go into

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:34.500 
my chances when I had them so we go into
extra<00:02:33.129> time<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.579> our<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.909> course<00:02:34.120> would<00:02:34.269> push

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
extra time and our of course would push

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.289 
extra time and our of course would push
for<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.469> 2-1<00:02:36.010> goal<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.310> want<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:36.849> don't<00:02:37.060> want

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
for that a 2-1 goal I want I don't want

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.449 
for that a 2-1 goal I want I don't want
to<00:02:37.510> go<00:02:37.689> into<00:02:37.870> penalties<00:02:38.439> but<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.889> is<00:02:39.069> what<00:02:39.280> we

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
to go into penalties but that is what we

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.729 
to go into penalties but that is what we
do<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:39.969> I'll<00:02:40.209> score<00:02:40.510> my<00:02:40.689> first<00:02:40.959> one<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.319> he

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
do and I'll score my first one and he

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.099 
do and I'll score my first one and he
will<00:02:41.889> score<00:02:42.010> his<00:02:42.370> first<00:02:42.670> one<00:02:43.090> as<00:02:43.269> well<00:02:43.569> but

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
will score his first one as well but

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.319 
will score his first one as well but
then<00:02:44.230> he<00:02:44.379> saves<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.799> my<00:02:44.919> second<00:02:45.340> shot<00:02:45.579> and<00:02:46.209> I

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
then he saves to my second shot and I

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.149 
then he saves to my second shot and I
stand<00:02:46.599> in<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.840> middle<00:02:47.169> and<00:02:47.349> I<00:02:47.470> saves<00:02:47.739> his<00:02:47.950> as

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
stand in the middle and I saves his as

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.190 
stand in the middle and I saves his as
well<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.669> then<00:02:49.120> molding<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.599> will<00:02:49.750> converted

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
well and then molding you will converted

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.690 
well and then molding you will converted
and<00:02:50.349> he<00:02:50.650> will<00:02:50.769> shoot<00:02:50.889> down<00:02:51.129> the<00:02:51.280> middle<00:02:51.459> once

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
and he will shoot down the middle once

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.699 
and he will shoot down the middle once
again<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.480> thought<00:02:52.689> he'd<00:02:52.930> probably<00:02:53.379> don't

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
again and I thought he'd probably don't

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.319

know<00:02:53.859> how<00:02:54.159> to<00:02:54.220> take<00:02:54.519> penalties<00:02:54.849> and<00:02:55.120> he<00:02:55.209> will

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
know how to take penalties and he will

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.849 
know how to take penalties and he will
shoot<00:02:55.510> down<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.900> middle<00:02:56.079> every<00:02:56.500> single<00:02:56.680> time

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
shoot down the middle every single time

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.949 
shoot down the middle every single time
and<00:02:57.219> that<00:02:57.609> is<00:02:57.760> what<00:02:57.939> he<00:02:58.090> do<00:02:58.329> so<00:02:58.540> i<00:02:58.569> win<00:02:58.840> the

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959

like<00:05:29.940> a<00:05:29.969> rabona<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:30.509> then<00:05:30.599> a<00:05:30.630> bicycle<00:05:31.080> kick

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
like a rabona and then a bicycle kick

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:32.749 
like a rabona and then a bicycle kick
scoping<00:05:31.680> kicks<00:05:31.889> something<00:05:32.219> like<00:05:32.370> that<00:05:32.550> it

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
scoping kicks something like that it

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:33.830

will look really nice for the

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.689 
will look really nice for the
compilation<00:05:34.380> but<00:05:34.889> I<00:05:34.919> end<00:05:35.250> up<00:05:35.370> winning<00:05:35.580> the

and my silver players because I want to
want<00:05:52.050> to<00:05:52.169> do<00:05:52.319> is<00:05:52.529> I<00:05:52.560> want<00:05:52.919> to<00:05:53.400> build<00:05:53.849> a<00:05:54.000> new

want to do is I want to build a new

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:55.760 
want to do is I want to build a new
squad<00:05:54.389> because<00:05:54.539> I<00:05:54.659> had<00:05:55.110> quite<00:05:55.319> a<00:05:55.349> few<00:05:55.500> comments

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
squad because I had quite a few comments

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.589 
squad because I had quite a few comments
about<00:05:55.949> asking<00:05:56.460> when<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.729> next<00:05:56.909> two<00:05:57.150> squad<00:05:57.419> was

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
about asking when the next two squad was

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.360 
about asking when the next two squad was
and<00:05:57.930> I<00:05:58.080> think<00:05:58.259> it<00:05:58.349> is<00:05:58.440> about<00:05:58.560> time<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:59.159> let<00:05:59.340> the

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
and I think it is about time to let the

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.820 
and I think it is about time to let the
let<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.090> gold<00:06:00.389> squad<00:06:00.629> go<00:06:00.840> but<00:06:01.080> I<00:06:01.110> will<00:06:01.319> hang<00:06:01.680> on

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
let the gold squad go but I will hang on

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.890 
let the gold squad go but I will hang on
to<00:06:02.069> a<00:06:02.099> river<00:06:02.460> E&amp;E<00:06:02.940> /<00:06:03.090> hemorrhage<00:06:03.419> and<00:06:03.629> then<00:06:03.750> you

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
to a river E&amp;E / hemorrhage and then you

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.510 
to a river E&amp;E / hemorrhage and then you
should<00:06:04.080> decide<00:06:04.319> which<00:06:04.800> other<00:06:05.039> place<00:06:05.310> I<00:06:05.490> should

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
should decide which other place I should

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.459 
should decide which other place I should
implement<00:06:06.000> in<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.509> side<00:06:06.690> alongside<00:06:07.080> those

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:07.469 
implement in the side alongside those

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.129 
implement in the side alongside those
two<00:06:07.710> players<00:06:07.979> and<00:06:08.940> regarding<00:06:09.360> suicide<00:06:09.539> I<00:06:09.990> will

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
two players and regarding suicide I will

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.959 
two players and regarding suicide I will
probably<00:06:10.560> go<00:06:10.680> back<00:06:10.860> to<00:06:11.159> the<00:06:11.279> full<00:06:11.460> silver<00:06:11.819> side

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
probably go back to the full silver side

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.269 
probably go back to the full silver side
that<00:06:12.120> I<00:06:12.150> had<00:06:12.389> have<00:06:12.810> around<00:06:13.740> one<00:06:14.099> to

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:14.279

one-and-a-half week ago it wasn't very

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
enjoyable to play so i would probably

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.219
