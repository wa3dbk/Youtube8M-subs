Kodiak<00:01:31.110> I'm<00:01:31.320> side<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> young<00:01:32.250> home<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.299> I'm

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
Kodiak I'm side of it young home so I'm

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.910 
Kodiak I'm side of it young home so I'm
on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> side<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> little<00:01:34.110> torn<00:01:34.439> up<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:34.740> side

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
on the side a little torn up on my side

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.030 
on the side a little torn up on my side
though<00:01:35.630> he's<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> fuel<00:01:37.200> gauge<00:01:38.780> 2006<00:01:40.040> okay

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
though he's got the fuel gauge 2006 okay

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.090 
though he's got the fuel gauge 2006 okay
so<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.850> high-tech<00:01:42.840> as<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.290> 2007

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
so it's not as high-tech as the 2007

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.940 
so it's not as high-tech as the 2007
which<00:01:44.220> I've<00:01:44.399> looked<00:01:44.610> at<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.829> here's<00:01:46.829> the

brakes<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.040> will<00:02:51.160> drive<00:02:51.489> forward<00:02:51.820> drive<00:02:52.330> to

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
brakes to it will drive forward drive to

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.130 
brakes to it will drive forward drive to
foot<00:02:53.290> drive<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.709> forward<00:02:54.040> drive<00:02:54.930> then<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.020> can

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
foot drive to forward drive then you can

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.729 
foot drive to forward drive then you can
sweep<00:02:56.350> this<00:02:56.500> over<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.360> lock<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:59.170> lock<00:02:59.440> the

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
sweep this over and lock you lock the

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.660 
sweep this over and lock you lock the
front<00:02:59.950> differential<00:03:00.310> in<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:02.280> lecture<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:03.580> you

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
front differential in the lecture so you

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.890 
front differential in the lecture so you
don't<00:03:03.790> run<00:03:03.880> up<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.120> move<00:03:04.270> that<00:03:04.420> much<00:03:04.630> but<00:03:04.870> um

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
don't run up the move that much but um

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.530 
don't run up the move that much but um
it's<00:03:07.900> two-wheel<00:03:08.350> drive<00:03:08.560> for<00:03:09.190> drive<00:03:09.640> or

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
it's two-wheel drive for drive or

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.880 
it's two-wheel drive for drive or
four-wheel<00:03:10.750> drive<00:03:11.230> with<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.769> diff<00:03:11.920> lock<00:03:12.130> on<00:03:12.370> I

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
four-wheel drive with the diff lock on I

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.810 
four-wheel drive with the diff lock on I
don't<00:03:14.890> like<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.160> because<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.430> makes<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:15.640> lot<00:03:15.760> of

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
don't like it because it makes a lot of

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.440 
don't like it because it makes a lot of
noise<00:03:15.910> whenever<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.510> switches<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.989> gears<00:03:17.290> and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
noise whenever it switches to gears and

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.490 
noise whenever it switches to gears and
it<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.720> sounds<00:03:20.080> bad

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
it just sounds bad

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.120 
it just sounds bad

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
make a video of it I should be mudding

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.680 
make a video of it I should be mudding
and<00:04:42.560> but<00:04:43.190> I'll<00:04:43.340> probably<00:04:43.550> be<00:04:43.880> making<00:04:44.240> a<00:04:44.449> video

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
and but I'll probably be making a video

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.340 
and but I'll probably be making a video
of<00:04:44.750> my<00:04:45.340> own<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.490> 400<00:04:46.970> Rancher<00:04:47.330> on<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.199> ranch
