00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.099
 it's february the barn owls couple have 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.590
 looked up the shelter of the barn 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.030
 pits can be in the wild for about 13 years 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.700
 getting old 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.100
 couples usually remain loyal to each other and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.230
 often use the same nesting place 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.060
 There are nesting sites that already have more than 100 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.099
 years by several generations older 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.199
 used to survive savings interest 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.699
 and has the nest under the roof again 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.199
 concerned 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.880
 from a month before they start laying 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.370
 from the eggs the female gets 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.649
 extra food from the male 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.879
 this feeding during the balls strengthen the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.559
 waistband 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.969
 it also needs extra food 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.969
 for the production of the eggs 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.500
 find the mating after a short bathing ritual 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.500
 Place 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.490
 they sometimes mate many times in one night 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.020
 the pairs of yarn yarn breeding season 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.149
 almost every time the male goes to 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.270
 the nest comes the birds make it together 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.270
 court 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.140
 viewed superficially see the male 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.420
 and the female looks the same 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.830
 but sometimes the female is a bit dark and 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.830
 stronger spotted on the back 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.670
 if the female stays on the nest go this 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.670
 little man on the hunt 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.000
 the nest of their church already exists 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.000
 largely from flat-stepped fallow balls 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.170
 after the first egg has been laid in April 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.819
 the female adds a he every day 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.739
 until the insert is completely in one 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.650
 well mice year the injury is greater 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.840
 then in a bad mice year the big one 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.790
 white eggs stand out so that they even 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.520
 in the dark and not so fast 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.770
 the parents will be trampled 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.290
 feel them hatching for the eggs one 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.970
 month by the female she appeals 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.950
 she regularly returns to make sure 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.950
 that they are heated evenly 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.709
 it touched the eggs and the 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.090
 care of the little boy is 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.090
 done only by the female 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.879
 she leaves the nest only two or three 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.439
 times a day 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.439
 to stretch and brush them 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.380
 it never stays longer than ten minutes 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.380
 away 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:46.379
 it is now with us and the first young is out 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.120
 crawled the egg 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.099
 Young owls are the first 12 days 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.629
 blind 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.730
 the young ones will be around 2 weeks old 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.810
 long by the female she takes care of his or 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.280
 unable to own them 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.280
 maintain body temperature 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.600
 how many young people stay alive 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.600
 depending on the food supply 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.900
 in years with very few mice it is 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.200
 number of young adults becoming whole 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.200
 small 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.180
 carefully it we we 4 the young 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.180
 small pieces of mouse 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.840
 after two weeks the family is complete 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:55.529
 the youngest is a few days old the 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.120
 oldest is 10 days and already a lot bigger 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.860
 young barn owls differ in age 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.449
 and size 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.469
 this increases the chance that in years 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.159
 of scarcity 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:07.599
 at least a few young survive as 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:12.029
 they would all be the same size 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.029
 they would compete strongly with each other 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:18.340
 the young are now a month old and 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.349
 still have a down rug 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.150
 they survive the cold nights thanks 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.990
 dress their thick down and do them 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.990
 love each other 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.830
 when the 6 to 7 weeks old start 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.300
 working on real crying 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.300
 they are in line to be joined 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.090
 at this age the youngsters love 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.750
 also a safe nest curious 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.750
 environment 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.660
 so this is a nice picture for it 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.660
 keep family 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.320
 they are now half young half full 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.320
 get it 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.889
 how many young will the trials 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.020
 to endure the coming year 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.699
 grow up and how much life is the 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.090
 greatest challenge in the life of one 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.090
 church love 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:58.939
 the barn owl is one of the most beautiful birds 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:01.159
 from The Netherlands 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:03.669
 the barn owl is really a following 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:06.199
 the night a bird of darkness 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:09.219
 night and dark are always 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:09.219
 associated with magic 

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:11.929
 we therefore cannot deny that the 

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:15.069
 barn owl 

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:15.069
 is a magic bird 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:40.989
