thing that I'm gonna mention is the

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.970 
thing that I'm gonna mention is the
design<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:15.720> just<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.989> simple<00:03:16.290> sort<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.739> way<00:03:16.950> of

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
design it's just a simple sort of way of

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.090 
design it's just a simple sort of way of
3d<00:03:17.610> sort<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.510> look<00:03:18.690> on<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.050> on<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.709> grill<00:03:19.950> if

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
simple minus and plus which I assume is

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.320 
simple minus and plus which I assume is
going<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.870> be<00:03:24.959> for<00:03:25.110> volume<00:03:25.320> control<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:26.330> this

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
going to be for volume control and this

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.030 
going to be for volume control and this
middle<00:03:27.540> button<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:28.019> called<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.350> multi

the cutout here for the wrist strap on
the<00:03:57.450> bottom<00:03:57.750> nothing<00:03:58.290> too<00:03:58.410> exciting<00:03:58.680> to

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
the bottom nothing too exciting to

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.370 
the bottom nothing too exciting to
report<00:03:58.980> just<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.550> model<00:03:59.790> number<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.380> the

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
report just a model number and the

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.199 
report just a model number and the

both<00:04:03.569> sides<00:04:03.930> have<00:04:04.709> this<00:04:04.859> simple<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:06.299> we<00:04:06.599> have

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:06.719 
both sides have this simple so we have

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.140 
both sides have this simple so we have
cut<00:04:06.959> out<00:04:07.079> look<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.159> can<00:04:08.519> just<00:04:08.879> be

cut out look to it you can just be
through<00:04:09.420> I<00:04:09.480> don't<00:04:09.629> think<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.109> camera<00:04:10.409> will

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
through I don't think the camera will

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.289 
through I don't think the camera will
pick<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.650> up<00:04:10.799> but<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.040> can<00:04:11.159> see<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.489> two

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
as you can see and I've got to be honest

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.749 
as you can see and I've got to be honest
it's<00:05:00.720> not<00:05:00.990> practical<00:05:01.740> at<00:05:02.190> all

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
it's not practical at all

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.050 
it's not practical at all
it<00:05:03.449> doesn't<00:05:04.139> feel<00:05:04.349> if<00:05:05.130> this<00:05:05.370> wrist<00:05:05.669> strap<00:05:05.880> is

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
it doesn't feel if this wrist strap is

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.320 
it doesn't feel if this wrist strap is
cut<00:05:06.270> out<00:05:06.419> for<00:05:06.690> taking<00:05:07.050> such<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.409> weird<00:05:07.800> I<00:05:08.330> get

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
cut out for taking such a weird I get

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.879 
cut out for taking such a weird I get
what<00:05:09.510> you<00:05:09.900> know<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.110> intention<00:05:10.590> is<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.740> make

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
what you know the intention is to make

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.820 
what you know the intention is to make
them<00:05:11.159> more<00:05:11.340> by<00:05:11.550> oven<00:05:11.849> a<00:05:12.000> little<00:05:12.389> bit<00:05:12.510> more

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
them more by oven a little bit more

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.170 
them more by oven a little bit more
funky<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:14.010> different<00:05:14.039> but<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:14.550> as<00:05:14.849> you<00:05:14.940> just

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
funky and different but that as you just

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.850 
funky and different but that as you just
you<00:05:15.479> know<00:05:15.570> it's<00:05:15.750> not<00:05:15.810> working<00:05:16.139> for<00:05:16.260> me<00:05:16.440> that's

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
you know it's not working for me that's

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.029 
you know it's not working for me that's
all<00:05:17.039> I<00:05:17.699> can<00:05:18.570> recommend<00:05:18.930> using<00:05:19.289> included<00:05:19.830> wrist

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
here well it's probably not going to

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.480 
here well it's probably not going to
snap<00:05:24.150> but<00:05:24.389> it's<00:05:24.620> it's<00:05:25.620> not<00:05:25.800> gonna<00:05:25.979> last<00:05:26.280> that

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
snap but it's it's not gonna last that

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.450 
through and we'll get a few followed
device<00:06:00.659> and<00:06:01.020> we<00:06:01.169> will<00:06:01.199> produce<00:06:01.740> a<00:06:02.099> written

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
device and we will produce a written

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.520 
device and we will produce a written
review<00:06:02.610> to<00:06:03.030> to<00:06:03.750> go<00:06:03.930> with<00:06:03.960> this<00:06:04.199> because

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
review to to go with this because

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.810 
review to to go with this because
there's<00:06:04.740> a<00:06:04.770> little<00:06:04.949> are<00:06:05.070> no<00:06:05.190> point<00:06:05.490> in<00:06:05.639> trying

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
there's a little are no point in trying

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.480 
there's a little are no point in trying
to<00:06:06.090> stream<00:06:07.020> audio<00:06:07.229> to<00:06:07.590> this<00:06:07.770> device<00:06:08.130> and<00:06:08.400> then

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
to stream audio to this device and then

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.040 
to stream audio to this device and then
record<00:06:08.820> it<00:06:08.909> from<00:06:09.090> analogue<00:06:09.449> device<00:06:09.780> that's

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
record it from analogue device that's

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.560 
record it from analogue device that's
not<00:06:10.259> going<00:06:10.440> to<00:06:10.530> give<00:06:10.680> a<00:06:10.880> true<00:06:11.880> representation

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
not going to give a true representation

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.410 
not going to give a true representation
of<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:13.380> audio<00:06:14.180> capability

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
of the audio capability

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.810 
of the audio capability
better<00:06:16.980> some<00:06:17.980> thorough<00:06:18.190> testing<00:06:18.670> and

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
better some thorough testing and

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.180 
better some thorough testing and
produced<00:06:19.120> something<00:06:19.450> written<00:06:19.660> and<00:06:20.100> gray<00:06:21.100> at
