now<00:02:01.120> given<00:02:01.480> that<00:02:01.510> we're<00:02:01.810> losing<00:02:02.130> 25

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
now given that we're losing 25

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.460 
now given that we're losing 25
millimeters<00:02:03.730> of<00:02:03.760> travel<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.360> then<00:02:04.900> you're

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
millimeters of travel and then you're

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.490 
millimeters of travel and then you're
effectively<00:02:05.920> losing<00:02:06.550> another<00:02:07.300> 25<00:02:07.930> on<00:02:08.140> top<00:02:08.350> of

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.309 
of course is right out 40 millimeters of
sag<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.970> shock<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.209> definitely<00:02:40.870> too<00:02:41.050> soft

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
sag so the shock is definitely too soft

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.930 
sag so the shock is definitely too soft
in<00:02:41.470> terms<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:41.740> springing<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.459> you'd<00:02:42.670> want<00:02:42.880> to

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
in terms of springing so you'd want to

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.170 
in terms of springing so you'd want to
respring<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.569> shock<00:02:43.780> with<00:02:43.990> a<00:02:44.020> stiffer<00:02:44.380> spring

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
respring the shock with a stiffer spring

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.220 
respring the shock with a stiffer spring
remember<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.420> instance<00:02:46.810> when<00:02:46.990> you<00:02:47.020> get

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
remember in this instance when you get

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.220 
remember in this instance when you get
past<00:02:47.380> 35<00:02:47.830> 40<00:02:48.190> millimeters<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.730> sag<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.959> back

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
past 35 40 millimeters of sag the back

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.020 
past 35 40 millimeters of sag the back
of<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.470> bike<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.860> collapsing<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:51.610> causing

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
of the bike is collapsing and causing

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.570 
of the bike is collapsing and causing
the<00:02:52.120> front<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.660> extend<00:02:53.110> so<00:02:53.380> until<00:02:53.709> you<00:02:53.920> fix

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
the front to extend so until you fix

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.580 
the front to extend so until you fix
that<00:02:54.850> problem<00:02:55.030> you're<00:02:55.870> really<00:02:56.110> never<00:02:56.410> going

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
that problem you're really never going

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.080 
that problem you're really never going
to<00:02:56.650> get<00:02:56.770> truly<00:02:57.160> get<00:02:57.310> an<00:02:57.430> accurate<00:02:57.580> measurement

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
to get truly get an accurate measurement

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.150 
to get truly get an accurate measurement
so<00:02:58.480> if<00:02:59.020> you're<00:02:59.200> buying<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.560> bike<00:02:59.800> you're

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
so if you're buying this bike you're

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.520 
so if you're buying this bike you're
this<00:03:00.310> heavy<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:01.390> weight<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.810> bike<00:03:01.989> is

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
this heavy the weight of the bike is

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.170 
this heavy the weight of the bike is
towards<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.070> rear<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.489> bike<00:03:03.640> with<00:03:03.940> very

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
towards the rear of the bike with very

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.610 
towards the rear of the bike with very
little<00:03:04.420> weight<00:03:04.660> on<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.900> front<00:03:05.020> end<00:03:05.290> that's<00:03:05.500> a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
little weight on the front end that's a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:15.340 
little weight on the front end that's a
huge<00:03:05.980> safety<00:03:06.280> problem

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.580 

now<00:03:15.980> we<00:03:16.040> Chris<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.520> the<00:03:16.610> bike<00:03:17.380> here's<00:03:18.380> exactly

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
now we Chris on the bike here's exactly

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.740 
now we Chris on the bike here's exactly
the<00:03:19.250> same<00:03:19.460> Saget's<00:03:19.940> dave<00:03:20.120> did<00:03:20.360> but<00:03:20.540> there's<00:03:20.690> a

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
the same Saget's dave did but there's a

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.480 
the same Saget's dave did but there's a
40<00:03:21.110> pound<00:03:21.260> weight<00:03:21.500> differential<00:03:21.950> because<00:03:22.340> the

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
40 pound weight differential because the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.460 
40 pound weight differential because the
back<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:22.880> bike<00:03:23.000> has<00:03:23.060> collapsed<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:24.230> until

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
back of the bike has collapsed so until

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.860 
back of the bike has collapsed so until
that's<00:03:24.710> corrected<00:03:25.490> we<00:03:26.060> can't<00:03:26.300> go<00:03:26.420> ahead<00:03:26.690> and

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
that's corrected we can't go ahead and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.410 
that's corrected we can't go ahead and
accurately<00:03:27.440> measure<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.920> front<00:03:28.300> because<00:03:29.300> the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
accurately measure the front because the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.840 
accurately measure the front because the
attitude<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.080> bike<00:03:30.380> is<00:03:31.160> all<00:03:31.460> chopped<00:03:31.700> it

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
attitude of the bike is all chopped it

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:40.080 
attitude of the bike is all chopped it
out<00:03:32.440> now<00:03:33.440> with<00:03:33.590> Lisa<00:03:33.770> on<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.040> bike<00:03:35.560> madam<00:03:37.570> and

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
out now with Lisa on the bike madam and

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:49.730 
out now with Lisa on the bike madam and
140

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.340 

we've<00:03:50.310> got<00:03:50.430> 23<00:03:51.030> millimeters<00:03:51.300> of<00:03:51.570> sag<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.170> this

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
we've got 23 millimeters of sag so this

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.220 
we've got 23 millimeters of sag so this
spring<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.770> marginal<00:03:53.430> if<00:03:53.840> you're<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:55.020> this

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
spring is marginal if you're in this

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.590 
spring is marginal if you're in this
weight<00:03:55.500> category<00:03:56.040> certainly<00:03:56.790> if<00:03:56.910> you're<00:03:57.060> less

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
weight category certainly if you're less

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.150 
weight category certainly if you're less
than<00:03:57.780> 140<00:03:58.230> pounds<00:03:58.620> you're<00:03:58.740> going<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:58.920> have<00:03:59.040> to

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
than 140 pounds you're going to have to

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
than 140 pounds you're going to have to
respring<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.700> back<00:03:59.820> of<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.030> bike<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:08.190> in<00:04:09.060> the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
respring the back of a bike and in the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.010 
respring the back of a bike and in the
front<00:04:09.390> lisa<00:04:09.720> has<00:04:10.850> 20<00:04:11.850> millimeters<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.450> sag<00:04:12.750> so

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
front lisa has 20 millimeters of sag so

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.070 
front lisa has 20 millimeters of sag so
obviously<00:04:13.440> this<00:04:14.400> bike<00:04:14.670> is<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:15.210> definitely

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
obviously this bike is is definitely

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.870 
obviously this bike is is definitely
completely<00:04:16.620> mismatched<00:04:17.040> front<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.520> back<00:04:17.670> with

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
completely mismatched front to back with

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.360 
completely mismatched front to back with
springs<00:04:18.239> at<00:04:18.480> spring<00:04:18.750> rates<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.290> if<00:04:20.070> you're<00:04:20.280> in

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
springs at spring rates so if you're in

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.190 
springs at spring rates so if you're in
this<00:04:20.520> way<00:04:20.700> category<00:04:21.239> you've<00:04:21.390> got<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.690> do<00:04:21.780> some

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
this way category you've got to do some

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.530 
this way category you've got to do some
very<00:04:22.410> significant<00:04:23.160> work<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.610> front<00:04:23.850> but

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
very significant work to the front but

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.950 
very significant work to the front but
in<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.750> back<00:04:24.900> just<00:04:24.930> swap<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.500> spring<00:04:25.770> out
