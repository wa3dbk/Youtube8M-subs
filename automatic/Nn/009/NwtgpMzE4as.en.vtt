00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.859
 welcome to one here 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:09.510
 small update video to the hotspots and 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.200
 yes, I was still attentive 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.299
 I can take a look here 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.820
 apolonia works the thing is a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.100
 little difficult despite four 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.060
 lying with four cables impossible there times 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.199
 a welcome challenge accepted though 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.449
 seems to be very difficult for real 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.880
 or you can do that too 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.520
 are a bit tricky in part 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.620
 stop players mustered 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:40.920
 you will see 50 points despite this 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:45.629
 So what is in the 50 costs knows 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.480
 i do not i do not know it i believe 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.610
 not that the 50 costs that's just so 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.329
 sees a whole list full of players 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:59.910
 how stop really funny yes so me 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.500
 think a full touch is maybe 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.229
 a little too wild we'll lie 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.610
 I really like for 400k though 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.600
 maybe you can do that despite number yes 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.950
 do somehow more that you then 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.780
 normal spielereien takes and best 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.250
 maybe not a player somehow 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.939
 Here's a fucked price range 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.430
 I look that one at ricardo rodriguez 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.070
 for 150 to 5,200 as something wrong 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.759
 Run or something is there 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.030
 somehow wrong 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.560
 and of course I am fine if this 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.040
 maybe leave games out here 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.070
 but lets make outside and then 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.600
 instead, let's say six stops 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.000
 purely fit at 4 lie 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.560
 that should be a bit 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.500
 be better if we look at the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.720
 Prices are okay after that 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.860
 far as I can tell 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.329
 bonn 24 540 k and so on and so forth 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.930
 yes, that's just the squad 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.700
 created with only six despite so by 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.710
 Here's some kind of information 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.549
 I somehow one 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.280
 I would just go here now 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.630
 raus picken 1 11 42 22 so and then 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.340
 Collect this together and at the end 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.640
 you must because somehow here can you 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.220
 here 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.380
 esl teamname your name if it's you 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.819
 Something like that number so you are looking for 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:25.630
 Meyer out when I'm out of them 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:28.690
 I was three he was broke 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.190
 I think so too broken dyballa 50 points 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.360
 for the bba'ler so such players stop 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.450
 not or have you see her here 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.250
 min max price is 50 points so that's 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.050
 of course a great player maybe 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.519
 somehow put together a few others 4 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.530
 lie 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.870
 and 6 so maybe the whole thing 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.300
 a little better is ok then it was 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.890
 it already with the little update I 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.130
 Thank you , I'm fine 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.130
 next
