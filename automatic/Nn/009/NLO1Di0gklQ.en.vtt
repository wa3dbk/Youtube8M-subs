00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.290 
so that's made me happy because I want
to<00:02:34.800> try<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.070> out<00:02:35.160> in<00:02:35.370> for<00:02:35.580> graphics<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.150> know

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
to try that out in for graphics I know

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.660 
to try that out in for graphics I know
it's<00:02:36.570> not<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.720> most<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:37.170> graphical<00:02:37.800> game<00:02:37.980> but

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
it's not the most a graphical game but

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.220 
it's not the most a graphical game but
i'm<00:02:39.180> really<00:02:39.360> looking<00:02:39.510> forward<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.050> and
