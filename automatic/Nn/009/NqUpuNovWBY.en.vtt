00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:51.210 
haven't gotten another deer on the
ground<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:49.380> found<00:00:50.380> out<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.650> there's<00:00:51.040> other

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
ground I found out that there's other

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.450 
ground I found out that there's other
hunters<00:00:51.760> in<00:00:52.210> my<00:00:52.540> spot<00:00:52.900> up<00:00:53.170> in<00:00:54.210> marshall<00:00:55.210> county

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
hunters in my spot up in marshall county

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.100 
hunters in my spot up in marshall county
because<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.640> property<00:00:58.210> line<00:00:58.360> was<00:00:58.690> in<00:00:58.810> a<00:00:58.870> place

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
because the property line was in a place

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.600 
because the property line was in a place
that<00:00:59.140> i<00:00:59.530> didn't<00:00:59.890> know<00:01:00.040> I<00:01:00.070> thought<00:01:00.400> the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
that i didn't know I thought the

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.890 
that i didn't know I thought the
property<00:01:01.060> line<00:01:01.210> was<00:01:01.420> further<00:01:01.720> away<00:01:03.869> but<00:01:04.869> I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
property line was further away but I

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.350 
property line was further away but I
think<00:01:05.019> this<00:01:05.530> is<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.770> fairly<00:01:06.159> decent<00:01:06.340> spot<00:01:07.030> that

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
think this is a fairly decent spot that

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.289 
think this is a fairly decent spot that
these<00:01:07.509> people<00:01:07.810> are<00:01:08.049> letting<00:01:08.290> me<00:01:08.500> hunt<00:01:08.740> now<00:01:09.009> but
