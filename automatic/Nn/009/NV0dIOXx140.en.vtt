guitar video so we've got audio bus
running<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:15.020> I've<00:00:16.369> just<00:00:17.369> got<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.730> ordinary

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
speaker output but you know it could be

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.330 
speaker output but you know it could be
your<00:00:19.619> favorite<00:00:19.830> door<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.289> alchemy<00:00:22.289> as<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
input and there's something else running

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.950 
input and there's something else running
as<00:00:26.730> well<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.060> we'll<00:00:27.240> get<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
as well but we'll get to that in just a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.530 
as well but we'll get to that in just a
sec<00:00:28.220> angelic<00:00:29.220> voice<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.940> guitar<00:00:33.300> which

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
sec angelic voice and the guitar which

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:54.819 
sec angelic voice and the guitar which
is<00:00:33.690> now<00:00:33.840> gonna<00:00:34.250> play<00:00:35.250> alchemy<00:00:36.030> polyphonic<00:00:36.809> so

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:42.480 

and<00:00:55.570> just<00:00:56.570> check<00:00:57.110> another<00:00:57.800> sound

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.690 

so<00:01:43.750> what<00:01:44.750> I've<00:01:44.869> done<00:01:44.899> here<00:01:45.079> to<00:01:45.619> make<00:01:46.310> that<00:01:46.490> work

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
so what I've done here to make that work

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.690 
so what I've done here to make that work
is<00:01:47.119> use<00:01:47.990> another<00:01:48.229> app<00:01:48.590> which<00:01:48.979> some<00:01:49.490> of<00:01:49.520> you

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
is use another app which some of you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.639 
is use another app which some of you
might<00:01:49.880> know<00:01:50.210> but<00:01:50.450> if<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:50.750> don't<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:51.200> think<00:01:51.530> if

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
might know but if you don't I think if

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:52.809 
might know but if you don't I think if
you're<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.799> guitarist<00:01:52.189> used<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.520> definitely

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
you're a guitarist used to definitely

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:58.630 
you're a guitarist used to definitely
get<00:01:52.969> this<00:01:53.179> it's<00:01:54.049> a<00:01:54.500> MIDI<00:01:55.189> guitar<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:57.280> it<00:01:58.280> it

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
get this it's a MIDI guitar and it it

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.569 
get this it's a MIDI guitar and it it
will<00:01:58.909> it<00:01:59.539> will<00:01:59.719> obviously<00:02:00.469> play<00:02:01.130> any<00:02:01.399> of<00:02:01.520> your

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
will it will obviously play any of your

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.880 
will it will obviously play any of your
synth<00:02:02.000> apps<00:02:02.209> that<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.750> can<00:02:02.780> do<00:02:03.350> with<00:02:03.530> virtual

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
synth apps that you can do with virtual

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.919 
synth apps that you can do with virtual
midi<00:02:04.069> at<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.310> moment<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:05.000> also<00:02:05.179> does<00:02:05.479> Wi-Fi

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
midi at the moment it also does Wi-Fi

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.229 
midi at the moment it also does Wi-Fi
MIDI<00:02:06.200> as<00:02:06.350> well<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:06.709> you<00:02:06.770> can<00:02:07.039> control<00:02:07.969> any<00:02:08.209> of

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
MIDI as well so you can control any of

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.039 
MIDI as well so you can control any of
the<00:02:08.330> sense<00:02:08.599> off<00:02:08.840> your<00:02:09.220> desktop<00:02:10.220> da<00:02:10.670> w's<00:02:11.150> okay

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
the sense off your desktop da w's okay

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.729 
the sense off your desktop da w's okay
so<00:02:12.110> it's<00:02:12.379> picked<00:02:12.709> up<00:02:12.799> for<00:02:12.980> alchemy<00:02:13.340> mobile<00:02:13.730> now

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
so it's picked up for alchemy mobile now

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.000 
so it's picked up for alchemy mobile now
it<00:02:15.739> does<00:02:16.040> polyphonic<00:02:16.760> or<00:02:16.910> monophonic<00:02:17.299> and<00:02:17.569> has

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
it does polyphonic or monophonic and has

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.990 
it does polyphonic or monophonic and has
latency<00:02:19.010> sense<00:02:19.250> other<00:02:19.519> than<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.819> it's

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
latency sense other than that it's

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.819 
latency sense other than that it's
pretty<00:02:21.099> anything<00:02:23.230> but<00:02:24.230> I've<00:02:24.410> got<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.680> running

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
pretty anything but I've got it running

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.199 
pretty anything but I've got it running
with<00:02:25.069> alchemy<00:02:25.400> because<00:02:25.579> I<00:02:25.730> think<00:02:25.790> it's<00:02:26.060> really

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
with alchemy because I think it's really

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.449 
with alchemy because I think it's really
it's<00:02:27.049> really<00:02:27.140> nice<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:27.709> that's<00:02:27.890> that's<00:02:28.220> all

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
it's really nice so that's that's all

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.000 
it's really nice so that's that's all
you<00:02:28.549> do<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:29.329> get<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.079> only<00:02:30.650> thing<00:02:30.799> is<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
you do to get to the only thing is the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.520 
you do to get to the only thing is the
app<00:02:31.099> is<00:02:31.280> free<00:02:31.510> but<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.569> only<00:02:32.780> thought<00:02:33.110> he<00:02:33.260> only

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
app is free but it only thought he only

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.569 
app is free but it only thought he only
comes<00:02:33.739> with<00:02:33.950> fear<00:02:34.250> okay<00:02:35.060> this<00:02:35.959> one<00:02:36.200> sound

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
comes with fear okay this one sound

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:42.550 
comes with fear okay this one sound
which<00:02:37.579> which<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:38.269> rubbish<00:02:41.140> but<00:02:42.140> at<00:02:42.230> least<00:02:42.349> you

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
which which is rubbish but at least you

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.990 
which which is rubbish but at least you
can<00:02:42.739> see<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.129> works<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.670> then<00:02:43.760> we<00:02:43.849> can

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
can see that it works and then we can

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.729 
can see that it works and then we can
run<00:02:44.180> through<00:02:44.329> network<00:02:44.870> sessions<00:02:45.350> virtual

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
run through network sessions virtual

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.129 
run through network sessions virtual
midi<00:02:45.859> alchemy<00:02:46.250> mobile<00:02:46.579> again<00:02:48.850> it's<00:02:50.139> $13.99

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
midi alchemy mobile again it's $13.99

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.870 
midi alchemy mobile again it's $13.99
which<00:02:51.470> is<00:02:51.620> what<00:02:51.799> I<00:02:51.829> guess<00:02:52.389> 1919<00:02:53.389> or<00:02:53.480> $20.00<00:02:54.109> and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
which is what I guess 1919 or $20.00 and

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.879 
which is what I guess 1919 or $20.00 and
to<00:02:55.880> get<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:56.480> virtual<00:02:56.750> midi<00:02:57.109> I<00:02:57.410> think<00:02:57.709> it's

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
to get the virtual midi I think it's

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.610 
to get the virtual midi I think it's
well<00:02:58.190> worth<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.730> I<00:02:58.970> got<00:02:59.900> this<00:02:59.989> absolutely<00:03:00.230> ages

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
well worth it I got this absolutely ages

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.520 
well worth it I got this absolutely ages
ago<00:03:00.889> I<00:03:01.010> forgot<00:03:01.280> forgot<00:03:01.609> all<00:03:01.880> about<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.150> until<00:03:02.530> I

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
ago I forgot forgot all about it until I

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.520 
ago I forgot forgot all about it until I
gave<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.940> iPad<00:03:05.329> and<00:03:05.540> I'll<00:03:05.870> try<00:03:06.139> the<00:03:06.200> stuff

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
gave the iPad and I'll try the stuff

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.890 
gave the iPad and I'll try the stuff
that<00:03:06.739> you<00:03:06.829> know<00:03:06.950> do<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.310> was<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.430> bit<00:03:07.639> glitchy<00:03:07.900> so

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
that you know do it was a bit glitchy so

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.809 
that you know do it was a bit glitchy so
anyway<00:03:09.319> let's<00:03:09.919> run<00:03:10.190> through<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.430> few<00:03:10.639> more

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
anyway let's run through a few more

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.110 
anyway let's run through a few more
sounds<00:03:12.040> let's<00:03:13.040> pick<00:03:13.310> another<00:03:13.400> another

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
sounds let's pick another another

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:26.199 
sounds let's pick another another
library<00:03:14.690> actually<00:03:15.410> I<00:03:15.590> quite<00:03:16.099> like<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:23.109> I<00:03:25.209> like

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
library actually I quite like the I like

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:33.250 
library actually I quite like the I like
the<00:03:26.359> guitar<00:03:27.430> ones<00:03:30.400> because<00:03:31.569> it<00:03:32.569> sounds<00:03:32.989> really

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
the guitar ones because it sounds really

00:03:33.260 --> 00:04:13.230
