00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.920
 although there is poverty mh how 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:14.739
 how so 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.300
 Rotterdam is the most being in Europe 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.840
 Products arrive from all over the world through this distance 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.430
 the pit stop 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.520
 first to the hinterland 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.050
 this distribution provides a lot of jobs for that ensured 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.050
 the netherlands a trading nation 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.660
 the trade and transport sector but even nearly 20 percent of the Dutch 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.850
 Gross domestic product 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.910
 for good international trade is like last year 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.920
 this can be done through extensive network of waterways and they form roads 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.680
 nevertheless the infrastructure of the netherlands appears to have been seriously deficient in recent years 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.399
 shoot 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.470
 cope with the constantly growing flow of goods 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.790
 therefore negative in May 94 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.870
 the plans for the cup in the tub are decisively laid down 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.799
 in the following year so the second room gave the green light for the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.070
 construction of this railway line in Rotterdam with the German hinterland 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.570
 this 160 kilometer long railway line 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.520
 that from Rotterdam to an open house on the German border connecting her business 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.200
 German sport 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.150
 the objective of this project 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.110
 and recipient of the shortage on good 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.380
 carry over the railroad 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.689
 it arises because the capacity is mainly used for 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.320
 passengers 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.840
 relieving the burden on the road network through the decrease in freight transport via that road 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.560
 keep up with the constant growth of rotterdam nb safeguard import function 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.360
 this large infrastructure projects provide a lot of employment 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.140
 The name was originally chosen as better to be confused with the already 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.980
 existing appears to be better 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.180
 and politics in the media was called Peter Line 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.160
 from the start of construction there are four other business premises and houses 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.980
 demolished 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.770
 make a job out of the word 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.799
 the owners of these properties are financially compensated 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.969
 on request of the client 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:18.309
 the company bull does expect the system of 155 points and 130 overpasses 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.029
 bridges 190 fauna passages 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.730
 too often this railway line was the first track in the Netherlands to use at5 20 kilos 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.129
 for the system 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.199
 this prestigious project of 3com to 8 billion euros in use at the beginning of 2007 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.619
 must be taken 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:36.119
 these seekers could, in the long term, be recouped as 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:40.879
 due to the expected additional 30 million tonnes of cross-border freight in 2015 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:47.059
 after the second chamber 2096 must approve route decision of the better 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.659
 the then NS prorail infrastructure management has now been assessed 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.659
 received the order to construct the second time 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.819
 the budget that was made available for this purpose was only 74 billion euros 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.469
 based on the then prevailing prices 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.839
 it was also established what a margin of 20 percent is acceptable 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.929
 in the route decision without exactly what is there for that money 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:11.959
 be parked 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.349
 this becomes disco bar 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.359
 in the period between 9 and 96 and 2005 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.699
 with the budget of a little lead supplemented with the 783 million euros for 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:23.809
 the extra charges 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:27.049
 the extensive sko they added an extra 321 million euros 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:33.309
 the forecast of the costs in July 2007 around â‚¬ 350 billion 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:38.059
 but the state of affairs in a year's time 6 it was that the project already had more than 4 to 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.119
 8 billion euros 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.899
 for a lot of delays and the rising costs 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:47.009
 in 2007 they are still intact 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.009
 commissioning has been prepared by soldiers 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:54.209
 the better line is an unwanted project for many 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.619
 from the outset both the years of construction and the inconvenience 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:58.739
 from the hotel 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.069
 for many complaints from local residents 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.279
 similarly in tiel 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.549
 that is divided by both the a15 and the beetle end points 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:15.829
 horn up 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.509
 her works 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.629
 then a nonsense 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.629
 we have the first leg 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.590
 Yes 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.590
 markets can happen 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.199
 actually completely 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.490
 the municipality is breaking through 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.490
 then in edinburgh 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.599
 per share 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.270
 the American 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.060
 the ditch the problems ended up with the book burgum 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.219
 the Dutchman won a train 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.219
 we try to handle the news so well 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:05.870
 6 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.870
 Koekelberg is walking 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:13.219
 that the prizes are distributed 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.689
 Queen Beatrix will most likely take the metro line in June 2007 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.210
 officially open 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.580
 but yes of delay 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.110
 financial setbacks the protests show the direct connection of 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.120
 Take Rotterdam to the German hinterland now 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.509
 she can be seen here 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.539
 yes the expectations are that this connection will be available in the coming years 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.630
 for many additional millions of tons of cross-border decency standards 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:40.219
 This offers glorious opportunities for my sport to grow up the anp and 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.219
 its leading position in international trade 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.219
 did 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:51.219
 from 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.339
