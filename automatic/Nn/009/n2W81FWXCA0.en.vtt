00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 and I 'm immune to everyone and we're on the verge of 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.770
 a boyfriend of jeta 5 in this case we are 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.180
 with the new update that you already know 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.250
 that has been just today 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.929
 and that is available for all 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.370
 You see platforms like today I 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.690
 I'm going to show the tournament of one of the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.099
 new vehicles that has come out that the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.599
 I really like fixes 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.460
 how the doors come out and today I'm going to 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.779
 teach what this car is worth and what 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.490
 are also worth the others in case you want 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.199
 because they know that since sections 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.000
 travel and transportation we have to go here 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.949
 to the legend or motorsport and as you see 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.019
 they have changed what would be the menu in 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.050
 this case the vehicle that we are going to have 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.600
 would this be the benefactor styling gt that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.520
 goes from 975 this would be the clearest of 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.140
 all that is the pegasus city that also 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.030
 you are going to have a video later on him 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.500
 but in this case we're going to tune this 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.540
 that the truth that pretty cool what 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.430
 it would be about the doors that is 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.620
 pretty good is a novelty that they have 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.910
 included in this dlc in this vehicle and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.500
 the truth that I love so nothing 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.910
 let's go to the righteous saints we're going 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.440
 to have this vehicle to see how it is 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.329
 as you are seeing we are already here 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.280
 let's see what things can be put 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.989
 what would be the doors and all this to 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.460
 see if you can put spoiler and the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.590
 different things that you can put 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.789
 and we will see how it is for 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.400
 shielding all this I'm not going to put it 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.140
 because it's simply to make it better 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.909
 the car and what I want to see 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.640
 it's as if it would fit, I think it's 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.010
 better with this one here we're going to see the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.010
 others as they would be let's see the escape 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.900
 serial coffee you can not see 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.340
 a gale baleares here is here to us 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.680
 how live is that I like more 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.690
 sincerely the one that has value 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.330
 let's see the grille 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.250
 this one I like more with all these 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.740
 so we're going to put it like that then the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.840
 capo so that it stays like that 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.090
 I think that's how the carbon bonnet works better 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.730
 mola more then the horn that we're going to 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.650
 also put the lights of being a yes what 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.810
 On the other hand this already gets registration 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.760
 these are like all of them although in this 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.340
 case we are going to put this so that it is 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.780
 just like the capo the painting to the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.250
 paint only has the color 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.810
 principal ok ok because we have 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.120
 removed what would be the capo so 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.210
 let's see what's left we're going to put 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.670
 the metal and esteban let's see which one 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.500
 we have around here to see what he knows 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.960
 it suits you better these worlds the truth is 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.970
 It looks pretty good, it does not 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.100
 make things the blue is that I love 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.010
 you can seriously get it blue 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.099
 racing for now 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.230
 or is the same also looks good but the 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.700
 blue racing 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.709
 if the blue racing by was approaching me 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.769
 like everyone then the journalist 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.470
 It is also pretty cool but I would say 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.670
 we're going to put the racing blue on 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.829
 little red is also quite 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.200
 well the truth in this car but as 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.519
 I brought it red we're going to it for blue and 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.829
 the red and we will put it to another car 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.230
 let's look for it racing blue for 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.370
 here then we have the emblem of the I think 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.569
 that in this we do not have any 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.829
 emblem so we can not put it 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:52.260
 none the flight cage is not always 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:56.379
 change the color to the cage to see no no 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.120
 paint as if not here yes yes now 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.080
 Well, here we can put it 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.590
 black so that it is blue 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.630
 blue in plan towards white yes yes yes know 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.940
 let's see white white white 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.980
 where are we going to put it on target 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.720
 because I think it may look good that 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.360
 stand out below yes it can be white 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.740
 frost west yes I think the white 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.810
 and ice and I do not know if it left me here 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.860
 put in pearl exact here the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.110
 we put in the face of we put it on 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.910
 white and I think now he was going 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.670
 to stay much better ice white 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.150
 there we are now yes so I like 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.170
 more how is it left then we would stay 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.780
 sell when you give to us give us 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.800
 pretty spoiler yes it has extraction 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.709
 It's worth it if we do not put that in the turbo 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.300
 ok this is nothing the wheels and that if you 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.700
 we are going to change it, we are going to 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.020
 see the luxury ones as they were luxury 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.330
 I think there were some up here that 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.310
 I liked them a lot, I like them a lot 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.310
 but I do not know which one will be better to 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.410
 this car we will go down to see if there 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.780
 some that we like more I think that 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.209
 I'm going to put that is what really are the 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.569
 I like for these cars this 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:09.200
 we're going to put it on, we're not going to chrome 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.970
 to put white and white white we are going to 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.470
 look because I think that maybe 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.810
 yes I know because it is white as I have 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.799
 seen that we have put the other white 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.359
 we are looking for white scarce that is 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.340
 here I think that was the frost and 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.919
 I think it's not there the ice is not worth 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.260
 we put that accessories and tires 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.630
 bulletproof custom made it what 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.240
 let's put blue I do not know if I will not have 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.850
 unlocked and then we put the blue 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.930
 and I think it would be ready I'll 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.009
 come down anyway in case there 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.869
 clarified the windows the windows 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.789
 I think it's a life leaves like that 

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:45.099
 transparent to see this or 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.900
 maybe a little bit like that if I think that 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.069
 yes with a little nothing else I think that 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.169
 yes it stays better because if the 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.059
 we put black whole is not going to see by 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.460
 behind what would this be the calender 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:56.559
 so I kind of put it on for 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.180
 nothing not the truth that I do not 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:59.979
 love the fact of this the doors 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.599
 and notice how cool it is how we get 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.389
 open a door and stay that way 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.580
 open let's go there we are going to fix is 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.020
 that the truth remains that pretty well 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.120
 we're going to open both of them since it's 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.919
 we are there there is a bat appears 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.960
 I was up here and the truth is that 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.370
 there we are closed then nothing guys 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.899
 I hope you liked the truth that 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.080
 I really like this vehicle as 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:24.849
 is the tune and everything is pretty cool and 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.169
 nothing if you liked it leave a piece of 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.729
 the excessive so your Christian is not 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.839
 to lose any video and see you in 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.839
 the next goodbye
