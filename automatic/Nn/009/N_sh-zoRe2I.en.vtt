00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.550
 decades of driving to this car 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.829
 because it 's a pretty complicated car 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.540

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.920

 I think I remember more than the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.719
 would play a lot of time and you have to 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.210

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.800
 when I shot with a bit of this 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.270
 but it looks like it's a flying pea 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.039
 they do not let me live to the entrants 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.170

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.379
 ok eye because we go first I do not want 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.379

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.170

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.550
 Checkpoints seems pretty 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.590
 right we have the second list behind 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.940
 takes a willy list that is critical that 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.410
 the theme said a damn to the taste uncle 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.760
 vania this car is so fragile that I 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.620
 a branch arrives a branch woman half of the 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.940
 incredible day to day it seems that the 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.910
 car is a bit sad the one behind the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.510
 capo is sad or 10 has a part of 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:40.060
 the very good sad sewing of the house 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.980
 no one earns his car runs more macho 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.810
 my mother, my mother, cyberbulling 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.580

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.480
 roof from the cloverleaf airport 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.940
 macho madryn and later named him 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.980
 we catch it I think it's ready it runs 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.360
 much more than the covenant not if 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.580
 it's really worth it 's ahead I can 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.140
 see if the guy sticks with something 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.230
 I would love it and will stick to it or that 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.790
 a lion came and he was bitten by a wheel 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.980
 although it has given you the problem of equal 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.690
 that put it in a spontaneous dlc 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.470
 now here oh my god that I the 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.470
 I hit 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.780
 no longer 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.670
 it is very well written that it shows in the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.670
 atmosphere the truth 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.299
 It seems that the subscribers are a bit 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.430

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.360

 They were waiting to throw me 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.120
 down to below until it seems 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.099
 that is fine it seems that we are going to win 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.099
 it seems that it is very clear 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.410
 and this is where it can happen very well 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.500
 first, it is also effectively 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.690
 flying so look a lot because it's worth 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.269
 even though it's because how fast because 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.010
 that fucking car that is fast is that 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.280
 that we can not against the car with the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.280

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.900
