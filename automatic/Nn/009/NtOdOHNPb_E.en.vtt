you got on an average frame rate go for
the<00:02:18.390> 128<00:02:18.870> if<00:02:18.930> you've<00:02:19.019> got<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> high<00:02:19.260> frame<00:02:19.530> rate

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
the 128 if you've got a high frame rate

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.610 
the 128 if you've got a high frame rate
go<00:02:19.799> for<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.010> 256<00:02:20.400> 256<00:02:22.670> yeah<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.360> how<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.349> go

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
go for the 256 256 yeah the how you go

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.289 
go for the 256 256 yeah the how you go
up<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:26.129> more<00:02:26.280> demanding<00:02:26.459> on<00:02:26.819> your<00:02:26.849> graphics

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
up the more demanding on your graphics

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.940 
up the more demanding on your graphics
card<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.290> more<00:02:28.410> demanding<00:02:28.560> on<00:02:28.920> your

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
card and the more demanding on your

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.300 
card and the more demanding on your
processor<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:32.060> game<00:02:33.060> will<00:02:33.239> be<00:02:33.650> right<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:35.040> can

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
processor the game will be right I can

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.710 
processor the game will be right I can
handle<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:35.700> I'll<00:02:35.790> go<00:02:35.910> for<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.120> 256<00:02:36.540> 256<00:02:38.720> start

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
handle so I'll go for the 256 256 start

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.170 
handle so I'll go for the 256 256 start
the<00:02:39.810> download<00:02:40.260> save<00:02:40.859> it<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.100> desktop<00:02:41.180> I've

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
the download save it to the desktop I've

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.420 
the download save it to the desktop I've
already<00:02:42.389> downloaded<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.769> previously<00:02:44.100> because

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
already downloaded it previously because

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.180 
already downloaded it previously because
it<00:02:44.910> can<00:02:45.120> take<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.329> while<00:02:45.450> from<00:02:47.599> sometimes<00:02:49.190> right

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
it can take a while from sometimes right

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.819 
it can take a while from sometimes right
now<00:02:50.989> simplest<00:02:51.989> just<00:02:52.260> click<00:02:52.410> mugs<00:02:52.650> and

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
now simplest just click mugs and

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.690 
now simplest just click mugs and
textures<00:02:53.220> open<00:02:53.609> texture<00:02:53.880> pack<00:02:54.120> folder<00:02:55.700> drag

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
textures open texture pack folder drag

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.500 
textures open texture pack folder drag
it<00:02:56.880> in

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.319 

now<00:03:01.510> it's<00:03:01.689> in<00:03:01.810> there<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.980> then<00:03:03.909> you<00:03:04.120> just

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
now it's in there and then you just

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.380 
now it's in there and then you just
click<00:03:04.480> on<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:04.829> in<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:06.010> list<00:03:06.189> it<00:03:06.849> will<00:03:07.090> freeze

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
click on it in the list it will freeze

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.869 
click on it in the list it will freeze
for<00:03:07.599> a<00:03:07.629> bit<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:08.439> just<00:03:08.650> does<00:03:08.829> this<00:03:08.980> for<00:03:09.310> well

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
for a bit it just does this for well

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.220 
for a bit it just does this for well
it's<00:03:10.000> loading<00:03:10.269> all<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.450> textures<00:03:10.900> it's<00:03:11.079> got

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
it's loading all the textures it's got

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.080 
it's loading all the textures it's got
to<00:03:11.349> load<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.590> lot<00:03:11.920> more<00:03:12.069> information<00:03:12.670> with<00:03:12.939> the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
to load a lot more information with the

to load a lot more information with the
original<00:03:13.689> textures<00:03:14.349> are<00:03:14.680> only<00:03:14.890> 16<00:03:15.400> bits<00:03:15.700> there

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
original textures are only 16 bits there

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.410

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
bits these are 256 x 256 which is a hell

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.460 
bits these are 256 x 256 which is a hell
of<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.420> lot<00:03:22.569> more<00:03:22.599> you<00:03:22.900> think<00:03:22.959> about<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:25.470> give

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
of a lot more you think about it so give

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.440 
of a lot more you think about it so give
it<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.620> minute<00:03:26.769> eventually<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.430> will<00:03:27.549> there<00:03:28.359> we

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
it a minute eventually it will there we

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.750 
it a minute eventually it will there we
go<00:03:29.159> once<00:03:30.159> you've<00:03:30.310> done<00:03:30.400> your<00:03:30.459> click<00:03:30.700> done

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
go once you've done your click done

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.160 
go once you've done your click done
it'll<00:03:33.760> freeze<00:03:34.299> again<00:03:34.450> for<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.870> couple<00:03:35.109> of

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
it'll freeze again for a couple of

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.619 
it'll freeze again for a couple of
seconds<00:03:37.530> then<00:03:38.530> just<00:03:38.859> load<00:03:39.099> a<00:03:39.430> world<00:03:40.329> and

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
seconds then just load a world and

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.599 
seconds then just load a world and
you'll<00:03:41.620> see<00:03:41.889> a<00:03:42.150> lot<00:03:43.150> better<00:03:43.329> texture<00:03:44.609> textures

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
you'll see a lot better texture textures

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.369 
you'll see a lot better texture textures
now<00:03:46.030> as<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.209> can<00:03:46.299> see<00:03:46.359> my<00:03:46.629> frame<00:03:46.870> rates<00:03:47.109> haft

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
now as you can see my frame rates haft

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.759 
now as you can see my frame rates haft
and<00:03:47.829> now<00:03:48.670> I'm<00:03:48.760> only<00:03:49.950> 180<00:03:51.540> 300s<00:03:52.540> when<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:52.989> was<00:03:53.290> at

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
and now I'm only 180 300s when I was at

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.280 
and now I'm only 180 300s when I was at
least<00:03:54.040> double<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.400> if<00:03:54.849> not<00:03:55.239> more<00:03:55.450> now<00:03:56.230> you

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
least double that if not more now you

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.539 
least double that if not more now you
will<00:03:56.470> get<00:03:56.620> more<00:03:56.769> frame<00:03:57.010> rates<00:03:57.220> running<00:03:57.459> it

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
will get more frame rates running it

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.349 
will get more frame rates running it

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
which will show you how to fix that it's

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.629 
which will show you how to fix that it's
quite<00:04:25.270> common<00:04:25.630> when<00:04:25.810> because<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:27.520> original

quite common when because the original

quite common when because the original
