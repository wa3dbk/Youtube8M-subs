against a few packs that I've been using
for<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.879> while

for a while

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.650 
for a while
gonna<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> discharge<00:00:56.090> graph<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.449> I'm

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
gonna get a discharge graph on it I'm

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.170 
gonna get a discharge graph on it I'm
also<00:00:57.780> gonna<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.590> some<00:00:58.620> actual<00:00:59.280> testing<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
also gonna do some actual testing in the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.100 
also gonna do some actual testing in the
field<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.840> my<00:01:01.050> ultimate<00:01:01.280> SCR<00:01:02.690> Racing<00:01:03.690> short

course<00:01:04.379> rig<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.159> see<00:01:05.430> how<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.640> performs<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:07.970> hit

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
course rig and see how it performs I hit

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.420 
course rig and see how it performs I hit
the<00:01:09.090> track<00:01:09.330> first<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:10.080> put<00:01:10.290> throw<00:01:10.560> some<00:01:10.920> cycles

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the track first to put throw some cycles

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.380 
the track first to put throw some cycles
through<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> packs

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
through the packs

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
through the packs
and<00:01:12.720> also<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> subjective<00:01:13.920> feel<00:01:14.369> for

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and also to get a subjective feel for

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.240 
and also to get a subjective feel for
just<00:01:14.909> how<00:01:15.270> much<00:01:15.479> punch<00:01:15.840> they<00:01:16.080> had<00:01:16.320> generally

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
just how much punch they had generally

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070 
just how much punch they had generally
going<00:01:17.400> from<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.850> pack<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.330> another<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:18.869> there

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
going from one pack to another if there

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.649 
going from one pack to another if there
is<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> noticeable<00:01:20.070> difference<00:01:20.540> you<00:01:21.540> can

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
is a noticeable difference you can

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.350 
is a noticeable difference you can
actually<00:01:22.049> tell<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.950> by<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.939> feel<00:01:24.299> of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
actually tell just by the feel of

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.999 
actually tell just by the feel of
driving<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.110> around<00:01:25.229> how<00:01:25.590> much<00:01:25.740> acceleration

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
driving it around how much acceleration

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.330 
driving it around how much acceleration
you<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:27.049> particularly<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.439> highest<00:01:28.920> grip

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
you get particularly in the highest grip

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.300 
you get particularly in the highest grip
areas<00:01:29.729> when<00:01:30.119> you're<00:01:30.329> accelerating<00:01:30.900> hard<00:01:31.560> in

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
areas when you're accelerating hard in

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.390 
areas when you're accelerating hard in
this<00:01:32.430> case<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:33.450> pack<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.200> felt<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.860> good<00:01:35.070> as

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
this case this pack just felt as good as

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.789 
this case this pack just felt as good as
the<00:01:35.759> best<00:01:35.909> pack<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.990> already<00:01:37.590> are

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the best pack that I have already are

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.390 
the best pack that I have already are
the<00:01:37.920> best<00:01:38.100> pack<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.460> I've<00:01:38.610> used<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.689> past

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
the best pack that I've used in the past

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.770 
the best pack that I've used in the past
definitely<00:01:41.400> was<00:01:41.579> not<00:01:41.729> anything<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.630> out

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
definitely was not anything that was out

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.679 
definitely was not anything that was out
of<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.020> world<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:44.280> was<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:45.000> night<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.509> day

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
of this world it was not night and day

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.929 
of this world it was not night and day
difference<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.280> at<00:01:47.520> least<00:01:47.700> from<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
difference at all at least from the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.109 
difference at all at least from the
subjective<00:01:48.479> feel<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.979> was<00:01:50.220> performing

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
subjective feel but it was performing

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.719 
subjective feel but it was performing
about<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:51.689> well<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.170> could<00:01:52.229> possibly<00:01:52.829> ask<00:01:52.920> it

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
about as well as I could possibly ask it

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.139 
about as well as I could possibly ask it
was<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.270> fastest<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.619> felt<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.490> vehicle

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
was the fastest that I felt this vehicle

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.899 
was the fastest that I felt this vehicle
go<00:01:57.390> for<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> particular<00:01:58.200> setup<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.520> next<00:01:59.790> it

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
go for this particular setup so next it

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.420 
go for this particular setup so next it
was<00:02:00.000> time<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.270> verify<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.890> some<00:02:02.159> actual

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
was time to verify that with some actual

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.670 
was time to verify that with some actual
objective<00:02:03.060> results<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.229> went<00:02:04.409> to

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
objective results for that and went to

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.280 
objective results for that and went to
doing<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.640> discharge<00:02:05.939> graph<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.990> these<00:02:07.110> are

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
doing a discharge graph and these are

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.949 
doing a discharge graph and these are
the<00:02:07.350> results<00:02:07.740> from<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.369> used<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.330> 30<00:02:09.690> amp

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
the results from that I used a 30 amp

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.530 
the results from that I used a 30 amp
bulb<00:02:10.679> discharger<00:02:11.640> didn't<00:02:12.209> go<00:02:12.330> any<00:02:12.450> higher

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
bulb discharger didn't go any higher

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.340 
bulb discharger didn't go any higher
than<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
than that

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.050 
than that
because<00:02:13.620> 30<00:02:13.950> amps<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.430> pretty<00:02:14.730> much<00:02:14.880> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
because 30 amps is pretty much the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.210 
because 30 amps is pretty much the
standard<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.320> industry<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.860> standard

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
standard in the industry the standard

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.040 
standard in the industry the standard
that's<00:02:17.400> been<00:02:17.610> used<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.270> quite<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> long<00:02:18.990> time

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
that's been used for quite a long time

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.860 
that's been used for quite a long time
so<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:19.800> look<00:02:20.010> up<00:02:20.160> other<00:02:20.370> people's

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
so if you look up other people's

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.480 
so if you look up other people's
discharge<00:02:21.870> graphs<00:02:22.290> most<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.070> time<00:02:23.280> you'll

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
discharge graphs most of the time you'll

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.670 
discharge graphs most of the time you'll
see<00:02:23.760> them<00:02:23.940> at<00:02:24.210> 30<00:02:24.660> amps<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.380> just

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
see them at 30 amps and you can just

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.980 
see them at 30 amps and you can just
compare<00:02:26.130> these<00:02:26.280> as<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:27.060> can<00:02:27.180> see<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.570> Jen's<00:02:27.810> a

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
packs and as you can see I didn't do so

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.180

well<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.640> last<00:03:03.180> place<00:03:03.420> was<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.190> hobbyking

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
actually a soft sell softshell packed so

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.040 
actually a soft sell softshell packed so
the<00:03:10.830> Jen's<00:03:11.190> ace<00:03:11.370> was<00:03:11.580> definitely<00:03:12.150> up<00:03:12.750> there

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
the Jen's ace was definitely up there

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.590 
the Jen's ace was definitely up there
and<00:03:13.350> most<00:03:14.310> importantly<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.210> Jen's<00:03:15.420> ace

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
and most importantly the Jen's ace

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.310 
and most importantly the Jen's ace
actually<00:03:16.230> returned<00:03:16.860> more<00:03:17.600> capacity<00:03:18.600> than<00:03:18.990> its

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
actually returned more capacity than its

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.000 
actually returned more capacity than its
States

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.710 
States
I<00:03:20.160> actually<00:03:20.520> got<00:03:20.970> over<00:03:22.670> 4900<00:03:23.670> milliamp<00:03:24.300> hours

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.350 
I actually got over 4900 milliamp hours
during<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.650> discharge<00:03:25.890> not<00:03:26.460> bringing<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.210> down

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.470 
during a discharge not bringing it down
below<00:03:27.690> 6<00:03:28.230> volts<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.040> actual<00:03:29.490> capacity<00:03:29.700> of
