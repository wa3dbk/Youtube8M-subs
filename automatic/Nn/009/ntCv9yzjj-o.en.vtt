property<00:02:11.390> system<00:02:11.599> I<00:02:11.870> have<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.379> I<00:02:12.560> have<00:02:12.590> to

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
property system I have and I have to

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.460 
property system I have and I have to
choose<00:02:13.040> pictures<00:02:13.819> here<00:02:14.030> one<00:02:14.930> two<00:02:15.260> or<00:02:15.440> three

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
choose pictures here one two or three

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.110 
choose pictures here one two or three
crops<00:02:15.769> here<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.280> I'm<00:02:16.370> choosing<00:02:16.519> two<00:02:16.849> crops

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
crops here and I'm choosing two crops

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.550 
crops here and I'm choosing two crops
because<00:02:17.330> we're<00:02:17.660> growing<00:02:17.840> usually<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.319> dry

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
because we're growing usually a dry

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.089 
because we're growing usually a dry
season<00:02:18.799> crop<00:02:20.440> then<00:02:21.440> it's<00:02:21.590> asking<00:02:21.950> me<00:02:22.010> what

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
season crop then it's asking me what

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.699 
season crop then it's asking me what
season<00:02:22.519> it<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.910> it's<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> dry<00:02:23.870> season<00:02:23.900> crop<00:02:24.440> so

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
season it is it's the dry season crop so

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.500 
season it is it's the dry season crop so
I<00:02:24.739> have<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.010> picture<00:02:25.220> here<00:02:25.400> with<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.790> Sun<00:02:26.030> and

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
I have a picture here with the Sun and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.539 
I have a picture here with the Sun and
the<00:02:26.660> rice<00:02:26.810> plants<00:02:27.319> choosing<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.890> dry<00:02:28.069> seasons

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
the rice plants choosing the dry seasons

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.809 
the rice plants choosing the dry seasons
next<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:31.010> next<00:02:31.040> question<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.670> have<00:02:31.760> to

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
next and the next question I have to

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.059 
next and the next question I have to
answer<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.390> where<00:02:32.599> my<00:02:32.930> water<00:02:33.170> comes<00:02:33.500> from<00:02:33.769> is

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
answer is where my water comes from is

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.699 
answer is where my water comes from is
it<00:02:34.220> from<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.430> surface<00:02:35.269> irrigation<00:02:35.540> canal<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.560> it

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
it from a surface irrigation canal is it

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.100 
it from a surface irrigation canal is it
from<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:36.950> tube<00:02:37.340> or<00:02:37.910> do<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.690> no<00:02:38.840> irrigation

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
from a tube or do I have no irrigation

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.190 
from a tube or do I have no irrigation
so<00:02:40.099> here<00:02:40.340> in<00:02:40.519> Erie<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:41.060> are<00:02:41.150> using<00:02:41.329> tube<00:02:41.989> with

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
so here in Erie we are using tube with

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.500 
so here in Erie we are using tube with
water<00:02:42.440> that<00:02:42.739> comes<00:02:43.010> actually<00:02:43.250> quite<00:02:43.670> deep<00:02:43.910> out

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
water that comes actually quite deep out

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.289 
water that comes actually quite deep out
of<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.840> nurse<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.730> contains<00:02:46.730> quite<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.030> bit<00:02:47.209> of

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
of the nurse and contains quite a bit of

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.360 
of the nurse and contains quite a bit of
nutrients<00:02:47.690> particularly<00:02:48.049> fantastic<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.250> I'm

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
nutrients particularly fantastic so I'm

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.000 
nutrients particularly fantastic so I'm
choosing<00:02:49.519> tube<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.420> irrigation<00:02:51.049> but<00:02:51.799> there

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
choosing tube the irrigation but there

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.339 
choosing tube the irrigation but there
are<00:02:52.069> some<00:02:52.220> other<00:02:52.400> questions<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.019> have<00:02:54.200> to

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
are some other questions that I have to

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.069 
are some other questions that I have to
answer<00:02:54.500> here<00:02:54.920> soon<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.660> I'm<00:02:56.660> just<00:02:56.870> going

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
answer here soon and I'm just going

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.839 
answer here soon and I'm just going
through<00:02:57.230> this<00:02:57.920> it's<00:02:58.160> also<00:02:58.340> asking<00:02:58.730> you

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
through this it's also asking you

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.729 
through this it's also asking you
whether<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.150> apply<00:02:59.510> any<00:02:59.750> organic<00:03:00.200> fertilizer

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
whether I apply any organic fertilizer

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.490 
whether I apply any organic fertilizer
now<00:03:01.639> we<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:01.970> chosen<00:03:02.209> not<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.569> apply<00:03:02.959> organic

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
now we have chosen not to apply organic

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.809 
now we have chosen not to apply organic
fertilizer<00:03:03.950> because<00:03:04.340> we<00:03:04.489> have<00:03:04.609> a<00:03:04.639> very

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
fertilizer because we have a very

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.080 
fertilizer because we have a very
fertile<00:03:05.299> soil<00:03:05.569> it's<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.319> mass<00:03:06.530> place<00:03:07.040> all<00:03:07.310> it's

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
fertile soil it's a mass place all it's

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.910 
fertile soil it's a mass place all it's
rich<00:03:08.359> in<00:03:08.540> organic<00:03:08.690> matter<00:03:09.139> has<00:03:09.350> over<00:03:09.739> two

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
rich in organic matter has over two

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.670 
rich in organic matter has over two
percent<00:03:10.100> sole<00:03:10.730> organic<00:03:11.120> carbon<00:03:11.630> it's<00:03:12.440> rich

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
percent sole organic carbon it's rich

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.160 
percent sole organic carbon it's rich
many<00:03:13.069> other<00:03:13.280> things<00:03:13.549> we<00:03:14.090> don't

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
many other things we don't

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.860 
many other things we don't
by<00:03:15.710> applying<00:03:16.070> organic<00:03:16.940> fertilizer<00:03:17.420> we<00:03:17.660> could

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
by applying organic fertilizer we could

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.750 
by applying organic fertilizer we could
get<00:03:18.110> an<00:03:18.260> extra<00:03:18.410> benefit<00:03:19.040> in<00:03:19.190> terms<00:03:19.220> of<00:03:19.580> yield

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
get an extra benefit in terms of yield

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.690 
get an extra benefit in terms of yield
or<00:03:19.970> profit<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:21.230> when<00:03:21.410> I'm<00:03:21.530> done<00:03:21.740> it<00:03:22.250> will<00:03:22.430> spit

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
or profit and when I'm done it will spit

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.070 
or profit and when I'm done it will spit
out<00:03:22.820> hopefully

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
out hopefully

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.470 
out hopefully
I<00:03:25.110> feel<00:03:25.500> about<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.740> recommendation<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.790> can<00:03:27.300> also

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
I feel about a recommendation I can also

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.069 

welcome<00:03:46.659> back<00:03:46.840> it's<00:03:47.620> now<00:03:47.920> about<00:03:48.750> 12<00:03:49.750> days

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
welcome back it's now about 12 days

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.610 
welcome back it's now about 12 days
after<00:03:50.379> sowing<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:51.310> we're<00:03:52.150> about<00:03:52.420> ready<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.930> put

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
after sowing so we're about ready to put

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.830 
after sowing so we're about ready to put
the<00:03:53.799> first<00:03:53.980> fertilize<00:03:54.969> of<00:03:55.150> those<00:03:55.299> own<00:03:55.510> so<00:03:55.719> I've

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
the first fertilize of those own so I've

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.839 
the first fertilize of those own so I've
calculated<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.500> amount<00:03:56.680> already<00:03:57.400> a<00:03:57.430> few<00:03:57.640> days

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
calculated the amount already a few days

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.160 
calculated the amount already a few days
before<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:59.280> this<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.459> our<00:04:00.640> first<00:04:01.510> fertilizer

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
before and this is our first fertilizer

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.569 
before and this is our first fertilizer
so<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.920> 14<00:04:03.879> 14<00:04:04.269> 14<00:04:04.299> so<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.049> contains

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
so it's a 14 14 14 so it contains

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.220 
so it's a 14 14 14 so it contains
roughly<00:04:06.579> equal<00:04:07.150> proportions<00:04:07.689> of<00:04:07.780> nitrogen

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
roughly equal proportions of nitrogen

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.380 
roughly equal proportions of nitrogen
phosphorus<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:09.010> potassium<00:04:09.129> to<00:04:09.879> get<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.209> crop

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
phosphorus and potassium to get the crop

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.140 
phosphorus and potassium to get the crop
going<00:04:10.659> we<00:04:11.079> need<00:04:11.200> particularly<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:12.150> nitrogen

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
going we need particularly a nitrogen

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.390 
going we need particularly a nitrogen
and<00:04:13.329> phosphorus<00:04:13.930> early<00:04:14.769> at<00:04:14.889> this<00:04:15.099> stage

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
and phosphorus early at this stage

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.050 
and phosphorus early at this stage
because<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:16.810> stimulates<00:04:17.470> tillering

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
because that stimulates tillering

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.710 
because that stimulates tillering
so<00:04:19.060> i've<00:04:19.180> got<00:04:19.829> about<00:04:20.829> one<00:04:21.340> bag<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.449> another

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
so i've got about one bag and another

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.050 
so i've got about one bag and another
pocket<00:04:23.199> food<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.889> distribute<00:04:24.039> over<00:04:24.699> my

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
pocket food to distribute over my

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.860

failure

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
failure

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.520 
failure
so<00:04:26.560> each<00:04:26.889> bucket<00:04:27.220> is<00:04:27.520> roughly<00:04:27.910> twelve<00:04:28.750> kilos<00:04:29.080> I

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
so each bucket is roughly twelve kilos I

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.620 
so each bucket is roughly twelve kilos I
have<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.919> make<00:04:30.280> sure<00:04:30.460> that<00:04:30.669> it<00:04:30.820> lasts<00:04:31.240> for<00:04:31.449> one

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
have to make sure that it lasts for one

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.200 
have to make sure that it lasts for one
walk<00:04:32.050> through<00:04:32.349> the<00:04:32.440> field<00:04:32.710> a<00:04:33.310> hundred<00:04:33.910> metres

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
walk through the field a hundred metres

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.150 
walk through the field a hundred metres
tall<00:04:34.419> so<00:04:35.229> that's<00:04:35.440> going<00:04:35.620> to<00:04:35.680> be<00:04:35.800> my<00:04:35.949> big

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
tall so that's going to be my big

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.159 
tall so that's going to be my big
challenge<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.820> make<00:04:37.240> sure<00:04:37.419> that<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.720> evenly

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
challenge to make sure that I evenly

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.659 
challenge to make sure that I evenly
spread<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.470> don't<00:04:38.889> run<00:04:39.070> out<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:39.250> it<00:04:39.490> halfway

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
spread it don't run out of it halfway

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.260 
spread it don't run out of it halfway
through

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
through

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.110 
through
you<00:04:41.780> can<00:04:41.930> see<00:04:42.139> it's<00:04:42.319> at<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:43.120> granular

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
you can see it's at a granular

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.040 
you can see it's at a granular
fertilizer<00:04:45.520> so<00:04:46.520> it's<00:04:46.759> pretty<00:04:46.970> easy<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.630> handle

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
fertilizer so it's pretty easy to handle

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.779 
fertilizer so it's pretty easy to handle
it<00:04:49.039> doesn't<00:04:49.639> stink<00:04:49.940> so<00:04:50.270> I<00:04:50.300> should<00:04:50.569> be<00:04:50.599> able<00:04:50.750> to

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
it doesn't stink so I should be able to

00:04:51.789 --> 00:05:11.909 
it doesn't stink so I should be able to
destroy<00:04:52.789> it<00:04:52.819> spread<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.419> quite<00:04:53.720> well

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919
