00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.479 
out here I show you how to do it with
the<00:04:09.750> Frog<00:04:09.989> too<00:04:10.229> but<00:04:10.739> that'll<00:04:10.979> be<00:04:11.069> pretty<00:04:11.310> late

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
the Frog too but that'll be pretty late

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.689 
the Frog too but that'll be pretty late
or<00:04:11.609> show<00:04:11.840> let's<00:04:12.840> get<00:04:12.930> back<00:04:13.079> on<00:04:13.199> the<00:04:13.349> water<00:04:13.699> it

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
or show let's get back on the water it

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.399 
or show let's get back on the water it
on<00:04:15.030> these<00:04:15.389> it's<00:04:15.659> going<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.840> be<00:04:15.930> something<00:04:16.139> with

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
on these it's going to be something with

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:17.779 
on these it's going to be something with
the<00:04:16.500> speed<00:04:16.769> it's<00:04:17.039> going<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.280> be<00:04:17.400> able<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.669> get

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
the speed it's going to be able to get

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.189 
the speed it's going to be able to get
it<00:04:17.880> through<00:04:17.909> their<00:04:18.120> create<00:04:18.599> a<00:04:18.630> speed<00:04:18.900> right<00:04:19.109> in

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
it through their create a speed right in

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.839 
it through their create a speed right in
a<00:04:19.259> boil<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.739> they're<00:04:20.340> going<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.519> choke<00:04:20.820> it

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
a boil and they're going to choke it

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.469 
a boil and they're going to choke it
just<00:04:21.180> like<00:04:21.329> that<00:04:21.590> that's<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:23.370> thing<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:24.330> can

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
just like that that's the thing you can

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.300 
just like that that's the thing you can
actually<00:04:24.690> see<00:04:24.930> this<00:04:25.289> little<00:04:25.500> bait<00:04:25.830> fish<00:04:26.070> over

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
actually see this little bait fish over

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.649 
actually see this little bait fish over
here<00:04:26.490> in<00:04:26.550> front<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.849> you<00:04:26.940> kind<00:04:27.150> of<00:04:27.240> doing<00:04:27.449> a<00:04:27.509> V

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:27.659 
here in front of you kind of doing a V

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.950 
here in front of you kind of doing a V
wake<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.909> you<00:04:29.909> know<00:04:30.030> we<00:04:30.360> talked<00:04:30.570> about<00:04:30.810> doing

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
wake and you know we talked about doing

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.540 
wake and you know we talked about doing
a<00:04:31.199> an<00:04:32.090> 8<00:04:33.090> inch<00:04:33.620> super<00:04:34.620> super<00:04:34.950> slow<00:04:35.190> across<00:04:35.430> the

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
a an 8 inch super super slow across the

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.209 
a an 8 inch super super slow across the
surface<00:04:36.260> because<00:04:37.260> that's<00:04:37.469> the<00:04:37.680> environment

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
surface because that's the environment

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:39.310 
surface because that's the environment
you<00:04:38.310> build

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
you build

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.230 
you build
when<00:04:39.590> they're<00:04:39.740> boiling<00:04:39.950> like<00:04:40.280> that<00:04:40.550> your<00:04:40.970> best

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
when they're boiling like that your best

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.810 
when they're boiling like that your best
bet<00:04:41.330> is<00:04:41.660> put<00:04:41.990> on<00:04:42.140> the<00:04:42.950> horses<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.550> get<00:04:43.610> that

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
bet is put on the horses and get that

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.340 
bet is put on the horses and get that
thing<00:04:44.000> swimming<00:04:44.420> fast<00:04:45.040> and<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.990> usually

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
thing swimming fast and that usually

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.470 
thing swimming fast and that usually
will<00:04:48.740> trigger<00:04:48.980> these<00:04:49.190> fish<00:04:49.490> not<00:04:49.940> a<00:04:49.970> big<00:04:50.270> fish

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
will trigger these fish not a big fish

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.700 
will trigger these fish not a big fish
but<00:04:50.720> definitely<00:04:52.090> definitely<00:04:53.090> on<00:04:53.390> a<00:04:53.710> bite

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
but definitely definitely on a bite

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.990 
but definitely definitely on a bite
where<00:04:54.890> guys<00:04:55.100> right<00:04:55.340> now<00:04:55.370> and<00:04:55.640> no<00:04:55.820> one's

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
where guys right now and no one's

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.160 
where guys right now and no one's
catching<00:04:56.420> anything<00:04:57.850> that's<00:04:58.900> sometimes<00:04:59.900> the

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
catching anything that's sometimes the

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.330 
catching anything that's sometimes the
triggering<00:05:00.530> factors<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:01.250> speed<00:05:03.130> nice<00:05:04.130> whole

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
triggering factors the speed nice whole

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.270 
triggering factors the speed nice whole
thing<00:05:04.550> right<00:05:04.700> there<00:05:08.290> and<00:05:09.290> its<00:05:09.530> timing<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:10.100> you

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
thing right there and its timing to you

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.460 
thing right there and its timing to you
got<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.550> be<00:05:10.670> right<00:05:10.850> in<00:05:11.080> you<00:05:12.080> got<00:05:12.230> to<00:05:12.320> be<00:05:12.440> there

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
got to be right in you got to be there

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.560 
got to be right in you got to be there
when<00:05:12.740> it's<00:05:12.920> happening<00:05:13.310> right<00:05:13.520> in<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:13.910> boils

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.500 

but<00:05:17.570> as<00:05:17.690> you<00:05:17.870> saw<00:05:18.050> in<00:05:18.080> that<00:05:18.320> one<00:05:18.940> man<00:05:19.940> I<00:05:19.970> had<00:05:20.390> to

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
but as you saw in that one man I had to

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.450 
but as you saw in that one man I had to
throw<00:05:20.720> out<00:05:20.750> get<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:21.230> system<00:05:21.620> set<00:05:21.860> up<00:05:21.890> and<00:05:22.220> man

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
throw out get the system set up and man

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.340 
throw out get the system set up and man
just<00:05:22.730> start<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:23.420> horse<00:05:23.600> powers<00:05:23.930> get<00:05:24.170> that

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
just start the horse powers get that

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.250 
just start the horse powers get that
thing<00:05:24.560> ripping<00:05:25.310> across<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.760> surface<00:05:25.970> and<00:05:26.390> was
