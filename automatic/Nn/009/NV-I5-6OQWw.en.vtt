the good things about this hairstyle is
that<00:01:21.670> it<00:01:21.790> hides<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:23.310> number<00:01:24.310> of<00:01:24.490> hair<00:01:24.700> sins<00:01:25.060> so

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
that it hides a number of hair sins so

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
going poof II this can conceal that so

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.810 
going poof II this can conceal that so
it<00:01:36.490> is<00:01:37.470> basically<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:39.190> same<00:01:39.370> as<00:01:39.430> a<00:01:39.550> French

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.820 

the<00:03:41.760> reason<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.240> like<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.660> braid<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.230> much<00:03:43.440> is

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
the reason I like this braid so much is

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.830 
the reason I like this braid so much is
that<00:03:44.220> for<00:03:44.430> some<00:03:44.580> reason<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:45.060> find<00:03:45.300> it<00:03:45.480> easier

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
that for some reason I find it easier

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.770 
that for some reason I find it easier
than<00:03:46.020> French<00:03:46.320> braid<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.800> don't<00:03:47.070> know<00:03:47.190> why<00:03:47.720> but<00:03:48.720> I

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
than French braid I don't know why but I

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.900 
than French braid I don't know why but I
really<00:03:49.110> love<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.440> 3d<00:03:49.980> effect<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.730> this

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
really love the 3d effect that this

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.300 
really love the 3d effect that this
gives<00:03:51.590> because<00:03:52.590> we're<00:03:52.740> braiding<00:03:53.010> under

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
gives because we're braiding under

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.300 
gives because we're braiding under
instead<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.700> over<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.990> braid<00:03:55.200> sticks<00:03:55.620> out

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.010 

the<00:03:59.310> points<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:01.050> braid<00:04:01.290> also<00:04:02.540> go<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.900> the

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
the points of the braid also go in the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.800 
the points of the braid also go in the
opposite<00:04:04.320> direction<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.100> French<00:04:05.430> braid<00:04:08.810> for

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
opposite direction to a French braid for

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.300 
opposite direction to a French braid for
the<00:04:09.870> life<00:04:10.080> of<00:04:10.200> me<00:04:10.380> now<00:04:10.530> I'm<00:04:10.650> filming<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.040> can't

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
the life of me now I'm filming I can't

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.460 
the life of me now I'm filming I can't
remember<00:04:11.460> which<00:04:11.670> way<00:04:11.850> is<00:04:11.880> which<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.480> if<00:04:13.290> you

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
remember which way is which but if you

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.979 
remember which way is which but if you
look<00:04:13.680> at<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.860> braids<00:04:14.210> with<00:04:15.210> a<00:04:15.240> French<00:04:15.660> braid

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
look at the braids with a French braid

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.810 
look at the braids with a French braid
the<00:04:18.989> shape<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.590> braid<00:04:19.799> makes<00:04:20.100> will<00:04:20.400> go<00:04:20.549> one

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
the shape the braid makes will go one

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.550 
the shape the braid makes will go one
way<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.359> with<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.780> Dutch<00:04:21.959> braid<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.320> will<00:04:22.410> go

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
way and with a Dutch braid it will go

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:32.690 
way and with a Dutch braid it will go
the<00:04:22.710> other<00:04:22.860> way<00:04:27.140> adding<00:04:30.800> adding<00:04:31.800> this<00:04:32.370> is<00:04:32.550> my

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
the other way adding adding this is my

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.130 
the other way adding adding this is my
little<00:04:32.850> last<00:04:33.180> little<00:04:33.420> bit<00:04:33.540> of<00:04:33.600> hair<00:04:33.840> here

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
there we have it but that's raid grab my

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.700 
there we have it but that's raid grab my
mirror<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.540> make<00:05:59.720> sure<00:05:59.930> that<00:06:00.170> it<00:06:00.290> looks<00:06:00.470> the

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
mirror to make sure that it looks the

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:09.820 
mirror to make sure that it looks the
way<00:06:00.740> it's<00:06:00.950> supposed<00:06:01.160> to<00:06:08.170> and<00:06:09.170> even<00:06:09.530> if<00:06:09.680> I<00:06:09.770> do

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
way it's supposed to and even if I do

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.000 
way it's supposed to and even if I do
say<00:06:10.100> so<00:06:10.430> myself

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
say so myself

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.180 
say so myself
that<00:06:13.010> is<00:06:13.280> a<00:06:13.490> particularly<00:06:14.120> fine<00:06:14.690> example<00:06:15.620> of

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
that is a particularly fine example of

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.560 
that is a particularly fine example of
what<00:06:16.640> a<00:06:16.670> Dutch<00:06:17.630> braid<00:06:17.870> should<00:06:18.590> look<00:06:19.100> like<00:06:19.570> and

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
what a Dutch braid should look like and

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.990 
what a Dutch braid should look like and
it<00:06:20.690> didn't<00:06:21.590> even<00:06:21.770> go<00:06:22.010> slightly<00:06:22.310> walk<00:06:22.610> um<00:06:22.940> I

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
it didn't even go slightly walk um I

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.450 
it didn't even go slightly walk um I
started<00:06:23.240> really<00:06:23.630> over<00:06:23.810> my<00:06:23.990> shoulder<00:06:24.470> which

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
started really over my shoulder which

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.330 
started really over my shoulder which
frequently<00:06:26.030> happens<00:06:26.360> to<00:06:26.540> me<00:06:29.560> as<00:06:30.560> you<00:06:30.890> can<00:06:31.100> see

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
frequently happens to me as you can see

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.210 
frequently happens to me as you can see
I<00:06:31.580> mentioned<00:06:32.240> that<00:06:32.540> the<00:06:32.780> the<00:06:33.110> points<00:06:33.620> go<00:06:33.920> in

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
I mentioned that the the points go in

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.090 
I mentioned that the the points go in
the<00:06:34.340> opposite<00:06:34.700> direction<00:06:35.140> so<00:06:36.140> we<00:06:36.800> the<00:06:36.890> Dutch

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
the opposite direction so we the Dutch

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.150 
the opposite direction so we the Dutch
braid<00:06:37.340> they're<00:06:38.180> doing<00:06:38.480> that<00:06:39.410> and<00:06:39.980> with<00:06:40.130> a

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
braid they're doing that and with a

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.060 
braid they're doing that and with a
French<00:06:40.460> braid<00:06:40.790> they're<00:06:41.150> doing<00:06:41.590> that<00:06:42.590> I'll<00:06:42.890> see

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
French braid they're doing that I'll see

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.920 
French braid they're doing that I'll see
if<00:06:43.160> I<00:06:43.280> can<00:06:43.430> put<00:06:43.610> a<00:06:43.640> picture<00:06:43.880> side<00:06:44.270> by<00:06:44.300> side<00:06:44.750> so

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
if I can put a picture side by side so

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.080 
if I can put a picture side by side so
you<00:06:44.990> can<00:06:45.170> see<00:06:45.230> the<00:06:45.500> difference<00:06:45.890> it's<00:06:46.670> it's<00:06:47.000> a

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
you can see the difference it's it's a

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.020 
you can see the difference it's it's a
bit<00:06:47.240> of<00:06:47.330> a<00:06:47.390> quirky<00:06:47.810> thing<00:06:48.050> but<00:06:48.290> I<00:06:48.320> like<00:06:48.680> it<00:06:49.030> um

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
bit of a quirky thing but I like it um

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.350 
bit of a quirky thing but I like it um
so<00:06:50.990> I<00:06:51.380> guess<00:06:51.800> that's<00:06:52.070> all<00:06:52.190> for<00:06:52.250> me<00:06:52.520> for<00:06:52.730> now<00:06:52.940> I'm

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
so I guess that's all for me for now I'm

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.040 
so I guess that's all for me for now I'm
gonna<00:06:54.190> spritz<00:06:55.190> these<00:06:55.670> silly<00:06:56.060> flyaways<00:06:56.660> down

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
gonna spritz these silly flyaways down

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.020
