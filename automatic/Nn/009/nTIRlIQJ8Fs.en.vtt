 I came from another save exactly 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.930
 now we do not hear anything at me 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.580
 the game took off guys because of the fact that I 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.560
 downloaded from another save then i'm here 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.650

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.600
 there someone gets me 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.730
 guys, developers need to optimize 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.620
 it is here I do not understand how could so can 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.750
 take off because it is generally a clearing well yes 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.820
 ok but not optimize this this is it 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.170
 it's just pipets cult that color 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.940
 author to optimize it well what is he 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.600
 starts departure after a few there 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.820
 minutes or 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.320
 Well, I do not know who but through me 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.510
 a few minutes of ult that is how you 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.130
 see for yourself but that's why itâ€™s so simple 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.360
 especially spend time on it 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:29.600
 kill him or not kill him or beat him 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.790
 he how to listen and in my opinion and rises 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.100
 before dodavi yellows let's get it 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.660
 the volume is finally but so much I do not understand 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.390
 why he himself how much hp do because 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.450
 all the same people will get a minigun 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.640
 start doing it nifiga 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.460
 as we had taken away only down 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.770
 in fact it's really like sasuke here if 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.010
 so see how sasuke at all 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.430
 guys wait I think 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.170
 if I am mistaken then his eyes were they 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.370
 all right all right I already thought 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.830
 the author of the shepsy is not all right here 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.160
 correctly done so in my opinion this skin 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.120
 by the way for someone I replaced now 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.450
 I'll see quickly 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.600
 here is this skin guys all right 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.220
 there is a mafon made principle ok but 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.170
 Why do you have to have been yellow 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.120
 I can not understand the author probably 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.680
 he knows he probably read the myth about it 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.440
 that it must be black therefore 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.050
 I advise in the second part of it as not knowing 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.200
 so he flew so he how to say more 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.150
 black was his eyes cool 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.040
 done red things like that 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.960
 exactly like in the picture which 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.640
 there gamers invented or she 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.040
 fictional it was true on 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.470
 screenshots what was there for a long time 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.380
 This I don't know guys this already you can 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.919
 look there to read and find out as well 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.860
 everything 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.650
 this world is more accurate than the mod takes off very much 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.360
 guys I flew 1 3-4 times therefore 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.940
 records there are some even embarrassing and were 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.560
 if you noticed so well the wings are made 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.270
 You can fly to Malta and so on 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.729
