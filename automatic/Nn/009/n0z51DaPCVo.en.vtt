north of Scotland in the very north and
in<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.890> round<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.310> will<00:00:20.430> be<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> total<00:00:20.910> eclipse

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
in that round it will be a total eclipse

in that round it will be a total eclipse
of<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.720> Sun<00:00:23.090> eclipses<00:00:24.090> especially<00:00:24.869> solar

of the Sun eclipses especially solar

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.900 
of the Sun eclipses especially solar
eclipses<00:00:25.740> are<00:00:25.800> normally<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.960> little<00:00:27.960> bit<00:00:28.109> o<00:00:28.910> men

us<00:00:31.009> but<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.250> honest<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:33.660> doesn't

us but to be honest this one doesn't
concern<00:00:34.440> me<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:35.010> much<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:36.890> not<00:00:37.890> making

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
concern me that much it's not making

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.010 
concern me that much it's not making
aspects<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.940> any<00:00:39.120> other<00:00:39.300> planet<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
aspects to any other planet in the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.229 
aspects to any other planet in the
heavens<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.550> significance<00:00:41.550> from<00:00:42.059> an

earth-based geocentric perspective

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.630 
earth-based geocentric perspective
therefore<00:00:46.140> I'm<00:00:46.710> suggesting<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
therefore I'm suggesting that the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.790 
therefore I'm suggesting that the
eclipse<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.149> tomorrow<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.719> not<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
eclipse of tomorrow is not going to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.350 
eclipse of tomorrow is not going to
directly<00:00:50.719> bring<00:00:51.719> any<00:00:51.930> new<00:00:52.289> big<00:00:52.850> challenges<00:00:53.850> or

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
directly bring any new big challenges or

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.470 
directly bring any new big challenges or
problems<00:00:54.469> or<00:00:55.469> difficulties<00:00:56.180> into<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> lives

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
problems or difficulties into the lives

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.049 
problems or difficulties into the lives
of<00:00:57.719> individuals<00:00:59.480> however<00:01:00.680> it<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.640> set

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
of individuals however it is in the set

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.500 
of individuals however it is in the set
last<00:01:03.270> half<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> last<00:01:04.860> degree<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.210> last

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
last half of the last degree of the last

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.770 
last half of the last degree of the last
sign<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> zodiac<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.479> an

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
sign of the zodiac so there is an

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.800 
sign of the zodiac so there is an
element<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.409> closure<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.490> ending<00:01:12.210> about<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
element of closure and ending about it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.499 
element of closure and ending about it
and<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.409> solar<00:01:13.799> eclipse<00:01:14.180> that<00:01:15.180> means

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and it is a solar eclipse that means

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.760 
and it is a solar eclipse that means
that<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.380> light<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.979> Sun<00:01:17.960> will<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.200> cut

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that the light of the Sun will be cut

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.560 
that the light of the Sun will be cut
off<00:01:20.009> from<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:21.210> earth<00:01:22.939> always<00:01:23.939> nonsense<00:01:24.450> about

off from the earth always nonsense about

positive way and this future should kick

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.059 
positive way and this future should kick
in<00:04:28.030> from<00:04:29.030> perhaps<00:04:29.449> mid-april<00:04:30.110> onwards<00:04:30.860> as

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
the one that I'm much more concerned

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.100
