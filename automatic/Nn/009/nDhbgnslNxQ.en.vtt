00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
I'm going to slow it down and break down

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.720 
I'm going to slow it down and break down
what<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.289> detail<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.890> with<00:00:29.160> no<00:00:29.340> boxes

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
what I do in detail and with no boxes

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.540 
what I do in detail and with no boxes
left<00:00:29.910> as<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.630> what<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:30.960> your<00:00:31.140> question

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
left as that is what was your question

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.100 
left as that is what was your question
so<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:32.730> when<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.910> start<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.210> dungeon<00:00:33.600> you

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
so right when you start the dungeon you

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.600 
so right when you start the dungeon you
want<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> spin<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> circle<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.250> bomb<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
want to spin in a circle and bomb the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.520 
want to spin in a circle and bomb the
four<00:00:35.820> corners<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> bottom<00:00:36.690> floor<00:00:36.930> then

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
four corners of the bottom floor then

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.900 
four corners of the bottom floor then
use<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> jump<00:00:38.010> pad<00:00:38.190> sync<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
use the jump pad sync it up to the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.610 
use the jump pad sync it up to the
middle<00:00:39.090> platform<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.989> reason<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
middle platform the reason you do that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.650 
middle platform the reason you do that
is<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.670> energy<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:42.180> start<00:00:42.390> regenerating

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
is so your energy can start regenerating

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.740 
is so your energy can start regenerating
by<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.350> jumping<00:00:43.850> next<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.969> bomb<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.510> middle

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
by not jumping next I bomb the middle

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.600 
by not jumping next I bomb the middle
platform<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.469> spend<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:46.920> another<00:00:47.190> circle

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
platform and spend in another circle

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.160 
platform and spend in another circle
aiming<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.210> little<00:00:48.360> above<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> outside

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
aiming a little above the outside

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.410 
aiming a little above the outside
platforms<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.850> aim<00:00:51.000> straight<00:00:51.300> at

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
platforms because if you aim straight at

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.930 
platforms because if you aim straight at
them<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.410> will<00:00:52.559> only<00:00:52.800> hit<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.129> first<00:00:53.460> box<00:00:53.730> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
them you will only hit the first box and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.080 
them you will only hit the first box and
not<00:00:54.449> all<00:00:54.690> four<00:00:54.989> after<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.430> jump<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
not all four after that I jump to a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.840 
not all four after that I jump to a
corner<00:00:57.420> platform<00:00:57.899> bomb<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.070> then<00:00:59.520> jump

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
corner platform bomb that one then jump

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
corner platform bomb that one then jump
up<00:00:59.940> another<00:01:00.239> level<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.780> bomb<00:01:01.199> every<00:01:01.620> platform

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
up another level and bomb every platform

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.310 
up another level and bomb every platform
that's<00:01:02.280> left<00:01:02.609> if<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.390> see<00:01:03.600> where<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> place<00:01:04.080> my

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
that's left if you see where I place my

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.560 
that's left if you see where I place my
cursor<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:05.309> hit<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> platforms<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> back

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
cursor to hit the platforms in the back

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.750 
cursor to hit the platforms in the back
corners<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.799> exactly<00:01:08.280> where<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.580> need

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
corners that is exactly where you need

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330

to be aiming to destroy all the boxes on

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.760 
to be aiming to destroy all the boxes on
them<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.729> even<00:01:12.210> mess<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.530> redo

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
them I even mess up and have to redo

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.910 
them I even mess up and have to redo
them<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.880> next<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.390> jump<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.380> destroy<00:01:16.890> all

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
them but next I jump in and destroy all

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.249 
them but next I jump in and destroy all
the<00:01:17.310> boxes<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> main<00:01:18.240> room<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:19.080> will

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the boxes in the main room and this will

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.749 
the boxes in the main room and this will
differ<00:01:19.439> depending<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.979> which<00:01:20.220> room<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.610> get

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
differ depending on which room you get

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.149 
differ depending on which room you get
however<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> same<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:22.680> clear<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> rim

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
however it's the same just clear the rim

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
however it's the same just clear the rim
and<00:01:23.369> leave<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:24.390> jump<00:01:24.659> all<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.049> way

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and leave and then jump all the way

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.840 
and leave and then jump all the way
behind<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.619> room<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.490> will<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
behind the room and there will be the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.429 
behind the room and there will be the
last<00:01:27.030> platform<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.810> cannot<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.229> from

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
last platform that you cannot see from

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.190 
last platform that you cannot see from
the<00:01:28.560> other<00:01:28.710> side<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.060> see<00:01:30.299> even<00:01:30.810> with

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the other side so you can see even with

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.649 
the other side so you can see even with
my<00:01:31.380> mess<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:32.009> was<00:01:32.520> able<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.880> full<00:01:33.180> clear<00:01:33.420> all

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
my mess up I was able to full clear all
