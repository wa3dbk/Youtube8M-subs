00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.000
 some will remember that in a village of 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.220
 Pennsylvania a few years ago a 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.820
 fact that it still has the residents of 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.550
 that area terrified a strange ship 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.510
 fell and what happened next is quite a 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:23.890
 great mystery that we try to unveil 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.930
 the morning of December 4 , 1965, 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.939
 it was the same for the residents of Kate 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.470
 Pennsylvania tours when they saw 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.450
 rush to a racing car that made 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.500
 shake the earth when it hits in a 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.480
 wooded area 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.340
 one of the residents approached and 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.380
 they could see that it was a ship with 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.480
 cone shape that presented 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.300
 inscriptions throughout his 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.550
 edge structure and the object fell into the 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.350
 property of my uncle the one that always 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.080
 He said it was a UFO and that it did not take long 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.580
 on taking a few hours after the 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.140
 eyewitnesses witnessed the 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.269
 arrival of military trucks that 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.120
 cordoned off the area and took 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.190
 covertly the object a recent 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.080
 expedition to the place could determine that 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.540
 below the place of the fall is still 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.060
 find pieces of metal and elements 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.259
 that could be radioactive some 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.720
 residents think that the 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.610
 aliens have a base as 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.899
 the area is still hot due to the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.729
 constant sightings 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.320
 export is a divine place and it makes me 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.510
 understand why aliens 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.150
 they chose to come here 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.920
 The most interesting thing is that in recent 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.270
 declassification is of documents it 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.790
