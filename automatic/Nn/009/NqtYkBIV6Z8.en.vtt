 sanz sanchez sanz sanz 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.879
 sanz 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.470
 welcome friends of the power that have given you one more step and more in this 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.329
 occasion we have the minutes of the meeting 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.699
 in 1700 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.019
 here we have the box 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.150
 the denver team 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
 but first we want 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.400
 then here the equi 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.670
 it is covered 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.390
 a little box 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.670
 a little bag 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.860
 Sign up 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.860
 frustrated 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.120
 will understand that you do not plan to resign or the battery 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.770
 surely get more prakash 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.500
 if we open we find 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.430
 the connector 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.430
 electricity 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.210
 scioli 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.009
 great citations fined 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.009
 everything if we compare with other projects with him 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.910
 a case to keep the equipment still 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.440
 no doubt the protection 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.800
 more or less regular but for that we have other specialized voices 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.520
 individuals 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.100
 deceased ardoz 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.800
 there are external risk behaviors 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.150
 It would be very nice with the logo design 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.620
 of blackberry 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.190
 she was for the best 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.190
 more attention 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:12.249
 here we have the cable connector of headquarters to synchronize area 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.669
 Battery 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.669
 of course those facing the state 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.149
 equipped 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:25.639
 the software installation disk 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.499
 although they can also 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:29.179
 in the case of old age 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.179
 download us from the blackberry page 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.469
 put in the box without chair 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.299
 their 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.930
 can you see right now that we are making the team fire 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.930
 Coach 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.849
 how other equipment can 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.999
 the screen 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.999
 it does not hold 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:25.219
 this is an unlocked computer as you can see 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.579
 This is the background the team brings 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:39.239
 We can see that she does not have the loss of days some models 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:45.859
 - in English 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.179
 We wrote some of 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:52.179
 the accesses that this equipment has 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.569
 If I already have a meeting 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.569
 a few little programs 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.579
 I know you can see that you are connected to the fake website 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.009
 to the 13-year data network 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.149
 and if we wanted later to put a pluto headset 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.989
 well the tunnels 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.590
 let's take a look 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.590
 the keyboard you can 20 full clear 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.180
 115 heritage 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.449
 of others 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:30.930
 kubica 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.680
 according to the high mark of what is the steal 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.820
 here does not have a button dedicated to the part of the speakers here has it 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.259
 included 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.259
 inside he declared 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.490
 the keys feel comfortable even though this 23 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.559
 consists of a look at the sides of the equipment 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.529
 here you can see 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:58.499
 the volume key 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:01.499
 the one in the upper chamber 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.729
 insistently here 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.569
 you only see the indicators 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.589
 they tell us that he barely gets to see but 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.589
 here they have the unlocking 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.659
 nikki haley 8 500 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.789
 ticketera but then I say 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:27.029
 here we have the stereo plug the headphones 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:34.189
 this is a shortcut that can be configured 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.180
 and then not 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.789
 he has no other 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:41.629
 has more 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:45.139
 and here in the back they can see what it is 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.139
 the camera sensor 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.300
 and the engraving that says goal 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.589
 put the ovoid riverbed berrio 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:59.650
 the tent will be very beautiful of my life 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.650
 that is not heavy and looks very elegant 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.349
 with lead on top 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.270
 and how much of the mercy feels very light 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.969
 since fidel left 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:19.159
 in martinsville supposedly following parts should you are going to notice everything 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.999
 what he 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:21.229
 we 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:23.979
 let's talk about him 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.979
 with some curious aspects like having two browsers 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.490
 and some tricks to write accents like 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.390
 they fear and that just like in the other team just that 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.080
 This is my first duty 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.190
 busti who occupied I do not know some things but we already received 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.349
 commenting 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:50.349
 in the course of this challenge 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.570
 sanz 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.570
