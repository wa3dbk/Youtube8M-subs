00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.160 
just really love the packaging it's a
cooling<00:01:35.310> eye<00:01:35.579> gel<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.240> tried<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> little

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
cooling eye gel I tried it out a little

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.740 
cooling eye gel I tried it out a little
bit<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.590> felt<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:37.890> nice<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> thought

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
bit it felt really nice so I thought

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.810 
bit it felt really nice so I thought
this<00:01:39.900> was<00:01:40.110> really<00:01:40.170> nifty<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:41.310> shaped<00:01:41.670> like

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
this was really nifty it's shaped like

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.569 
this was really nifty it's shaped like
an<00:01:42.119> iron<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.259> idea<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.159> smooths

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
an iron so the idea is that it smooths

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.649 
an iron so the idea is that it smooths
out<00:01:45.000> lines<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.840> puffs<00:01:46.170> comes<00:01:46.860> out<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.250> a

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
out lines and puffs comes out like a

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.499 
out lines and puffs comes out like a
cream<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.860> even<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.700> my<00:01:50.880> hand<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.299> can

cream like that even on my hand I can

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.109 
cream like that even on my hand I can
feel<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.170> kind<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.710> minty<00:01:53.280> effect<00:01:53.670> feels

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
feel the kind of minty effect feels

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.359 
feel the kind of minty effect feels
really<00:01:54.360> nice<00:01:54.479> my<00:01:54.960> parents<00:01:55.530> are<00:01:55.710> still<00:01:56.070> on
