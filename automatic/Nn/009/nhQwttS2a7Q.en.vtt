00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
wide lug and I find that this has been

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.830 
wide lug and I find that this has been
very<00:00:51.989> handy<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.590> my<00:00:52.770> trail<00:00:53.070> rides<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.840> they

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
very handy on my trail rides as they

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.930 
very handy on my trail rides as they
really<00:00:55.140> clean<00:00:55.410> themself<00:00:55.829> well<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.399> mud<00:00:56.699> even

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940

sticky<00:00:57.449> clay<00:00:57.629> type<00:00:58.109> mud<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.879> they<00:00:59.879> also

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
sticky clay type mud and they also

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.619 
sticky clay type mud and they also
really<00:01:00.719> chew<00:01:01.020> really<00:01:01.410> well<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> snow<00:01:02.309> and

snow and they keep me going very well
and<00:01:13.189> in<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.369> mud<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:14.670> also<00:01:14.850> perform<00:01:15.330> way

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
and in the mud they also perform way

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.359 
and in the mud they also perform way
better<00:01:15.840> than<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.170> expected<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.159> been

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
better than I expected I have been

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.120 
better than I expected I have been
finding<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.790> I've<00:01:17.939> had<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:19.229> had<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> pretty

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
finding that I've had in had a pretty

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.649 
finding that I've had in had a pretty
easy<00:01:20.220> time<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.909> through<00:01:21.000> most<00:01:21.330> stuff<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
easy time going through most stuff the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.270 
easy time going through most stuff the
only<00:01:21.840> time<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> got<00:01:22.380> stuck<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.890> these<00:01:23.040> tires

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
only time I got stuck with these tires

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.010 
only time I got stuck with these tires
is<00:01:23.549> when<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> put<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> basically<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.659> its<00:01:24.840> side

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
is when I put it basically on its side

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.469 
is when I put it basically on its side
and<00:01:25.259> two<00:01:25.380> wheels<00:01:25.560> were<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> air<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.520> it's

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and two wheels were in the air and it's

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.410 
and two wheels were in the air and it's
a<00:01:27.540> muskeg<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.460> other<00:01:29.460> than<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.909> these<00:01:30.119> tires

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
a muskeg but other than that these tires

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.679 
a muskeg but other than that these tires
are<00:01:30.720> awesome<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.820> would<00:01:32.820> highly<00:01:33.180> recommend

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
are awesome I would highly recommend

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.789 
are awesome I would highly recommend
them<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.570> only<00:01:36.780> downside<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> guess<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.770> some

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
them the only downside I guess for some

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.230 
them the only downside I guess for some
of<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.040> bigger<00:01:38.189> bigger<00:01:38.520> machines<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.180> think

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
of the bigger bigger machines is I think

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.319 
of the bigger bigger machines is I think
27<00:01:39.869> inches<00:01:40.200> 27<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:41.070> 28<00:01:41.430> inches<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.030> biggest

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
27 inches 27 or 28 inches the biggest

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.719 
27 inches 27 or 28 inches the biggest
they<00:01:42.509> go<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:44.009> you're<00:01:44.130> looking<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.579> for

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
they go so if you're looking like for

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.609 
they go so if you're looking like for
those<00:01:44.850> 29<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> half's<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.960> outlaws<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
those 29 and a half's like outlaws and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.710 
those 29 and a half's like outlaws and
stuff<00:01:46.829> well<00:01:47.040> they're<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:48.240> are<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.540> that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
stuff well they're not they are not that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.710 
stuff well they're not they are not that
big<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.590> will<00:01:50.369> say<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> lug<00:01:51.149> spacing

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
big but I will say that the lug spacing

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.300 
big but I will say that the lug spacing
on<00:01:51.869> these<00:01:52.049> tires<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.710> tremendous<00:01:53.579> like<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:55.310> know

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
on these tires is tremendous like I know

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.950 
on these tires is tremendous like I know
my<00:01:56.579> hands<00:01:56.909> aren't<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> biggest<00:01:57.360> hands<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.899> the
