00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.370
 there are no blockbusters on the shelves 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.470
 stores appear games about 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.620
 the existence of which many and not 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.870
 suspect for example the third part of the secret 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.670
 British company deep silver 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.080
 this is by the way a good alternative 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.810
 diablo 3 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.480
 choose hero 1 of 5 classes like 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.179
 seraphim warriors or hunter 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.699
 pirates and then stamp paint 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.890
 the scenery of the monster crash and fill 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.640
 screen blasts of magic and other 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.930
 special effects developers have provided 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.300
 cooperative mode on four players 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.340
 if your comrades are offline 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.190
 characters will be controlled by a computer 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.010
 hardly a secret 3 will achieve the same 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.470
 popularity as the very first part 10 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.930
 years ago but it will easily stick to 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.510
 screens of fantasy action movies 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.020
 it's better for the street anyway 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.020
 roasting 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.960
 mid-august king's bounty series 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.850
 will go to the dark side thematic 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.670
 addition for the first time will allow players 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.430
 choose the race of the hero and these times 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.040
 atypical for fantasy epic on 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.710
 choices are presented by org demoness and 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.229
 bumper grim guys clash with 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.900
 knight elves and other carriers 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.510
 good at the time to celebrate not the day airborne 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.790
 and halloween plot tasks promised 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.180
 about a hundred developers will add to the game 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.330
 new squads and artifacts in general will 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.280
 to study -1 but weighty king's 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.890
 bounty still exists on the engine 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.650
 seven years ago from a technical point 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:50.410
 of view she is stuck far in the past and 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:51.250
 the company does not seem to be selected 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.590
 deep silver 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.259
 sold out in a couple of weeks 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.440
 after secret 3 she will release the third part 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.000
 another role-playing series risen 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.460

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.330
 Of course they are your teeth to the players 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.340
 allowed to join different factions that 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.220
 guarantees the support of allies and 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.890
 hatred of enemies the main character craves 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.049
 return his soul stolen from him for this 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.600
 goals he will have to perform plot 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:25.570
 a side task of learning magic and 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.630
 in large part fencing battles in previous 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.860
 parts of the reason were not that 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.160
 fascinating but the developers assure 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.420
 that completely altered the combat system 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.420
 let's see what progress they have 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.569
