general<00:00:43.480> theory<00:00:43.840> now<00:00:43.989> that<00:00:44.350> cacao<00:00:44.680> is

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
general theory now that cacao is

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.620 
general theory now that cacao is
originally<00:00:45.190> from<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.489> Cordoba<00:00:45.850> River<00:00:46.300> Basin

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
originally from the Cordoba River Basin

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.260 
originally from the Cordoba River Basin
of<00:00:46.720> Benjamin<00:00:47.079> anyway<00:00:47.500> this<00:00:47.950> plant<00:00:48.340> cacao<00:00:49.000> was

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
of Benjamin anyway this plant cacao was

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.770 
of Benjamin anyway this plant cacao was
put<00:00:49.570> into<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:50.020> natural<00:00:50.559> jungle<00:00:51.010> environment

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
put into a natural jungle environment

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.080 
put into a natural jungle environment
attracts<00:00:52.780> all<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.559> different<00:00:53.920> birds<00:00:54.250> that

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
attracts all the different birds that

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.590 
attracts all the different birds that
attracts<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:55.989> huge<00:00:56.770> amount<00:00:57.700> of<00:00:57.940> animals<00:00:58.450> and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
attracts a huge amount of animals and

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.910 
attracts a huge amount of animals and
different<00:00:58.870> species<00:00:59.020> into<00:00:59.530> that<00:00:59.649> environment

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
different species into that environment

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.979 
different species into that environment
so<00:01:00.790> much<00:01:01.000> so<00:01:01.270> that<00:01:01.300> there's<00:01:01.660> something<00:01:01.870> like

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
so much so that there's something like

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.590 
so much so that there's something like
88<00:01:02.649> new<00:01:02.920> species<00:01:03.430> of<00:01:03.579> birds<00:01:03.820> will<00:01:04.030> show<00:01:04.269> up<00:01:04.479> in

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
88 new species of birds will show up in

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.940 
88 new species of birds will show up in
an<00:01:04.719> environment<00:01:04.989> where<00:01:05.350> cacao<00:01:05.649> has<00:01:05.829> been

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.080 
of l-dopa nutrition students have
probably<00:05:16.470> looked<00:05:16.710> at<00:05:16.800> this<00:05:16.979> l-dopa<00:05:17.520> what's<00:05:17.940> up

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
probably looked at this l-dopa what's up

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.029 
probably looked at this l-dopa what's up
look<00:05:18.300> one<00:05:18.599> of<00:05:18.690> them<00:05:18.840> does<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:19.680> mean<00:05:19.710> I'm<00:05:19.889> gonna

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
look one of them does I mean I'm gonna

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.810 
look one of them does I mean I'm gonna
turn<00:05:20.190> into<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.460> dope<00:05:22.070> actually<00:05:23.070> it<00:05:23.190> fixes<00:05:23.669> you

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
turn into a dope actually it fixes you

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.080 
turn into a dope actually it fixes you
if<00:05:23.940> you've<00:05:24.120> been<00:05:24.150> on<00:05:24.360> dope<00:05:25.669> because<00:05:26.669> why<00:05:26.910> they

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
if you've been on dope because why they

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.480 
if you've been on dope because why they
call<00:05:27.270> it<00:05:27.300> dope<00:05:29.360> don't<00:05:30.360> mean<00:05:31.280> that's<00:05:32.280> something

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
call it dope don't mean that's something

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.750 
call it dope don't mean that's something
to<00:05:32.639> do<00:05:32.699> a<00:05:32.729> dope<00:05:33.000> man<00:05:33.270> up<00:05:35.990> that's<00:05:36.990> dopamine<00:05:37.760> so

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
to do a dope man up that's dopamine so

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.070 
to do a dope man up that's dopamine so
when<00:05:38.880> people<00:05:39.030> are<00:05:39.210> on<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.419> ganja<00:05:39.780> what<00:05:39.990> is

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
when people are on the ganja what is

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.010 
when people are on the ganja what is
actually<00:05:40.440> kicking<00:05:40.740> into<00:05:41.070> their<00:05:41.220> system

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
actually kicking into their system

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.420 
actually kicking into their system
dopamine<00:05:43.020> and<00:05:43.349> what<00:05:43.560> can<00:05:43.710> happen<00:05:43.919> is<00:05:44.250> it<00:05:44.400> can

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
dopamine and what can happen is it can

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.750 
dopamine and what can happen is it can
SAP<00:05:44.789> out<00:05:45.030> their<00:05:45.270> dopamine<00:05:46.400> so<00:05:47.400> these<00:05:47.520> are<00:05:47.669> the

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
SAP out their dopamine so these are the

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.310 
SAP out their dopamine so these are the
stimulants<00:05:48.300> all<00:05:48.419> time<00:05:48.599> they<00:05:48.690> send<00:05:48.900> this<00:05:49.139> down

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
stimulants all time they send this down

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.750 
stimulants all time they send this down
the<00:05:49.500> other<00:05:49.680> thing<00:05:49.860> what's<00:05:50.159> going<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:50.400> SAP<00:05:50.580> out

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
the other thing what's going to SAP out

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.570 
the other thing what's going to SAP out
their<00:05:51.060> dopamine<00:05:51.360> is<00:05:51.810> going<00:05:51.960> to<00:05:52.050> go<00:05:52.740> out<00:05:52.919> we've

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
their dopamine is going to go out we've

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.370 
their dopamine is going to go out we've
heard<00:05:53.820> a<00:05:53.880> lot<00:05:54.090> about<00:05:54.150> serotonin<00:05:54.780> and

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
heard a lot about serotonin and

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.710 
heard a lot about serotonin and
depression<00:05:56.039> and<00:05:56.250> depleting<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:57.090> serotonin

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
depression and depleting the serotonin

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.879 
depression and depleting the serotonin
pathway<00:05:58.490> tryptophan<00:05:59.490> and<00:05:59.820> all<00:05:59.940> the<00:06:00.120> big

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
pathway tryptophan and all the big

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.270 
pathway tryptophan and all the big
through<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:01.430> serotonin<00:06:02.120> DMT<00:06:02.780> movie<00:06:03.500> 15<00:06:03.889> and

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
through the serotonin DMT movie 15 and

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.619 
through the serotonin DMT movie 15 and
end<00:06:04.460> dancey<00:06:04.939> all<00:06:05.090> that<00:06:05.240> stuff<00:06:05.449> in<00:06:05.599> that

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:05.629 
end dancey all that stuff in that

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.240 
end dancey all that stuff in that
pathway<00:06:05.900> but<00:06:06.439> we<00:06:06.560> haven't<00:06:06.740> really<00:06:07.099> heard

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
pathway but we haven't really heard

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.129 
pathway but we haven't really heard
about<00:06:07.340> the<00:06:07.610> dopamine<00:06:08.030> pathway<00:06:08.509> and<00:06:08.930> one<00:06:09.080> of

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
about the dopamine pathway and one of

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:10.749 
about the dopamine pathway and one of
the<00:06:09.199> reasons<00:06:09.530> is<00:06:09.650> because<00:06:09.680> l-dopa<00:06:10.370> but<00:06:10.610> so

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
the reasons is because l-dopa but so

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.070 
the reasons is because l-dopa but so

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
opinion and it looks like a clam with a

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:49.899 
opinion and it looks like a clam with a
lip<00:06:48.469> on<00:06:48.680> it<00:06:48.919> you<00:06:49.129> know<00:06:49.250> which<00:06:49.370> one<00:06:49.550> that<00:06:49.580> is

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:49.909 
lip on it you know which one that is

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.330 
lip on it you know which one that is
it's<00:06:50.449> a<00:06:50.569> big<00:06:50.810> scene<00:06:51.139> anyway<00:06:51.770> it<00:06:51.830> usually<00:06:52.159> looks

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
it's a big scene anyway it usually looks

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.950 
it's a big scene anyway it usually looks
like<00:06:52.610> being<00:06:53.389> one<00:06:53.539> of<00:06:53.569> those<00:06:53.689> types<00:06:53.900> of

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
like being one of those types of

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.240 
like being one of those types of
necklaces<00:06:54.349> things<00:06:54.560> but<00:06:54.740> when<00:06:54.860> you<00:06:54.949> mix<00:06:55.129> it

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
necklaces things but when you mix it

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.649 
necklaces things but when you mix it
with<00:06:55.310> chocolate<00:06:55.669> what's<00:06:56.060> happening<00:06:56.539> is

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:56.659 
with chocolate what's happening is

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:58.540 
with chocolate what's happening is
you're<00:06:56.810> getting<00:06:57.050> that<00:06:57.110> dopamine<00:06:57.620> filled<00:06:58.189> in

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
you're getting that dopamine filled in

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.059 
you're getting that dopamine filled in
so<00:06:59.210> that<00:06:59.419> you<00:06:59.509> get<00:06:59.719> the<00:06:59.930> like<00:07:00.169> really<00:07:00.710> like<00:07:00.889> oh

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:01.069 
so that you get the like really like oh

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:07.360 
so that you get the like really like oh
yeah<00:07:01.370> this<00:07:01.580> is<00:07:01.819> going<00:07:05.620> this<00:07:06.620> is<00:07:06.680> good

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
yeah this is going this is good

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.589 
yeah this is going this is good
we<00:07:07.759> want<00:07:07.969> to<00:07:08.029> know<00:07:08.240> things<00:07:09.229> are<00:07:09.440> good<00:07:10.360> life<00:07:11.360> is
