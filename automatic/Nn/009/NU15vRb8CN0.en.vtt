a<00:00:49.170> small<00:00:49.680> fashion<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.760> guess<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.210> think<00:00:51.600> this

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
a small fashion I guess I think this

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.090 
a small fashion I guess I think this
design<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.230> lot<00:00:52.440> better<00:00:52.649> though<00:00:52.890> it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
design is a lot better though it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.819 
design is a lot better though it
definitely<00:00:54.000> looks<00:00:54.239> cool<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:54.780> what's<00:00:55.590> even

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
definitely looks cool but what's even

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.880 
definitely looks cool but what's even
more<00:00:55.980> interesting<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:57.030> me<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.750> Goku<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
more interesting to me is that Goku is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.420 
more interesting to me is that Goku is
going<00:00:59.609> super<00:01:00.000> saiyan<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.350> teaser<00:01:01.649> rather

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
going super saiyan in this teaser rather

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.329 
going super saiyan in this teaser rather
than<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.449> Super<00:01:03.870> Saiyan<00:01:03.899> God<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:05.189> was

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
than a Super Saiyan God it was

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.609 
than a Super Saiyan God it was
previously<00:01:05.729> thought<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.689> Super<00:01:07.110> Saiyan<00:01:07.350> God

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
previously thought that Super Saiyan God

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.920 
previously thought that Super Saiyan God
would<00:01:07.890> replace<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.670> need<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.450> Super<00:01:09.720> Saiyan

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
would replace the need for Super Saiyan

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.960 
would replace the need for Super Saiyan
all<00:01:10.140> together<00:01:10.320> yet<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.100> see<00:01:11.280> Goku<00:01:11.700> very

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
all together yet we see Goku very

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.120 
all together yet we see Goku very
clearly<00:01:12.510> transforming<00:01:13.409> into<00:01:13.500> one<00:01:13.770> right<00:01:14.010> in

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
clearly transforming into one right in

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.740 
clearly transforming into one right in
the<00:01:14.159> beginning<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> trailer<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.270> what

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the beginning of the trailer so what

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.690 
the beginning of the trailer so what
does<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:15.990> mean<00:01:16.290> maybe<00:01:17.189> there'll<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.460> another

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
does this mean maybe there'll be another

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300 
does this mean maybe there'll be another
video<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.360> later<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.770> now<00:01:20.070> it

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
video on that later on but for now it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
video on that later on but for now it
definitely<00:01:20.460> raises<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.119> very<00:01:21.299> valid<00:01:22.020> question

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
definitely raises a very valid question

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.550 
definitely raises a very valid question
I<00:01:22.590> think<00:01:22.860> also<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> teaser<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> look

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
I think also in the teaser we get a look

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.520 
I think also in the teaser we get a look
at<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:26.009> 10<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.520> trunks<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.420> new<00:01:27.600> outfit<00:01:28.080> but

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
at go 10 and trunks and a new outfit but

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.130 
at go 10 and trunks and a new outfit but
also<00:01:28.740> still<00:01:29.579> kids<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.210> lot<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.720> people<00:01:30.990> were

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
also still kids a lot of people were

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.109 
also still kids a lot of people were
very<00:01:31.170> very<00:01:31.650> upset<00:01:31.770> by<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.340> expecting<00:01:33.000> them

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
very very upset by this expecting them

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.899 
very very upset by this expecting them
to<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.240> teenagers<00:01:33.869> especially<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:35.009> at

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
to be teenagers especially because at

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.240 
to be teenagers especially because at
the<00:01:36.090> end<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.570> Dragon<00:01:37.110> Ball<00:01:37.290> Z<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:38.189> were

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the end of Dragon Ball Z they were

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.390 
the end of Dragon Ball Z they were
teenagers<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:40.380> does<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.590> mean<00:01:40.650> well

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
teenagers so what does this mean well

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.580 
teenagers so what does this mean well
this<00:01:41.610> could<00:01:41.790> mean<00:01:41.909> two<00:01:42.270> things<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.869> dragon

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
this could mean two things that dragon

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.100 
this could mean two things that dragon
ball<00:01:43.740> super<00:01:43.770> either<00:01:44.520> takes<00:01:45.030> place<00:01:45.420> directly

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
ball super either takes place directly

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.380 
ball super either takes place directly
after<00:01:46.829> battle<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.640> God<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.060> maybe<00:01:48.180> even

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
after battle of God and maybe even

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.850 
after battle of God and maybe even
fukatsu<00:01:48.960> no<00:01:48.990> f<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.340> takes<00:01:50.970> place<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.479> lot

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
fukatsu no f or it takes place a lot

the trailer we see Vegeta screaming and

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.500 
the trailer we see Vegeta screaming and

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
seemingly transforming into something

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.670 
seemingly transforming into something
unfortunately<00:04:42.510> we<00:04:42.600> do<00:04:42.750> not<00:04:42.780> get<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.260> see<00:04:43.410> once

but that's it for the trailer or the

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.320 
but that's it for the trailer or the
teaser<00:04:46.530> all<00:04:47.190> in<00:04:47.430> all<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.730> think<00:04:47.790> it<00:04:48.090> looks<00:04:48.120> very

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
teaser all in all I think it looks very

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.030 
teaser all in all I think it looks very
very<00:04:48.600> amazing<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.260> art<00:04:49.470> style<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:49.980> the

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
very amazing the art style and the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.240 
very amazing the art style and the
animation<00:04:50.610> is<00:04:50.760> just<00:04:51.140> superb<00:04:52.140> anime<00:04:52.710> quality

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
animation is just superb anime quality

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.730 
animation is just superb anime quality
and<00:04:53.430> as<00:04:53.730> it<00:04:53.940> should<00:04:54.180> be<00:04:54.390> considering<00:04:54.990> how<00:04:55.200> huge

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
and as it should be considering how huge

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.580 
and as it should be considering how huge
of<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.950> franchise<00:04:56.430> Dragonball<00:04:57.360> is<00:04:57.570> I<00:04:58.320> think

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
of a franchise Dragonball is I think

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.390 
of a franchise Dragonball is I think
they<00:04:58.800> showed<00:04:58.950> all<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.220> right<00:04:59.370> things

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
they showed all the right things

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.670 
they showed all the right things
essentially<00:05:00.000> we<00:05:00.480> get<00:05:00.660> a<00:05:00.690> dose<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.200> little

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
essentially we get a dose of a little

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.350 
essentially we get a dose of a little
bit<00:05:01.830> of<00:05:01.980> everybody<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:03.000> would<00:05:03.150> have<00:05:03.240> been<00:05:03.300> very

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
bit of everybody it would have been very

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.600 
bit of everybody it would have been very
very<00:05:04.020> difficult<00:05:04.170> to<00:05:05.160> get<00:05:05.280> a<00:05:05.310> much<00:05:05.580> better

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
very difficult to get a much better

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.030 
very difficult to get a much better
