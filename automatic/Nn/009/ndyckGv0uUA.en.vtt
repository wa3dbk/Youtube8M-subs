00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
dug up a little stat with the iowa coach

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.300 
dug up a little stat with the iowa coach
since<00:02:44.209> he's<00:02:44.420> been<00:02:44.659> there<00:02:44.930> any<00:02:45.170> time<00:02:46.010> they've

since he's been there any time they've

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.399 
since he's been there any time they've
had<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.519> game<00:02:46.879> where<00:02:47.269> they've<00:02:47.420> had<00:02:47.569> no<00:02:47.810> forced

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
had a game where they've had no forced

had a game where they've had no forced
turnovers<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.189> week<00:02:49.340> before<00:02:49.579> in<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.599> next

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
turnovers the week before in the next

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.039 
turnovers the week before in the next
game<00:02:51.260> they're<00:02:52.010> 11<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.790> 2<00:02:53.180> against<00:02:53.659> the<00:02:53.780> spread

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
game they're 11 and 2 against the spread

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.050 
game they're 11 and 2 against the spread
since<00:02:54.379> he's<00:02:54.560> been<00:02:54.769> there<00:02:55.010> it's<00:02:55.549> a<00:02:55.639> quirky

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
since he's been there it's a quirky

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.839 
since he's been there it's a quirky
little<00:02:56.209> step<00:02:56.629> but<00:02:56.930> if<00:02:57.169> you<00:02:57.919> dig<00:02:58.129> deeper<00:02:58.579> into<00:02:58.609> a

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
little step but if you dig deeper into a

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.979 
little step but if you dig deeper into a
stat<00:02:59.180> like<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.720> to<00:03:00.260> me<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:01.459> means<00:03:01.700> he<00:03:02.659> fires

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
stat like that to me that means he fires

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.679 
stat like that to me that means he fires
up<00:03:03.169> his<00:03:03.349> defense<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:04.280> team<00:03:05.000> wasn't<00:03:05.299> they

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
up his defense this team wasn't they

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.240 
up his defense this team wasn't they
weren't<00:03:05.930> swarming<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.739> ball<00:03:06.950> they

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.720 
weren't hitting hard and you know that
that<00:03:09.379> means<00:03:09.650> they're<00:03:10.129> gonna<00:03:10.220> have<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.459> hard

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
that means they're gonna have a hard

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.399 
that means they're gonna have a hard
practice<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.540> week<00:03:11.720> that's<00:03:11.900> what<00:03:12.079> I<00:03:12.109> take
