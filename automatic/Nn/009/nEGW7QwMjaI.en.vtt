00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.400 
rest assured you know what I'm saying
but<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.060> think<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.359> ultimately<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.989> helps<00:03:26.260> us

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
but I think that ultimately it helps us

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.530 
but I think that ultimately it helps us
because<00:03:26.829> it<00:03:27.430> kind<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:27.790> changed<00:03:28.180> people's
