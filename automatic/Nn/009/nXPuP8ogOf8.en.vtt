00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello everyone today we are again in review 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.940
 micron art universe who has not seen on 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.490
 its review, or just do not know what kind of 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.889
 the universe can see another 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.100
 video from this universe with one 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.350
 typesetter from the same series but today 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.560
 us from omicron corr pain and technique of this 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.039
 fractions 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.890
 more precisely there are only two factions here 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.230
 here are all sets of sets from 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.070
 light side and dark side well on 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.450
 in fact it is matter and antimatter 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.940
 this is exactly the same army 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.660
 differing only in color well there own 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.200
 the universe its history everything is as usual but 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.460
 here is a beautiful art network like this technique 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.610
 behaves in battle 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.329
 well, and here it is the technique we can 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.280
 fine to see its size and even 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.010
 some insides 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:05.210
 Also in the set there is another carbon fiber 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:08.909
 and the capsule here we still have the technique and 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:14.240
 a huge pyramid on which is right all 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.270
 factions depict all the races well back 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.549
 all functionality is represented that is 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.580
 technicians assembled eat appliances 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.680
 spitting out capsule 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.350
 capsules then 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.900
 the form of pilots well and disassembled 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.120
 I spit out the same capsule 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:37.820
 and then warlord whether hold warlord 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.979
 carbon of or carbanion saw difficult 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.080
 say how to correctly because there is 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.210
 cartoon for this universe but cartoon i 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.380
 found only in french 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.940
 actually as originally 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.760
 the manufacturer of this toy is in 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.560
 france well then let's look at 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.520
 this check the functionality of this 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.369
 beauty of a lamb 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.930
 and I can tell you exactly how it is 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.130
 actually because appearance 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.130
 pretty cool 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.970
 inside there is a booklet still surprisingly he 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.250
 in Russian however in the previous video on 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.450
 this universe, I seem to be exactly the same 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.330
 found booklets 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.330
 okay and inside we have this 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.090
 a colossus like some kind of cosmic 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.900
 monster with hands tail by the way here these 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.660
 here are the tail fins and rubber that 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.790
 very pleased with their difficult to break more precisely 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.510
 they cannot be broken they are rubber and 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.110
 which is very useful because if it were 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.530
 items were plastic then through a couple 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.970
 hours either not left at all otherwise 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.820
 everything is made of such a gray 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.490
 plastic us with such 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.330
 kind of like eyes and details 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.660
 but they are also present on the paws 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:03.720
 there is a huge mouth if that 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.260
 click on the language then the whole model 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.739
 decomposed and acquires already combat 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.840
 view this is no storage for the troops 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.050
 this is the storage for the rocket launcher 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.450
 here are such rocket launchers of course they are not 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.840
 know how to shoot but 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.840
 laid out effectively four feet on 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.120
 which this beast stands on each of 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.590
 they have wheels that if 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:36.300
 put is not visible but ride model 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:39.930
 can also in the set have a capsule easily 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.090
 opening by the way and such 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.540
 crook prostrate 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.849
 similar to a small godzilla in a helmet with 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.300
 pistols 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:55.959
 this is such a white alien who 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.879
 famous for their carboxylic skin which 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.930
 difficult to break through and in general these guys 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.349
 hard to destroy 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.500
 but anticorrosive bonsu and they are completely 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:09.910
 same evil as it all functions 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:16.979
 we take the capsule we insert there our 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:20.530
 pilot and this model is folded 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:26.620
 fold all the legs and in such 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:31.180
 position she flies in search of a pilot we 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.910
 we throw capsules in the mouth and here he is a pilot 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:38.639
 inside and ready to lead this deadly 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.570
 sing a car that's so simple 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.690
 plain toy 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.000
 in general, I have long wanted this sponge 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.110
 see but it cost too much 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.700
 and I bought it in the cottage dacha for 500 rubles 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.710
 I really wanted to see such a thing 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.820
 principle what to say toy pretty 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.490
 not bad 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.230
 not yet the least quality hunting but also done 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.130
 in China 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:09.250
 what's written here 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:12.400
 Hong Kong pretty good very 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:16.920
 pleased with this tail of course without flaws 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.920
 It cost but they are almost not felt 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.500
 general design interesting such 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.300
 cybernetic beast is always 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.710
 interesting mix of universes mixture of ideas 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.470
 well, pretty good mechanism 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.320
 although I thought that this capsule 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.500
 will shoot but basically on the boxes 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.669
 shows that you can shoot 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:44.100
 just close the lid quite abruptly and 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:48.780
 he spits out this thing and continues his 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:51.300
 flight in search and the enemy pilot 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:55.229
 less the universe shows that she 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:59.900
 noteworthy and unusual ideas not 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:03.840
 ordinary fighters and their unusual technique 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.130
 This is the one I liked the technique 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.990
 but I just love such 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:14.010
 beetle like cars but there is of course and 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:17.280
 the pyramids and here are such a walk and ki 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:20.910
 different other machines so the series then 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.919
 Micron is quite interesting in principle. 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.110
 and of course it would be desirable to find out in what 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.729
 that all the same thing here because we have 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.440
 on familiarization with the universe of all 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:33.070
 three paragraphs that's all you can 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.770
 from this concept and then micron it 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:38.830
 turns out to be some kind of combat universe 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.960
 rather, a series of toys fighting in it as 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.620
 you can even play there 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.230
 regulations 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.620
 but apparently the creators are us 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:50.800
 offer to invent them yourself but in 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:55.270
 anyway the thing is spectacular or at least 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:58.320
 attention attracts me especially 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.320
 like these rockets 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.360
 I hope you enjoyed this video and you 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.389
 stay on my channel because 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.979
 we still have a lot of interesting ahead 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:11.979
 good luck and bye
