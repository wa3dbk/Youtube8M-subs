00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.813
 Every year in Brunswick, we hold an eye exam. 

00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:08.132
 We are 100% supportive for improving children's vision and health. 

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.900
 We are very grateful to the Lions, 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.092
 Because of general inspection 

00:00:16.092 --> 00:00:17.600
 Unable to detect possible problems. 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.934
 - Facing the camera. 

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.867
 Within 30 seconds of taking a photo, 

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:24.533
 We can determine if the child wants to be tested further. 

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.700
 - Hey, Brianna is coming in. 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.000
 Can we take pictures of you? 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.934
 So the inspection of the Lions in the morning, 

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:31.800
 I almost forgot to sign the approval form. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.200
 Brianna is one of the children we checked. 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.000
 Last year's inspection had abnormal results. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.100
 Lions will inform us, 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.266
 Brianna needs 

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.166
 Checked by a professional ophthalmologist. 

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.944
 We didn't think too much. and so 

00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:48.270
 We booked an appointment three weeks later. 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.834
 - Bri, how many fingers do I have? 

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:53.066
 Two weeks after eye examination, 

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:56.266
 We noticed that her vision was blurred. 

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.300
 - Can't you see anything? 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.200
 We will go to the doctor as soon as possible. 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.967
 Her retina was completely separated at the time. 

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:07.100
 That afternoon, we contacted 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.066
 Go to the retina specialist and see a doctor. 

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:13.400
 But more tests are needed, and finally we are in an emergency. 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.767
 In the next 72 hours, we did a magnetic resonance angiography, as well as a computed tomography scan. 

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:20.667
 A tumor or Coates disease was found. 

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.934
 At the time we were faced with the need to do a biopsy of the eyes. 

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:26.600
 The problem is that if cancer can spread quickly. 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.367
 So extraction is our only choice. 

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:31.567
 This is a shocking moment. 

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:34.767
 Know the fatal dangers our daughter will face. 

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:36.877
 I mean to save her life, 

00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:40.500
 But it also contains a huge danger. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 So we are standing in her room, 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.166
 Just holding each other and crying. 

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.860
 The mood is so high. 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.266
 Being a parent is a difficult and tricky decision. 

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:53.200
 And understand that if it is not cancer, 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.607
 You may make the wrong decision. 

00:01:54.607 --> 00:01:56.880
 We decided to do it now, 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.127
 Because time does not wait for people. 

00:01:58.127 --> 00:01:59.266
 love you! 

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:02.033
 Her surgery was the first of the next morning. 

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:11.393
 But she only cares about those 

00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:13.734
 A friend who graduated with her kindergarten. 

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:17.934
 She smiled and walked into the school. 

00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:21.033
 After a whole day, it seems that nothing happened. 

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:24.533
 Brianna is a one-of-a-kind child. 

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.166
 She is adaptable. She is very special. 

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:29.767
 One week after the operation, the LEITTENS family 

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:33.600
 I realized that they made the right decision. It is cancer. 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.433
 Fortunately, it didn't spread. 

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:36.633
 I am shocked. 

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:38.470
 Childhood cataract 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.700
 The rate of occurrence is very low. 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.433
 But cancerous tumors are unusual things. 

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:45.667
 It really opens us 

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:48.247
 Confirm the true benefits of this activity. 

00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:49.967
 They saved the life of our daughter. 

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:53.166
 If it wasn't for the Lions, she might not exist today. 

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:55.467
 Brenfair Lion also helps 

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.333
 Pay the false eye of BRIANNA. 

00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:59.100
 Not covered by insurance. 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.386
 They are polished and put into the eyes, 

00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:04.467
 When we went out, she started dancing... 

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:07.900
 - My eyes are still there. My eyes are still there. 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.066
 She is very happy. 

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:11.834
 We are very happy that life can be restored. 

00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:15.567
 LEITTENS family decided 

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:17.433
 Giving back to Lions is their mission. 

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:19.333
 Through fundraising like this, 

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:22.433
 They helped the Brunffel branch to buy this special camera. 

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:24.867
 You don't have to borrow it later. 

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:26.487
 Increase the number of cameras and 

00:03:26.487 --> 00:03:29.266
 Number of Lions users 

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:31.900
 Means we can check more children, 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.000
 And hope to prevent more children's vision problems. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.467
 After Brianna, we have increased by 400% 

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:41.200
 Visual inspection of children. 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.066
 Due to her experience, 

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:46.500
 More parents and children are already involved. 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.066
 happy Birthday 

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:50.600
 Every moment of life, 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.333
 You should be treated as the last moment. 

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:54.066
 Your life can change the pace. 

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:55.767
 And our one year ago. 

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:57.867
 This definitely makes us stronger. 

00:03:57.867 --> 00:03:59.633
 Brianna has touched a lot of people. 

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:02.467
 I hope she will save more people. 

00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:05.600
 Every day I look at her, I want to cry. 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.934
 But every day I want to look at her with a smile. 

00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:10.433
 Because she brings us a lot of happiness. 

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:12.667
 I expect her life to be happy. 

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:14.096
 This is what I really want. 

00:04:14.096 --> 00:04:15.600
 This is what I expect from her. 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.333
 Thank you Lion.
