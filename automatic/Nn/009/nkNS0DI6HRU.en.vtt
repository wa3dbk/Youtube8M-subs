on<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.299> vehicle<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.130> particularly<00:01:17.130> what

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
on this vehicle and particularly what

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.840 
on this vehicle and particularly what
we're<00:01:17.580> gonna<00:01:17.670> work<00:01:17.880> look<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.689> airbag<00:01:19.500> in

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
we're gonna work look for is airbag in

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.760 
we're gonna work look for is airbag in
order<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.060> code<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
order to code it and as you see it's a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.830 
order to code it and as you see it's a
pretty<00:01:23.189> quick<00:01:23.400> process<00:01:23.630> now<00:01:24.630> pretty

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
pretty quick process now pretty

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.359 
pretty quick process now pretty
straightforward<00:01:25.500> forward<00:01:25.979> what<00:01:26.220> we're

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
straightforward forward what we're

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.179 
straightforward forward what we're
looking<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.740> that's<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.979> love<00:01:29.159> about

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
looking for and that's what I love about

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.069 
looking for and that's what I love about
Auto<00:01:29.640> logic<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.180> it's<00:01:30.479> easy

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
Auto logic is that it's easy

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.450 
Auto logic is that it's easy
it<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.439> does<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> factory<00:01:32.220> scan

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it really does what the factory scan

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880 
it really does what the factory scan
tool<00:01:32.640> does<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.570> know<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.229> affordable

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
tool does you know it's it's affordable

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.179 
tool does you know it's it's affordable
you<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.579> being<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.750> could<00:01:36.979> finance<00:01:37.979> it

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
you know being that you could finance it

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.520 
you know being that you could finance it
and<00:01:38.220> everything<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.939> really<00:01:39.840> good<00:01:40.170> technical

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
and everything and really good technical

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.749 
and everything and really good technical
support<00:01:40.979> which<00:01:41.070> you're<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.280> gonna<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.610> for

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
support which you're not gonna get for

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.840 
support which you're not gonna get for
the<00:01:41.820> factory<00:01:42.210> tool<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:44.040> some<00:01:44.700> other

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the factory tool and and some other

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.969 
the factory tool and and some other
things<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.500> evolve<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.829> like

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
things you can evolve it to like

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.620 
things you can evolve it to like
performance<00:01:47.490> flashing<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.180> things<00:01:48.390> like

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
performance flashing and things like

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.780 
performance flashing and things like
that<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.680> know<00:01:49.799> we're<00:01:49.979> watching<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.399> load<00:01:50.610> up

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that you know we're watching it load up

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.200 
that you know we're watching it load up
right<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:52.399> for<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.460> coding<00:01:53.820> procedure

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
right now and for a coding procedure

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.910 
right now and for a coding procedure
just<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:55.020> knowledge<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.470> do<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:55.740> need

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
just for your knowledge you do not need

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.530 
just for your knowledge you do not need
a<00:01:55.979> battery<00:01:56.340> maintainer<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.210> not<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
a battery maintainer it's not like a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.620 
a battery maintainer it's not like a
reflash<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.040> key<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.630> engine

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
reflash you can do it just key on engine

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.399 
reflash you can do it just key on engine
off<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:02.329> but<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.479> can't<00:02:03.719> screw<00:02:03.990> anything<00:02:04.170> up

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
off and but you can't screw anything up

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.380 
off and but you can't screw anything up
when<00:02:04.710> you're<00:02:04.860> doing<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.430> that's<00:02:05.790> that's

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
when you're doing it so that's that's

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.020 
when you're doing it so that's that's
the<00:02:06.630> fun<00:02:06.869> part<00:02:06.899> for<00:02:07.469> technicians<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:08.970> a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
the fun part for technicians and it's a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.219 
the fun part for technicians and it's a
good<00:02:09.179> thing<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> all<00:02:09.599> logic<00:02:09.989> as<00:02:10.080> well

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
good thing but the all logic as well

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.470 
good thing but the all logic as well
it's<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.560> very<00:02:10.590> straightforward<00:02:11.039> tool<00:02:11.670> you

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
it's a very straightforward tool you

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.880 
it's a very straightforward tool you
know

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
know

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.590 
know
you<00:02:13.370> have<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.640> cellphone<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.390> can<00:02:14.510> only

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
you have a cellphone and you can only

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.330 
you have a cellphone and you can only
use<00:02:14.690> 10%<00:02:14.930> yourself<00:02:15.470> own<00:02:15.650> well<00:02:15.800> maybe<00:02:15.980> should

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
use 10% yourself own well maybe should

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.190 
use 10% yourself own well maybe should
buy<00:02:16.460> cheaper<00:02:16.880> cellphone<00:02:17.300> he<00:02:17.720> says<00:02:17.959> all<00:02:18.080> that

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
buy cheaper cellphone he says all that

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.750 
buy cheaper cellphone he says all that
functionality<00:02:18.410> likes<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.550> lot<00:02:19.670> of

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
functionality likes a lot of

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.390 
functionality likes a lot of
functionality<00:02:20.260> but<00:02:21.260> it's<00:02:21.590> very<00:02:21.770> easy<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.100> use

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
functionality but it's very easy to use

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.030 
functionality but it's very easy to use
and<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:23.240> makes<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.600> really<00:02:23.959> really<00:02:24.560> good<00:02:24.830> and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
and that makes it really really good and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.610 
and that makes it really really good and
that's<00:02:25.100> why<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.340> love<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.760> auto<00:02:25.910> logic<00:02:26.330> now<00:02:27.290> I

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
that's why I love the auto logic now I

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.530 
that's why I love the auto logic now I
just<00:02:28.100> want<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.280> show<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.459> how<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:28.940> fixed<00:02:29.450> it

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
just want to show you how I fixed it

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.060 
just want to show you how I fixed it
right<00:02:29.720> after<00:02:30.110> tournament<00:02:30.410> determines<00:02:30.950> these

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
show you in the real world how quick the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.140 
show you in the real world how quick the
auto<00:02:41.930> logic<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.739> how<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.520> really<00:02:43.760> fix

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
auto logic is and how you really fix

auto logic is and how you really fix
these<00:02:44.360> we<00:02:44.600> were<00:02:44.690> real<00:02:44.989> worlds<00:02:45.410> problems<00:02:45.890> on<00:02:46.130> a

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
these we were real worlds problems on a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.100 
these we were real worlds problems on a
vehicle<00:02:46.690> all<00:02:47.690> right<00:02:47.989> so<00:02:49.540> let's<00:02:50.540> wait<00:02:50.780> for<00:02:50.989> it

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
vehicle all right so let's wait for it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.860 
vehicle all right so let's wait for it
cuz<00:02:51.260> I'm<00:02:51.350> running<00:02:51.590> out<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:51.680> things<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.100> say<00:02:52.870> now

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
cuz I'm running out of things to say now

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.900 
cuz I'm running out of things to say now
we're<00:02:54.709> all<00:02:55.190> these<00:02:55.370> different<00:02:55.640> things<00:02:55.670> you

we're all these different things you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.340 
we're all these different things you
could<00:02:56.060> do<00:02:56.239> we're<00:02:56.840> just<00:02:56.989> gonna<00:02:57.110> go<00:02:57.290> to

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
could do we're just gonna go to

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.170 
could do we're just gonna go to
programming<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.100> coding<00:02:58.340> because<00:02:58.670> we're

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
programming and coding because we're

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.910 
programming and coding because we're
gonna<00:02:59.300> code<00:02:59.660> and<00:03:00.260> we're<00:03:00.350> gonna<00:03:00.440> go<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.590> control

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
gonna code and we're gonna go to control
