00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
tricky because normally we'll have at

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.160 
tricky because normally we'll have at
least<00:00:36.630> like<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> hands<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:38.300> space<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.629> between

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
least like a hands with space in between

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.670 
least like a hands with space in between
and<00:00:40.559> down<00:00:40.680> there<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> mean<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.500> can

and down there so but I mean as you can

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.279 
and down there so but I mean as you can
see<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> hole<00:00:44.160> down<00:00:44.370> there<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:46.170> in

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
see the hole down there and in

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.590 
see the hole down there and in
comparison<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:46.860> my<00:00:47.100> hand<00:00:49.760> it<00:00:50.760> doesn't<00:00:51.180> even

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
comparison with my hand it doesn't even

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.340 
comparison with my hand it doesn't even
fit<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.960> way<00:00:52.140> I'm<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.949> there<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.370> mean<00:00:54.350> not

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
fit that way I'm right there I mean not

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.450 
fit that way I'm right there I mean not
a<00:00:55.379> good<00:00:55.559> situation<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.610> uh<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:58.070> it's<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.160> very

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
a good situation but uh this it's a very

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.770 
a good situation but uh this it's a very
very<00:00:59.789> simple<00:01:00.570> job<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> most<00:01:01.469> part<00:01:02.780> this

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
very simple job for the most part this

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.740 
very simple job for the most part this
actually<00:01:04.290> has<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> different<00:01:04.890> setup<00:01:05.100> then

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
actually has a different setup then

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.039 
actually has a different setup then
there<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:07.020> then<00:01:07.500> um<00:01:08.510> most<00:01:09.510> master

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
there you are then um most master

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.539 
there you are then um most master
cylinders<00:01:10.880> on<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.090> setups<00:01:12.420> easy<00:01:13.460> simple<00:01:14.460> I

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
cylinders on the setups easy simple I

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.740 
cylinders on the setups easy simple I
mean<00:01:16.220> basically<00:01:17.220> what<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> got<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750

reservoir off of the line take a little

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.609 
reservoir off of the line take a little
actual<00:01:23.130> line<00:01:23.369> off<00:01:23.689> from<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.960> old<00:01:25.229> master

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
actual line off from the old master

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
actual line off from the old master
cylinder<00:01:26.009> which<00:01:26.729> all<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> had<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.180> this

socata pin that a holds this is broken
for<00:02:35.690> one<00:02:35.870> I'll<00:02:36.680> show<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:36.890> why<00:02:37.160> it's<00:02:37.370> broken

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
for one I'll show you why it's broken

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.289 
for one I'll show you why it's broken
but<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:39.400> let's<00:02:40.400> do<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.700> from<00:02:40.850> here<00:02:41.000> there's<00:02:41.239> a

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
but a let's do it from here there's a

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.270 
but a let's do it from here there's a
pin<00:02:42.459> that<00:02:43.459> goes<00:02:43.489> through<00:02:43.940> this<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:45.069> this<00:02:46.069> is

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
pin that goes through this and this is

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.059 
pin that goes through this and this is
actually<00:02:46.670> connected<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.150> your<00:02:47.360> pedal<00:02:48.069> this

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
actually connected to your pedal this

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.759 
actually connected to your pedal this
part<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.849> parts<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.360> uh<00:02:50.390> inside<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.410> master

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
part that parts in uh inside the master

00:02:51.769 --> 00:03:00.400 
part that parts in uh inside the master
cylinder<00:02:53.230> like<00:02:55.420> like<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:58.989> sorry<00:02:59.989> I'm<00:03:00.200> paying

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
cylinder like like so sorry I'm paying

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.170 
cylinder like like so sorry I'm paying
more<00:03:00.560> attention<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.190> what<00:03:01.819> I'm<00:03:01.940> holding

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
more attention to a what I'm holding

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.360 
more attention to a what I'm holding
instead<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.840> camera<00:03:03.130> anyways<00:03:04.130> there's<00:03:04.310> a

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
instead of the camera anyways there's a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.610 
instead of the camera anyways there's a
pin<00:03:04.519> that<00:03:04.670> goes<00:03:04.700> through<00:03:05.150> from<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.230> actual

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
pin that goes through from the actual

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.050 
pin that goes through from the actual
pin<00:03:06.830> part<00:03:07.010> goes<00:03:07.190> through<00:03:07.400> through<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.910> then

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
pin part goes through through and then

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.310 
pin part goes through through and then
there's<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.299> hole<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.690> pin<00:03:08.900> where<00:03:09.200> the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
there's a hole in the pin where the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.539 
there's a hole in the pin where the
cotter<00:03:09.530> pin<00:03:09.739> goes<00:03:09.920> in<00:03:10.070> to<00:03:10.160> keep<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.400> pin

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
cotter pin goes in to keep the pin

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.120 
cotter pin goes in to keep the pin
attached<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.180> pedal<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.980> have<00:03:12.980> your

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
attached to the pedal you have your

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.970 
attached to the pedal you have your
adjustments<00:03:13.730> right<00:03:13.880> here<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:15.019> actually<00:03:15.859> you

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
adjustments right here and actually you

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.300 
adjustments right here and actually you
can<00:03:17.320> you<00:03:18.320> if<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:18.709> don't<00:03:18.890> like<00:03:19.010> where<00:03:19.190> your

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
can you if you don't like where your

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.770 
can you if you don't like where your
clutch<00:03:19.489> engages<00:03:19.850> all<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.239> have<00:03:20.359> to<00:03:20.450> do<00:03:20.600> is

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
clutch engages all you have to do is

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.599 
clutch engages all you have to do is
take<00:03:21.620> that<00:03:21.650> pin<00:03:21.950> out<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.160> adjust<00:03:22.700> this<00:03:22.970> and

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
take that pin out and adjust this and

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.599 
take that pin out and adjust this and
then<00:03:25.609> you'll<00:03:25.760> have<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:26.030> like<00:03:26.959> where<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.859> clutch

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
then you'll have a like where the clutch

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.840 
then you'll have a like where the clutch
pedal<00:03:28.790> engages<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:30.410> don't<00:03:30.890> know<00:03:31.040> as<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> fact<00:03:31.549> if

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
pedal engages I don't know as a fact if

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.809 
pedal engages I don't know as a fact if
I'm<00:03:32.060> right<00:03:32.380> but<00:03:33.380> going<00:03:33.889> towards<00:03:34.220> away<00:03:34.459> I<00:03:34.489> saw

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
I'm right but going towards away I saw

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.590 
I'm right but going towards away I saw
another<00:03:35.060> video<00:03:35.389> on<00:03:35.510> YouTube<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:38.150> further<00:03:38.389> it

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
another video on YouTube the further it

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.000 
another video on YouTube the further it
is<00:03:38.630> down<00:03:39.019> towards<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.560> bottom<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.889> the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
is down towards the bottom of the

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.580 
is down towards the bottom of the
threads<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:42.190> later<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.639> clutch<00:03:43.880> engages<00:03:44.590> and

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
threads the later the clutch engages and

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.690 
threads the later the clutch engages and
then<00:03:47.139> further<00:03:48.139> up<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:48.859> if<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.040> added<00:03:49.280> up<00:03:49.340> here

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
then further up so if you added up here

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.250 
then further up so if you added up here
and<00:03:49.880> tighten<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:50.239> down<00:03:50.299> then<00:03:50.720> that's<00:03:50.959> where

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
and tighten it down then that's where

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.690 
and tighten it down then that's where
I'm<00:03:53.109> going<00:03:54.109> to<00:03:54.200> say<00:03:54.350> that's<00:03:55.280> when<00:03:55.489> it<00:03:55.609> would

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
I'm going to say that's when it would

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.740 
I'm going to say that's when it would
engage<00:03:55.970> sooner<00:03:56.420> so

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
engage sooner so

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.590 
engage sooner so
that's<00:03:59.750> my<00:03:59.960> reservoir<00:04:00.740> that<00:04:01.040> just<00:04:01.250> leaked<00:04:01.970> by

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
that's my reservoir that just leaked by

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.510 
that's my reservoir that just leaked by
the<00:04:02.660> way<00:04:02.810> brake<00:04:03.550> and<00:04:04.780> brake<00:04:05.780> fluid<00:04:06.340> eats<00:04:07.340> away

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
the way brake and brake fluid eats away

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.360 
the way brake and brake fluid eats away
at<00:04:07.640> paint<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:08.620> if<00:04:09.620> you<00:04:09.770> catch<00:04:09.950> it

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
at paint so if you catch it

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.980 
at paint so if you catch it
pick<00:04:10.970> it<00:04:11.000> up<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.300> rag<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.570> won't<00:04:11.690> hurt<00:04:11.810> it

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
pick it up the rag you won't hurt it

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.420 
pick it up the rag you won't hurt it
immediately<00:04:12.320> but<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:12.740> mean<00:04:12.890> if<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.130> leave<00:04:13.310> it

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
immediately but I mean if you leave it

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.030 
immediately but I mean if you leave it
on<00:04:13.550> there<00:04:13.850> it's<00:04:14.750> like<00:04:14.900> what<00:04:15.440> they<00:04:15.560> say<00:04:15.740> Bologna

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
on there it's like what they say Bologna

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.400 
on there it's like what they say Bologna
does<00:04:16.370> but<00:04:16.670> when<00:04:16.760> he<00:04:16.850> pulls<00:04:17.299> away<00:04:17.540> paint<00:04:17.900> it'll

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
does but when he pulls away paint it'll

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.700 
does but when he pulls away paint it'll
do<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.860> so<00:04:19.989> yep<00:04:21.760> but<00:04:22.760> here's<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.060> new<00:04:23.180> one<00:04:23.210> I

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
do that so yep but here's the new one I

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.940 
do that so yep but here's the new one I
recommend<00:04:24.710> back<00:04:24.920> in<00:04:25.040> Arnie<00:04:25.340> iron<00:04:26.240> Lee<00:04:26.480> I<00:04:26.950> don't

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
recommend back in Arnie iron Lee I don't

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.170 
recommend back in Arnie iron Lee I don't
know<00:04:28.720> look<00:04:29.720> for<00:04:29.900> back<00:04:30.700> it's<00:04:31.700> made<00:04:31.910> in<00:04:32.060> Japan

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
know look for back it's made in Japan

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.170 
know look for back it's made in Japan
that<00:04:32.840> one<00:04:33.080> was<00:04:33.410> actually<00:04:33.590> made<00:04:33.950> in<00:04:34.160> USA<00:04:34.610> its

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
that one was actually made in USA its

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.580 
that one was actually made in USA its
stock<00:04:35.510> so<00:04:35.900> fairly<00:04:36.830> impressed<00:04:37.160> but<00:04:37.400> this<00:04:37.910> one

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
stock so fairly impressed but this one

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.110 
stock so fairly impressed but this one
has<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.770> same<00:04:39.950> type<00:04:40.220> setup<00:04:40.520> you<00:04:40.700> can<00:04:40.760> see<00:04:40.970> the

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
has the same type setup you can see the

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.180 
has the same type setup you can see the
hole<00:04:41.870> right<00:04:42.080> there<00:04:42.140> that<00:04:42.590> goes<00:04:42.740> through<00:04:43.040> and

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
hole right there that goes through and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.330 
hole right there that goes through and
that's<00:04:43.340> good<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.610> clip<00:04:43.870> it's<00:04:44.870> good<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:45.340> it's

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
that's good the clip it's good and it's

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.650 
that's good the clip it's good and it's
for<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.640> reservoir<00:04:46.970> it's<00:04:47.180> got<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.330> different

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
for the reservoir it's got a different

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.530 
for the reservoir it's got a different
setup<00:04:47.870> for<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:48.970> hopefully<00:04:49.970> as<00:04:50.090> plastic

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
setup for that hopefully as plastic

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.740 
setup for that hopefully as plastic
keeps<00:04:51.170> that's<00:04:52.130> tightened<00:04:52.520> down<00:04:52.750> assuming

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
keeps that's tightened down assuming

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.710 
keeps that's tightened down assuming
just<00:04:53.900> torques<00:04:54.290> it's<00:04:54.530> tight<00:04:54.770> but<00:04:55.640> um<00:04:55.820> then<00:04:56.630> it

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
just torques it's tight but um then it

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.090 
just torques it's tight but um then it
comes<00:04:56.870> with<00:04:56.960> this<00:04:57.110> cardboard<00:04:57.410> gasket<00:04:58.010> you

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
don't really need the gasket but that's

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.250 
don't really need the gasket but that's

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
the gasket you don't want to double

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.820 
the gasket you don't want to double
their<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:14.810> gasket<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:16.490> no<00:05:16.750> it's<00:05:17.750> not<00:05:18.350> usually

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
their the gasket so no it's not usually

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.050 
their the gasket so no it's not usually
good<00:05:19.010> and<00:05:19.160> you<00:05:19.250> might<00:05:19.400> get<00:05:19.520> away<00:05:19.610> with<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:19.910> not

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
good and you might get away with it not

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.360 
good and you might get away with it not
enough<00:05:20.650> so<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:23.270> then<00:05:23.390> all<00:05:23.540> you<00:05:23.660> have<00:05:23.810> is<00:05:23.990> this

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
enough so and then all you have is this

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.480 
enough so and then all you have is this
which<00:05:25.370> users<00:05:25.730> thread<00:05:26.120> on<00:05:26.980> to<00:05:27.980> the<00:05:28.070> end<00:05:28.250> of<00:05:28.370> this

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
which users thread on to the end of this

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.760 
which users thread on to the end of this
and<00:05:28.880> then<00:05:29.000> while<00:05:29.540> that<00:05:29.570> one<00:05:29.990> goes<00:05:30.230> first<00:05:30.530> a

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
and then while that one goes first a

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.400 
and then while that one goes first a
little<00:05:30.919> nut<00:05:31.220> and<00:05:34.270> yeah<00:05:35.270> then<00:05:36.140> you<00:05:36.230> just

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
little nut and yeah then you just

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.380 
little nut and yeah then you just
tighten<00:05:36.560> it<00:05:36.710> up<00:05:36.830> against<00:05:37.250> each<00:05:37.340> other<00:05:37.490> set<00:05:38.300> it

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
tighten it up against each other set it

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.600 
tighten it up against each other set it
in<00:05:38.480> there<00:05:38.600> and<00:05:38.780> hook<00:05:39.560> everything<00:05:39.919> back<00:05:40.130> in<00:05:40.370> I

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
but right there is the slave it's not

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:21.409 
but right there is the slave it's not
easy<00:06:14.930> and<00:06:15.930> as<00:06:16.409> you<00:06:16.560> can<00:06:16.680> see<00:06:20.120> this<00:06:21.120> is<00:06:21.300> why

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
easy and as you can see this is why

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:31.219 
easy and as you can see this is why
flashlights<00:06:29.240> all<00:06:30.240> right<00:06:30.479> as<00:06:30.659> you<00:06:30.810> can<00:06:30.960> see

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
flashlights all right as you can see

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.710 
flashlights all right as you can see
right<00:06:31.500> there<00:06:31.849> the<00:06:32.849> slave<00:06:33.180> is<00:06:33.210> compressed

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
right there the slave is compressed

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.930 
right there the slave is compressed
right<00:06:33.990> now<00:06:34.169> but<00:06:35.039> literally<00:06:35.310> all<00:06:35.520> you<00:06:35.550> do<00:06:35.789> is

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
right now but literally all you do is

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.540 
right now but literally all you do is
you<00:06:36.060> take<00:06:36.240> a<00:06:36.470> new<00:06:37.470> slave<00:06:37.740> and<00:06:38.009> you<00:06:38.069> push<00:06:38.280> it<00:06:38.310> in

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
you take a new slave and you push it in

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.529 
you take a new slave and you push it in
there<00:06:38.699> and<00:06:38.819> it<00:06:38.909> takes<00:06:39.030> a<00:06:39.180> little<00:06:39.300> bit<00:06:39.479> of

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 
there and it takes a little bit of

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:41.540 
there and it takes a little bit of
strength<00:06:39.780> but<00:06:40.020> you<00:06:40.860> push<00:06:41.039> it<00:06:41.159> in<00:06:41.280> there<00:06:41.370> as<00:06:41.520> you

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
strength but you push it in there as you

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.580 
strength but you push it in there as you
stick<00:06:41.849> a<00:06:41.880> bulb<00:06:42.120> in<00:06:42.300> after<00:06:42.930> you<00:06:43.159> do<00:06:44.159> that<00:06:44.400> line

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
stick a bulb in after you do that line

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.930 
stick a bulb in after you do that line
think<00:06:46.590> oh<00:06:46.710> I<00:06:46.740> might<00:06:47.099> have<00:06:47.220> the<00:06:47.340> same<00:06:47.520> setup<00:06:47.759> as

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
think oh I might have the same setup as

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.629 
think oh I might have the same setup as
the<00:06:48.090> other<00:06:48.240> one<00:06:48.389> I<00:06:48.419> haven't<00:06:48.659> looked<00:06:48.780> out<00:06:48.990> yet

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
the other one I haven't looked out yet

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.120 
the other one I haven't looked out yet
but<00:06:50.639> regardless<00:06:50.970> I<00:06:51.240> just<00:06:51.659> what<00:06:51.810> you<00:06:51.900> do<00:06:52.130> that's

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
but regardless I just what you do that's

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.510 
but regardless I just what you do that's
really<00:06:53.310> simple<00:06:53.669> and<00:06:54.409> when<00:06:55.409> you<00:06:55.500> take<00:06:56.250> off<00:06:56.400> the

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
really simple and when you take off the

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.399 
really simple and when you take off the
other<00:06:56.550> half<00:06:56.909> you<00:06:57.360> have<00:06:57.509> to<00:06:57.659> go<00:06:57.780> inside<00:06:58.050> the<00:06:58.199> car

00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:58.409 
other half you have to go inside the car

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:00.320 
other half you have to go inside the car
and<00:06:58.590> go<00:06:58.710> up<00:06:58.830> against<00:06:59.099> the<00:06:59.219> pedal<00:06:59.520> it's<00:07:00.060> really

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
and go up against the pedal it's really

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.580 
and go up against the pedal it's really
simple<00:07:00.569> once<00:07:00.810> you<00:07:00.870> get<00:07:00.990> there<00:07:01.110> just<00:07:01.319> look<00:07:01.409> for

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
simple once you get there just look for

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.820 
simple once you get there just look for
a<00:07:01.620> pin<00:07:01.830> with<00:07:02.250> cotter<00:07:02.520> pin<00:07:02.759> in<00:07:02.909> it<00:07:03.469> my<00:07:04.469> cars<00:07:04.710> were

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
a pin with cotter pin in it my cars were

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.690 
a pin with cotter pin in it my cars were
wreck

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.670
