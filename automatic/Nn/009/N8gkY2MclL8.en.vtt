won't go off and then you can speed

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.300 
won't go off and then you can speed
through<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> caves<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.770> got<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> duck

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
through the caves and they got a duck

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.570 
through the caves and they got a duck
between<00:01:17.700> these<00:01:17.850> barrels<00:01:18.240> pretty<00:01:18.479> fast<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
between these barrels pretty fast and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.520 
between these barrels pretty fast and
then<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:21.180> drive<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.630> slow<00:01:21.960> down<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.470> you

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
then just drive up slow down if you

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.840 
then just drive up slow down if you
don't<00:01:22.680> slow<00:01:22.860> down<00:01:23.009> you'll<00:01:23.220> fall<00:01:23.430> back<00:01:23.640> in

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
don't slow down you'll fall back in

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.060 
don't slow down you'll fall back in
which<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.570> really<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.500> makes<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.890> mad

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
which is really really makes you mad

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.800 
which is really really makes you mad
because<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.060> don't<00:01:27.180> want<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.360> fall<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:27.659> can

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
because you don't want to fall they can

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.899 
because you don't want to fall they can
enough<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.290> over<00:01:28.320> again<00:01:28.640> they<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.820> get

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
enough do it all over again they can get

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.340 
enough do it all over again they can get
all<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.090> way<00:01:30.240> through<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.570> cave<00:01:30.869> down<00:01:31.290> there

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
all the way through the cave down there

is<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.300> use<00:02:09.600> a<00:02:09.630> little<00:02:09.810> statue<00:02:10.170> base<00:02:10.560> thing<00:02:10.860> in

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
is to use a little statue base thing in

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.950 
is to use a little statue base thing in
the<00:02:11.100> middle<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.640> map<00:02:11.850> sometimes<00:02:12.810> if

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
the middle on this map sometimes if

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.090 
the middle on this map sometimes if
someone's<00:02:13.200> chasing<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.860> have<00:02:14.010> the

someone's chasing you and you have the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.520 
someone's chasing you and you have the
flag<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.670> he's<00:02:14.880> top<00:02:15.210> over<00:02:15.570> that<00:02:15.750> thing<00:02:15.990> you

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
flag and he's top over that thing you

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.600 
flag and he's top over that thing you
completed<00:02:16.950> throme<00:02:17.370> off<00:02:18.770> ok<00:02:19.770> here's<00:02:20.010> infinity

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
completed throme off ok here's infinity

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.150 
completed throme off ok here's infinity
on<00:02:20.790> infinity<00:02:21.390> those<00:02:21.660> big<00:02:22.050> bridge<00:02:22.320> things<00:02:22.650> you

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
on infinity those big bridge things you

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.680 
on infinity those big bridge things you
can<00:02:23.340> actually<00:02:23.610> get<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.760> hog<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.180> top<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.570> them

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
can actually get a hog on top of them

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.330 
can actually get a hog on top of them
you<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:25.380> got<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.500> be<00:02:25.650> patient<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.250> really

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
you just got to be patient and really

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.820 
you just got to be patient and really
practice<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.060> because<00:02:27.330> if<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.560> flip

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
practice this because if you if you flip

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.170 
practice this because if you if you flip
side<00:02:29.070> ways<00:02:29.280> you're<00:02:29.430> never<00:02:29.580> going<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.850> get<00:02:30.030> back

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
side ways you're never going to get back

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.410 
side ways you're never going to get back
up<00:02:30.950> then<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.280> can<00:02:32.400> also<00:02:32.550> drive<00:02:32.850> across<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
up then you can also drive across the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.970 
up then you can also drive across the
bridge<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:34.050> can<00:02:34.230> do<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.590> other<00:02:34.620> bridge

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
bridge you can do it on the other bridge

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.620 
bridge you can do it on the other bridge
too<00:02:35.390> it's<00:02:36.390> uh<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:38.120> pretty<00:02:39.120> easy<00:02:39.330> on<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
too it's uh it's pretty easy on the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.240 
too it's uh it's pretty easy on the
other<00:02:39.840> bridge<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.410> almost<00:02:40.590> easier<00:02:40.950> than<00:02:41.160> on

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
other bridge it's almost easier than on

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.770 
other bridge it's almost easier than on
this<00:02:41.400> fridge<00:02:41.700> it's<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.240> little<00:02:42.360> trickier

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
this fridge it's just a little trickier

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.540 
this fridge it's just a little trickier
to<00:02:42.930> actually<00:02:43.170> get<00:02:43.320> on<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.650> last<00:02:44.190> approach

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
to actually get on the last approach

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.150 
to actually get on the last approach
because<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:46.140> teleporters<00:02:46.740> in<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.980> way<00:02:47.100> but

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
because that teleporters in the way but

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.760 
because that teleporters in the way but
it's<00:02:47.520> possible<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.840> then<00:02:49.080> if<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.320> line<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.530> up

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
it's possible and then if you line it up

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.380 
it's possible and then if you line it up
straight<00:02:50.130> like<00:02:50.160> I'm<00:02:50.550> about<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.850> do<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.240> can

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
straight like I'm about to do you can

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.490 
straight like I'm about to do you can
drive<00:02:51.540> across<00:02:52.310> driver<00:02:53.310> has<00:02:53.760> pretty<00:02:54.000> fast<00:02:54.240> too

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
drive across driver has pretty fast too

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.960 
drive across driver has pretty fast too
you<00:02:55.500> can<00:02:55.590> go<00:02:55.709> full<00:02:55.890> speed<00:02:56.100> there's<00:02:56.490> no<00:02:56.610> worries

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
you can go full speed there's no worries

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.470 
you can go full speed there's no worries
it's<00:02:57.330> not<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:57.600> on<00:02:57.750> danger<00:02:58.110> cannon<00:02:59.240> see

is possible to drive through the base
it'll<00:03:33.989> actually<00:03:34.110> sometimes<00:03:34.470> work<00:03:34.829> if<00:03:34.980> you

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
it'll actually sometimes work if you

danger<00:04:38.490> Canyon<00:04:38.940> this<00:04:39.539> one<00:04:39.750> is<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:39.960> little<00:04:40.169> bit

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
danger Canyon this one is a little bit

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.370 
danger Canyon this one is a little bit
harder<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.520> be<00:04:41.669> extremely<00:04:42.120> patient<00:04:42.419> I<00:04:42.840> can

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
harder to be extremely patient I can

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.890 
harder to be extremely patient I can
usually<00:04:43.500> do<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:43.800> way<00:04:43.919> faster<00:04:44.370> than<00:04:44.400> this<00:04:44.610> but

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
usually do it way faster than this but

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.990 
usually do it way faster than this but
sometimes<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.020> legs<00:04:46.229> up<00:04:46.440> like<00:04:46.650> this<00:04:46.849> you<00:04:47.849> just

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
sometimes it legs up like this you just

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.310 
sometimes it legs up like this you just
got<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.150> make<00:04:48.360> sure<00:04:48.419> that<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:48.750> kind<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:48.990> gun<00:04:49.200> it

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
got to make sure that you kind of gun it

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.320 
got to make sure that you kind of gun it
back<00:04:49.530> but<00:04:49.830> then<00:04:49.919> hold<00:04:50.370> off<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:50.849> it'll<00:04:51.120> get

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
back but then hold off and it'll get

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.240 
back but then hold off and it'll get
stuck<00:04:51.599> like<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.780> you<00:04:52.200> can<00:04:52.380> even<00:04:52.710> get<00:04:53.010> in<00:04:53.130> all

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
stuck like that you can even get in all

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.560 
stuck like that you can even get in all
the<00:04:53.370> passenger<00:04:53.789> seat<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.150> stuff<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.479> I'll

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
the passenger seat and stuff and I'll

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.500 
the passenger seat and stuff and I'll
keep<00:04:54.720> floating<00:04:55.400> ok<00:04:56.400> see<00:04:56.460> if<00:04:56.700> you<00:04:57.060> ever<00:04:57.180> wanted
