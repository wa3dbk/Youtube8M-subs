incredibly<00:00:38.850> awesome<00:00:39.350> kinda<00:00:40.350> awesome<00:00:40.500> that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
incredibly awesome kinda awesome that

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.360 
incredibly awesome kinda awesome that

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
sucks but there's basically you have a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
sucks but there's basically you have a
terrain<00:00:44.730> meter<00:00:45.030> where<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.649> can

terrain meter where you have to you can

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.560 
terrain meter where you have to you can
only<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.309> many<00:00:47.610> objects<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.210> your<00:00:48.300> park

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
only have so many objects in your park

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.660 
only have so many objects in your park
which<00:00:48.870> makes<00:00:49.200> your<00:00:49.320> parks<00:00:49.649> very<00:00:49.980> small<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
which makes your parks very small and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.479 
which makes your parks very small and
the<00:00:51.210> objects<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:52.379> get<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:53.010> park<00:00:53.250> are

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the objects you get in your park are

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.869 
the objects you get in your park are
very<00:00:53.820> limited<00:00:54.030> also<00:00:54.570> which<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.879> unfortunate

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
very limited also which is unfortunate

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.939 
very limited also which is unfortunate
but<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.600> did<00:00:57.780> good<00:00:57.989> now<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.770> see

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
but I think I did good now as you see

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.569 
but I think I did good now as you see
right<00:00:59.160> now<00:00:59.309> there's<00:00:59.730> those<00:00:59.989> grey<00:01:00.989> ledges

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
right now there's those grey ledges

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.460 
right now there's those grey ledges
inside<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.730> full<00:01:02.940> pipe<00:01:03.180> which<00:01:03.449> trust<00:01:04.199> me<00:01:04.290> out

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
inside the full pipe which trust me out

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.020 
inside the full pipe which trust me out
if<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.739> could<00:01:04.949> make<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.129> without<00:01:05.400> those<00:01:05.790> things

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
if I could make it without those things

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.880 
if I could make it without those things
in<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.330> that'd<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> lot<00:01:06.990> better<00:01:07.260> but

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
in there that'd be a lot better but

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.450 
in there that'd be a lot better but
that's<00:01:08.159> all<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> could<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:08.939> because<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
that's all I could do because of the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.340 
that's all I could do because of the
those<00:01:11.460> corner<00:01:12.060> pieces<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.869> quarter<00:01:13.170> pipes

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
those corner pieces on the quarter pipes

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.109 
those corner pieces on the quarter pipes
that<00:01:13.530> I'm<00:01:13.619> skating<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.010> right<00:01:14.250> now<00:01:14.430> those
