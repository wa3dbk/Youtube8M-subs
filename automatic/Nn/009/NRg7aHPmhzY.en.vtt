slickness<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.479> his<00:02:09.599> defense<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.319> eventually

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
slickness and his defense and eventually

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.220 
slickness and his defense and eventually
it<00:02:11.129> paid<00:02:11.340> off<00:02:11.370> Mike<00:02:12.180> Perez<00:02:12.540> he<00:02:12.750> started<00:02:13.110> to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.300 
he started to slow down and look to me
like<00:02:16.540> Brian<00:02:17.080> Gina's<00:02:17.440> basically<00:02:17.890> started<00:02:18.220> to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
like Brian Gina's basically started to

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.970 
like Brian Gina's basically started to
take<00:02:18.489> over<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.849> fight<00:02:19.060> after<00:02:19.959> around<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.560> don't

know<00:02:21.069> seven<00:02:21.400> or<00:02:21.730> eight<00:02:22.270> right<00:02:22.840> that's<00:02:23.140> when<00:02:23.319> we

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
know seven or eight right that's when we

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.650 
know seven or eight right that's when we
started<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.830> see<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.010> drastic<00:02:24.340> change<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:25.090> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
started to see a drastic change in the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.830 
started to see a drastic change in the
fight<00:02:25.930> now<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:27.370> way<00:02:27.520> on<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:28.209> judges<00:02:28.660> have

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
fight now the way on the the judges have

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.960 
fight now the way on the the judges have
to<00:02:28.870> fight<00:02:29.200> they<00:02:29.410> had<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.770> only<00:02:29.920> by<00:02:30.280> one<00:02:30.670> point

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
to fight they had it only by one point

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.780 
to fight they had it only by one point
for<00:02:31.930> Brian<00:02:32.860> Jennings<00:02:33.190> but<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.519> kind<00:02:33.760> of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
for Brian Jennings but I kind of

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.089 
for Brian Jennings but I kind of
disagree<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.300> think<00:02:34.420> he<00:02:34.750> pulled<00:02:35.019> away<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.530> think

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
disagree I think he pulled away I think

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.800 
disagree I think he pulled away I think
Brian<00:02:36.310> Jennings<00:02:36.550> won<00:02:36.849> this<00:02:37.030> fight<00:02:37.239> at<00:02:37.510> least

Brian Jennings won this fight at least

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.640 
Brian Jennings won this fight at least
by<00:02:38.050> three<00:02:38.709> points<00:02:38.950> okay<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:41.230> know<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.470> big

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
by three points okay so you know the big

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.740 
by three points okay so you know the big
controversy<00:02:42.340> right<00:02:42.519> now<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:43.000> if<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.390> wasn't

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
controversy right now is if it wasn't

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.960 
controversy right now is if it wasn't
for<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.930> referee<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.980> duct<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.489> that<00:02:45.640> point

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
for the referee the duct in that point

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.370 
for the referee the duct in that point
this<00:02:46.330> fight<00:02:46.569> actually<00:02:47.019> would<00:02:47.170> have<00:02:47.260> been<00:02:47.350> a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
this fight actually would have been a

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.979 
this fight actually would have been a
draw<00:02:47.709> I<00:02:48.069> for<00:02:48.730> one<00:02:48.880> I'm<00:02:49.060> happy<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.510> fight<00:02:49.720> you

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
know wasn't a draw because that leads to

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.630 
know wasn't a draw because that leads to
more<00:02:52.120> unfinished<00:02:52.810> business<00:02:53.560> we're<00:02:54.250> trying<00:02:54.459> to

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
say this looking at all the young

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.990 
say this looking at all the young
heavyweights<00:03:17.349> coming<00:03:17.769> up<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.160> still<00:03:18.970> can't

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
heavyweights coming up I still can't

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.800 
heavyweights coming up I still can't
really<00:03:19.690> say<00:03:20.049> that<00:03:20.709> I<00:03:20.769> see<00:03:21.130> someone<00:03:21.810> dominating

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
really say that I see someone dominating

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.960

the<00:03:23.230> real<00:03:23.470> champion<00:03:24.100> wladimir<00:03:24.790> klitschko

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
the real champion wladimir klitschko

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.360 
the real champion wladimir klitschko
right<00:03:25.870> now<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.140> I<00:03:26.230> think<00:03:26.470> Klitschko<00:03:27.100> he<00:03:27.250> has

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
right now and I think Klitschko he has

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.729 
right now and I think Klitschko he has
an<00:03:27.549> edge<00:03:27.880> on<00:03:28.120> all<00:03:28.690> these<00:03:28.930> young<00:03:29.230> heavyweights

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
an edge on all these young heavyweights

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.620 
an edge on all these young heavyweights
