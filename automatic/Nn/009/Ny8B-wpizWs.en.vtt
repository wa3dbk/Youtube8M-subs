00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
a quite linear fashion which was quite

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.400 
a quite linear fashion which was quite

that in the 13 to you don't know whether
exactly<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> monsters<00:01:33.570> are<00:01:33.810> locking<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.100> if

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
exactly the monsters are locking but if

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.249 
exactly the monsters are locking but if

you get close enough to the monster
still<00:01:37.680> appear<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.130> vary<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.670> alarm<00:01:38.909> then

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
still appear to vary with you alarm then

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.300 
still appear to vary with you alarm then
if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.539> go<00:01:39.750> into<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:40.080> exam<00:01:40.350> touch<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.100> that's

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
if you go into the exam touch so that's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.430

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
what we call more modcloth or multiple

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.770 
what we call more modcloth or multiple
and<00:01:43.649> live<00:01:44.340> trigger<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.149> something<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.630> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and live trigger is something that is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.670 
and live trigger is something that is
one<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:47.210> elements<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.539> into<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.229> quite<00:01:49.439> so

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
one of the elements of into it quite so

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.440 
one of the elements of into it quite so
mysterious<00:01:50.460> elements<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> mystery

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
mysterious elements of the mystery

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.170 
mysterious elements of the mystery
involved<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> lab<00:01:52.939> trigger<00:01:53.939> system

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
involved in it so the lab trigger system

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.540 
involved in it so the lab trigger system
allows<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.259> choose<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.770> action<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> take
