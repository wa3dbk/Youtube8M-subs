00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.740
 you people is gray while the team 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.199
 short and we end up today for 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.640
 a redstone tutorial so stalled after this 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.439
 redstone tutorial this raid tutorial 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.090
 doorbell hidden door thanks to the red 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.009
 area that opens with a shot of 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.089
 lighter on a gloss stone we will do 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.949
 the demonstration 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.169
 I click on the left -hand side with 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.789
 my lighter and now the side opens 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.739
 you can not be a pic h and a 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.600
 vault room like me here and a 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.760
 second click with the evoked on the agglo 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.449
 tons and closes it will go to 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.210
 explanations 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.289
 so here I did the house but with 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.140
 a lot less history stuff 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.550
 sees is a lot more the system so 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.020
 already there is a gloss stone because 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.449
 that there is need of a greedy I 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.430
 I put two for that - spoil and 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.289
 there he had a chart why a 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.719
 chart to avoid seeing the piston 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.430
 so let's talk about the red wool the 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.230
 red line represents the switch box 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.329
 simply the bitchois not in 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.699
 speak in this video there are plenty of 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.729
 tutorials on the internet and I will do it 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.340
 myself a later is the wool 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.170
 yellow is used for what it is used for 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.740
 two pistons be extended ciapa this 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.660
 yellow wool 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.789
 it lasted that the bac will be 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.319
 extended and berthe wool it serves to 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.319
 what does she show the door 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:23.720
 so the idea re demonstration clicks 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.560
 on the blood stone it opens have resumed 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.440
 his closes 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.170
 now we will go to the creation 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.890
 so as you saw we put a gloss 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:38.149
 tons behind at the wall level a 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.220
 piston right in front of the piston a torch 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.599
 after for the blog colors that we are going 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.860
 resume as there we will create the 

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:46.700
 buzz fall with red wool 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.929
 it must be more for the buzz since the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.640
 red zone come in the block that is 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.459
 just in front of this one so we go all 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.750
 simply raise the red stone 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:56.509
 how to make it go up real simpler 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.170
 we made it go up with the son of 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.200
 redstone contaminated by a repeater so 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.050
 I'll already show you that the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.349
 wish to switcher is running one clicks 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.270
 it grows it complicates attracts now 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.370
 more than to make a door so here we go 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.020
 to make a door an x 2 I'm going to you 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.100
 show without putting the yellow block what 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.050
 it makes 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.800
 there is that spicy dupas that is 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.390
 activated so just put a block 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.620
 who here is the yellow wool with the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.540
 red stone on it and the two blocks 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.790
 will be activated both pistons are 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.530
 active and therefore to the door as 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.730
 here the left bugs will not want 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.610
 it's just to show that 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.100
 opening hop we take the lighter and 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.080
 magical magic it opens so frankly 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.180
 this system I make them full of forms 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.100
 multi never did I find myself my 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.160
 secret bases so otherwise what else 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.380
 this system comes from a German youtuber 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.540
 which is called minecraft pg5 you can 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.430
 find his channel in the video in 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.740
 the video discussion and as you 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.980
 could also notice there was 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.940
 the common man intro cfr why 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.920
 simply because I'm going to them 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.470
 top of this video 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.390
 hoping he accepts why because 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.620
 that as I say it is a youtuber 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.190
 German there is no version 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.350
 French 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.360
 so do not hesitate to like a 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.920
