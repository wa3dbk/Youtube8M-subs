00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.700
 almost all put the peculiarity 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.220
 the benefits of this product is that we 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.230
 has a bowl capacity that is wide the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.930
 broader market today which

 big benefits of the product then there you 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.430
 see for example we are trying to make a

 floating island 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.340

 sold with the product 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.780
 which is what is very interesting 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.430
 also in this product is that I you 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.920
 were talking about automatic programs that 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.470
 allows people who are not very 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.870
 seasoned in the kitchen to do it themselves 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.090
 and to have access to cases of elaboration 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.310
 of complex recipes but when we 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.560
 gets hard little by little we can 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.470
 switch to a manual mode or there one 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.769
 pilot ourselves the gesture the 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.200
 temperature and time and so we're going 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.840
 offer the consumer small 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.120
 online course via another partner 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.430
 atelierdeschefs so there typically have 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.900
 made 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.060
 we are preparing an island 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.640
 floating we put the egg whites 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.310
 in the in the robot and that brings us 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.500
 behind at this result so here is 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.269
 so taken private sales price to 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.269
