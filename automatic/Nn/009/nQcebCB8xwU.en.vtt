00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.499
 hello friends welcome to cook real 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.740
 free for those who do not know how to cook today 

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:10.990
 let's prepare a passion fruit sauce 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.339
 The first thing we do is open the 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.870
 passion for the center as you see here with 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.150
 the help of a saw knife is more 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.900
 easy 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.640
 and we took the pulp to a plate 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.140
 passion fruit is also known as fruit 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.099
 of passion is a very aromatic fruit 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.860
 delicious exotic and a little asia that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.680
 It serves for multiple preparations with 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.220
 the help of a spoon we remove all 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.239
 the pulp here we are using 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.030
 only two passion fruit 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.750
 when you choose it, notice that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.330
 this wrinkled is the skin and that despite 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.360
 weights because the pulp content is 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:58.379
 great here is our fault we are going to 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.740
 take it now to a pot and pass it by 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.170
 a colander 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.120
 what we want is to get all the juice 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.990
 and leave the seeds in the colander 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.240
 then we help ourselves with a spoon 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.850
 moving the pulp in several directions 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.770
 so that the juice comes out with you what 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.590
 come here 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.929
 and we do not have to liquefy or make 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.670
 nothing else as it is so dense 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:25.159
 we have to help us with the spoon 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.130
 moving it and pressing if you do not 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.219
 we do not go out all the content 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.460
 when we have all the liquid in the 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:37.219
 maracuyÃ¡ will place the pot to 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.560
 fire add two tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:45.439
 brunette we mix in eight so that 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.959
 integrate if you want to add a 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.000
 little more sugar can do that 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.510
 it's a pleasure but it seems to me that 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.970
 will hear of being more than enough 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.100
 let's remove a bit of the 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.100
 peel a lemon or an orange 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.380
 and the low 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.360
 we are also going to remove the shell of a 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.700
 piece of ginger can be two or three 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.800
 centimeters of ginger root 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.650
 we wash it too 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.260
 and we're going to bring all this to the mix 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.720
 of sugar with passion fruit juice and 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.140
 add the lemon peel add 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.260
 cinnamon ginger and aniseed we let 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.600
 boil and occasionally every 2 minutes 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.330
 let's hopefully mix in eights so that 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.040
 everything is well integrated and we let it 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.090
 kitchen 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.859
 here we have already 15 minutes of cooking 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.170
 20 minutes of cooking and notice 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.269
 this point has been reduced it has 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.200
 expressed and it has darkened is already 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.469
 list we got off the fire and went through a 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.469
 strainer 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.989
 we discard the lemon the cinnamon the 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:03.220
 ginger and our sauce is ready 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.260
 sauce is very rich because it is bittersweet and 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.800
 we can use it with sweet dishes and 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.530
 salty 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.380
 For example, we can serve it with a 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.400
 dessert like this gelatin with a cake 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.860
 of banana 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.170
 that is a bit sweet but not so much 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.799
 we can also serve it on seafood 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.560
 grilled over fish on chicken 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.150
 about meat 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.130
 on breaded fried fish 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.800
 about fried seafood 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:37.020
 then they can accompany this sauce with 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.020
 anything and they are very rich
