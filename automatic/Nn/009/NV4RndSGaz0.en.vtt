do this type of diet I do raise my

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.179 
do this type of diet I do raise my
protein<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.360> lot<00:01:12.630> because<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.500> decrease<00:01:14.040> my

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
protein a lot because they decrease my

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.260 
protein a lot because they decrease my
carbs<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.670> raised<00:01:15.540> my<00:01:15.750> fats<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.530> raise<00:01:16.770> my

carbs I raised my fats and I raise my

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.109 
carbs I raised my fats and I raise my
protein<00:01:18.270> intake<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:19.590> because<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.970> would

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
protein intake just because if I would

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.539 
protein intake just because if I would
also<00:01:21.360> take<00:01:21.689> protein<00:01:22.200> or<00:01:22.470> keep<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.890> low<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.400> will

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
also take protein or keep it low I will

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.230 
also take protein or keep it low I will
just<00:01:23.909> gonna<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.560> very<00:01:25.560> big<00:01:26.240> calorie

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
just gonna be in a very big calorie

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.920 
just gonna be in a very big calorie
deficit<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.759> I<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:30.329> find<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.689> very

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
deficit and I just find it very

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.890 
deficit and I just find it very
effective<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.310> play<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> carbs<00:01:33.630> why

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
effective to play with the carbs why

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.740 
effective to play with the carbs why
