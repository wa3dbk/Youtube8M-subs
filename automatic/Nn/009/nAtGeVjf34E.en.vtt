00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hi bye guys are grant welcome 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.839
 finally this new clash video 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.690
 so many plants had me 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.030
 asked unfortunately the fact is that I do not 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.920
 I can find a topic every day 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.470
 let's say about this game since yes 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.189
 it proceeds so slowly 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.289
 But today I did a nice attack neither 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.210
 which brought me a lot of resources 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.990
 so I wanted to show it to you and also there is 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.840
 the novelty of the flywheel that substantially 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.050
 new 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.330
 object that was unlocked with the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.610
 new update you can build me 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.650
 seems with the town hall at level 6 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.380
 and it is currently the only object that it is 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.510
 can rotate this way as it is 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.460
 its usefulness 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.290
 look at the shuttlecock and put powerful 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.780
 gusts of wind that repel enemies 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.760
 you can direct it in one direction only to 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.220
 which rotates to maximize it 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.270
 effectiveness does not hurt ie it does not 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.629
 damage 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:04.250
 this object however rejects i 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.800
 enemies and how many can be built 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.820
 I still don't know this apparently 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.050
 one good I have yet to see however how 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:18.320
 place it inside the village 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:19.880
 because sincerely at the moment can in 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.030
 theory should be put as an example 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.440
 between two cannons or between two towers 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.240
 of the archer so that the enemies do not 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.940
 they manage to get close to the tower 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.830
 could be an idea anyway 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.590
 this as you see the village is 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.350
 however in expansion I am increasing 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.940
 slowly the walls 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.270
 the last camp at 6 will be between 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.160
 little and all is increasing 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.440
 extractors and all the mines 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.890
 now it's a question of time to do 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.899
 new research within the course 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.149
 I really don't miss the lab 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.030
 lots of stuff 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.619
 the barbarian king 4 in short, then slowly 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.240
 I have to do right that I could finish them 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.950
 researches I have to increase two more 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.690
 barracks at 9 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.780
 then let's see this now 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:10.399
 attack then I did here it is 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.080
 brought us 409,000 gold and 277 thousand 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.480
 to really elixir a quantity 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.090
 incredible for a village among other things 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.670
 as you also see quite crap if 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.630
 she 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.540
 how everything is structured 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.709
 I practically cleaned these two 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.100
 structures above and then I did 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:35.490
 enter all into barbarians and give ourselves 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.860
 therefore without major war strategies 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.280
 of who knows what type I simply have 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.290
 split a wall and they were inside 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.540
 all the mines because it was above all 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.650
 in short, the mines contain a good one 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.650
 half of the loot is taken all all 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.880
 deposit the mines 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.300
 I ended up basically with 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.010
 with a very simple 100 percent 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.730
 in short it is that there was no difficulty a 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.250
 concerning I put only barbarian archers 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.230
 King Barbarian Okay But in short I had 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.840
 a good amount of the loot that is me 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.820
 very useful because at this point I can 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.410
 choose what to do 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:21.360
 I honestly know that I put myself in others 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:24.690
 big money aside and then omi enhances the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.690
 strength potion at level 4 that 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.070
 could be a good thing 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:34.560
 I let these units pass because 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:36.660
 I don't use them or wait a little longer 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.310
 I do another barracks on the 9th that 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.740
 it could perhaps be more convenient 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.650
 I don't know what I should do according to you say 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.450
 Explain it to me fully 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.180
 meanwhile it could also enhance this 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.000
 here at level 2 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.140
 but I know that as a rise another 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.310
 no extractor and then it strengthens me 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:04.590
 some walls still or here it improves 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.530
 improves improves and nothing with them does not 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.570
 I can do something else for this, okay yes 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.520
 I can empower it this is yes I would have it 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.640
 had to do first okay now nothing got me 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.799
 I define to upgrade the last wall e 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.489
 for now we stop here 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.640
 let's say eo nothing 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:27.170
 wars go on with the clan we are 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.820
 at level 3 e 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.130
 we always have a lot of people 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.710
 strong I always thank ico leaders who 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.810
 they always do a great job and nothing 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.340
 boh unfortunately I'm not very active 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.340
 lately on the clan 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.080
 however anyway then thanks for the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.690
 I recommend you watch this video 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.720
 leave a nice like and hello everyone 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.720
