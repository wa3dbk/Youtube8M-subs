00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
something that I do because it kind of

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.719 
something that I do because it kind of
makes<00:04:43.290> sense<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.800> me<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.950> Pat<00:04:44.250> them<00:04:44.430> dry<00:04:44.639> a

makes sense to me to Pat them dry a

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.340 
makes sense to me to Pat them dry a
little<00:04:44.970> bit<00:04:45.210> before<00:04:45.360> they<00:04:45.660> go<00:04:45.780> into<00:04:45.960> the

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
little bit before they go into the

dehydrator especially in that cold water
so<00:04:50.490> I<00:04:50.520> just<00:04:50.729> Pat<00:04:50.910> them<00:04:51.090> down<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.539> little<00:04:51.690> bit<00:04:52.460> not

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
so I just Pat them down a little bit not

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.740 
so I just Pat them down a little bit not
overly<00:04:53.789> so<00:04:54.289> just<00:04:55.289> a<00:04:55.380> little<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:56.360> then<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.390> lay

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
overly so just a little and then I lay

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.090 
overly so just a little and then I lay
them<00:04:58.020> down<00:04:58.050> on<00:04:59.030> my<00:05:00.030> dehydrating<00:05:00.720> trays<00:05:01.100> these

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
them down on my dehydrating trays these

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.200 
them down on my dehydrating trays these
are<00:05:02.430> going<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:03.060> crinkle<00:05:03.720> up<00:05:03.840> really<00:05:04.669> quick<00:05:06.770> and

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
are going to crinkle up really quick and

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.610 
are going to crinkle up really quick and
they<00:05:09.210> do<00:05:09.800> shrink<00:05:10.800> down<00:05:11.100> to<00:05:12.620> practically

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
they do shrink down to practically

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.340 
they do shrink down to practically
nothing<00:05:13.760> in<00:05:14.760> my<00:05:14.910> opinion<00:05:15.270> but<00:05:15.570> they're<00:05:16.139> so

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
nothing in my opinion but they're so

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.710 
nothing in my opinion but they're so
worth<00:05:16.560> to<00:05:16.830> have<00:05:17.150> especially<00:05:18.150> when<00:05:18.570> you're

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
worth to have especially when you're
