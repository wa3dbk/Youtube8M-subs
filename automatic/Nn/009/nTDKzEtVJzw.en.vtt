 It's not to forget our old not 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.830
 pay attention at the check point only 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.830
 to give a stir here 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.580

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.580

 no light is out as the sultan it rises 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:26.530
 well, on the ground and overturned 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.530

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:40.549
 oddly enough there 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.750
 good 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.110
 because this here is one more trail is 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.000
 That's what had to be screwed with di 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.410
 I went with sports because it was the standard 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.800
 that was already right 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:01.239
 good dps should be that is ideal right 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.430
 above the guy who was going to be very 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.730
 complicated in by car speeds up a lot 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.750
 will accelerate a little more here 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.750
 ceded far from below 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.090
 I think the sport here is very good. 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:21.989

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.989

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.560
 the first one was close 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.020
 I thought it was further away there in the 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.540
 beginning and distanced harding 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:44.120
 We're arriving in Chile. Come on. Come on. 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:48.040
 To get to the end, do not waste it here. 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.040
 do not lose control of the car ensures 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.900
 that guy has been stranded here 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.070

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.729
