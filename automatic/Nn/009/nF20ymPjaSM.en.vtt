00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.500 
one thing about the druggies I noticed
is<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.380> are<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> pretty<00:00:50.280> tight<00:00:50.550> Bunch<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.270> are

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
is you are a pretty tight Bunch you are

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.990 
is you are a pretty tight Bunch you are
together<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:52.410> lot<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:53.489> under<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> lot

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
together a lot and you are under a lot

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.420 
together a lot and you are under a lot
of<00:00:54.239> pressure<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> go<00:00:55.020> through<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:56.190> I

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
of pressure and you go through what I

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.170 
of pressure and you go through what I
clearly<00:00:56.760> say<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> real<00:00:57.719> lot<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.500> emotion<00:00:59.180> we

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
clearly say is a real lot of emotion we

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.369 
clearly say is a real lot of emotion we
do<00:01:02.210> it's<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.510> them<00:01:03.600> sports<00:01:03.930> rates<00:01:04.199> but

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
do it's one of them sports rates but

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.510 
do it's one of them sports rates but
it's<00:01:04.470> probably<00:01:04.680> there's<00:01:05.009> a<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.399> bit<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
it's probably there's a little bit of

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.310 
it's probably there's a little bit of
danger<00:01:05.759> involved<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.630> you're<00:01:07.170> obviously

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
danger involved so that you're obviously

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.450 
danger involved so that you're obviously
very<00:01:07.530> close-knit<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.070> probably<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
very close-knit and it's probably one of

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.859 
very close-knit and it's probably one of
the<00:01:11.610> few<00:01:11.729> jobs<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.210> professions<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.720> do

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the few jobs and professions you do

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.859
