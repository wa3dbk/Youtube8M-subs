00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.760 

I<00:01:13.820> guess<00:01:14.570> it's<00:01:14.750> pretty<00:01:14.870> much<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.140> same<00:01:15.410> except

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
I guess it's pretty much the same except

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.290 
I guess it's pretty much the same except
for<00:01:15.890> its<00:01:15.980> black

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.080

and well if you got far in the campaign

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.970 
and well if you got far in the campaign
there's<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.450> mission<00:01:21.750> reach<00:01:21.930> out<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.590> choose<00:01:22.830> to
