Barcelona this year as you can see

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.929 
Barcelona this year as you can see
there's<00:00:19.050> some<00:00:19.260> wedges<00:00:19.769> around<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> defender

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
there's some wedges around the defender

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.400 
there's some wedges around the defender
who's<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.630> possession<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.140> ball<00:00:22.170> at<00:00:22.349> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
who's in possession of the ball at the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.410 
who's in possession of the ball at the
beginning<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.949> video<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.429> these<00:00:23.910> wedges

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
beginning of the video and these wedges

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.810 
beginning of the video and these wedges
is<00:00:25.380> what<00:00:25.590> we're<00:00:25.740> calling<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.189> vision<00:00:26.460> map<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
is what we're calling the vision map and

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.120 
is what we're calling the vision map and
is<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> concept<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.080> we've<00:00:28.259> created<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.949> try

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
is the concept that we've created to try

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.970 
is the concept that we've created to try
to<00:00:29.189> create<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.820> behavior<00:00:30.650> you<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.800> see<00:00:31.949> that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
to create this behavior you can see that

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.800 
to create this behavior you can see that
the<00:00:32.160> defenders<00:00:32.490> vision<00:00:32.790> map<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.210> very<00:00:33.540> big

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
the defenders vision map is not very big

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.740 
the defenders vision map is not very big
he<00:00:34.620> doesn't<00:00:34.830> have<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.980> lot<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.600> vision<00:00:36.600> behind

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
he doesn't have a lot of vision behind

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.770 
he doesn't have a lot of vision behind
him<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:38.030> he<00:00:39.030> doesn't<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:39.510> all<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
him and he doesn't see all the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.299 
him and he doesn't see all the
opportunities<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.289> are<00:00:40.530> presented<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:41.219> a

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
opportunities that are presented in a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.959 
opportunities that are presented in a
play<00:00:41.460> at<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.149> given<00:00:42.300> moment<00:00:43.039> but<00:00:44.039> now<00:00:44.219> when<00:00:44.850> we

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
play at a given moment but now when we

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.000 
play at a given moment but now when we
run<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.270> video<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.840> he<00:00:46.440> passes<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.829> ball<00:00:46.949> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
run the video and he passes the ball to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.380 
run the video and he passes the ball to
Fabregas<00:00:47.520> who<00:00:47.699> is<00:00:47.789> around<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> middle<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
Fabregas who is around the middle of the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.049 
Fabregas who is around the middle of the
field<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.989> he<00:00:49.680> gets<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:50.699> that<00:00:50.879> his

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
field as he gets it you can see that his

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.910 
field as he gets it you can see that his
vision<00:00:51.359> map<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.719> much<00:00:51.899> much<00:00:52.109> larger<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.710> this

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
vision map is much much larger and this

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.819 
vision map is much much larger and this
is<00:00:53.070> because<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.820> his<00:00:54.420> vision<00:00:54.750> attribute<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
is because of his vision attribute and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.439 
is because of his vision attribute and
now<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.100> vision<00:00:56.430> map<00:00:56.609> changes<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.269> a<00:00:57.329> variety

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
now this vision map changes in a variety

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.299 
now this vision map changes in a variety
of<00:00:57.719> things<00:00:58.019> the<00:00:58.620> opportunities<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.250> threats

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
of things the opportunities and threats

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.599 
of things the opportunities and threats
that<00:00:59.609> i<00:00:59.640> mentioned<00:01:00.120> affect<00:01:01.070> how<00:01:02.070> much<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that i mentioned affect how much the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.880 
that i mentioned affect how much the
vision<00:01:03.449> map<00:01:03.600> slows<00:01:03.870> down<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.410> it<00:01:04.530> hits<00:01:04.710> that

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
vision map slows down as it hits that

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.179 
vision map slows down as it hits that
player<00:01:05.450> it<00:01:06.450> also<00:01:06.660> division<00:01:07.560> attribute<00:01:08.009> also

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
player it also division attribute also

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.789 
player it also division attribute also
affects<00:01:08.460> how<00:01:08.640> how<00:01:09.090> big<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.080> vision<00:01:10.320> map<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.590> in

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
affects how how big the vision map is in

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.090 
affects how how big the vision map is in
general<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:12.090> terms<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.920> angle<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.040> he

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
general in terms of the angle that he

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.070 
general in terms of the angle that he
can<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.850> terms<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> how<00:01:15.630> much<00:01:15.900> he

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
can see in terms of how much he

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.300 
can see in terms of how much he
remembers<00:01:16.530> after<00:01:16.830> seeing<00:01:17.100> an<00:01:17.220> opportunity

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
remembers after seeing an opportunity

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
remembers after seeing an opportunity
and<00:01:18.030> all<00:01:18.360> these<00:01:18.509> different<00:01:18.600> things<00:01:18.869> that

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and all these different things that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.050 
and all these different things that
create<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.470> very<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:19.770> sophisticated<00:01:20.280> system

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
create a very very sophisticated system

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.390 
create a very very sophisticated system
to<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:21.659> replicate<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.920> behavior<00:01:23.369> of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to really replicate the behavior of

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.910 
to really replicate the behavior of
players<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.850> Fabregas<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.450> shabby<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.860> you

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
players like Fabregas and shabby so you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.020 
players like Fabregas and shabby so you
can<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.130> when<00:01:26.250> probably<00:01:26.490> cos<00:01:26.610> gets<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
can see when probably cos gets it and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.690 
can see when probably cos gets it and
he's<00:01:27.180> turning<00:01:27.390> around<00:01:27.799> his<00:01:28.799> wedges<00:01:29.280> now

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
he's turning around his wedges now

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.219 
he's turning around his wedges now
already<00:01:30.060> covered<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> opportunity<00:01:31.110> that

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
already covered the opportunity that

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.810 
already covered the opportunity that
he's<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.860> capitalize<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.369> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
he's actually going to capitalize on and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.999 
he's actually going to capitalize on and
that<00:01:33.090> he<00:01:33.210> actually<00:01:33.360> did<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.799> real-life

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that he actually did in the real-life

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.069 
that he actually did in the real-life
example<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.619> this<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:38.070> pass<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.579> creates

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
example and this this pass then creates

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.450 
example and this this pass then creates
this<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.530> know<00:01:40.649> amazing<00:01:40.770> opportunity<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
this you know amazing opportunity to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.730 
this you know amazing opportunity to
score<00:01:42.470> now<00:01:43.470> when<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:43.860> run<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.750> test<00:01:45.750> again<00:01:45.930> by

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
score now when we run the test again by

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.219 
score now when we run the test again by
keeping<00:01:46.950> all<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> variables<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.360> same<00:01:48.659> but

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
keeping all the variables the same but

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.200 
keeping all the variables the same but
only<00:01:49.439> substituting<00:01:49.829> Fabregas<00:01:50.549> for<00:01:50.759> another

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
only substituting Fabregas for another

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.179 
only substituting Fabregas for another
player<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.229> case<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.530> jay<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.829> far<00:01:53.040> from

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
player in this case is jay is far from

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.550 
player in this case is jay is far from
manchester<00:01:53.640> united<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.719> see<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
manchester united you can see that the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620 
manchester united you can see that the
outcome<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.189> going<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.579> different<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
outcome is going to be different the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.330 
outcome is going to be different the
first<00:01:57.840> defender<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.320> same<00:01:58.590> his<00:01:59.009> wedges

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
first defender is the same his wedges

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.920 
first defender is the same his wedges
are<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> same<00:01:59.759> he<00:01:59.969> passes<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.360> park<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
are the same he passes it to park and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.889 
are the same he passes it to park and
you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.500> see<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.979> parks<00:02:02.759> vision<00:02:03.509> map<00:02:03.689> is

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you can see that parks vision map is

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.109 
you can see that parks vision map is
much<00:02:04.619> larger<00:02:04.829> than<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.159> defender<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.000> it's

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
much larger than the defender but it's

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.230 
much larger than the defender but it's
not<00:02:06.180> quite<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.689> big<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.229> an<00:02:08.160> encompassing<00:02:08.729> as

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
not quite as big as an encompassing as

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.290 
not quite as big as an encompassing as
Fabregas<00:02:10.310> because<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.460> this<00:02:11.550> as<00:02:11.820> he<00:02:12.000> turns

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
Fabregas because of this as he turns

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.290 
Fabregas because of this as he turns
he's<00:02:12.960> not

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
he's not

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.140 
he's not
yep<00:02:13.570> ready<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.500> make<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.100> pass<00:02:15.490> he<00:02:15.790> hasn't

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
yep ready to make that pass he hasn't

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.180 
yep ready to make that pass he hasn't
seen<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.600> opportunity<00:02:17.140> yet<00:02:17.350> up<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.920> field

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
seen that opportunity yet up the field

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.010 
seen that opportunity yet up the field
so<00:02:18.730> he's<00:02:18.940> still<00:02:19.060> considering<00:02:19.540> other<00:02:19.660> things

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
so he's still considering other things

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.840 
so he's still considering other things
and<00:02:20.350> eventually<00:02:21.100> he<00:02:21.130> does<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.580> can<00:02:21.670> see<00:02:21.820> that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
and eventually he does you can see that

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.610 
and eventually he does you can see that
the<00:02:22.120> vision<00:02:22.390> map<00:02:22.540> eventually<00:02:22.810> gets<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.500> that

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
the vision map eventually gets to that

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.040 
the vision map eventually gets to that
place<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.130> field<00:02:24.400> but<00:02:25.030> now<00:02:25.630> it's<00:02:25.810> too<00:02:26.020> late

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
place of the field but now it's too late

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.440 
place of the field but now it's too late
he<00:02:26.530> takes<00:02:26.770> two<00:02:27.100> touches<00:02:27.370> on<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.670> ball<00:02:27.700> as<00:02:28.090> it

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
he takes two touches on the ball as it

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.030 
he takes two touches on the ball as it
takes<00:02:28.600> time<00:02:28.900> for<00:02:28.930> him<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.260> see<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.620> whole<00:02:29.860> play

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
takes time for him to see the whole play

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.190 
takes time for him to see the whole play
develop<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.730> when<00:02:31.090> he<00:02:31.180> plays<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.600> past<00:02:31.810> the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
develop and when he plays the past the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.540 
develop and when he plays the past the
defender<00:02:32.350> is<00:02:32.740> actually<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.130> one<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.310> ends

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
defender is actually the one that ends

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.190 
defender is actually the one that ends
up<00:02:33.640> with<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.910> ball<00:02:34.120> because<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.840> attacker

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
up with the ball because the attacker

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.280 
up with the ball because the attacker
has<00:02:35.440> now<00:02:35.560> given<00:02:35.710> up<00:02:35.980> on<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.960> as<00:02:37.960> you<00:02:38.170> can

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
has now given up on it and as you can

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.650 
has now given up on it and as you can
see<00:02:38.320> it's<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.710> subtle<00:02:39.070> difference<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:40.360> it

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
see it's a subtle difference but it

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.630 
see it's a subtle difference but it
makes<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.680> world<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:42.100> difference<00:02:42.160> when<00:02:42.610> it

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
makes a world of difference when it

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.490 
makes a world of difference when it
comes<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.480> outcome<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.990> play<00:02:44.020> and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
comes to the outcome of a play and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.840 
comes to the outcome of a play and
that's<00:02:44.920> where<00:02:45.010> we're<00:02:45.100> going<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.280> have<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.700> this

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
that's where we're going to have in this

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.360 
that's where we're going to have in this
year's<00:02:46.120> game
