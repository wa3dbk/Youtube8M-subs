ool cases number 43 40 and 39 in that
order

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.710 

alright<00:00:28.920> guys<00:00:29.100> so<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.730> last<00:00:29.910> episode<00:00:30.450> I

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
alright guys so in the last episode I

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.229 
alright guys so in the last episode I
told<00:00:31.200> you<00:00:31.350> that<00:00:31.470> today's<00:00:31.770> algorithms<00:00:32.610> might

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
told you that today's algorithms might

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.150 
told you that today's algorithms might
contain<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> few<00:00:33.900> moves<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.710> would<00:00:34.860> make<00:00:35.040> you

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
contain a few moves that would make you

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.190 
contain a few moves that would make you
use<00:00:35.370> your<00:00:35.520> left<00:00:35.730> hand<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.330> with<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:36.989> mind

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
use your left hand and with that in mind

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.530 
use your left hand and with that in mind
we're<00:00:37.800> gonna<00:00:37.950> start<00:00:38.280> off<00:00:38.489> with<00:00:38.820> o<00:00:38.940> ll<00:00:39.239> number

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
we're gonna start off with o ll number

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.320 
we're gonna start off with o ll number
43<00:00:40.110> now<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.920> don't<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.340> name<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.059> case

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
43 now I don't have a name for this case

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.080 
43 now I don't have a name for this case
but<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.290> know<00:00:43.590> its<00:00:43.770> shape<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.280> let's<00:00:44.940> get

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
but I do know its shape and let's get

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.570 
but I do know its shape and let's get
familiar<00:00:45.449> with<00:00:45.540> it<00:00:45.920> what<00:00:46.920> you're<00:00:47.040> looking<00:00:47.340> for

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
familiar with it what you're looking for

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.250 
familiar with it what you're looking for
is<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.629> B<00:00:49.199> shape<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.430> left<00:00:50.670> hand<00:00:50.940> side

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
is this B shape on the left hand side

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
is this B shape on the left hand side
this<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.320> actually<00:00:52.830> easy<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.910> confused

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
this is actually easy to get confused

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
this is actually easy to get confused
with<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> Oh<00:00:54.960> L<00:00:55.379> number<00:00:55.650> 44<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.460> covered

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
with the Oh L number 44 that we covered

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.600 
with the Oh L number 44 that we covered
in<00:00:57.000> last<00:00:57.199> episode<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.160> way<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.340> tell

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
in last episode but the way you tell

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.880 
in last episode but the way you tell
them<00:00:59.730> apart<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> yellow<00:01:01.350> bar<00:01:01.680> on

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
them apart is you have the yellow bar on

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.299 
them apart is you have the yellow bar on
the<00:01:02.010> right<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:03.050> you<00:01:04.050> have<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.229> B<00:01:04.589> shape<00:01:04.949> here

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the right and you have the B shape here

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.510 
the right and you have the B shape here
instead<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> P<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.800> look<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.280> B

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
instead of the P so you look for the B

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.510 
instead of the P so you look for the B
shape<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> left<00:01:09.420> side<00:01:09.660> and<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:11.190> yellow

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
shape on the left side and the yellow

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.600 
shape on the left side and the yellow
bar<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> right<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:13.190> then<00:01:14.190> you<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.430> this

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
bar on the right and then you do this

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.810 
bar on the right and then you do this
following<00:01:14.970> algorithm<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.920> F<00:01:16.920> Prime<00:01:17.310> with

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
following algorithm and F Prime with

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.740 
following algorithm and F Prime with
your<00:01:17.970> left<00:01:18.180> hand<00:01:19.100> then<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.729> sexy<00:01:21.539> move

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
your left hand then you do a sexy move

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.410 
your left hand then you do a sexy move
but<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.289> left<00:01:22.320> hand<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.160> it's<00:01:23.789> L<00:01:24.060> prime

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
but with your left hand so it's L prime

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.450 
but with your left hand so it's L prime
u<00:01:25.410> prime<00:01:25.460> L<00:01:26.630> u<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.500> under<00:01:28.979> your<00:01:29.100> setup

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
u prime L u then you under your setup

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.050 
u prime L u then you under your setup
move<00:01:29.720> with<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> small<00:01:31.080> F<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.760> then<00:01:32.760> your<00:01:32.880> layers

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
move with a small F and then your layers

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.270 
move with a small F and then your layers
oriented<00:01:33.780> now<00:01:34.260> I'm<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.619> best<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:35.100> my

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
oriented now I'm not the best with my

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.310 
oriented now I'm not the best with my
left<00:01:35.520> hand<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.510> can<00:01:36.659> get<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.900> done<00:01:37.020> quicker

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
left hand but I can get it done quicker

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.249 
left hand but I can get it done quicker
than<00:01:37.560> doing<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.040> look<00:01:38.280> case<00:01:41.330> ok<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.960> next

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
than doing the to look case ok the next

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.510 
than doing the to look case ok the next
two<00:01:43.409> algorithms<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.009> I'm<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> cover

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
two algorithms that I'm going to cover

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.850 
two algorithms that I'm going to cover
are<00:01:44.790> actually<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> pair<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.869> they're<00:01:46.439> mirrors

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
are actually a pair and they're mirrors

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.190 
are actually a pair and they're mirrors
of<00:01:47.070> each<00:01:47.189> other<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.750> called<00:01:48.930> anti

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
of each other this one is called anti

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.580 
of each other this one is called anti
Fung<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.159> few<00:01:50.670> ng<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:52.140> second<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.500> I'm

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
Fung a few ng and the second one I'm

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.219 
Fung a few ng and the second one I'm
gonna<00:01:52.740> cover<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.250> called<00:01:53.490> Fung<00:01:53.850> now<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> think

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
gonna cover is called Fung now I think

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.050 
gonna cover is called Fung now I think
those<00:01:55.380> names<00:01:55.650> should<00:01:55.860> be<00:01:55.920> reversed<00:01:56.460> but

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
those names should be reversed but

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.620 
those names should be reversed but
that's<00:01:57.270> because<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.810> prefer<00:01:58.229> my<00:01:58.380> right<00:01:58.619> hand

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
that's because I prefer my right hand

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.420 
that's because I prefer my right hand
anti-fog<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.900> a<00:02:01.350> lot<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.710> right<00:02:01.920> hand<00:02:02.189> moves

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
anti-fog is a lot of right hand moves

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.210 
anti-fog is a lot of right hand moves
where<00:02:03.090> Fung<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.750> left<00:02:04.439> hand<00:02:04.680> moves<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
where Fung is left hand moves and

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.039 
where Fung is left hand moves and
they're<00:02:05.430> exact<00:02:05.790> mirrors<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.390> each<00:02:06.540> other<00:02:06.780> so

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
they're exact mirrors of each other so

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.680 
they're exact mirrors of each other so
let's<00:02:07.799> go<00:02:07.950> over<00:02:08.130> anti-fun

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
let's go over anti-fun

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.199 
let's go over anti-fun
now<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.440> way<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.709> recognize<00:02:11.430> o<00:02:11.640> ll<00:02:11.940> number

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
now the way I recognize o ll number

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.370 
now the way I recognize o ll number
forty<00:02:12.570> or<00:02:12.780> anti<00:02:13.200> Fung<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:14.430> see<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.940> shape

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
forty or anti Fung is I see this shape

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.039 
forty or anti Fung is I see this shape
oriented<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.739> top<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.190> cube<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:18.049> then

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
oriented on the top of the cube and then

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.860 
oriented on the top of the cube and then
on<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.470> back<00:02:19.680> there<00:02:20.489> are<00:02:20.670> two<00:02:20.880> pieces<00:02:21.120> facing

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
on the back there are two pieces facing

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.220 
on the back there are two pieces facing
away<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.910> trick<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.600> distinguishing

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
away so a trick to distinguishing

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.819 
away so a trick to distinguishing
between<00:02:25.370> anti-fun<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:27.360> when<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.440> have<00:02:28.650> these

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
between anti-fun is when you have these

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.680 
between anti-fun is when you have these
two<00:02:29.130> pieces<00:02:29.400> on<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> back<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.239> your<00:02:30.329> cube

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
two pieces on the back of your cube

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.199 
two pieces on the back of your cube
whichever<00:02:31.680> side<00:02:32.010> they're<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.310> that's<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
whichever side they're on that's the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.390 
whichever side they're on that's the
hand<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.660> start<00:02:33.930> with<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.099> case

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
hand that you start with so in this case

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.940 
hand that you start with so in this case
you're<00:02:36.239> going<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.390> be<00:02:36.510> using<00:02:36.660> your<00:02:36.930> right<00:02:37.200> hand

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
you're going to be using your right hand

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.190 
you're going to be using your right hand
and<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.940> algorithm<00:02:39.440> our<00:02:40.440> prime<00:02:40.830> F

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
and this is the algorithm our prime F

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.640 
and this is the algorithm our prime F
then<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.319> do<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> sexy<00:02:43.890> move<00:02:44.099> R<00:02:44.489> u<00:02:45.300> R<00:02:45.870> prime<00:02:46.230> u

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
then you do the sexy move R u R prime u

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.400 
then you do the sexy move R u R prime u
prime<00:02:47.150> then<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.300> do<00:02:48.480> F<00:02:48.810> prime<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:50.430> are<00:02:51.410> and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
prime then you do F prime you are and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.160 
prime then you do F prime you are and
that<00:02:52.560> will<00:02:52.709> orient<00:02:53.040> your<00:02:53.190> lair<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.900> I'm<00:02:54.900> just

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
that will orient your lair and I'm just

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.229 
that will orient your lair and I'm just
learning<00:02:55.380> these<00:02:55.709> but<00:02:56.610> here's<00:02:56.849> how<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.060> executed

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.759 

okay<00:03:03.239> in<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.750> last<00:03:03.959> case<00:03:04.200> I'm<00:03:04.380> going<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.560> cover

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
okay in the last case I'm going to cover

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.979 
okay in the last case I'm going to cover
today<00:03:05.099> is<00:03:05.280> Olo<00:03:05.819> number<00:03:06.150> 39

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
today is Olo number 39

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.130 
today is Olo number 39
it's<00:03:07.349> called<00:03:07.650> Fung<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:09.330> way<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.510> recognize

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
it's called Fung the way I recognize

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.289 
it's called Fung the way I recognize
this<00:03:10.440> case<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:11.250> very<00:03:11.370> similar<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.209> the

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
this case it's very similar to the

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.809 
this case it's very similar to the
previous<00:03:12.510> one<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:13.680> look<00:03:13.860> for<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.190> shape<00:03:14.519> on

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
previous one you look for this shape on

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.220 
previous one you look for this shape on
the<00:03:15.090> top<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:18.090> look<00:03:18.239> for<00:03:18.420> two<00:03:18.569> oriented

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
the top and you look for two oriented

the top and you look for two oriented
pieces<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.099> back<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.610> in<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.510> case

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
pieces in the back and in this case

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.289 
pieces in the back and in this case
they're<00:03:22.620> on<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.860> left<00:03:23.069> side<00:03:23.310> letting<00:03:24.090> you

now<00:03:46.739> I'm<00:03:46.980> very<00:03:47.400> slow<00:03:47.700> this<00:03:47.910> algorithm<00:03:48.450> because

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
now I'm very slow this algorithm because

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.960 
now I'm very slow this algorithm because
I'm<00:03:48.810> not<00:03:48.989> good<00:03:49.230> with<00:03:49.260> my<00:03:49.410> left<00:03:49.680> hand<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.340> I've

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
I'm not good with my left hand and I've

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.759 
I'm not good with my left hand and I've
just<00:03:51.150> learned<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.690> but<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.590> how<00:03:52.739> I

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
just learned it but this is how I

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:59.650 
just learned it but this is how I
execute<00:03:53.430> it

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.060 

just<00:04:00.660> remember<00:04:01.110> with<00:04:01.290> both<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.680> these<00:04:01.770> cases

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
just remember with both of these cases

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.850 
just remember with both of these cases
you<00:04:02.790> start<00:04:03.180> out<00:04:03.330> with<00:04:03.540> whatever<00:04:03.810> hand<00:04:04.320> the

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
you start out with whatever hand the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.190 
you start out with whatever hand the
block<00:04:05.100> side<00:04:05.400> is<00:04:05.610> on<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:06.420> this<00:04:06.720> one<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.050> would<00:04:07.140> be

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
block side is on so this one it would be

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.500 
block side is on so this one it would be
right<00:04:07.530> hand<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:08.370> pull<00:04:08.640> forward<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.270> push

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
right hand you pull forward and push

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.810 
right hand you pull forward and push
down<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.990> start<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.410> off<00:04:10.560> then<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.580> do<00:04:11.700> the

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
down to start it off then you do the

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.009 
down to start it off then you do the
sexy<00:04:12.210> move<00:04:12.420> then<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.410> do<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.860> bring<00:04:14.130> this<00:04:14.310> up

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
sexy move then you do you bring this up

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.970 
sexy move then you do you bring this up
twist<00:04:16.019> it<00:04:16.170> around<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.739> push<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.400> up<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:18.980> it's

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
twist it around and push it up and it's

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.350 
twist it around and push it up and it's
the<00:04:20.130> same<00:04:20.370> with<00:04:20.610> the<00:04:20.730> left<00:04:20.880> handed<00:04:21.239> version

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
the same with the left handed version

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.950 
the same with the left handed version
you<00:04:22.290> see<00:04:22.320> what<00:04:22.710> side<00:04:22.950> your<00:04:23.160> blocks<00:04:23.430> on<00:04:23.960> you

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
you see what side your blocks on you

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.600 
you see what side your blocks on you
pull<00:04:25.230> forward<00:04:25.470> with<00:04:25.770> your<00:04:25.890> left<00:04:26.070> hand<00:04:26.340> and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
pull forward with your left hand and

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.380 
pull forward with your left hand and
push<00:04:27.030> down<00:04:27.620> then<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.770> do<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:29.070> sexy<00:04:29.460> move<00:04:29.730> or

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
push down then you do the sexy move or

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.660 
push down then you do the sexy move or
Lexi<00:04:30.840> move<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.170> guess<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:32.460> push<00:04:32.730> this<00:04:32.970> bar<00:04:33.300> up

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
Lexi move I guess you push this bar up

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.320 
Lexi move I guess you push this bar up
you<00:04:35.670> straighten<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.410> and<00:04:37.410> bring<00:04:37.650> this<00:04:37.800> up<00:04:38.330> and

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
you straighten it and bring this up and
