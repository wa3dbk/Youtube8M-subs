00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hi i am seven new muscle macher 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.130
 Today it is still about the question how 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.810
 I actually get a very special one 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.799
 nice six pack for the summer 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.599
 how do you actually get that 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.830
 Finishing touch what the abdominal muscles are concerned 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.360
 particularly well out 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.130
 one always assumes that the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.839
 sixpack a lot with training too 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.730
 do is that it is exactly what the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.279
 Advertising always makes you there and there 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.020
 which electro-stimulation belt or in 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.060
 which roll you over the belly 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.410
 rolled over and the brazenest thing I did 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.359
 so far that's how it works 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.070
 you look at the abdomen 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.869
 So almost applies to the abdomen 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.000
 and this goal should ensure that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.230
 the fat cells under the skin somehow 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.090
 be dissolved and then be immediately 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.920
 of course, all complete bullshit 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.510
 the hessian sixpack has in the first 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.129
 line what to do with the diet so 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.050
 by having a very small one 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.940
 body fat percentage has become the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.170
 abdominal muscles visible 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.700
 I have a very nice one 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.500
 expect that is wrong that is 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.820
 unique and my girlfriend finds it 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.640
 wonderful I mean I just have 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.410
 Genetic just take my one 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.449
 tendency and that's what happens 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.100
 that I have a very wide also trained 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.960
 have it amy you can already see without 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.760
 that someday I'll pump in my stomach 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.650
 I have a very wide mouth 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.060
 have diversified abdominal muscles 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.979
 of course one always asks oneself 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.360
 just what the side and straight 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.490
 how can I take care of the weeks 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.750
 Exercise and exercise a whole 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.700
 especially beautiful aesthetic 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.130
 to make belly training are here 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.479
 clear that means with this device 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.530
 You can do this simple device 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.750
 very good the weeks musculature 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.009
 Just train the important ones 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.080
 I'm underarming on the upholstery here 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.759
 take off and ensure that in 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.540
 Elbow joint about one right 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.520
 angle arises 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.369
 that is how you lay down then 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.409
 Do you drive your legs right here 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.540
 angle in the knee with the back 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.170
 completely on the cushion 3 and exactly 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.770
 this position you now lift yours 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.770
 Schinkel 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.040
 By putting my legs down here 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.479
 have sold for the very good 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 I have all the possibilities 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.509
 To maintain a particularly good body tension 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.490
 if i just legs now 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.720
 I would have left next to each other 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.790
 then the problem is that this 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.649
 Merck is just losing his temper 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.630
 I agree about a bit 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.140
 more difficult because of that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.479
 legs 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.830
 ver cross the tension and with 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.640
 the backwind of the entire movement 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.830
 To run 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.030
 and a bit more 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.259
 you can make the legs more difficult 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.180
 I also advise you to do that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.769
 just block it like this 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.540
 to start at both angles as 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.819
 thus for a right angle in the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.980
 Knee-throat optimal for the movement only 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.049
 sometimes concentrated to fill without 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.209
 the back of the back pad loosens 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.130
 without you starting to pull off 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.720
 is a beautiful exercise in the 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.890
 whole body is under tension 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.870
 means you work with the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.060
 body tension and concentrated that 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.010
 whole in the abdominal area straight 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.870
 the lower abdomen area so the 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.610
 In the lower weeks muscles become whole 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.640
 particularly stressed so exactly 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.040
 there you notice the center of the burden 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.799
 Overall, it is the week just now 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.829
 Musculature being also through light 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.609
 also exercise the lateral training 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.209
 there are different ones 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.799
 possibilities 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.480
 He just sees me with his knee 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.220
 against dollars there are still 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.840
 I could do different variations 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.370
 show you for example next video 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.410
 if you want to see it all, but 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.350
 Please do not let it persuade you that 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.120
 any deals any devices 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.489
 any electrostimulation skrtel 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.410
 where you sit on the couch cola 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.700
 juice and chips eat and then sixpack 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.049
 Gets the best the next morning 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.090
 we'll meet again next 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.090
 Many greetings from your simon
