00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.719
 number 3 we have up to the group of the 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.219

 has raised more 2 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.710
 more per minute and the mega evolves 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.480
 but without hesitation the trick goes for another

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.659
 danger now that they have their attack 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.340
 elevated to plus 3 unfortunately it's not what 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.990

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.660
 giving a free turn I like to do 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.489
 barrier raising its defense to kill 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.340

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.110

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.210
 although they know that they received hidden power 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.680
 and ice of that mega man x but it will not be 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.240
 enough to eliminate them 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.400
 there is a role of the commission and 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.200
 ends with the one-shot rival goes 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.850
 for dura since as a highway goal it has 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.720
 your special attack at least 2 will not make you 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.700
