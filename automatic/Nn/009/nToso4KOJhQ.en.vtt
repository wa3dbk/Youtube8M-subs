00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.480
 earlier 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.820
 why has history in the world 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.910
 Why are not the ladder books 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.560
 in which someone pretends to be the demetris 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.240
 I don't have one and I started there 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.980
 I thought that myself all the time 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.250
 against dimitri 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.070

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.040

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.140
 hans please say yes in that hand that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.960
 suddenly says 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.699
 this role is for me a man 74 dvd 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.010
 katie 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:02.219
 that his wife was so tired of you can that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.510
 suddenly got the idea that it was whole 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:12.390
 slow demented law and one day looks 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:15.240
 around and see a woman he 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.560
 recognizes and that is all of them all 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.490
 first major 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.350
 greatest love rosa 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.560
 that you have ever asked and dance and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.180
 who was very young and asked after the dance 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.040
 they go outside for a moment and air you like 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.920
 start creating 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.020
 what is wonderful is the video that it 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.400
 Dimitri movies at the late come out 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.439
 has brought 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.229
 and in particular the end in which he 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.530
 Dimitri himself conceals at the piano 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:49.350
 plays 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.350
 the ticket 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.700
 how 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.030
 my channels removed 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.030
 the and 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.619
 now 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.689
 and then there is something very universal like 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.639
 a big theme and that's how you care 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:29.180
 make sure that when you grow old you don't have any 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:30.349
 sorry have and it's actually now that you 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.560
 get that done 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.689
 because our desiree met his real one 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.540
 love wit is now about the big one 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.739

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.419
 knight 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.639
 that's not about it is about that 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:47.090

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:48.079
 say to haters we will have another 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.810

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.639
 I'm sorry he didn't try and 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.699
 those are the things we want 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:59.030
 very happy to learn first 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:03:02.030
 dimitri masks and dvd 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.239
 and that we then jointly 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.739
 so with you and then few attempts were and 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.629
 that they are just a theater then you see such 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.150
 story and you think it happens to me 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.739

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.199

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:22.819
