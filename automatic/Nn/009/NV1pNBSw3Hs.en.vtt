00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.260
 i 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.060
 do not 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.190
 how about how are we and good 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.800
 we are climbing with the previous 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.100
 of this engine that is given notebooks or 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.720
 weapons or whatever you want to call it the link is 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.210
 I leave you in the description as always 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.309
 be more fun I david well the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.960
 that by the way is crazy it is not 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.710
 he's great that he knows he shows 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.300
 much the madness sofía and is great and he 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.700
 I have also had a recommendation 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.690
 among other bikes there are like others 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.360
 friends 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.040
 I currently have so the link in 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.940
 the description so let's process 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.130
 right now by the varió 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.579
 are more closely 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:22.890
 I know if more than 50 weapons have 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:26.850
 this way you can count on that as 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.130
 always the currently are more than 50 is 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.909
 more it happens seriously he approved every 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.460
 a 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.409
 just that if you have it on servers and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.600
 they lend weapons 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.909
 but now fine if you're in creative 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.499
 because they are practically infinite 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.159
 data are being these are the 

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:47.880
 refills has a parachute that is 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.530
 great the racing kit that if you're 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.740
 this year with something or someone hurts you 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.770
 it cures you simply 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.220
 once 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.810
 this over here 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.540
 and let's try some I will not approve 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.850
 all because it 's crazy 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.799
 it also brings you a teacher of a 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.270
 of luggage that has been this 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.580
 crystal on the likewise 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.010
 and wonder what can dominate the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.440
 wolf get in sun saw the clear that yes 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.280
 in fact you can have the coffee growers 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.910
 here 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.730
 This is the one of ex looks info 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.450
 It is still the information about each 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.370
 weapon that has been each 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.730
 this is the cannon that we are going to prove it 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.730
 because here 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.810
 and I'm going to give this 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.940
 flowers 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.130
 the here 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.890
 is the information what is good to touch and 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.890
 gives information about the mode or something 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.650
 I'm going to configure the buttons or the 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.450
 when you have each weapon, it seems like a 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.260
 button to shoot and all put 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.540
 appear there 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.280
 active on craft eos stress for 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.079
 heal you if you hurt yourself and 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.209
 theologically I can not you there's no 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.860
 no way close 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.129
 now we're going to see the postmen every 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.129
 one 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.120
 of each weapon and weapon so it can 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.080
 I 'll talk to you easily and mostly 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.700
 they use iron and here rest if not 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.090
 I'm wrong 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.340
 extreme scene grenade 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.019
 actually the amount is great so 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.420
 let's try for those that so 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.310
 that one of the things that I liked the most and 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.460
 I'm going to keep this arch 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.120
 more progressive because 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.860
 we put a lunge 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.440
 one of the things that I really want 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.360
 comment on the server the server if 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.940
 they want to know about the steps 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.629
 facebook because I will not be able to 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.540
 publish it publicly in the 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.069
 description now I'm going to put it 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.110
 publicly when I do a special 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.450
 well, it's not so special because 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.130
 we are almost a thousand people good thousand friends 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.580
 for me 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.770
 it's really crazy, thank you very much 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.590
 for supporting me world day and it is the 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.140
 noon when we reach 1000 the 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.140
 I'll post on Facebook and I'll pass them the 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.380
 server so they can all enter the 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:26.030
 server supports more than 15 or 20 or more 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.940
 something like that so it's nothing crazy 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.830
 so the server about rum is for 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.500
 facebook it can go while watching 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.710
 is opening it but the very day that 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.990
 we wish I am going to open it for all 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.820
 for all 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.060
 so we 've tested games that was 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.900
 what I liked the most and an effect that 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.250
 taste 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.250
 right now but yes no 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.300
 so it's crazy in education in 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.300
 motorcycle 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:05.220
 so that would be all the weapons 9 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.220
 try them all very many 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.860
 so the link in the description is 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.780
 progressive translated live com parts 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:16.770
 to install it is practically similar 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.920
 at the last time of the mozilla backpack as well 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.270
 that the description link and linares a 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.270
