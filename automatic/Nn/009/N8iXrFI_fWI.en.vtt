selling<00:01:33.090> price<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.900> that's<00:01:34.470> less

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
selling price for it and that's less

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.289 
selling price for it and that's less
than<00:01:34.979> another<00:01:35.159> battery<00:01:35.520> pack<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:35.939> my<00:01:36.030> drill

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
than another battery pack for my drill

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
than another battery pack for my drill
so<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.990> decided<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.380> give<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> shot<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.159> try

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
so I decided to give it a shot and try

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.359 
so I decided to give it a shot and try
what<00:01:38.700> when<00:01:38.880> these<00:01:39.000> low<00:01:39.180> impact<00:01:39.509> teens<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.930> do

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
what when these low impact teens can do

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.740 
what when these low impact teens can do
now<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.400> looked<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.030> market<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.460> other

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
now I looked on the market and for other

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.060 
now I looked on the market and for other
impact<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.869> was<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.380> recorded<00:01:46.890> I

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
impact I was like this that recorded I

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.359 
impact I was like this that recorded I
actually<00:01:47.700> found<00:01:48.090> two<00:01:48.860> it's<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.040> actually

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
actually found two it's this actually

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.039 
actually found two it's this actually
kind<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.610> rare<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> court<00:01:51.390> side<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.659> found<00:01:51.840> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
kind of rare on the court side I found a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.230 
kind of rare on the court side I found a
Makita<00:01:52.409> which<00:01:53.189> actually<00:01:53.610> has<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.060> slightly

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
Makita which actually has a slightly

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.109 
Makita which actually has a slightly
bigger<00:01:54.509> motor<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> much<00:01:55.320> larger<00:01:55.860> case<00:01:56.159> it's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
bigger motor but a much larger case it's

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.870 
bigger motor but a much larger case it's
much<00:01:57.240> longer<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.439> was<00:01:58.530> $200<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.729> we're

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
much longer and it was $200 so we're

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.330 
much longer and it was $200 so we're
talking<00:02:00.060> over<00:02:00.420> twice<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:00.899> much<00:02:01.049> now<00:02:01.409> I'm<00:02:02.159> sure

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
talking over twice as much now I'm sure

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.670 
talking over twice as much now I'm sure
this<00:02:02.460> isn't<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:03.000> professional-grade<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.380> so

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
this isn't as professional-grade but so

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.319 
this isn't as professional-grade but so
far<00:02:04.920> I've<00:02:05.219> been<00:02:05.250> doing<00:02:05.579> really<00:02:05.820> great<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.240> it

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
far I've been doing really great with it

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.270 
far I've been doing really great with it
on<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.540> deck<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.649> only<00:02:07.799> other<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.129> out

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
there was a craftsman was a little bitty

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.410 
there was a craftsman was a little bitty
3a<00:02:10.319> motor<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.790> way<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.000> looked<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.360> looked

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
3a motor and the way it looked it looked

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.130 
3a motor and the way it looked it looked

anyways<00:02:20.130> I'll<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> further<00:02:21.240> review<00:02:21.690> on

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
anyways I'll have a further review on

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.720 
anyways I'll have a further review on
this<00:02:21.990> after<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.319> use<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.560> more<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:22.920> for<00:02:23.610> those

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
this after you use it more but for those

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.160 
this after you use it more but for those
of<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:23.910> don't<00:02:24.000> know<00:02:24.090> much<00:02:24.270> about<00:02:24.300> them<00:02:24.690> they

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
of you don't know much about them they

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.510 
of you don't know much about them they
start<00:02:25.470> off<00:02:25.650> at<00:02:25.860> first<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.100> thought<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.430> thing

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
start off at first I thought this thing

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.920 
start off at first I thought this thing
was<00:02:26.640> supposed<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.940> be<00:02:27.030> really<00:02:27.480> slow<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.720> way

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
was supposed to be really slow the way

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.330 
was supposed to be really slow the way
people<00:02:28.170> talked<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.560> thought<00:02:28.709> man<00:02:28.980> I'm<00:02:29.100> almost

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
people talked I thought man I'm almost

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.670 
people talked I thought man I'm almost
just<00:02:29.490> stick<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.760> my<00:02:29.850> big<00:02:30.030> drills<00:02:30.360> because<00:02:31.200> I

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
just stick to my big drills because I

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.590 
just stick to my big drills because I
can't<00:02:31.890> spend<00:02:32.310> all<00:02:32.430> day<00:02:32.640> setting<00:02:33.150> these<00:02:33.270> screws

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
can't spend all day setting these screws

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.890 
can't spend all day setting these screws
but<00:02:34.440> actually<00:02:34.709> stepped<00:02:34.980> off<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.750> real<00:02:36.750> good

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
but actually stepped off a real good

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.620 
but actually stepped off a real good
speeds<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:37.770> drill<00:02:38.100> would<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.630> as

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
speeds just like a drill would and as

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.780 
speeds just like a drill would and as
soon<00:02:39.840> as<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.080> starts<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.470> torque<00:02:41.160> down<00:02:41.459> that's

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
soon as it starts to torque down that's

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.100 
soon as it starts to torque down that's
when<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:41.970> impact<00:02:42.270> kicks<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.930> see<00:02:46.080> that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
when the impact kicks in you see that

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.110 
when the impact kicks in you see that
wasn't<00:02:46.380> slow<00:02:46.680> at<00:02:46.860> all<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.340> was<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.850> three

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
wasn't slow at all and that was a three

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.000 
wasn't slow at all and that was a three
inch<00:02:48.239> deck<00:02:48.480> screws<00:02:48.510> going<00:02:49.110> into<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.320> six<00:02:49.620> by<00:02:49.739> six

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
inch deck screws going into a six by six

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.580 
inch deck screws going into a six by six
post<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.640> nice<00:02:51.630> thing<00:02:51.900> about<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.350> when<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
post and nice thing about it is when the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.620 
post and nice thing about it is when the
impact<00:02:52.920> starts<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:54.000> have<00:02:54.090> more<00:02:54.269> control<00:02:54.600> so

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
impact starts you have more control so

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.330 
impact starts you have more control so
when<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.870> let<00:02:55.080> off<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.380> trigger<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:56.250> know

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
when you let off the trigger you know

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.590 
when you let off the trigger you know
you<00:02:56.459> don't<00:02:56.580> have<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.910> drill<00:02:57.150> or<00:02:57.330> when<00:02:57.480> your

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
you don't have the drill or when your

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.690 
you don't have the drill or when your
kit<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.900> don't<00:02:57.930> have<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.320> drill<00:02:58.580> action<00:02:59.580> that

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
kit you don't have the drill action that

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.190 
kit you don't have the drill action that
normally<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.000> get<00:03:00.180> where<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.450> rips<00:03:01.050> your

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
normally you get where it rips your

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.370 
normally you get where it rips your
wrist<00:03:01.590> up<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:01.950> don't<00:03:02.040> get<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.400> anymore<00:03:02.580> and

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
wrist up you don't get that anymore and

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.080 
wrist up you don't get that anymore and
far<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.560> stripping<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.160> heads<00:03:05.370> outs<00:03:05.640> on<00:03:05.940> your

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
far is stripping the heads outs on your

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.600 
far is stripping the heads outs on your
bit<00:03:06.269> or<00:03:06.480> on<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.810> screw<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.380> final<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:08.370> that

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
bit or on the screw a final so that

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.949 
bit or on the screw a final so that
almost<00:03:08.730> doesn't<00:03:09.060> happen<00:03:09.300> all<00:03:09.600> either<00:03:09.810> on
