I I might even have to be able to use a

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.240 
I I might even have to be able to use a
bigger<00:05:29.050> jar<00:05:29.259> but<00:05:29.409> I'm<00:05:29.530> going<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.770> just<00:05:29.889> kind<00:05:30.159> of

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
bigger jar but I'm going to just kind of

and you want to use apple cider vinegar

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.420 
and you want to use apple cider vinegar
not<00:05:58.690> white<00:05:58.900> vinegar<00:05:59.169> apple<00:05:59.560> cider<00:05:59.710> vinegar<00:05:59.949> is

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
not white vinegar apple cider vinegar is

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.089 
not white vinegar apple cider vinegar is
more<00:06:00.699> of<00:06:00.820> a<00:06:00.940> kind<00:06:01.719> of<00:06:01.780> a<00:06:01.840> real<00:06:02.110> food<00:06:02.500> vinegar

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
and so because we're going to ingest

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.360 
and so because we're going to ingest
this<00:06:05.110> we<00:06:05.289> are<00:06:05.440> going<00:06:05.590> to<00:06:05.650> eat<00:06:05.680> it<00:06:05.919> so<00:06:06.039> we<00:06:06.190> use

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
this we are going to eat it so we use

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.110 
this we are going to eat it so we use
organic<00:06:07.360> apple<00:06:08.020> cider<00:06:08.050> vinegar<00:06:08.320> and<00:06:09.120> now

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
organic apple cider vinegar and now

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.330 
organic apple cider vinegar and now
because<00:06:10.690> it's<00:06:10.900> vinegar<00:06:11.349> if<00:06:11.979> you<00:06:12.130> have<00:06:12.310> a

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
because it's vinegar if you have a

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.670 
because it's vinegar if you have a
plastic<00:06:12.639> top<00:06:13.150> that's<00:06:13.479> fine<00:06:13.780> we<00:06:14.139> have<00:06:14.289> a<00:06:14.319> metal

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
plastic top that's fine we have a metal

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.100 
plastic top that's fine we have a metal
top<00:06:14.860> and<00:06:14.919> it<00:06:15.340> will<00:06:15.909> corrode<00:06:16.240> with<00:06:16.630> the<00:06:16.750> vinegar

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
top and it will corrode with the vinegar

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.629 
top and it will corrode with the vinegar
so<00:06:17.349> i<00:06:17.380> have<00:06:17.680> i'm<00:06:17.889> going<00:06:18.069> to<00:06:18.130> take<00:06:18.310> a<00:06:18.340> piece<00:06:18.580> of

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
so i have i'm going to take a piece of

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.570 
so i have i'm going to take a piece of
wax<00:06:18.909> paper<00:06:19.150> and<00:06:19.860> i'm<00:06:20.860> just<00:06:21.009> going<00:06:21.250> to<00:06:21.310> kind<00:06:21.520> of

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
wax paper and i'm just going to kind of

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
wax paper and i'm just going to kind of
cut<00:06:21.789> a<00:06:21.819> small<00:06:22.120> piece

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
cut a small piece

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:30.260 
cut a small piece
paper<00:06:23.760> and<00:06:26.160> and<00:06:27.160> just<00:06:27.610> put<00:06:27.820> that<00:06:27.850> between<00:06:28.620> the

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
paper and and just put that between the

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.000 
paper and and just put that between the
the<00:06:31.270> lid<00:06:31.480> you<00:06:31.780> know<00:06:31.900> underneath<00:06:32.260> the<00:06:32.500> lid<00:06:32.710> to

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
the lid you know underneath the lid to

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.680 
the lid you know underneath the lid to
protect<00:06:33.550> the<00:06:33.850> lid<00:06:34.030> from<00:06:34.240> getting<00:06:34.570> all

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
protect the lid from getting all

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.790 
protect the lid from getting all
corroded<00:06:35.820> center<00:06:36.820> that<00:06:37.000> a<00:06:37.030> little<00:06:37.330> better<00:06:37.800> so

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
corroded center that a little better so

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.060 
corroded center that a little better so
that'll<00:06:39.130> be<00:06:39.220> great<00:06:39.370> and<00:06:40.060> then<00:06:40.500> very<00:06:41.500> important

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
that'll be great and then very important

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.860 
that'll be great and then very important
to<00:06:42.220> label<00:06:42.640> it<00:06:42.760> because<00:06:43.330> even<00:06:43.600> if<00:06:43.720> you<00:06:43.840> think

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
to label it because even if you think

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.610 
to label it because even if you think
that<00:06:44.710> you'll<00:06:45.550> remember<00:06:45.990> it's<00:06:46.990> you<00:06:47.380> know<00:06:47.470> we're

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
that you'll remember it's you know we're

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.170 
that you'll remember it's you know we're
going<00:06:47.710> to<00:06:47.770> put<00:06:47.950> up<00:06:48.130> a<00:06:48.310> lot<00:06:48.490> of<00:06:48.610> vinegars<00:06:48.970> this

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
going to put up a lot of vinegars this

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.240 
going to put up a lot of vinegars this
year<00:06:49.450> and<00:06:49.720> you<00:06:50.020> know<00:06:50.140> it's<00:06:50.290> it's<00:06:50.710> obvious<00:06:51.220> to

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
year and you know it's it's obvious to

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.430 
year and you know it's it's obvious to
me<00:06:51.490> what's<00:06:51.670> in<00:06:51.820> there<00:06:51.970> now<00:06:52.150> but<00:06:52.510> after<00:06:52.900> a<00:06:53.290> while

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
me what's in there now but after a while

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.770 
me what's in there now but after a while
you<00:06:54.040> know<00:06:54.130> it<00:06:54.190> all<00:06:54.330> it'll<00:06:55.330> kind<00:06:55.540> of<00:06:55.630> look<00:06:55.750> a

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
you know it all it'll kind of look a

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.090 
you know it all it'll kind of look a
little<00:06:55.960> different<00:06:56.470> as<00:06:56.560> it<00:06:56.710> sits<00:06:56.890> in<00:06:57.010> the

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 
little different as it sits in the

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.040 
little different as it sits in the
vinegar<00:06:57.490> it's<00:06:57.880> just<00:06:58.060> a<00:06:58.180> good<00:06:58.330> idea<00:06:58.600> and<00:06:58.810> how<00:06:58.990> we

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050 
vinegar it's just a good idea and how we

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.740 
vinegar it's just a good idea and how we
label<00:06:59.320> it<00:06:59.680> is<00:06:59.860> we<00:07:00.460> write<00:07:00.700> the<00:07:01.000> herb<00:07:01.300> it's

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
label it is we write the herb it's

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.460 
label it is we write the herb it's
mugwort<00:07:03.030> rewrite<00:07:04.030> the<00:07:04.210> date<00:07:04.890> today<00:07:05.890> is<00:07:06.280> for

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
mugwort rewrite the date today is for

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.000 
mugwort rewrite the date today is for
1609<00:07:08.470> and<00:07:09.480> the<00:07:10.480> what<00:07:10.840> I<00:07:10.870> put<00:07:11.140> it<00:07:11.260> in<00:07:11.380> apple

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.010 
1609 and the what I put it in apple

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.590 
1609 and the what I put it in apple
cider<00:07:12.160> vinegar<00:07:13.020> apple<00:07:14.020> cider<00:07:14.260> vinegar<00:07:15.600> and

that's<00:07:16.750> kind<00:07:17.050> of<00:07:17.110> the<00:07:17.170> very<00:07:17.440> basic<00:07:18.010> that<00:07:18.280> we

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.430 
that's kind of the very basic that we

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.280 
that's kind of the very basic that we
need<00:07:18.610> sometimes<00:07:19.480> I<00:07:19.600> also<00:07:19.750> put<00:07:20.080> where<00:07:20.260> I

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.290 
need sometimes I also put where I

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.710 
need sometimes I also put where I
harvested<00:07:20.890> it<00:07:21.100> from<00:07:21.400> or<00:07:21.880> you<00:07:22.300> know<00:07:22.420> if<00:07:22.510> I<00:07:22.600> have

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 
harvested it from or you know if I have

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.150 
harvested it from or you know if I have
different<00:07:23.080> batches<00:07:23.260> or<00:07:23.650> anything<00:07:24.010> like<00:07:24.040> that

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 
different batches or anything like that

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.610 
different batches or anything like that
