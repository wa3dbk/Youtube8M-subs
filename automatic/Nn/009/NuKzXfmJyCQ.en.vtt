00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.830
 we will begin the press conference 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.830
 a casual sports technician the vineyard 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:20.170
 ceuta is that the first part of 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:28.410
 sports and two occasions at the end the 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:28.410
 point is 40 grams left over sorry 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.400
 when he got second maximum then 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.350
 is fine and especially when that final 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.240
 of match but of what a 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.150
 a little bit better 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.300
 but we will see the areas that we suffer not 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.300
 he 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.810
 we went wrong and 15 minutes more complicated 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.600
 intensity with little strength we went 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.850
 catching the rhythm of the game and 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.340
 we finished very well the last half of 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.980
 what we were to initiate in a way 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.180
 seemed like we broke down a bit 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.839
 people the tension is the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.839
 responsibility 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.170
 and sometimes the team gets confused 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.600
 because you have to keep doing things 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.640
 well having organization had the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.520
 order having great defensive ability 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.250
 of counterattack and it is not that everything seems 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.640
 the one a rout that at the moment 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.640
 it seems to me 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.090
 because because you have to put that you have to 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.710
 start the game obviously 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.320
 I think it was for us the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.630
 fact that in the team situation 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.189
 of sportive the after was was the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.530
 red-hot worried in the sense of 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.179
 descent I imagine that I already want to say 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.920
 for us therefore to maintain the 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.350
 result but it would be very important and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.490
 things can be different if 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.560
 we would have if we had 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.409
 got ahead was not like that and everything 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.310
 fell on the side of the Alava sports car because 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.069
 we also have the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.560
 responsibility to ascend and that 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.209
 they are little on muscle if not 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.660
 we were lost a little order not and 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:11.750
 I always dislike that 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.680
 good for the match with 6 all in 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.600
 sportive 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.819
 like to say get it 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.920
 it's not the time to be safe 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.440
 little bit more to the truth 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.350
 start trusting that when one has 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.030
 the ball that front sports outlet of 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.990
 the opposite is every vote in confidence of the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.200
 team lacks a little confidence 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.760
 it comes out a little fearful you know if you 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.320
 you keep a little and really place to do 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.400
 where 20 you do not do so much of cheers and that 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.960
 it shows, it is noticeable, I always say when 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.250
 attack island when you have the ball in 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.530
 the opposite goal to do it as 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.840
 always do with that thing things to 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.240
 times to that security that gives you to 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.580
 feel safe not good but little 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.250
 little followed we were earning a little bit of 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.690
 team was fine I think it should 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.680
 make a goal in the first half and the 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.680
 situation would have been different 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.770
 good in the media 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:18.470
 for great looks but not 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.470
 Y 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.550
 because it 's a special movie 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.730
 good to start when we are the party 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.769
 neither 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.599
 we had the idea of loss happening in 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.970
 rival field 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.190
 the pressure of our birds not started 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.310
 in excess and that was a bit the idea of 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.659
 rest we modified a little bit good 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.940
 we have just finished we end up long 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.410
 there is dry abandonment with the foot to a pass 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.099
 medium I was dating 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:59.060
 lateral or to the middle but without the speed 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:00.920
 nothing more but the team without looking for a 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.599
 long pass evidently even if you have 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.269
 found and who takes the second ball 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.390
 but it will be a lot with dehesa in that 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.390
 situation 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.970
 what a bloody point how to get 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.470
 later on an important one could want 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.970
 it is very important directly from help 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.860
 it seems that these birds but the 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.110
 changes have to be won and all 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.360
 division teams are able to 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.010
 win you are good teams and they are good 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.990
 prepared and trained as you have 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.270
 doubts like you therefore have to go 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.480
 little by little and win games in 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.760
 way next Saturday only the minimum 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.760
 we have another end against age 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.889
 If he did not know how to run, it's just wind 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.389
 rabbits but we got the end to 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.849
 us and tied the daring road 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:57.300
 in the end it hurts a little bit more but good 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:00.590
 analyzing the party itself of things that 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.590
 I did not like my match today 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.449
 then sometimes very far from other 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.150
 things about the time the card 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:18.120
 yellow clearly to meet the 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:22.830
 rival team does not whistle 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:26.300
 it's clearly age not stop good 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.300
 the line can not see it 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.360
 let's wait at another time be our 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.360
 favor 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:49.479
 and they inform me that he does not throw the ball 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.300
 out then you do not have to throw away the 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.680
 ball out because the AlavÃ©s does not throw it 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.479
 what I do not understand is why he throws it and 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.069
 they told me they told me not to 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.759
 They were pulling my equipment as much as I 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:03.090
 I said why at the end at the end 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.090
 we throw 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.310
 it has been seen that his eyes for me told me 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.320
 that's why it surprises 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.220
 the ball I have done here said back 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.220
 back history science 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.930
 if we start with a system that more or 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:30.250
 less dominates well 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:32.380
 very repeated by the team and all this 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.650
 they would study in general terms the 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.949
 team with a lot of quality but 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.880
 also since the data is a second 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:44.620
 time declared I do not know a little more 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.900
 In addition to seeing or I'm trying to get 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.900
 based on the exchange rate
