00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
saw instead of the usual Bethesda logo

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.970 
saw instead of the usual Bethesda logo
just<00:00:32.770> popping<00:00:33.129> up<00:00:33.250> and<00:00:33.370> in<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.640> word<00:00:34.059> Skyrim

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
just popping up and in the word Skyrim

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.350 
just popping up and in the word Skyrim
now<00:00:35.980> we<00:00:36.040> have<00:00:36.190> that<00:00:36.400> one<00:00:36.610> it's<00:00:36.940> from<00:00:37.150> the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
now we have that one it's from the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.570 
now we have that one it's from the
client<00:00:38.110> commercials<00:00:38.890> like<00:00:39.040> you<00:00:39.160> used<00:00:39.309> to<00:00:39.400> see

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
client commercials like you used to see

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.990 
client commercials like you used to see
before<00:00:40.090> skyman<00:00:40.600> was<00:00:40.690> released<00:00:40.989> um<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.670> think

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
before skyman was released um I think

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.490 
before skyman was released um I think
that<00:00:43.330> intro<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.629> way<00:00:43.839> cooler<00:00:44.110> than<00:00:44.229> the

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
that intro is way cooler than the

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.799 
that intro is way cooler than the
original<00:00:44.949> one<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:46.210> we<00:00:46.269> have<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.479> second

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
original one so we have the second

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.149 
original one so we have the second
