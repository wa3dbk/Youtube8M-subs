00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
internet that you can add but that's

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.280 
internet that you can add but that's
that's<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.099> basically<00:02:48.579> and<00:02:48.959> that's<00:02:49.959> kind<00:02:50.230> of

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
that's it basically and that's kind of

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.770 
that's it basically and that's kind of
what<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.650> but<00:02:50.860> if<00:02:51.209> because<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.420> don't<00:02:52.599> think

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
what it is but if because I don't think

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.940 
what it is but if because I don't think
there's<00:02:52.959> anything<00:02:53.200> else<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.650> you'd

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
you can get different screen resolutions

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.869 
you can get different screen resolutions
but<00:03:37.750> that's<00:03:38.169> basically<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:38.709> but<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.549> depends

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
but that's basically it but it depends

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.220 
but that's basically it but it depends
