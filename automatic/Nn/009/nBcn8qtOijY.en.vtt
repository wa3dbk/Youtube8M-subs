00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:16.560
 Sandrine, what's up, guys! 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.970
 I like bringing another video from the channel 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.330
 Whoa, it's been such a long time since I 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.580
 I can not a video our touch bringing 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.779
 a video with the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.880
 411 m vip predator whatever the name told 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:36.059
 American only power 11 hs on the side side 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.010
 no traces now then right to explain the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.420
 my absence first makes more or 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.230
 less crisis 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.150
 My weeks that I do not play cf that in the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.070
 if it was the time I'm not 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:53.730
 posting a video and basically this does not 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.860
 I do not know, but that method plays more 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.870
 sometimes a game from one part of another 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.330
 because of the load I already said I think 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.269
 I already said the video but I do not know there. 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.030
 How do you stop explaining why even 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:10.979
 with the game had a fast season 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.500
 but still on this plane 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.020
 I tried then that's why I'm already 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.090
 justifying why I 'm middle and in this 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.940
 video was too long I did not even play 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.799
 I do not know until I'm sure I'll be back. 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.689
 to play like this henrique should play when 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.790
 setting back and destroyed 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.230
 I do not need a time getting used to it. 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.950
 with that was the first match of the 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.540
 day 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.820
 I think this part I did until seven 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.659
 morning hours 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.300
 and I was sleepy eita 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.520
 then that's it then was the mother 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.010
 renowned person for the truth also know 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.680
 Who knows what detail in this damn thing does not 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.430
 recognize the goal is to let the 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.960
 marquinhos 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.060
 the company tells me to record with it 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.180
 only login will play with her know that the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.490
 only novelty that has to unfortunately 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.520
 is 8 when you released an update 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.290
 you just see what the black market or vip 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.830
 I saw there was not much of a problem 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.690
 because that image I bought more type 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.539
 for example has now launched these new 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.150
 gilded weapon and kind that I forgot the 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.450
 name cook golden business bullfight is not 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.820
 of gold foods and then the black market 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.190
 a trap for its shape of pio that 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.830
 everything I remember that was the style at 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.410
 kill 700 fucking time we could not launch 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.209
 something that gives a shot and kills not only will 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:32.180
 give to make a loot heat then it's just 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.760
 this is why both in cs also without 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.060
 grace and without explaining how bland 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.750
 because my routine was what it was 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:49.070
 place the stitches daily, right? 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:52.489
 then all or just a do not know whatever is just 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.769
 This is the type you use to do it. 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:59.660
 so much so that it gets boring gets annoying 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:02.120
 you 're not alone, just doing that amapÃ¡ 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.900
 because it was there the other ways that I played 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.950
 ghost mode, for example, already sang a 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.290
 year 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.140
 play very fanciful a nobody stayed 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.209
 a little in then already when a 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.819
 million motivating to play in beauty 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.040
 in confrontation of the team 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.840
 I get tired of playing is always the 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.260
 same thing the whole room that I enter is 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.440
 multi kill not wanting to find but I do not 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.300
 I see so much grace more played play 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.510
 against teams because a room has 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.549
 an attack when there is no here is your team 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.890
 field that the other team think you 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.780
 This is where it does not always happen with me. 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.870
 I confess that this is rare. 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.700
 With me but I'm just on my way to a year. 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.430
 so I got it because it was always 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.230
 when I carried anything on the channel and I said 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.260
 that he will shut up in front of me and I will do 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.630
 This I have to go back to play try 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.430
 of animals already of the mind as before but is 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.560
 That's when you liked the video of your 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.750
 book your favorite you are new to 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.880
 gum and sign up remember more 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.880
 I did it though, it worked out well
