00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
so this is the opening of our or at

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.850 
so this is the opening of our or at
California<00:00:08.550> level<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.530> this<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.710> all

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
California level and this is all

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.570 
California level and this is all
captured<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.490> game<00:00:11.849> we<00:00:12.840> use<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.860> as<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> movie<00:00:14.340> to

generation game the story here is that

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.980 
generation game the story here is that
Nathan<00:00:28.949> Hale<00:00:29.099> you're<00:00:29.429> seeing<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.840> his

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
Nathan Hale you're seeing is with his

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.420 
Nathan Hale you're seeing is with his
Sentinel<00:00:31.380> team<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.679> they're<00:00:31.769> chasing<00:00:32.219> one<00:00:32.340> of

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
Sentinel team and they're chasing one of

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.770 
Sentinel team and they're chasing one of
the<00:00:32.489> Chimera<00:00:32.850> battleships<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.660> they

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the Chimera battleships that they

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.870 
the Chimera battleships that they
damaged<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.440> Battle<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.920> San<00:00:35.280> Francisco

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
damaged in the Battle of San Francisco

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.090 
damaged in the Battle of San Francisco
so<00:00:36.690> they're<00:00:37.140> often<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.710> redwood<00:00:38.070> forest

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
so they're often to the redwood forest

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.220 
so they're often to the redwood forest
of<00:00:38.579> California<00:00:39.180> towards<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.600> lumber<00:00:40.020> town

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
of California towards this lumber town

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.920 
of California towards this lumber town
where<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> ship<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:42.059> something's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
where the ship is that but something's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.260 
where the ship is that but something's
gone<00:00:43.110> wrong<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.710> there<00:00:44.070> there's<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.820> blockage

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
gone wrong and there there's a blockage

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.090 
gone wrong and there there's a blockage
in<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.809> road<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.530> you're<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.920> kind

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
in the road and now you're going to kind

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.069 
in the road and now you're going to kind
of<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.309> what<00:00:47.520> happened<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.210> then<00:00:48.660> what<00:00:48.840> takes

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
of see what happened and then what takes

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.180 
of see what happened and then what takes
place<00:00:49.170> after<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.829> convoy<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.460> ambushed<00:00:55.190> it's

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
place after the convoy is ambushed it's

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.799 
place after the convoy is ambushed it's
also<00:00:56.340> really<00:00:56.699> nicely<00:00:56.969> shows<00:00:57.270> our<00:00:57.480> motion

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
also really nicely shows our motion

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.380 
also really nicely shows our motion
capture<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.829> use<00:00:59.370> motion<00:00:59.760> capture<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
capture we use motion capture for the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.060 
capture we use motion capture for the
first<00:01:00.570> time<00:01:00.750> an<00:01:00.930> insomniac<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:01.859> turned

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
first time an insomniac and it's turned

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.619 
first time an insomniac and it's turned
out<00:01:02.160> really<00:01:02.309> well<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.640> also<00:01:02.789> motion<00:01:03.270> captured

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
out really well we also motion captured

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.539 
out really well we also motion captured
the<00:01:03.719> camera<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.589> use<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> inner<00:01:04.949> sense<00:01:05.220> camera

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the camera we use the inner sense camera

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.340 
the camera we use the inner sense camera
which<00:01:05.670> allows<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.330> mocap<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> actors

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
which allows you to mocap the actors

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.870 
which allows you to mocap the actors
first<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.770> then<00:01:07.860> go<00:01:08.010> back<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> camera

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
first and then go back and do the camera

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.850 
first and then go back and do the camera
later<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.930> capture<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.409> performance

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
later so you can capture the performance

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.990 
later so you can capture the performance
from<00:01:10.950> tons<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.340> different<00:01:11.400> angles<00:01:11.820> it's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
from tons of different angles it's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:32.820 
from tons of different angles it's
really<00:01:12.240> nice

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.860 

so<00:01:33.460> we're<00:01:33.760> trying<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.120> keep<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.420> story<00:01:34.660> right

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
so we're trying to keep the story right

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.270 
so we're trying to keep the story right
in<00:01:35.050> Nathan<00:01:35.350> Hales<00:01:35.500> perspective<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.160> whole

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
in Nathan Hales perspective the whole

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.560 
in Nathan Hales perspective the whole
time<00:01:36.490> you're<00:01:36.640> all<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:36.910> cutscenes<00:01:37.210> are<00:01:37.390> always

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
time you're all the cutscenes are always

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.030 
time you're all the cutscenes are always
focusing<00:01:38.050> on<00:01:38.170> him<00:01:38.350> you<00:01:38.500> go<00:01:38.620> right<00:01:38.770> from<00:01:38.890> the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
focusing on him you go right from the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.370 
focusing on him you go right from the
cutscene<00:01:39.400> into<00:01:39.670> his<00:01:39.790> view<00:01:40.230> picking<00:01:41.230> up

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
cutscene into his view picking up

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.260 
cutscene into his view picking up
there's<00:01:41.650> all<00:01:41.770> this<00:01:41.890> smoke<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.610> fog<00:01:42.940> and

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
there's all this smoke and fog and

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.080 
there's all this smoke and fog and
debris

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.120 

so<00:01:51.689> Billy's<00:01:51.990> using<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.350> marksman<00:01:52.799> right<00:01:52.979> now

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
so Billy's using the marksman right now

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.169 
so Billy's using the marksman right now
and<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> marksman<00:01:53.789> is<00:01:53.850> kind<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.060> our

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
and the marksman is kind of our

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.419 
and the marksman is kind of our
mid-range<00:01:54.539> battle<00:01:55.049> rifle<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.920> really<00:01:56.189> great

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
mid-range battle rifle it's really great

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.310 
mid-range battle rifle it's really great
because<00:01:56.640> its<00:01:57.030> scope<00:01:57.270> fires<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.810> three-shot

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
because its scope fires a three-shot

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.529 
because its scope fires a three-shot
burst<00:01:58.679> it<00:01:59.280> also<00:01:59.399> has<00:01:59.670> an<00:01:59.819> awesome<00:01:59.969> all<00:02:00.299> fire

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
burst it also has an awesome all fire

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.480 
burst it also has an awesome all fire
where<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.869> fire<00:02:01.049> out<00:02:01.289> electrostatic<00:02:02.100> orbs

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
where I can fire out electrostatic orbs

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.779 
where I can fire out electrostatic orbs
that<00:02:02.609> are<00:02:02.759> kind<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.119> automated<00:02:03.810> turrets

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
that are kind of like automated turrets

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.270 
that are kind of like automated turrets
and<00:02:05.810> do<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> lot<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.079> damage<00:02:07.380> great<00:02:08.099> for

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and do a lot of damage great for

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
another example of the gore can also see

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.360 
another example of the gore can also see
our<00:03:32.660> new<00:03:32.750> water<00:03:32.990> technology<00:03:33.680> all<00:03:34.130> these

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
our new water technology all these

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.310 
our new water technology all these
soldiers<00:03:34.610> are<00:03:34.790> leaving<00:03:35.150> ripples<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:36.020> see<00:03:36.170> the

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
soldiers are leaving ripples and see the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.680 
soldiers are leaving ripples and see the
splash<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:36.920> leave<00:03:37.070> awake<00:03:37.400> as<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.760> go<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.630> if

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
splash you leave awake as you go so if
