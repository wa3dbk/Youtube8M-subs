 Unread paper 1 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:11.639
 It is a fan that is not 2 pieces 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.490
 It is money that an entrusted country guarantees value 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.490
 I see by using anyway throat in the next trade 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.679
 Certainly in the poetry alley 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.630
 Various effects are the number of dialects 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:29.870
 It has been changed to a furniture product special product 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.800
 The power lent me banks and banks 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:37.719
 But if you notice Balvat's economy is funny 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.719
 It became completely dependent 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:46.910
 But there was a threat Anan we did not notice 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.850
 It takes Ricco is to rent a fan 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.900
 However 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.620
 The value fluctuates in detail 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:01:00.280
 The biggest thing until yesterday suddenly becomes a fan 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.140
 That maybe our country will put a big damage 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.199
 Legislators just like silver coins 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.400
 But the bill is different 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.320
 In the first place, it is just plain paper 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.300
 The country that made it only guarantees the victory 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.030
 It is not possible to no 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:22.460
 There are people who can exchange for silver in Japan but it is temporary 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.630
 I do not use it abroad 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:30.820
 Japan's debt has been cleared to a huge amount 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.430
 Piled up debt in order to return the debt 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:42.310
 But I will not hand it over to the banker 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:43.420
 A variety of things such as marine Kenkokudo's concessions were seized as collateral 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.820
 No 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.690
 The people were suffering behind them 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:56.110
 Bush runs short of rising taxes 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.110

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:08.979
 The plague spread in the next year's slum where you went to the Royal Palace 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:11.069

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.900
 Hmm 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.620
