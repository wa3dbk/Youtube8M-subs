00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
wall ride it's a pretty new type of

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.060 
wall ride it's a pretty new type of
building<00:00:24.579> method<00:00:25.000> for<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:26.320> custom<00:00:26.830> race

building method for the custom race

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.509 
building method for the custom race
scene<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:28.570> it's<00:00:28.720> pretty<00:00:29.260> simple<00:00:29.710> to<00:00:30.039> do<00:00:30.189> with

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
scene but it's pretty simple to do with

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.360 
scene but it's pretty simple to do with
a<00:00:30.970> little<00:00:31.090> practice<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.920> I<00:00:32.980> know<00:00:33.100> you<00:00:33.220> guys

yeah let's get right into this all right
so<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.340> first<00:00:48.550> step<00:00:48.850> when<00:00:49.059> building<00:00:49.270> the

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
so the first step when building the

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.630 
so the first step when building the
vertical<00:00:49.960> container<00:00:50.289> wall<00:00:50.620> ride<00:00:50.829> is<00:00:51.160> to<00:00:51.430> go

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
vertical container wall ride is to go

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.360 
vertical container wall ride is to go
into<00:00:51.879> your<00:00:52.110> barriers<00:00:53.110> and<00:00:53.469> select<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.129> long

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
into your barriers and select the long

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.540 
into your barriers and select the long
striped<00:00:55.120> concrete<00:00:56.219> you're<00:00:57.219> gonna<00:00:57.340> want<00:00:57.520> to

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
striped concrete you're gonna want to

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.549 
striped concrete you're gonna want to
place<00:00:57.789> that<00:00:58.030> down<00:00:58.210> pick<00:00:58.719> it<00:00:58.840> up<00:00:58.960> and<00:00:59.109> raise<00:00:59.320> it

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
place that down pick it up and raise it

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.049 
place that down pick it up and raise it
to<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.739> level<00:01:00.039> of<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.399> wall<00:01:00.579> ride<00:01:00.789> you<00:01:00.969> want

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
to the level of the wall ride you want

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.420 
to the level of the wall ride you want
to<00:01:01.210> build<00:01:01.469> I'm<00:01:02.469> gonna<00:01:02.649> actually<00:01:02.800> build<00:01:03.129> mine

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
to build I'm gonna actually build mine

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.469 
to build I'm gonna actually build mine
pretty<00:01:03.670> close<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.390> ground<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:07.270> you<00:01:07.390> know

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
pretty close to the ground but you know

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.210 
pretty close to the ground but you know
you<00:01:07.570> can<00:01:07.690> always<00:01:07.810> build<00:01:08.050> it<00:01:08.259> up<00:01:08.380> however<00:01:08.860> high

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
you can always build it up however high

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.529 
you can always build it up however high
you<00:01:09.250> want<00:01:10.050> so<00:01:11.050> you<00:01:11.140> just<00:01:11.289> place<00:01:11.649> that<00:01:11.679> down<00:01:12.160> and

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
you want so you just place that down and

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.039 
you want so you just place that down and
then<00:01:13.539> you<00:01:13.840> want<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.080> switch<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:16.049> containers

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
then you want to switch to containers

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.499 
then you want to switch to containers
and<00:01:17.350> you<00:01:18.159> can<00:01:18.310> use<00:01:18.460> whichever<00:01:18.820> container<00:01:19.330> you

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
and you can use whichever container you

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.160 
and you can use whichever container you
want<00:01:19.799> it'll<00:01:20.799> work<00:01:20.950> with<00:01:21.159> any<00:01:21.340> container<00:01:22.170> so

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
want it'll work with any container so

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.870 
want it'll work with any container so
then<00:01:23.350> basically<00:01:23.830> you're<00:01:24.130> gonna<00:01:24.310> glitch<00:01:24.670> it

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
then basically you're gonna glitch it

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.870 
then basically you're gonna glitch it
using<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.869> move<00:01:26.079> method<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.310> then<00:01:27.759> you're

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
using the move method and then you're

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.920 
using the move method and then you're
gonna<00:01:27.970> do<00:01:28.180> it<00:01:28.329> underneath<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:30.400> concrete<00:01:31.329> so

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
gonna do it underneath the concrete so

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.960 
gonna do it underneath the concrete so
place<00:01:32.200> your<00:01:32.470> container<00:01:33.280> down<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:33.880> then

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
place your container down and then

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.210 
place your container down and then
you're<00:01:34.960> gonna<00:01:35.079> move<00:01:35.380> glitch<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.860> from<00:01:36.070> the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
you're gonna move glitch it from the

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.120 
you're gonna move glitch it from the
bottom<00:01:36.640> up<00:01:37.000> on<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.900> container<00:01:38.409> up<00:01:38.770> onto

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
bottom up on to the container up onto

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.910 
bottom up on to the container up onto
the<00:01:39.250> concrete<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.990> basically<00:01:41.290> just<00:01:41.380> moving

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
the concrete so basically just moving

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.520 
the concrete so basically just moving
the<00:01:42.040> left<00:01:42.220> stick<00:01:42.460> up<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.939> down<00:01:43.119> but<00:01:44.049> starting

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
the left stick up and down but starting

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.660 
the left stick up and down but starting
underneath<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:46.299> thing<00:01:46.720> so<00:01:47.640> something<00:01:48.640> like

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
underneath the thing so something like

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.730 
underneath the thing so something like
this<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.630> get<00:01:49.720> it<00:01:49.869> right<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.409> where<00:01:50.560> it's

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
this you get it right to where it's

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.800 
this you get it right to where it's
about<00:01:50.829> to<00:01:51.009> switch<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.820> then<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.540> just<00:01:52.689> do

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
about to switch and then you just do

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.929 
about to switch and then you just do
little<00:01:53.079> light<00:01:53.409> up-and-down<00:01:54.219> moves<00:01:54.579> with<00:01:54.850> the

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
little light up-and-down moves with the

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.600 
little light up-and-down moves with the
left<00:01:55.149> stick<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.719> press<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:56.110> as<00:01:56.979> soon<00:01:57.280> as<00:01:57.430> it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
left stick and press a as soon as it

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.330 
left stick and press a as soon as it
lands<00:01:58.000> on<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.360> thing<00:01:58.710> almost<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.950> actually<00:02:00.280> I

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
lands on the thing almost you actually I

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.030 
lands on the thing almost you actually I
almost<00:02:00.610> have<00:02:00.909> to<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.270> beforehand<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.860> see

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
almost have to do it beforehand so see

actually a pretty small little area
there<00:02:13.540> we<00:02:13.630> go<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.430> that's<00:02:16.000> how<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.450> get<00:02:16.720> the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
there we go so that's how you get the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.470 
there we go so that's how you get the
container<00:02:17.739> placed<00:02:18.310> vertical<00:02:18.910> like<00:02:19.060> that

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.140 

and<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.800> can<00:02:22.950> actually<00:02:23.340> go<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.819> put

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
and then you can actually go and put

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.630 
and then you can actually go and put
another<00:02:24.300> one<00:02:24.780> right<00:02:25.080> beside<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:28.640> basically

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
another one right beside it basically

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.369 
another one right beside it basically
wherever<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:30.090> see<00:02:30.300> those<00:02:30.480> little<00:02:30.660> tabs<00:02:31.019> on

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
wherever you see those little tabs on

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.990 
wherever you see those little tabs on
the<00:02:31.500> bottom<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.040> concrete<00:02:32.430> you'll<00:02:32.849> be

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the bottom of the concrete you'll be

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000 
the bottom of the concrete you'll be
able<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.269> glitch<00:02:33.510> one<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:35.129> this<00:02:35.970> manner

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
able to glitch one on in this manner

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.920 
able to glitch one on in this manner
let's<00:02:38.010> see<00:02:38.130> if<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.459> do<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.730> again<00:02:39.000> wrong

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
let's see if I can do it again wrong

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:53.030 
let's see if I can do it again wrong
angle<00:02:48.709> okay<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:51.349> now<00:02:52.349> what<00:02:52.560> you're<00:02:52.739> gonna<00:02:52.830> want

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
angle okay so now what you're gonna want

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.839 
angle okay so now what you're gonna want
to<00:02:53.099> do<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:54.769> continue<00:02:55.769> your<00:02:56.099> wall<00:02:56.310> ride<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:56.790> you

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
to do is continue your wall ride so you

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.550 
to do is continue your wall ride so you
probably<00:02:57.120> want<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.750> know<00:02:57.840> change<00:02:58.440> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
probably want to you know change the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.160 
probably want to you know change the
angle<00:02:59.130> make<00:02:59.819> it<00:02:59.940> turn<00:03:00.120> more<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.750> left<00:03:00.959> or

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
angle make it turn more to the left or

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.710 
angle make it turn more to the left or
to<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.319> right<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:02.269> normally<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.420> would<00:03:03.569> go

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
to the right and normally you would go

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.569 
to the right and normally you would go
ahead<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.049> set<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.380> container<00:03:04.950> floating<00:03:05.459> in

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
ahead and set a container floating in

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.300 
ahead and set a container floating in
the<00:03:05.670> air<00:03:06.290> which<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.470> gonna<00:03:07.680> be<00:03:07.860> your<00:03:08.069> height

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the air which is gonna be your height

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.110 
the air which is gonna be your height
guide<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.890> I'm<00:03:10.980> gonna<00:03:11.160> go<00:03:11.400> ahead<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.610> set<00:03:11.970> one

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
guide so I'm gonna go ahead and set one

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.759 
guide so I'm gonna go ahead and set one
up<00:03:12.269> right<00:03:12.450> here<00:03:12.900> it's<00:03:13.290> not<00:03:13.440> going<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.620> be

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
up right here it's not going to be

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.300 
up right here it's not going to be
perfect<00:03:14.459> but<00:03:14.700> we'll<00:03:15.150> use<00:03:15.299> that<00:03:16.310> basically

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
perfect but we'll use that basically

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.150 
perfect but we'll use that basically
what<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.640> allows<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.180> do<00:03:18.799> so<00:03:19.799> go<00:03:19.950> back<00:03:20.099> to

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
what that allows you to do so go back to

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.870 
what that allows you to do so go back to
my<00:03:20.400> barriers<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.980> allows<00:03:23.280> me<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.549> place

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
my barriers and it allows me to place

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.009 
my barriers and it allows me to place
each<00:03:24.319> barrier<00:03:25.319> at<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.859> same<00:03:26.220> height<00:03:27.019> so

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
each barrier at the same height so

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.289 
each barrier at the same height so
there's<00:03:28.410> my<00:03:28.590> long<00:03:28.829> striped<00:03:29.280> concrete<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:30.030> place

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
there's my long striped concrete I place

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.479 
there's my long striped concrete I place
it<00:03:30.540> down<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.780> pick<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.440> up<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.799> press<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.370> on<00:03:32.459> the

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
it down I pick it up I press in on the

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.890 
it down I pick it up I press in on the
left<00:03:32.730> stick<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.000> raise<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.450> up<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.750> then<00:03:33.840> I

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
left stick to raise it up and then I

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.080 
left stick to raise it up and then I
drag<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.470> over<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.950> cop<00:03:35.160> over<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.730> container

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
drag it over the cop over the container

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.979 
drag it over the cop over the container
and<00:03:36.389> that<00:03:36.989> sets<00:03:37.319> my<00:03:37.560> Heights<00:03:38.600> so<00:03:39.600> now<00:03:39.780> what

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
and that sets my Heights so now what

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.710 
and that sets my Heights so now what
you're<00:03:40.079> gonna<00:03:40.200> want<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.500> do<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.769> you<00:03:40.889> want<00:03:41.069> to

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
you're gonna want to do is you want to

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.420 
you're gonna want to do is you want to
change<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.870> angle<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.260> little<00:03:43.319> bit<00:03:43.590> so<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.250> can

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
change the angle a little bit so you can

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.069 
change the angle a little bit so you can
actually<00:03:44.579> do<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.090> as<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.239> wall<00:03:45.510> ride<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:48.079> you

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
actually do it as a wall ride and you

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.069 
actually do it as a wall ride and you
basically<00:03:49.319> want<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:50.069> very<00:03:50.790> whoops<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:51.930> want

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
basically want the very whoops you want

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.009 
basically want the very whoops you want
went<00:03:53.010> down<00:03:54.650> you<00:03:55.650> want<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.980> bottom<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.670> the

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
went down you want the bottom of the

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.940 
went down you want the bottom of the
concrete<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.680> almost<00:03:59.190> be<00:03:59.430> touching<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:01.739> wall

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
concrete to almost be touching the wall

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:10.160 
concrete to almost be touching the wall
ride<00:04:02.750> so<00:04:04.010> something<00:04:05.010> like<00:04:05.160> that

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.030 

that's<00:04:11.170> pretty<00:04:11.439> good

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
that's pretty good

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.069 
that's pretty good
you<00:04:12.579> could<00:04:12.730> actually<00:04:12.879> get<00:04:13.180> even<00:04:13.480> closer<00:04:13.719> than

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
you could actually get even closer than

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.939 
you could actually get even closer than
that<00:04:14.230> but<00:04:14.620> we'll<00:04:14.769> go<00:04:14.920> with<00:04:15.069> that<00:04:15.099> for<00:04:15.400> now<00:04:15.570> and

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
that but we'll go with that for now and

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.289 
that but we'll go with that for now and
basically<00:04:17.949> just<00:04:18.190> go<00:04:18.370> back<00:04:18.579> and<00:04:18.880> you<00:04:18.940> just<00:04:19.120> keep

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
basically just go back and you just keep

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.800 
basically just go back and you just keep
glitching<00:04:19.780> on<00:04:19.900> containers<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:24.060> just<00:04:25.060> every

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
glitching on containers and just every

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.129 
glitching on containers and just every
so<00:04:25.990> often<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:26.919> know<00:04:27.039> changing<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.639> angle<00:04:28.139> to

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
so often you know changing the angle to

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.760 
so often you know changing the angle to
how<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.530> want<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.990> toughest<00:04:35.410> part<00:04:35.650> is

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
how you want it the toughest part is

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.689 
how you want it the toughest part is
definitely<00:04:35.979> the<00:04:36.340> move<00:04:36.520> glitching<00:04:38.160> so<00:04:39.160> yeah

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
definitely the move glitching so yeah

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.339 
definitely the move glitching so yeah
see<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.240> then<00:04:40.330> you<00:04:40.360> get<00:04:40.539> a<00:04:40.599> pretty<00:04:40.930> smooth

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
see and then you get a pretty smooth

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.120 
see and then you get a pretty smooth
pretty<00:04:41.770> smooth<00:04:42.520> wall<00:04:43.830> another<00:04:44.830> cool<00:04:45.099> thing

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
pretty smooth wall another cool thing

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.420 
pretty smooth wall another cool thing
you<00:04:45.400> can<00:04:45.520> do<00:04:45.820> is<00:04:46.000> you<00:04:46.150> can<00:04:46.270> raise<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.870> height

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.249 

so<00:04:51.430> go<00:04:52.180> back<00:04:52.389> to<00:04:52.570> barriers<00:04:54.720> get<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:55.960> long

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
so go back to barriers get the long

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.070 
so go back to barriers get the long
striped<00:04:56.770> concrete<00:04:57.430> again<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:58.120> I<00:04:58.870> could

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
striped concrete again and I could

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.870 
striped concrete again and I could
actually<00:04:59.229> go<00:04:59.710> up<00:05:00.210> say<00:05:01.210> you<00:05:01.690> know<00:05:01.780> this<00:05:02.020> high

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
actually go up say you know this high

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.830 
actually go up say you know this high
and<00:05:03.880> this<00:05:04.000> is<00:05:04.150> how<00:05:04.270> people<00:05:04.630> have<00:05:04.720> been

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
and this is how people have been

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.050 
and this is how people have been
building<00:05:05.020> those<00:05:05.349> really<00:05:05.620> crazy<00:05:06.340> vertical

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
building those really crazy vertical

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.330 
building those really crazy vertical
spirals<00:05:07.630> and<00:05:08.560> stuff<00:05:08.889> like<00:05:09.009> that<00:05:09.220> you

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
spirals and stuff like that you

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.219 
spirals and stuff like that you
basically<00:05:09.490> just<00:05:09.910> raise<00:05:10.180> this<00:05:10.449> up<00:05:10.660> every<00:05:11.020> so

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
basically just raise this up every so

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.689 
basically just raise this up every so
often<00:05:11.580> turn<00:05:12.580> it<00:05:12.760> a<00:05:12.849> little<00:05:13.030> bit<00:05:13.240> more<00:05:14.520> place<00:05:15.520> it

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
often turn it a little bit more place it

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.969 
often turn it a little bit more place it
down<00:05:15.880> and<00:05:16.830> then<00:05:17.830> just<00:05:17.860> put<00:05:18.280> another<00:05:19.979> container

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
down and then just put another container

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:36.420 
down and then just put another container
on<00:05:21.310> there<00:05:23.849> find<00:05:24.849> it<00:05:25.030> there<00:05:25.270> we<00:05:25.389> go

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.850 

so<00:05:37.150> something<00:05:37.960> like<00:05:38.110> that<00:05:38.350> and<00:05:38.620> then<00:05:38.770> you

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
so something like that and then you

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.580 
so something like that and then you
could<00:05:39.070> keep<00:05:39.540> building<00:05:40.540> it<00:05:40.810> up<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.199> up<00:05:41.290> and<00:05:41.500> up

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
could keep building it up and up and up

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.920 
could keep building it up and up and up
so<00:05:42.009> there's<00:05:42.910> a<00:05:42.970> lot<00:05:43.120> of<00:05:43.150> different<00:05:43.600> variations

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
so there's a lot of different variations

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.120 
so there's a lot of different variations
on<00:05:44.500> this<00:05:44.710> wall<00:05:45.039> design<00:05:45.639> you<00:05:45.910> can<00:05:46.090> use<00:05:46.770> and<00:05:47.770> as<00:05:47.919> I

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
on this wall design you can use and as I

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.490 
on this wall design you can use and as I
said<00:05:48.190> before<00:05:48.490> you<00:05:48.759> can<00:05:48.910> actually<00:05:49.060> use<00:05:49.500> you

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
said before you can actually use you

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.260 
said before you can actually use you
know<00:05:50.590> different<00:05:51.009> colored<00:05:51.310> containers<00:05:52.090> and

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
know different colored containers and

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.450 
know different colored containers and
stuff<00:05:52.479> so<00:05:52.720> it's<00:05:52.840> pretty<00:05:52.960> cool<00:05:53.199> you<00:05:53.350> can<00:05:53.460> have

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
stuff so it's pretty cool you can have

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.850 
stuff so it's pretty cool you can have
like<00:05:54.669> multicolored<00:05:55.270> wall<00:05:55.960> rides<00:05:56.229> and<00:05:56.560> stuff

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
like multicolored wall rides and stuff

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.760 
like multicolored wall rides and stuff
like<00:05:57.039> that<00:05:59.039> another<00:06:00.039> useful<00:06:00.940> thing<00:06:01.690> in<00:06:02.590> the

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
like that another useful thing in the

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.390 
like that another useful thing in the
same<00:06:03.009> category<00:06:03.639> as<00:06:03.940> the<00:06:04.389> vertical<00:06:04.570> wall<00:06:04.930> ride

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
same category as the vertical wall ride

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.300 
same category as the vertical wall ride
it<00:06:06.400> just<00:06:06.460> builds<00:06:07.000> up<00:06:07.120> more<00:06:07.360> of<00:06:07.509> a<00:06:07.630> slanted<00:06:08.310> wall

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
it just builds up more of a slanted wall

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.450 
it just builds up more of a slanted wall
ride<00:06:10.620> basically<00:06:11.620> you<00:06:11.710> can<00:06:11.860> use<00:06:11.889> the<00:06:12.220> bench

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
ride basically you can use the bench

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.860 
ride basically you can use the bench
right<00:06:12.729> here<00:06:13.229> kind<00:06:14.229> of<00:06:14.440> as<00:06:14.560> the<00:06:14.740> same<00:06:14.949> thing<00:06:15.870> so

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
right here kind of as the same thing so

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.230 
right here kind of as the same thing so
do<00:06:17.110> it<00:06:17.199> over<00:06:17.410> here<00:06:17.580> place<00:06:18.580> the<00:06:18.789> bench<00:06:18.970> down

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
do it over here place the bench down

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.300 
do it over here place the bench down
pick<00:06:19.600> it<00:06:19.720> up<00:06:20.280> place<00:06:21.280> it<00:06:21.310> in<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:21.729> air<00:06:21.880> and

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
pick it up place it in the air and

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.080 
pick it up place it in the air and
select<00:06:24.310> your<00:06:24.460> containers<00:06:25.000> again<00:06:25.710> and<00:06:27.090> this

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
select your containers again and this

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.000 
select your containers again and this
time<00:06:28.150> you<00:06:28.570> want<00:06:28.720> to<00:06:28.780> glitch<00:06:29.050> it<00:06:29.199> from<00:06:29.380> the<00:06:29.500> top

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
time you want to glitch it from the top

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:45.360 
time you want to glitch it from the top
and<00:06:30.699> go<00:06:31.030> up<00:06:31.180> and<00:06:31.360> down<00:06:31.740> and<00:06:32.740> just<00:06:32.919> press<00:06:33.220> a<00:06:44.340> okay

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
and go up and down and just press a okay

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.480 
and go up and down and just press a okay
so<00:06:46.090> as<00:06:46.449> you<00:06:46.960> can<00:06:47.080> see<00:06:47.139> this<00:06:47.560> one's<00:06:47.800> not<00:06:48.039> quite

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
so as you can see this one's not quite

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.860 
so as you can see this one's not quite
vertical<00:06:49.919> and<00:06:50.919> that<00:06:50.949> will<00:06:51.820> allow<00:06:52.090> you<00:06:52.150> to<00:06:52.360> you

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
vertical and that will allow you to you

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.570 
vertical and that will allow you to you
know<00:06:52.990> if<00:06:53.409> you<00:06:53.590> wanted<00:06:53.860> to<00:06:53.919> build<00:06:54.190> a<00:06:54.370> less

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
know if you wanted to build a less

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.899 
know if you wanted to build a less
vertical<00:06:55.150> wall<00:06:55.360> ride<00:06:55.659> or<00:06:56.020> spiral<00:06:56.740> it<00:06:57.729> just

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909 
vertical wall ride or spiral it just

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:00.779 
vertical wall ride or spiral it just
gives<00:06:58.090> you<00:06:58.210> another<00:06:58.830> another<00:06:59.830> way<00:07:00.130> to<00:07:00.610> create

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:00.789 
gives you another another way to create

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:03.420 
gives you another another way to create
this<00:07:01.120> sort<00:07:01.389> of<00:07:01.539> angle<00:07:01.930> with<00:07:02.800> the<00:07:02.919> containers

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
this sort of angle with the containers

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.180 
this sort of angle with the containers
and<00:07:03.729> actually<00:07:04.599> any<00:07:04.750> prop<00:07:05.080> so<00:07:05.740> you<00:07:05.830> can<00:07:05.979> glitch

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
and actually any prop so you can glitch

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.140 
and actually any prop so you can glitch
any<00:07:06.490> prop<00:07:07.139> using<00:07:08.139> these<00:07:08.620> two<00:07:08.889> methods<00:07:08.919> so<00:07:09.880> it

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
any prop using these two methods so it

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.390 
any prop using these two methods so it
can<00:07:10.330> be<00:07:10.479> very<00:07:10.690> useful<00:07:11.199> and<00:07:11.380> in<00:07:11.889> building<00:07:12.370> your

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
can be very useful and in building your

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.740 
can be very useful and in building your
races<00:07:12.880> and<00:07:13.030> stuff<00:07:13.240> like<00:07:13.419> that<00:07:13.630> so<00:07:15.449> yeah<00:07:16.449> that's

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:16.750 
races and stuff like that so yeah that's

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.219 
races and stuff like that so yeah that's
basically<00:07:16.990> it<00:07:17.909> I<00:07:18.909> hope<00:07:19.360> you<00:07:19.479> guys<00:07:19.539> found<00:07:20.080> this
