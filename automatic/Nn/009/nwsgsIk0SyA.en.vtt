cool<00:02:22.780> we're<00:02:23.019> sitting<00:02:23.320> here<00:02:23.350> on<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.160> bridge<00:02:24.400> of

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
cool we're sitting here on the bridge of

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.080 
cool we're sitting here on the bridge of
the<00:02:24.820> Carnival<00:02:25.299> Breeze<00:02:25.329> and<00:02:25.540> it's<00:02:25.959> pretty

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
the Carnival Breeze and it's pretty

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.990 
the Carnival Breeze and it's pretty
astounding<00:02:28.090> they<00:02:29.019> look<00:02:29.290> around

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
astounding they look around

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.800 
astounding they look around
and<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.240> course<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.710> expect<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.330> the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
and of course you can expect to see the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.620 
and of course you can expect to see the
modern<00:02:34.110> technology<00:02:34.740> but<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.520> don't<00:02:35.760> know<00:02:36.030> any

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
modern technology but you don't know any

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.470 
modern technology but you don't know any
idea<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.590> what<00:02:38.370> you're<00:02:38.550> going<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.790> see<00:02:39.030> until

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
idea of what you're going to see until

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.860 
idea of what you're going to see until
you're<00:02:39.660> up<00:02:39.810> here<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.190> really<00:02:41.840> kind<00:02:42.840> of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
you're up here and it's really kind of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.490 
you're up here and it's really kind of
minimal<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.470> wanted<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.490> know<00:02:45.080> how<00:02:46.080> has<00:02:46.320> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
minimal I wanted to know how has the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.920 
minimal I wanted to know how has the
technology<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.520> ships<00:02:47.790> changed<00:02:48.570> since

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
technology on the ships changed since

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.720 
technology on the ships changed since
you<00:02:49.170> first<00:02:49.560> started<00:02:50.160> sailing<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:51.090> lot<00:02:51.900> means

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
you first started sailing a lot means

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.900 
you first started sailing a lot means
when<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.760> start<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:55.440> give<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:56.130> an<00:02:56.340> example

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
when I start I give you just an example

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.700 
when I start I give you just an example
we<00:02:57.210> have<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.690> transistor<00:03:00.690> satellite<00:03:01.290> which

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
we have the transistor satellite which

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.699 
we have the transistor satellite which
was<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> kind<00:03:02.490> of<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.970> satellite<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:03.930> would

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
was a kind of a satellite that would

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.160 
was a kind of a satellite that would
give<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.459> position<00:03:06.709> every<00:03:07.970> 3-4<00:03:08.970> hours

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
give you the position every 3-4 hours

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.870 
give you the position every 3-4 hours
five<00:03:10.170> hours<00:03:10.200> six<00:03:10.770> hours<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:12.330> usually

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
five hours six hours and we usually

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.420 
five hours six hours and we usually
navigate<00:03:14.959> with<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:15.990> Raiders<00:03:16.530> these<00:03:17.250> are

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
navigate with the Raiders these are

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.420 
navigate with the Raiders these are
transistor<00:03:18.000> instruments<00:03:18.570> but<00:03:19.530> we<00:03:20.190> didn't

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
transistor instruments but we didn't

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.870 
transistor instruments but we didn't
have<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.580> much<00:03:20.850> technology<00:03:21.660> now<00:03:22.230> after<00:03:22.950> more

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
have a much technology now after more

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.240 
have a much technology now after more
than<00:03:23.910> 25<00:03:24.840> years<00:03:25.190> we<00:03:26.190> have<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:27.510> know<00:03:27.660> GPS<00:03:28.530> we

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
than 25 years we have you know GPS we

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.060 
than 25 years we have you know GPS we
have<00:03:29.480> rather<00:03:30.480> see<00:03:30.930> interface<00:03:31.380> with<00:03:31.800> the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
have rather see interface with the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.199 
have rather see interface with the
electronic<00:03:32.820> chart<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.780> something<00:03:34.230> that<00:03:34.500> is

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
electronic chart and something that is

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.210 
electronic chart and something that is
unbelievable<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.420> way<00:03:36.570> they<00:03:36.690> change

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
unbelievable the way they change

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.770 
unbelievable the way they change
but<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.250> understand<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.910> still<00:03:39.450> though

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
but I understand that you still though

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.620 
but I understand that you still though
you<00:03:39.840> still<00:03:40.380> will<00:03:40.620> use<00:03:40.890> paper<00:03:41.340> charts<00:03:41.940> to

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
you still will use paper charts to

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.540 
you still will use paper charts to
cross-reference<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.800> GPS<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.519> telling

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
cross-reference with the GPS is telling

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.750 
cross-reference with the GPS is telling
you<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.209> right<00:03:45.540> my<00:03:46.170> is<00:03:46.860> not<00:03:47.220> necessary

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
you is that right my is not necessary

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.850 
you is that right my is not necessary
means<00:03:47.940> here<00:03:48.720> we<00:03:48.930> use<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.260> adjusted<00:03:49.709> for

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
means here we use it adjusted for

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.210 
means here we use it adjusted for
practice<00:03:50.280> but<00:03:51.290> we<00:03:52.290> are<00:03:52.530> equipping<00:03:52.950> with

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
practice but we are equipping with

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.080 
practice but we are equipping with
decades--<00:03:53.760> which<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.330> a<00:03:54.870> new<00:03:55.140> system<00:03:55.820> with<00:03:56.820> the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
decades-- which is a new system with the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.930 
decades-- which is a new system with the
electronic<00:03:57.540> chart

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
electronic chart

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.210 
electronic chart
this<00:03:59.510> electronica<00:04:00.080> chart<00:04:00.320> will<00:04:00.770> give<00:04:00.950> you<00:04:01.040> the

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
this electronica chart will give you the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
this electronica chart will give you the
position<00:04:01.370> in<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.950> immediate<00:04:04.670> time<00:04:04.850> because

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
position in the immediate time because

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.050 
position in the immediate time because
his<00:04:05.360> interface<00:04:05.990> with<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.130> weather<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.670> the

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
his interface with the weather and the

course you still there's still a need
for<00:04:13.100> an<00:04:13.190> actual<00:04:13.430> human<00:04:13.670> being<00:04:13.880> I'm<00:04:14.630> referring

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
for an actual human being I'm referring

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.340 
for an actual human being I'm referring
to<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:16.070> river<00:04:16.370> pilot<00:04:16.640> who<00:04:17.360> will<00:04:17.870> still<00:04:18.110> guide

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
to the river pilot who will still guide

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.699 
to the river pilot who will still guide
you<00:04:18.620> in<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:19.190> last<00:04:19.480> part<00:04:20.480> of<00:04:20.540> the<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:21.500> know<00:04:21.650> as

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
you in the last part of the you know as

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.410 
you in the last part of the you know as
you're<00:04:21.890> as<00:04:22.040> you're<00:04:22.070> reporting<00:04:22.700> or<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.300> come

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
in and are going out yeah means every

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.740 
in and are going out yeah means every
port<00:04:26.500> they<00:04:27.500> have<00:04:27.590> their<00:04:27.770> own<00:04:27.860> rules<00:04:28.360> he<00:04:29.360> I<00:04:29.390> knew

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
port they have their own rules he I knew

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.880 
port they have their own rules he I knew
Europe<00:04:30.050> they<00:04:30.770> we<00:04:31.930> we<00:04:32.930> have<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.230> get<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.560> pirate

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
Europe they we we have to get the pirate

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.470 
Europe they we we have to get the pirate
at<00:04:34.070> every<00:04:34.310> port<00:04:34.580> what<00:04:34.850> are<00:04:34.940> we<00:04:35.060> going

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
at every port what are we going

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.700 
at every port what are we going
I<00:04:36.610> do<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.880> maneuvering<00:04:38.300> by<00:04:38.540> myself<00:04:39.050> even<00:04:39.230> I

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
I do the maneuvering by myself even I

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.610 
I do the maneuvering by myself even I
have<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.280> pilot<00:04:40.700> but<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:41.840> is<00:04:42.140> a<00:04:42.170> mandatory

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
have the pilot but it is a mandatory

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.180 
have the pilot but it is a mandatory
means<00:04:43.160> he<00:04:43.520> cannot<00:04:43.820> say<00:04:44.120> I<00:04:44.390> will<00:04:44.630> not<00:04:44.950> get<00:04:45.950> it

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
means he cannot say I will not get it

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.830
