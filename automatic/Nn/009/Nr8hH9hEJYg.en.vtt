00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.140
 yeah yeah you join me I'm old and 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:12.260
 the greenhouse che down from my house it was 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.260
 the nice crosses thank you 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.670
 and nothing said the father would be heavy that 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:25.369
 I'm getting off of his desk and 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:28.039
 perish copÃ© has legs and there you go 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.330
 well yeah yeah yeah that's terrible 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.089
 it's videos we'll say that good 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.800
 it annoys me and already leads canvas go there 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:36.110
 then not there men break medalion 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.730
 the round trip beach has just made headway 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.589
 worse, that to you as an engine 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.600
 I was a little motor without five girls 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.420
 super father gel and looks even better 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.260
 when he is with a dsg box 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.789
 the impression that it was still a 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.559
 hair more closed sport than golf the 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.940
 see gives was a little dynamic in 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.010
 anyway true it was good to live on credit 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.510
 but it's true that it feels and choco 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.750
 paul little farmville engine is 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.840
 more than enough what am I doing you 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.820
 sense you feel spontaneously of course the 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.390
 trunk eight months the superliga makes me 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.380
 think a lot about the first audi a4 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.890
 mid-90s monteux break 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.910
 you 've been discussing advice it annoys me a 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.310
 little because I wanted it to be the 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.580
 French who 2 min like that I was doing 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.970
 the same thought with skoda volkswagen 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.979
 has created standards but on all 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.179
 the brands of the group 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.410
 they become world standards 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.399
 that is to say that basically when you drive 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.319
 our tools but why 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.179
 the apaba why why pass it why 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.360
 the palm drop-down menus other that's 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.020
 especially in ergonomics the fact click a 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.910
 button 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.789
 yeah always be three needs 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.239
 ris that fire commands by ear 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:50.030
 regulator that the setting of the 

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:51.770
 flying better like this house it makes them 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.890
 economies of scale because possible 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.890
 no 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.170
 but OEMs that requires moreover 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.909
 as in the air that saw the number 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.280
 of equipment to the water was a few 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.390
 enchanted canvas merchants arrives there 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.190
 says it would be good that is 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.459
 now ergonomic standards 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.440
 yeah see you can just beak them 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.080
 people are reassured when he goes up in 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.550
 a car is not disturbed by asus 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.440
 the lighthouses to zut it's right on the left 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.330
 george knows more where his bones than I 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.950
 open my life and this one wins this 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.510
 are very simple elements 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.459
 and when they cruise control the nuts 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.900
 funny funny and soon when you 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.760
 go see the driving button 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.040
 autonomous in town at less than 40 km 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.989
 to set it up if everyone has their child 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.860
 software is like you tomorrow who 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.600
 change phone 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.400
 I lost you can a three four days 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.080
 still matter used and that's it 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.570
 annoying but does that mean 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.040
 that up to date all the major brands there 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.080
 the 300 tents this is not the case yet 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.070
 it is not the case it is in any case 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.730
 hope that caress the 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.800
 OEMs 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.070
 finally some of the biggest ones more 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.080
 big actors again because 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.840
 they say they are going to the East Coast 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.420
 standalone we go to settings of 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.720
 more and more complex and what would be 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.570
 well it's that every constructor 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.880
 can be heard padros on 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.640
 standards you know but simple 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.220
 buttons its menu setting they 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.200
 are all pretty much equivalent but 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.769
 for merengues and still looks 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.570
 once an example the gps there exists 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.570
 almost as much gps as two models 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.999
 it's to go crazy two and sometimes you 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.310
 say but it's not possible and so there 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:34.459
 that would be the idea also to make his 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.849
 rands his simple used for us to be 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.109
 not actually disturbed by this equipment 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.340
 acquired that they play their full 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.700
 role actually that deep inside them 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.760
 to increase the protection that offers us 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.950
 good freeman damien the easels you but 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.480
 yes I wanted to she is one of 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.910
 rare to propose if your question 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.250
 it is to wonder if between the audi a3 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.629
 reflects a scoop 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.010
 I did see Alexis back you told me 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.440
 me finally between an audi and the 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.489
 left would take the csg criigen a 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.170
 fucking accident 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.170
 no I'm kidding and later games yves 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.900
 why because when you count the 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.519
 under and you tell yourself ok they're from the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.260
 same family they are built of 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.049
 the same way there is one that is 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.040
 super well equipped and a design that is 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.229
 nice thing to touch but 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.930
 what more and more desirable since that 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.580
 which is probably the best report 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.560
 normal haven is equivalent to brest the 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.930
 Agouazi horses here is voila 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.689
 portbail and if you put and what puts 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.689
 side 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:39.439
 snobbery in just me I esteem 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:40.789
 but I first dried you 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.649
 please many virtues this good thank you 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.959
 to have a rowing rather work for 

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:46.610
 this small quick observation in 20 kg 

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:47.569
 internally many things but 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.519
 effective 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:51.519
 good go go to more
