to win at least one of them to shoulder
this<00:03:21.209> method<00:03:21.690> will<00:03:21.900> be<00:03:21.959> effective<00:03:22.890> but<00:03:23.670> it's

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
this method will be effective but it's

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.720 
this method will be effective but it's
really<00:03:24.959> hard<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.350> win<00:03:25.560> stuff<00:03:25.920> right<00:03:26.190> now<00:03:26.220> but
