00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
cool design here although you can see

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.700 
cool design here although you can see
here<00:00:19.350> design<00:00:20.039> here<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.699> out<00:00:21.449> looks<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
here design here on out looks and the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.120 
here design here on out looks and the
materials<00:00:23.250> here<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:24.769> what<00:00:25.769> you're<00:00:25.949> saying

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
materials here is what you're saying

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.120 
materials here is what you're saying
premium<00:00:26.550> leather<00:00:26.760> stainless<00:00:27.359> steel<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.130> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
premium leather stainless steel and a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.250 
premium leather stainless steel and a
good<00:00:29.369> audio<00:00:29.760> performance<00:00:30.090> inline<00:00:30.900> remote

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
good audio performance inline remote

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.889 
good audio performance inline remote
control<00:00:31.700> with<00:00:32.700> microphone<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.780> see

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
control with microphone that you can see

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.200 
control with microphone that you can see
right<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.920> guess<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.460> means<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.059> can

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
right here so I guess that means you can

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.209 
right here so I guess that means you can
take<00:00:36.300> calls<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.930> as<00:00:37.050> well<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.770> good

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
take calls with it as well a good

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.510 
take calls with it as well a good
carrying<00:00:38.640> case<00:00:38.850> for<00:00:39.149> easy<00:00:39.570> portability<00:00:40.520> yeah

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
carrying case for easy portability yeah

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
carrying case for easy portability yeah
it's<00:00:41.989> pretty<00:00:42.989> straightforward<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:49.200> let's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it's pretty straightforward so let's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.139 
it's pretty straightforward so let's
just<00:00:49.789> take<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.760> send<00:00:57.090> this

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
just take this one up here and send this

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:12.800 
just take this one up here and send this
pretty<00:00:57.390> interesting<00:00:57.809> package

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.940 

to<00:01:13.810> go<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.960> take<00:01:17.200> him<00:01:17.320> up<00:01:17.440> here

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
to go just take him up here

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.090 
to go just take him up here
and<00:01:18.040> I<00:01:18.580> mean<00:01:18.729> I<00:01:18.940> guess<00:01:19.180> say<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.799> packaging

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
and I mean I guess say the packaging

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.109 
and I mean I guess say the packaging
here<00:01:21.790> is<00:01:22.799> extremely<00:01:23.799> cool<00:01:23.979> ash<00:01:24.280> like<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.880> it

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
here is extremely cool ash like that it

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:36.620 
here is extremely cool ash like that it
is<00:01:25.299> so<00:01:26.070> simplistic<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.850> is<00:01:31.000> how<00:01:31.180> they<00:01:31.420> look

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.770 

then<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:39.549> is<00:01:39.640> also<00:01:39.789> very<00:01:40.090> very<00:01:40.210> interesting

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
then this is also very very interesting

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.040 
then this is also very very interesting
this<00:01:40.869> line<00:01:41.170> here<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:43.450> can<00:01:43.569> take<00:01:43.600> these

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
this line here that you can take these

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:54.330 
this line here that you can take these
off<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.960> don't<00:01:53.080> have<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.649> have<00:01:53.950> these<00:01:54.100> on

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
off so you don't have to have these on

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:03.139 
off so you don't have to have these on
all<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.880> time<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:01.299> what<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:01.990> do<00:02:02.140> here<00:02:02.170> is

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
all the time so what you do here is

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:12.380 
all the time so what you do here is
guess<00:02:04.149> you've<00:02:04.450> taken<00:02:04.810> down<00:02:05.140> like<00:02:05.409> this<00:02:09.509> go<00:02:10.509> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
guess you've taken down like this go and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.560 
guess you've taken down like this go and
it<00:02:13.390> could<00:02:13.660> fit<00:02:13.900> here<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.760> can<00:02:15.910> also<00:02:16.060> take<00:02:16.390> me

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
it could fit here you can also take me

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.180 
it could fit here you can also take me
in<00:02:16.720> if<00:02:16.900> they're<00:02:17.079> too<00:02:17.290> big<00:02:19.709> this<00:02:20.709> is<00:02:21.010> the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
in if they're too big this is the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.790 
in if they're too big this is the
maximum

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.820 

so<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.790> will<00:02:29.880> probably<00:02:30.240> fit<00:02:30.360> everyone<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.110> if

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
so it will probably fit everyone and if

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.250 
so it will probably fit everyone and if
you<00:02:31.980> wonder<00:02:32.160> how<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.790> put<00:02:33.450> these<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:34.460> here

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
you wonder how you put these on here

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.590 
you wonder how you put these on here
then<00:02:37.260> what<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.010> basically<00:02:38.190> do<00:02:38.490> here<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.270> I

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
then what you basically do here is I

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.160 
then what you basically do here is I
guess<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.710> take<00:02:40.950> these<00:02:41.160> off<00:02:41.400> there<00:02:41.820> we<00:02:41.940> go<00:02:42.170> so

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
guess you take these off there we go so

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.870 
guess you take these off there we go so
you<00:02:43.260> take<00:02:43.470> these<00:02:43.650> off<00:02:43.860> here<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:46.250> then<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.640> can

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
you take these off here and then you can

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.550 
you take these off here and then you can
just<00:02:48.060> plug<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.720> here<00:02:50.810> we<00:02:51.810> can<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.290> take

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
just plug this in here we can you take

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:02.360 
just plug this in here we can you take
this<00:02:52.680> one<00:02:59.180> and<00:03:00.180> then<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.410> just<00:03:01.560> push<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.340> down

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
this one and then you just push it down

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.640 
this one and then you just push it down
a<00:03:02.580> little<00:03:02.730> bit<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:04.170> then<00:03:04.950> use<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.460> magnet<00:03:05.970> here

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.330 

you<00:03:10.650> should<00:03:10.920> have<00:03:10.950> no<00:03:11.460> issues<00:03:13.160> putting<00:03:14.160> this

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
you should have no issues putting this

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:22.190 
you should have no issues putting this
one<00:03:14.580> on<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:21.090> then<00:03:21.390> just<00:03:21.660> do<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.960> same<00:03:22.140> thing

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
one on and then just do the same thing

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:56.770 
one on and then just do the same thing
here<00:03:22.740> on<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.010> other<00:03:23.100> side

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.880 

there<00:03:57.350> you<00:03:57.440> go<00:03:58.210> so<00:03:59.260> very<00:04:00.260> cool<00:04:00.500> and

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
there you go so very cool and

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.810 
there you go so very cool and
interesting<00:04:01.190> or<00:04:02.980> actually<00:04:03.980> unique<00:04:04.370> I<00:04:04.610> guess

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
interesting or actually unique I guess

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.090 
interesting or actually unique I guess
you<00:04:05.240> should<00:04:05.840> call<00:04:06.050> it<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:09.470> take<00:04:09.830> him<00:04:09.980> in<00:04:10.070> a

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
you should call it is take him in a

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.690 
you should call it is take him in a
little<00:04:10.340> bit<00:04:10.460> and<00:04:11.740> you<00:04:12.740> can<00:04:13.070> use<00:04:13.220> them<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.550> can

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
little bit and you can use them you can

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.690 
little bit and you can use them you can
see<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:13.880> these<00:04:14.030> are<00:04:14.209> pretty<00:04:14.330> small<00:04:14.630> so<00:04:15.700> it's

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
see that these are pretty small so it's

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.670 
see that these are pretty small so it's
not<00:04:16.820> for<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.120> one<00:04:17.269> that<00:04:17.480> when<00:04:18.140> I<00:04:18.170> have<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.380> big

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
not for the one that when I have a big
