taking slow burn and the reason why I'm
taking<00:02:43.629> slow<00:02:44.109> burn<00:02:44.319> is<00:02:44.499> if<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.829> look<00:02:45.010> at<00:02:45.159> your

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
taking slow burn is if you look at your

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.429

wheel and colors that complement each

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.580 
wheel and colors that complement each
other<00:02:50.859> and<00:02:51.069> such<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:52.030> right<00:02:52.359> across<00:02:52.540> from<00:02:53.170> blue

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
other and such so right across from blue

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.880 
other and such so right across from blue
as<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.430> can<00:02:54.609> see<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:55.060> like<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.269> golden<00:02:55.930> yellow<00:02:56.379> I

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
as you can see is like a golden yellow I

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.770 
as you can see is like a golden yellow I
just<00:02:57.280> did<00:02:57.519> not<00:02:57.549> want<00:02:57.969> to<00:02:58.060> do<00:02:58.269> yellow

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
just did not want to do yellow

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.080 
just did not want to do yellow
underneath<00:02:59.349> my<00:02:59.499> lash<00:02:59.709> line<00:03:00.129> I<00:03:00.430> really<00:03:00.849> wanted

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
underneath my lash line I really wanted

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.720 
underneath my lash line I really wanted
to<00:03:01.269> do<00:03:01.390> something<00:03:01.810> similar<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:02.769> an<00:03:03.189> orange

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
to do something similar so an orange

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.179 
to do something similar so an orange
something<00:03:04.299> close<00:03:04.599> to<00:03:04.629> that<00:03:04.870> will<00:03:05.349> also<00:03:05.920> pop

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
something close to that will also pop

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.940 
something close to that will also pop
because<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:06.730> am<00:03:06.939> using<00:03:07.180> blue<00:03:07.719> mascara<00:03:08.560> so

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
because I am using blue mascara so

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.190 
because I am using blue mascara so
that's<00:03:09.129> why<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.430> chose<00:03:09.969> this<00:03:10.239> orange<00:03:10.749> bright

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
that's why I chose this orange bright

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.530 
that's why I chose this orange bright
orange<00:03:11.709> color<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:12.310> all<00:03:12.609> I'm<00:03:12.760> doing<00:03:12.999> is<00:03:13.060> placing

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
orange color so all I'm doing is placing

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.149 
orange color so all I'm doing is placing
this<00:03:13.659> over<00:03:13.840> top<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.530> pencil<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:15.040> we

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159

this over top of the pencil that we
placed<00:03:15.459> earlier<00:03:15.969> and<00:03:16.239> then<00:03:16.749> just<00:03:16.989> blending<00:03:17.499> it

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
placed earlier and then just blending it

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.559 
placed earlier and then just blending it
out<00:03:17.889> there<00:03:18.189> making<00:03:18.579> it<00:03:18.670> as<00:03:18.790> thick<00:03:18.969> as<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.299> want

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569
