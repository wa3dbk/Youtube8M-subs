their own color theme and that's a

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.090 
their own color theme and that's a
conscious<00:01:05.510> decision<00:01:05.540> on<00:01:06.020> our<00:01:06.140> part<00:01:06.200> we

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
conscious decision on our part we

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.010 
conscious decision on our part we
collaborate<00:01:07.610> very<00:01:07.820> closely<00:01:08.180> between<00:01:08.750> our

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
collaborate very closely between our

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.219 
collaborate very closely between our
design<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:10.040> create<00:01:10.550> this<00:01:11.030> unified<00:01:11.690> experience

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
design to create this unified experience

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.700 
design to create this unified experience
so<00:01:13.190> as<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.460> group<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.030> entire<00:01:14.270> DLC<00:01:14.810> is<00:01:14.840> growing

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
so as a group the entire DLC is growing

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.000 
so as a group the entire DLC is growing

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
together skyline is definitely the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.350 
together skyline is definitely the
fastest<00:01:22.430> of<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.610> three<00:01:22.700> maps<00:01:23.060> you're<00:01:23.240> going

to be getting into combat faster than
ever<00:01:25.040> before<00:01:29.110> it's<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.320> smallest<00:01:30.619> scale<00:01:30.950> map

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160

it's got two bases in two different
levels<00:01:36.070> really<00:01:37.070> great<00:01:37.280> for<00:01:37.399> for<00:01:37.610> before<00:01:37.910> and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970

is a designer the most satisfying thing

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.910 
is a designer the most satisfying thing
for<00:03:19.610> me<00:03:19.940> is<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.329> get<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.959> map<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.560> can<00:03:21.680> stand

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
for me is to get that map that can stand
