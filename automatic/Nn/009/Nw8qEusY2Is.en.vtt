weapons in this custom deal see so there

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:36.599 
weapons in this custom deal see so there
is<00:01:34.869> one<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.350> I'm<00:01:35.439> not<00:01:35.590> sure<00:01:35.889> about<00:01:36.009> and<00:01:36.429> that

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
is one that I'm not sure about and that

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.639 
is one that I'm not sure about and that
is<00:01:36.639> the<00:01:36.850> plus<00:01:37.450> 70%<00:01:38.139> critical<00:01:38.469> hit<00:01:38.619> damage

is the plus 70% critical hit damage
boost<00:01:39.329> I'm<00:01:40.329> gonna<00:01:40.719> assume<00:01:41.079> that<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.499> is<00:01:41.529> in

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:41.889 
boost I'm gonna assume that it is in

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:43.559 
boost I'm gonna assume that it is in
effect<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.579> know<00:01:42.639> it<00:01:42.789> doesn't<00:01:43.060> show<00:01:43.209> it<00:01:43.329> on<00:01:43.420> the

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
effect I know it doesn't show it on the

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:46.859 
effect I know it doesn't show it on the
item<00:01:43.810> card<00:01:44.099> but<00:01:45.099> it<00:01:45.399> could<00:01:45.670> be<00:01:45.849> a<00:01:46.119> hidden

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
item card but it could be a hidden

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.199 
item card but it could be a hidden
effect<00:01:47.319> so<00:01:47.709> I'm<00:01:48.340> just<00:01:48.579> going<00:01:48.819> to<00:01:48.849> assume<00:01:48.999> that

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
effect so I'm just going to assume that

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.690 
effect so I'm just going to assume that
it<00:01:49.749> applies<00:01:50.079> here<00:01:50.109> now<00:01:51.009> there<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.459> one<00:01:51.670> more

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
it applies here now there is one more

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.550 
it applies here now there is one more

up<00:03:23.960> right<00:03:24.960> here<00:03:24.990> I<00:03:25.200> am<00:03:25.530> using<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.190> support

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
up right here I am using the support

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.120 
up right here I am using the support
gunner<00:03:27.090> build<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.620> just<00:03:28.860> tearing

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
gunner build and it is just tearing

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.550 
gunner build and it is just tearing
through<00:03:29.280> these<00:03:29.400> guys<00:03:29.610> so<00:03:30.090> yes<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.960> is<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.380> guess

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
through these guys so yes it is I guess

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.979 
through these guys so yes it is I guess
overpowered<00:03:32.360> but<00:03:33.360> it's<00:03:33.510> not<00:03:33.630> like<00:03:33.780> super

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
overpowered but it's not like super

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.440 
overpowered but it's not like super
overpowered<00:03:34.709> or<00:03:34.860> anything<00:03:35.010> like<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.340> but<00:03:36.150> it

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
overpowered or anything like that but it

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.470 
overpowered or anything like that but it
definitely<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.140> up<00:03:37.380> there<00:03:37.709> for<00:03:37.980> sure<00:03:38.239> if<00:03:39.239> we're

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
definitely is up there for sure if we're

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.180 
definitely is up there for sure if we're
talking<00:03:39.720> about<00:03:39.810> Lilith<00:03:40.170> on<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.560> other<00:03:40.680> hands

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
talking about Lilith on the other hands

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.220

and<00:03:41.430> that's<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.850> whole<00:03:42.060> nother<00:03:42.239> thing<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.840> think

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
and that's a whole nother thing I think

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.530 
and that's a whole nother thing I think
that<00:03:43.440> would<00:03:43.650> be<00:03:43.680> over<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.340> top<00:03:44.700> o<00:03:44.970> P<00:03:45.330> if<00:03:45.510> you

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
that would be over the top o P if you

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.500 
that would be over the top o P if you
ask<00:03:45.840> me<00:03:46.110> but<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.620> haven't<00:03:47.100> tried<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.910> would

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
ask me but I haven't tried that I would

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.220 
ask me but I haven't tried that I would
like<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.810> try<00:03:49.050> it<00:03:49.110> but<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:50.160> man<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:51.959> can

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
like to try it but I man I that I can

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.470 
like to try it but I man I that I can
only<00:03:52.350> imagine<00:03:52.530> right<00:03:53.070> now<00:03:53.100> how<00:03:53.610> freaking

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
only imagine right now how freaking

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.990 
only imagine right now how freaking
devastating<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.590> gun<00:03:55.830> would<00:03:55.980> be<00:03:56.040> in<00:03:56.370> the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
devastating this gun would be in the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.600 
devastating this gun would be in the
hands<00:03:57.300> of<00:03:57.390> Lilith<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.500> really<00:03:58.890> this<00:03:59.070> this<00:03:59.130> gun

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
hands of Lilith so really this this gun

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.449 
hands of Lilith so really this this gun
right<00:04:00.150> out<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.510> gate<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.900> opie<00:04:01.350> you<00:04:02.310> can

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
right out of the gate is opie you can

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.940 
right out of the gate is opie you can
use<00:04:02.610> this<00:04:02.790> on<00:04:03.000> brick<00:04:03.380> without<00:04:04.380> really<00:04:04.709> any

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
use this on brick without really any

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.699 
use this on brick without really any
damage<00:04:05.580> increase<00:04:06.000> skills<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.170> feel<00:04:07.440> that

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
damage increase skills and I feel that

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.199 
damage increase skills and I feel that
it<00:04:07.860> would<00:04:08.010> just<00:04:08.280> destroy<00:04:08.459> just<00:04:09.000> like<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
it would just destroy just like the

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.920 
it would just destroy just like the
Hellfire<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.830> I<00:04:10.830> think<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.940> bad<00:04:12.120> touch<00:04:12.480> which

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
Hellfire and I think the bad touch which

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.449 
Hellfire and I think the bad touch which
is<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.560> gun<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:13.739> covered<00:04:14.100> in<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.250> first

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
is the gun I covered in the first

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.659 
is the gun I covered in the first
episode<00:04:14.970> was<00:04:15.590> almost<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.769> same<00:04:16.980> way<00:04:17.190> because

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
episode was almost the same way because

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.539 
episode was almost the same way because
they<00:04:17.880> really<00:04:18.390> actually<00:04:18.780> are<00:04:19.250> super<00:04:20.250> alike

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
they really actually are super alike

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.600 
they really actually are super alike
it's<00:04:21.269> just<00:04:21.540> this<00:04:21.690> one<00:04:21.959> comes<00:04:22.260> in<00:04:22.500> shock<00:04:23.280> while

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
it's just this one comes in shock while

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.390 
it's just this one comes in shock while
the<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.240> bad<00:04:24.480> touch<00:04:24.780> comes<00:04:25.140> in<00:04:25.320> corrosive<00:04:25.710> I'd

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
the the bad touch comes in corrosive I'd

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.700 
the the bad touch comes in corrosive I'd
say<00:04:26.640> this<00:04:26.790> one<00:04:27.030> is<00:04:27.060> better<00:04:27.510> though<00:04:27.810> since<00:04:28.200> it's

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
say this one is better though since it's

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.130 
say this one is better though since it's
effective<00:04:29.310> against<00:04:29.790> a<00:04:29.910> lot<00:04:30.060> more<00:04:30.300> different

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
effective against a lot more different

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.200 
effective against a lot more different
enemies<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.710> that's<00:04:31.860> that's<00:04:32.220> kind<00:04:32.460> of<00:04:32.550> why<00:04:32.820> I

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
enemies and that's that's kind of why I

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.529 
enemies and that's that's kind of why I
think<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.810> good<00:04:33.990> touch<00:04:34.580> is<00:04:35.580> better<00:04:35.910> than<00:04:36.330> the

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
think the good touch is better than the

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.500 
think the good touch is better than the
bad<00:04:36.780> touch<00:04:37.140> in<00:04:37.350> this<00:04:37.470> case<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:39.060> bad<00:04:39.210> touch

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
bad touch in this case the bad touch

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.900 
bad touch in this case the bad touch
really<00:04:40.200> only<00:04:40.500> is<00:04:40.770> effective<00:04:41.280> against<00:04:41.550> like

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
really only is effective against like

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.060 
really only is effective against like
Lance<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.690> enemies<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:43.590> are<00:04:43.680> vulnerable<00:04:43.800> to

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
Lance and enemies that are vulnerable to

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.880 
Lance and enemies that are vulnerable to
corrosive<00:04:44.540> it's<00:04:45.540> not<00:04:45.690> too<00:04:46.230> effective<00:04:46.380> against

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
corrosive it's not too effective against

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:47.840 
corrosive it's not too effective against
bandits

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
bandits

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.910 
bandits
I'd<00:04:48.060> say<00:04:48.360> it's<00:04:48.690> it<00:04:48.930> just<00:04:49.140> comes<00:04:49.350> down<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.590> that

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
I'd say it's it just comes down to that

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.640 
I'd say it's it just comes down to that
if<00:04:49.950> we<00:04:50.340> were<00:04:50.460> comparing<00:04:51.020> both<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.230> good<00:04:52.410> touch

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
if we were comparing both the good touch

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.990 
if we were comparing both the good touch
in<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.860> bad<00:04:53.010> touch<00:04:53.250> but<00:04:53.460> really<00:04:53.670> that's<00:04:53.790> not

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
in the bad touch but really that's not

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.550 
in the bad touch but really that's not
what<00:04:54.210> we're<00:04:54.330> here<00:04:54.360> about<00:04:54.600> I<00:04:54.720> should<00:04:55.230> be<00:04:55.350> just

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
what we're here about I should be just

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.230 
what we're here about I should be just
reviewing<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.130> good<00:04:56.430> touch<00:04:56.640> not<00:04:56.970> really

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
reviewing the good touch not really

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.850 
reviewing the good touch not really
going<00:04:57.750> into<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.020> bad<00:04:58.170> touch<00:04:58.440> since<00:04:58.710> I've

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
going into the bad touch since I've

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.740 
going into the bad touch since I've
already<00:04:59.100> covered<00:04:59.280> that<00:04:59.580> but<00:04:59.850> you<00:05:00.360> know<00:05:00.480> I<00:05:00.510> felt

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
already covered that but you know I felt

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.390 
already covered that but you know I felt
like<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:00.960> wanted<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.320> bring<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:01.770> up<00:05:01.830> since

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
like I wanted to bring that up since

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.940 
like I wanted to bring that up since
they're<00:05:02.880> both<00:05:03.090> really<00:05:03.510> similar<00:05:03.780> now<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.530> didn't

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
they're both really similar now I didn't

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.860 
they're both really similar now I didn't
really<00:05:04.980> get<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.310> mention<00:05:05.670> this<00:05:05.820> but<00:05:06.450> just<00:05:06.750> in

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
really get to mention this but just in

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.420 
really get to mention this but just in
case<00:05:06.900> you<00:05:07.110> didn't<00:05:07.320> notice<00:05:07.470> I<00:05:07.740> did<00:05:07.920> switch<00:05:08.100> over

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
case you didn't notice I did switch over

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.490 
case you didn't notice I did switch over
to<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.820> heavy<00:05:09.060> gun<00:05:09.300> or<00:05:09.420> calm<00:05:09.630> before<00:05:10.230> I

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
to the heavy gun or calm before I

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.010 
to the heavy gun or calm before I
entered<00:05:10.860> this<00:05:11.010> area<00:05:11.160> so<00:05:11.720> yes<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.900> definitely

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
entered this area so yes it definitely

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.610 
entered this area so yes it definitely
does<00:05:13.440> increase<00:05:13.920> the<00:05:13.980> damage<00:05:14.490> output<00:05:14.700> and<00:05:15.620> you

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
does increase the damage output and you

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.350 
does increase the damage output and you
can<00:05:16.800> tell<00:05:16.980> that<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.220> fire<00:05:17.460> rate<00:05:17.700> is<00:05:17.880> is<00:05:18.180> over

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
can tell that the fire rate is is over

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.010 
can tell that the fire rate is is over
the<00:05:18.570> top

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
the top

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.510 
the top
especially<00:05:19.530> after<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:19.770> get<00:05:19.950> that<00:05:20.070> kill<00:05:20.310> skill

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
especially after I get that kill skill

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.070 
especially after I get that kill skill
going<00:05:20.850> the<00:05:21.240> killer<00:05:21.450> skill<00:05:21.630> I'm<00:05:21.720> talking<00:05:22.020> about

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
going the killer skill I'm talking about

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.410 
going the killer skill I'm talking about
i<00:05:22.260> think<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.770> meddlesome<00:05:23.490> i<00:05:23.880> could<00:05:24.120> be<00:05:24.240> wrong

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
i think is meddlesome i could be wrong

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.780 
i think is meddlesome i could be wrong
but<00:05:25.010> basically<00:05:26.010> it's<00:05:26.190> just<00:05:26.250> when<00:05:26.520> i<00:05:26.550> get<00:05:26.760> a

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
but basically it's just when i get a

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.530 
but basically it's just when i get a
kill<00:05:27.060> my<00:05:28.050> fire<00:05:28.290> rate<00:05:28.470> increases<00:05:29.010> even<00:05:29.460> more<00:05:29.580> so

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
kill my fire rate increases even more so

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.020 
kill my fire rate increases even more so
that's<00:05:30.990> stacking<00:05:31.650> with<00:05:31.920> the<00:05:32.520> heavy<00:05:32.730> gunner

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
that's stacking with the heavy gunner

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.360 
that's stacking with the heavy gunner
calm<00:05:33.330> which<00:05:34.170> I<00:05:34.290> believe<00:05:34.530> increases<00:05:34.980> my<00:05:35.100> fiery

fire rate that this gun has just makes
it<00:05:50.280> is<00:05:50.820> devastating<00:05:51.630> and<00:05:52.100> I'm<00:05:53.100> not<00:05:53.310> even

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
it is devastating and I'm not even

just<00:05:59.100> don't<00:05:59.730> even<00:05:59.820> know<00:05:59.940> if<00:06:00.240> you<00:06:00.600> could<00:06:00.720> just

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
just don't even know if you could just

just don't even know if you could just
tell<00:06:01.140> from<00:06:01.200> this<00:06:01.530> gameplay<00:06:01.740> that<00:06:01.950> it's

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
tell from this gameplay that it's

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.430 
tell from this gameplay that it's
tearing<00:06:02.550> up<00:06:02.700> so<00:06:03.030> I<00:06:03.270> think<00:06:03.780> what<00:06:04.050> I<00:06:04.080> said<00:06:04.320> about

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
tearing up so I think what I said about

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.850 
tearing up so I think what I said about
it<00:06:04.980> earlier<00:06:05.400> and<00:06:05.730> how<00:06:06.450> I<00:06:06.990> said<00:06:07.410> it<00:06:07.500> was<00:06:07.620> just

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
it earlier and how I said it was just

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.040 
it earlier and how I said it was just
Opie<00:06:08.220> and<00:06:08.400> not<00:06:08.520> really<00:06:08.850> ope<00:06:09.210> I<00:06:09.480> think<00:06:09.750> I<00:06:09.840> take

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
Opie and not really ope I think I take

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.100 
Opie and not really ope I think I take
that<00:06:10.290> back<00:06:10.530> now<00:06:10.800> because<00:06:11.810> this<00:06:12.810> right<00:06:13.050> here

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
that back now because this right here

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.980 
that back now because this right here
just<00:06:13.530> goes<00:06:13.830> to<00:06:14.040> show<00:06:14.220> that<00:06:14.250> this<00:06:14.610> gun<00:06:14.880> I<00:06:15.180> think

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
just goes to show that this gun I think

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.380 
just goes to show that this gun I think
