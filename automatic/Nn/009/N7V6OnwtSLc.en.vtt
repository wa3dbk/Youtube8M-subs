appointment and I'm probably gonna have
her<00:00:57.319> check<00:00:57.559> me<00:00:57.769> she<00:00:57.920> didn't<00:00:58.159> check<00:00:58.309> me<00:00:58.550> at<00:00:59.089> my

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
her check me she didn't check me at my

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.430 
her check me she didn't check me at my
37<00:00:59.960> week<00:01:00.109> appointment<00:01:00.649> she<00:01:01.249> didn't<00:01:01.489> even<00:01:01.550> ask

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
37 week appointment she didn't even ask

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.670 
37 week appointment she didn't even ask
if<00:01:03.440> I<00:01:03.859> wanted<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.220> be<00:01:04.309> checked<00:01:04.580> or<00:01:04.729> anything

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
if I wanted to be checked or anything

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.959 
if I wanted to be checked or anything
but<00:01:06.680> I<00:01:06.710> think<00:01:06.860> that's<00:01:07.159> cuz<00:01:07.340> she's<00:01:07.579> a<00:01:07.610> midwife

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
but I think that's cuz she's a midwife

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.609 
but I think that's cuz she's a midwife
and<00:01:08.299> she<00:01:08.360> takes<00:01:08.479> a<00:01:08.600> more<00:01:08.719> natural<00:01:09.170> approach<00:01:09.320> so

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
and she takes a more natural approach so

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.740 
and she takes a more natural approach so
she<00:01:09.680> doesn't<00:01:09.950> check<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:11.060> unless<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:11.570> really

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
she doesn't check you unless you really

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.840 
she doesn't check you unless you really
want<00:01:11.869> to<00:01:12.200> be<00:01:12.320> or<00:01:12.530> if<00:01:12.619> she<00:01:12.770> unless<00:01:13.280> she<00:01:13.520> finds

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
want to be or if she unless she finds

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.249 
want to be or if she unless she finds
that<00:01:14.000> there's<00:01:14.270> a<00:01:14.390> reason<00:01:14.659> that<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:14.899> do<00:01:15.079> need

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
two or three weeks ago I was getting

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.700 
two or three weeks ago I was getting
them<00:02:37.510> like<00:02:37.690> every<00:02:37.960> single<00:02:38.110> day<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.590> seems

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
them like every single day and it seems

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.350 
them like every single day and it seems
like<00:02:38.920> they've<00:02:39.130> kind<00:02:39.490> of<00:02:39.580> slowed<00:02:39.880> down<00:02:40.120> now

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
like they've kind of slowed down now

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.170 
like they've kind of slowed down now
like<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.690> barely<00:02:41.050> ever<00:02:41.290> get<00:02:41.590> them<00:02:41.830> I<00:02:42.070> do<00:02:42.880> get

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
like I barely ever get them I do get

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.670 
like I barely ever get them I do get
them<00:02:43.270> at<00:02:43.510> night<00:02:43.870> still<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:44.530> they're

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
them at night still but they're

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.980 
them at night still but they're
definitely<00:02:44.860> not<00:02:45.220> like<00:02:45.970> there's<00:02:46.420> not<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.600> ton<00:02:46.960> of

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
definitely not like there's not a ton of

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.450 
definitely not like there's not a ton of
them<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.320> they're<00:02:47.410> not<00:02:47.440> consistent<00:02:48.220> at<00:02:48.340> all

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
them and they're not consistent at all

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.880 
them and they're not consistent at all
so<00:02:48.820> he<00:02:49.480> could<00:02:49.660> definitely<00:02:49.870> still<00:02:50.410> be<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.680> there

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
so he could definitely still be in there

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.530 
so he could definitely still be in there
for<00:02:51.160> another<00:02:51.220> two<00:02:51.640> or<00:02:51.790> three<00:02:52.000> more<00:02:52.240> weeks

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
for another two or three more weeks

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.930 
for another two or three more weeks

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
which had really hoping he's not because

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.990 
which had really hoping he's not because
it<00:02:55.060> was<00:02:55.209> so<00:02:55.450> hard<00:02:55.660> going<00:02:56.530> past<00:02:56.890> 41<00:02:57.310> weeks<00:02:57.670> with

Caden and I'm really hoping Remington

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.970
