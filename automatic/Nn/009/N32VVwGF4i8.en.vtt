going to be getting 99 cooking because

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.860 
going to be getting 99 cooking because
99<00:02:40.670> cooking<00:02:41.060> believe<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.390> or<00:02:41.450> not<00:02:41.600> has<00:02:41.840> a

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
99 cooking believe it or not has a

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.950 
99 cooking believe it or not has a
profit<00:02:42.440> margin<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.100> about<00:02:43.190> 10<00:02:43.700> mil<00:02:44.000> once<00:02:44.750> you

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
profit margin of about 10 mil once you

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.380 
profit margin of about 10 mil once you
hit<00:02:45.110> good<00:02:45.470> sharks<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.220> hopefully<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.150> make

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
hit good sharks and hopefully I make

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.210 
hit good sharks and hopefully I make
some<00:02:47.540> moolah<00:02:47.840> not<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.560> mention<00:02:48.740> I<00:02:48.920> think<00:02:49.130> it's

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
some moolah not to mention I think it's

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.730 
some moolah not to mention I think it's
time<00:02:49.370> for<00:02:49.400> skill<00:02:49.850> cape<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:51.320> think<00:02:51.590> would

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
time for skill cape and I think would

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.260 
time for skill cape and I think would
probably<00:02:52.070> most<00:02:52.220> likely<00:02:52.280> take<00:02:52.640> me<00:02:52.790> longer<00:02:53.060> to

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
probably most likely take me longer to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.949 
probably most likely take me longer to
get<00:02:53.930> 99<00:02:54.290> attack<00:02:54.770> or<00:02:55.010> strength<00:02:55.280> or<00:02:55.459> etc<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.270> I

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
get 99 attack or strength or etc and I

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.390 
get 99 attack or strength or etc and I
kind<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:57.350> just<00:02:57.500> really<00:02:57.770> want<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.040> follow<00:02:58.250> the
