00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.860 
so long as it is horror mystery or
science<00:03:07.209> fiction<00:03:07.659> and<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.829> will<00:03:09.480> watch<00:03:10.480> it<00:03:10.510> and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
science fiction and I will watch it and

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.059 
science fiction and I will watch it and
give<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.530> review<00:03:13.409> even<00:03:14.409> if<00:03:14.590> it's<00:03:14.829> this<00:03:15.430> odd<00:03:15.819> and

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
give a review even if it's this odd and

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.229 
give a review even if it's this odd and
by<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.099> way<00:03:18.220> I'm<00:03:18.459> sorry<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:18.879> didn't<00:03:19.120> have<00:03:19.209> a

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
by the way I'm sorry I didn't have a

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.069 
by the way I'm sorry I didn't have a
trailer<00:03:19.720> again<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.519> couldn't<00:03:21.519> find<00:03:21.730> this<00:03:21.849> I<00:03:22.079> saw

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
trailer again I couldn't find this I saw

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:29.460 
trailer again I couldn't find this I saw
it<00:03:23.349> on<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:24.760> sci-fi<00:03:25.150> or<00:03:25.629> chiller<00:03:26.019> and<00:03:26.639> I<00:03:28.470> don't

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
it on like sci-fi or chiller and I don't

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.229 
it on like sci-fi or chiller and I don't
think<00:03:29.650> there<00:03:29.799> is<00:03:29.829> a<00:03:30.010> trailer<00:03:30.549> for<00:03:30.760> this<00:03:31.030> though

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
think there is a trailer for this though

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.689 
think there is a trailer for this though
they<00:03:31.419> had<00:03:31.569> plenty<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:31.989> trailers<00:03:32.530> on<00:03:32.799> TV<00:03:33.400> so<00:03:33.669> i

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:33.699 
they had plenty of trailers on TV so i

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.319 
they had plenty of trailers on TV so i
don't<00:03:34.090> know<00:03:34.209> why<00:03:34.359> i<00:03:34.389> can't<00:03:34.780> find<00:03:34.989> those
