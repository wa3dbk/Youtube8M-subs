00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:07.559 
color theory is something that has

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.039 
color theory is something that has
thanked<00:00:08.400> me<00:00:08.519> for<00:00:08.549> ages<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.209> don't<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:09.840> any

the<00:00:19.890> idea<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.490> since<00:00:21.480> I'm<00:00:21.779> not

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:22.019 
the idea is that since I'm not

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:23.749 
the idea is that since I'm not
tremendously<00:00:22.650> well<00:00:22.859> versed<00:00:23.099> in<00:00:23.220> color<00:00:23.429> theory

if I can get it out quickly and in front
of<00:00:27.119> me<00:00:27.239> I<00:00:27.269> can<00:00:27.599> visualize<00:00:27.900> all<00:00:28.169> of<00:00:28.289> my<00:00:28.409> colors

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

always feel free to rotate your

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.110 
always feel free to rotate your
miniature<00:01:00.890> if<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.160> need<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.550> change<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
miniature if you need to change the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.810 
miniature if you need to change the
angle<00:01:03.650> drawing<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.829> brush<00:01:05.009> towards<00:01:05.460> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
angle drawing the brush towards you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.800 
angle drawing the brush towards you
makes<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.689> much<00:01:07.049> easier<00:01:07.520> brushstroke<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.540> I'm

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
makes a much easier brushstroke so I'm

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.490 
makes a much easier brushstroke so I'm
going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> come<00:01:10.350> back<00:01:10.790> to<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.909> area<00:01:12.500> down

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
going to come back to this area down

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
going to come back to this area down
here<00:01:13.560> at<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> base<00:01:14.370> I'm<00:01:16.370> bouncing<00:01:17.370> all<00:01:17.490> over

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
here at the base I'm bouncing all over

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.640 
here at the base I'm bouncing all over
the<00:01:17.730> place<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.480> is<00:01:18.630> my<00:01:18.750> normal<00:01:19.110> painting

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the place this is my normal painting

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.390 
the place this is my normal painting
habit<00:01:20.240> usually<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.650> work<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.830> something<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
habit usually I work on something and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.180 
habit usually I work on something and
then<00:01:23.610> oh<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.510> it's<00:01:25.470> wet<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:26.010> to<00:01:26.100> go

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
then oh it's it's wet I have to go

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.940 
then oh it's it's wet I have to go
somewhere<00:01:26.430> else

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
somewhere else

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.580 
somewhere else
so<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.340> don't<00:01:29.909> spend<00:01:30.270> too<00:01:30.690> long<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.080> any<00:01:31.350> one

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
so I don't spend too long on any one

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.950 
so I don't spend too long on any one
place<00:01:32.040> consecutively<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.780> then<00:01:33.930> I

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
place consecutively I go here and then I

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.140 
place consecutively I go here and then I
go<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.409> then<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.620> go<00:01:34.740> back<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.920> forth<00:01:35.150> so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
go there and then I go back and forth so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240 
go there and then I go back and forth so
the<00:01:36.840> next<00:01:37.049> step<00:01:37.229> I've<00:01:37.409> got<00:01:37.590> my<00:01:37.710> basic<00:01:38.010> shapes

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the next step I've got my basic shapes

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.200 
the next step I've got my basic shapes
blocked<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.729> I'm<00:01:39.210> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.290> add<00:01:40.409> dots<00:01:41.210> adding

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
blocked in I'm going to add dots adding

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.020 
blocked in I'm going to add dots adding
dots<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:43.130> one<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> more<00:01:44.460> enjoyable<00:01:44.549> things

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
dots is one of the more enjoyable things

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.780 
dots is one of the more enjoyable things
it's<00:01:45.750> pretty<00:01:45.930> simple<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.650> do<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> very

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it's pretty simple you do it with a very

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.370 
it's pretty simple you do it with a very
light<00:01:47.940> touch<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.460> tap<00:01:50.460> tap<00:01:51.150> tap<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
light touch you just go tap tap tap the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.109 
light touch you just go tap tap tap the
lighter<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.740> tap<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.280> smaller<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.760> dot<00:01:53.940> is

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
lighter you tap the smaller the dot is

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.820 
lighter you tap the smaller the dot is
so<00:01:54.570> that's<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.900> mighty<00:01:55.080> tap<00:01:55.320> than<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> other

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
so that's a mighty tap than the other

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.289 
so that's a mighty tap than the other
ones

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.749 

I<00:02:02.170> think<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.350> works<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.220> viewer<00:02:04.460> we

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
I think that works so the viewer we

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.420 
I think that works so the viewer we
purposely<00:02:05.329> took<00:02:05.509> this<00:02:05.689> out<00:02:05.869> of<00:02:05.899> focus<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:07.189> so

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
purposely took this out of focus and so

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.919 
purposely took this out of focus and so
that<00:02:07.580> way<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:07.790> can<00:02:08.000> kind<00:02:08.239> of<00:02:08.300> see<00:02:08.479> this<00:02:08.660> is<00:02:08.720> the

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
that way you can kind of see this is the

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.630 
that way you can kind of see this is the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
and you can see on the corners of the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.199 
and you can see on the corners of the
helmet<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.099> can<00:02:13.459> see<00:02:13.580> on<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.730> top<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.090> his

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
helmet you can see on the top of his

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.670 
helmet you can see on the top of his
breastplate<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.930> where<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> Sun<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:15.590> gonna

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
breastplate and where the Sun is gonna

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.530 
breastplate and where the Sun is gonna
hit<00:02:16.069> now<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:16.819> made<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.060> blurry<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.420> can

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
hit now that we made it blurry you can

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.610 
hit now that we made it blurry you can
kind<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.780> see<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.200> actually<00:02:18.290> looks

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
kind of see that it actually looks

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.290 
kind of see that it actually looks
brighter<00:02:18.980> because<00:02:19.670> like<00:02:19.940> you're<00:02:20.090> squinting

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
brighter because like you're squinting

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.020 
brighter because like you're squinting
at<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.720> it's<00:02:20.900> further<00:02:21.140> away<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:22.340> I'm<00:02:22.700> just

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
at it it's further away so I'm just

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.330 
at it it's further away so I'm just
painting<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:24.019> in<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:27.620> first<00:02:27.890> step<00:02:28.099> of<00:02:28.280> the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
painting this in the first step of the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.229 
painting this in the first step of the
layer<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:28.790> kind<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.780> just<00:02:29.989> put<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.349> stripe<00:02:30.650> down

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
layer is kind of just put a stripe down

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.789 
layer is kind of just put a stripe down
so<00:02:32.239> that's<00:02:32.360> what<00:02:32.569> I'm<00:02:32.660> doing<00:02:32.690> here<00:02:33.019> picking

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
so that's what I'm doing here picking

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.890 
so that's what I'm doing here picking
out<00:02:33.890> his<00:02:33.980> nose<00:02:34.250> at<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:34.970> edge<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.239> his<00:02:35.330> mouth

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
out his nose at the edge of his mouth

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.309 
out his nose at the edge of his mouth
little<00:02:36.410> rims<00:02:37.100> up<00:02:37.280> here<00:02:37.459> on<00:02:37.549> his<00:02:37.610> eyes<00:02:37.930> well<00:02:38.930> I'm

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
little rims up here on his eyes well I'm

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.220 
little rims up here on his eyes well I'm
going<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.040> come<00:02:40.220> in<00:02:43.299> and<00:02:44.299> give<00:02:44.750> him<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.989> black

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
going to come in and give him a black

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:58.000 
going to come in and give him a black
slip<00:02:45.650> right<00:02:45.830> there

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.480 

for<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.820> time<00:02:59.120> there<00:02:59.390> I<00:03:00.050> was<00:03:00.740> really<00:03:01.220> struggling

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
for a time there I was really struggling

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.520 
for a time there I was really struggling
with<00:03:01.760> my<00:03:01.880> nonmetallic<00:03:02.180> metal<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.170> then<00:03:03.500> I

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
with my nonmetallic metal and then I

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.370 
with my nonmetallic metal and then I
realized<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:04.280> if<00:03:04.430> I<00:03:04.610> mixed<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.600> Grays<00:03:05.810> using

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
realized that if I mixed the Grays using

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.650 
realized that if I mixed the Grays using
colors<00:03:06.740> elsewhere<00:03:07.550> in<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.730> guinea<00:03:07.880> pig

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
colors elsewhere in the guinea pig

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.350 
colors elsewhere in the guinea pig
it<00:03:09.170> really<00:03:09.500> just<00:03:09.740> worked<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.070> lot<00:03:10.160> better<00:03:10.400> so

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
it really just worked a lot better so

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.680 
it really just worked a lot better so
the<00:03:12.350> colors<00:03:12.620> on<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.950> blade<00:03:13.160> are<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:14.060> same<00:03:14.450> as

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
the colors on the blade are the same as

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.250 
the colors on the blade are the same as
the<00:03:14.840> ones<00:03:15.020> on<00:03:15.200> his<00:03:15.350> stoop<00:03:15.650> for<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.400> most<00:03:16.580> part

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
the ones on his stoop for the most part

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.130 
the ones on his stoop for the most part
and<00:03:18.260> I've<00:03:18.710> just<00:03:19.070> mixed<00:03:19.520> them<00:03:19.760> up<00:03:19.910> together<00:03:20.180> so

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
and I've just mixed them up together so

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.120 
and I've just mixed them up together so
I<00:03:21.590> got<00:03:22.070> that<00:03:22.370> purpley<00:03:23.030> gray<00:03:23.300> with<00:03:24.110> Oxford<00:03:24.890> blue
