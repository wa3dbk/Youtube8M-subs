like<00:00:16.770> cinnamon<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:18.240> isn't<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.170> type<00:00:19.380> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
like cinnamon and this isn't the type of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.950 
like cinnamon and this isn't the type of
cinnamon<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.039> think<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.210> cinnamon<00:00:21.660> sugar

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
cinnamon you think it's a cinnamon sugar
