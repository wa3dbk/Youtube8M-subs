00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.570 
all the different sessions
the<00:02:29.230> latch<00:02:29.830> system<00:02:30.459> which<00:02:31.269> is<00:02:31.480> great

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
the latch system which is great

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.399 
the latch system which is great
goes<00:02:33.580> right<00:02:33.879> into<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.690> car<00:02:34.930> if<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.230> have<00:02:35.379> a

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.640 
goes right into the car if you have a
latch<00:02:35.709> system<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.610> guess<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.450> also<00:02:37.569> has<00:02:37.900> four

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
latch system I guess it also has four

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
latch system I guess it also has four

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.530 
know ten position harness and headrests
side-impact<00:03:14.049> tested<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:15.310> let's<00:03:16.150> see<00:03:16.390> how<00:03:16.510> it

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
side-impact tested and let's see how it

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.400 
side-impact tested and let's see how it
looks<00:03:17.430> okay<00:03:18.430> here's<00:03:18.849> a<00:03:18.910> little<00:03:19.299> model<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:20.379> I

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
looks okay here's a little model so I

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.470 
looks okay here's a little model so I
was<00:03:20.530> trying<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.739> figure<00:03:21.010> out<00:03:21.069> how<00:03:21.849> you<00:03:21.910> put<00:03:22.359> the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
was trying to figure out how you put the

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.009 
was trying to figure out how you put the
straps<00:03:22.870> up<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.650> down<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:25.269> through<00:03:25.660> here

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
straps up and down and it's through here

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.170 
straps up and down and it's through here
so<00:03:26.319> mix<00:03:27.129> down<00:03:27.310> their<00:03:27.430> height<00:03:27.640> you<00:03:27.819> can<00:03:28.000> lift

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
so mix down their height you can lift

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.319 
so mix down their height you can lift
this<00:03:28.390> up<00:03:29.040> right<00:03:30.040> down<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:30.609> it<00:03:30.760> was<00:03:30.849> really<00:03:31.120> down

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
this up right down so it was really down

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.759 
this up right down so it was really down
I'm<00:03:31.480> like<00:03:31.629> oh<00:03:31.720> my<00:03:31.870> god<00:03:32.019> how<00:03:32.169> do<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.349> get<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.650> up

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
I'm like oh my god how do you get it up

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.559 
I'm like oh my god how do you get it up
so<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.250> had<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.549> lift<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.000> little<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.540> that

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
so I had to lift it a little so that

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.520 
so I had to lift it a little so that
it's<00:03:34.959> either<00:03:35.739> at<00:03:36.099> or<00:03:36.160> above<00:03:36.730> her<00:03:37.720> shoulders

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
it's either at or above her shoulders

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.520 
it's either at or above her shoulders
I<00:03:38.819> put<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:39.940> things<00:03:40.660> in<00:03:40.900> they<00:03:41.079> just<00:03:41.260> clicked

I put the things in they just clicked
right<00:03:41.650> in<00:03:41.889> I<00:03:42.010> don't<00:03:42.069> think<00:03:42.340> they<00:03:42.430> come<00:03:42.700> back

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
right in I don't think they come back

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.909 
right in I don't think they come back
out<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:46.299> then<00:03:46.660> for<00:03:46.959> this<00:03:47.109> part<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.560> have<00:03:47.739> to

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.180 
out and then for this part you have to
pick<00:03:48.639> it<00:03:48.819> up<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.389> here<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:50.019> move<00:03:50.230> this<00:03:50.440> out<00:03:50.680> not

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190
