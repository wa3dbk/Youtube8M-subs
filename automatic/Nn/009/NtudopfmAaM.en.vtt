00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.219
 The benchmark for safety is always difficult 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.289
 again in their investigations of e on and windows we are tempted to try 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.039
 shows the couple 72 percent of all form half positions with injured 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.039
 laterally offset or Shrek are 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.399
 These are only partially over against traffic accidents 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.170
 Second vehicle fronts Voser and on quality masts 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.150
 the previous week, however, only one-sidedly aware of her 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.120
 the symmetrical frontal impact with almost full coverage makes 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.710
 By contrast, only about 28 percent of all frontal collisions 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.710
 two of these by law as a standard accident seventh sense and understood 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.440
 The impact energy is shown over the entire vehicle width 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.109
 on the other hand it was different from Holzwickede one has always fun 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.070
 so concentrated one-sided force 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.939
 In many cases, the engine is not hit by the wind here 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.410
 for vehicles with conventional construction 60 consequences 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.869
 China's on to a legal z Trischen on 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.710
 splendidly from covering the passenger compartment as a survival space for 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.460
 the inmates are largely preserved 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.250
 leaves at the stay 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.750
 with the same vehicle of the same speed 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.500
 but laterally offset 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.500
 how strong the formations are 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.310
 Hirscher area sitting driver 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.310
 considerably endangered 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.840
 this example is clearly the only legal 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.880
 Definitely the constructs we have ample 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.359
 ski star automatically 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.359
 now it should also be brought in reality 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.660
 in contrast to the xetra-conclusion of the valley impact 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.360
 the us band of the crash has the same impact energy of one essential 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.360
 be included in smaller daily mail 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.599
 the episode of three conventional construction, for example, he travels demanding 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.829
 crossbeam 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.099
 more side member is heavily deformed 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.099
 the end wall can not withstand the high loads 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:22.159
 JÃ¼lich 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.749
 Consequently, there are significant deformations, although guest room 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.959
 That's why Mercedes Benz takes his car into account when designing 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.899
 these are now first extreme load 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:42.199
 For that the tester is the boss of the industry with nearly half 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.069
 overlap 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.879
 at a speed up to 45 kilometers per hour and the straight victory 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.879
 angle of impact 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:58.140
 the highest priority is the preservation of the passenger compartment 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.819
 the survival space for the inmates too 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.859
 Buchenwald so was developed by Mercedes Benz you can Roudourou concept 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.379
 Whatever happens and material use is based only 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.379
 You can go back to coffee 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.790
 this happens on the one hand by inflows of funds 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.790
 Ford Vertrek 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.379
 through this also the side facing away from the shock of the vehicle were 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.379
 used for energy intake 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.459
 on the other hand are the one-sided by a special straight tractor 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.399
 a little break further 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.739
 on the side of bands 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.739
 and distributed the gear troop 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:52.219
 thus rest will lend real deformations in the standard range 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.339
 Not only are you shattering for a good result 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:03.849
 Structural Elements League amounts from time to time decide the cross member 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.969
 An important role also plays the answers of aggregates 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:09.489
 I feel good 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.400
 these arranged one behind the other 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.590
 arises at the dive center Steinblock which he pushes into the passenger compartment 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.979
 can 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.879
 This can be avoided by a staggered arrangement
