00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500

could<00:00:58.710> fall<00:00:58.920> off<00:00:58.949> or<00:00:59.340> even<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.699> gems<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.420> the

front<00:01:00.780> could<00:01:01.440> become<00:01:01.920> unstable<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> let's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
front could become unstable so let's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.250 
front could become unstable so let's
open<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.619> up
