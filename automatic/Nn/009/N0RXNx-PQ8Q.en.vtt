00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:44.100
 kisses from the early start of the game then and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.329
 show you then you will do 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.500
 the exchange of quests 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.809
 I will take the lead she will die 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.320
 the fire from heaven was going to take a ford to 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.140
 the door 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.770
 you put everything in normal difficulty 3 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.030
 and worried and let's go go hop 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.900
 gold the goal of Switzerland will be to go see 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:12.600
 task a deminer our merchants 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.600
 favorite and especially cow you're just 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.009
 before the stf here is a little I have the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.330
 luck 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.240
 here it is this staff the powder htl 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.390
 it's cheaper there is 4 167 p 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.020
 o 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.350
 good at least the cheapest 465 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.720
 good is not theo close then the put 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.790
 we live your inventory because there 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.490
 we invented thinking I 'm going to sell that 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.470
 no use hop on the goals you in 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.310
 buy a maximum 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.490
 why because after we go 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.610
 recycle then we will see the function 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.170
 which is just below we go and we 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.770
 recycle all of that then the eight nations 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.619
 you will have understood to sell the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.299
 products that have been recycled that 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.689
 could see that gives essences a 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.119
 subtle but we sell exchanges are 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.090
 of course both leaving subtle more 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.560
 tear teeth then the goal 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.140
 special but 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:14.110
 December 10 at the auction house it's this 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.520
 who pays the most no times too 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.690
 waste the ranks could do 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.530
 will see to see for us really 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.330
 really really a lot less 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:28.060
 so what are we going to do we will do a 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:31.989
 blood stage in the name the aja on 25 you 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.300
 show exactly the expenses to you 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.140
 have done so unstable blood 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.120
 laurent gap 4 167 countries where the stuff but 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:48.489
 I share without you are at 46 1700 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:52.860
 theo finished them all and I served 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.860
 for magic we will accelerate his pocket 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:48.659
 so here are these finished at the small the 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:52.090
 porter in front of the auction house 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:56.200
 it is selling all this then all you 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:00.129
 the price the price 8 112 72 was not too much 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.579
 bad knowing he is the lowest 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.870
 currently that i use a round of 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.090
 720p or in May spring that I have 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.560
 started at technical cpt because I 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.180
 am not the experience of a bo3 i do 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.530
 just share my knowledge 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:19.329
 an experience I started in mid-July 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:22.120
 in this not very long time and so 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.340
 I sold them in a tour 2010 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.639
 is it really much 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:31.900
 beneficial but hey there rents the 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:34.479
 total 80 a 1200 entries that it takes 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:42.740
 know that afterwards you have to deduct 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:49.490
 fees of 15% so 4200 mons and 15% 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:52.880
 we calculate and are waiting for that 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.680
 so we can see already sold there so the 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:03.160
 final price however I think around 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:06.110
 this price the trace 69000 71000 the year to 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:10.639
 so predict the meniscus benefits that 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:13.759
 you will not have done well and that's okay 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.380
 wait for the sale knowing that we can 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.630
 sell 5 minutes how an hour two 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.659
 hours and if you really see it at the end 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.569
 of its fors four hours on 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.680
 did not want to sold you canceled the sale 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:29.870
 if you redo a sale it's 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:41.419
 possible the price so here we are 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:44.930
 find a good time then we 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.490
 back to see what happened good 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.500
 the sale was made it lasted less 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:54.289
 of one of the best guides because 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:58.930
 I'll eat the meantime we finished 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:03.259
 can see hop it's 15% of fees 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:06.139
 so sales hotel has these are nine 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:08.729
 one thousand and twenty 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:12.150
 a profit of 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:15.120
 more than 22 million exactly so 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.800
 it's not bad at all so I 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.569
 started this technique 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.699
 when I was 50 miles from the waters and in 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:26.900
 knowing that I am is made to fake 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:30.839
 I did I won at least 200 miles 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:34.289
 and more, but frankly you have 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:37.889
 400 kg stop doing that night that a 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:40.069
 I had my first millions of passes 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:45.240
 capra after you have that it's 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:48.449
 relatively for business ch'ti 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.860
 relatively the world to win 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.219
 thousands as many amounts of money 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.870
 so here I hope this ozap tutorial 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:56.699
 unesco has tried your comments and 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.180
 your impressions are coming soon 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.180
