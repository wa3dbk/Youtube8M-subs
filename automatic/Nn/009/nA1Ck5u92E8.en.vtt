00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
equally as entertaining even though I

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.410 
equally as entertaining even though I
feel<00:02:23.900> like<00:02:24.080> it's<00:02:24.290> going<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.680> be<00:02:24.830> similar<00:02:25.820> very

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
feel like it's going to be similar very

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.410 
feel like it's going to be similar very
similar<00:02:26.510> because<00:02:27.110> it's<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:28.070> think<00:02:28.370> it's<00:02:28.550> tough

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
similar because it's I think it's tough

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.790 
similar because it's I think it's tough
it's<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.690> modern<00:02:29.960> storytelling<00:02:30.770> but<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.670> said

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
it's a modern storytelling but it said

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.380 
it's a modern storytelling but it said
Talia<00:02:33.800> fella<00:02:34.040> Phil<00:02:34.370> endure<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.640> spell<00:02:34.970> Jack

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
Talia fella Phil endure a spell Jack

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.260 
Talia fella Phil endure a spell Jack
broke<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.750> curse<00:02:35.930> on<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.350> back<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.710> so<00:02:37.310> I'm

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
broke the curse on the back and so I'm

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.420 
broke the curse on the back and so I'm
thinking<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:39.350> it's<00:02:39.710> going<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.070> have<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.250> do

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
thinking that it's going to have to do

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.260 
thinking that it's going to have to do
with<00:02:41.200> love<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.560> breaking<00:02:43.190> spells<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:43.850> magic

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
with love and breaking spells and magic

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.300 
with love and breaking spells and magic
and<00:02:44.450> that's<00:02:45.020> that's<00:02:45.290> very<00:02:45.470> similar<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.070> be

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
and that's that's very similar to be

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.130 
and that's that's very similar to be
sleep<00:02:46.610> which<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.000> bad<00:02:47.240> I<00:02:47.480> think<00:02:47.780> those<00:02:47.930> books

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
sleep which is a bad I think those books

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.690 
sleep which is a bad I think those books
are<00:02:48.260> kind<00:02:48.710> of<00:02:48.770> entertaining<00:02:49.190> like<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.520> said

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
are kind of entertaining like I said

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.510 
are kind of entertaining like I said
before<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:50.870> think<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.560> should<00:02:51.740> read<00:02:51.950> some<00:02:52.250> that

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
before I think you should read some that

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.060 
before I think you should read some that
are<00:02:52.640> kind<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:52.910> lighter<00:02:53.210> and<00:02:53.540> not<00:02:54.530> read<00:02:54.770> like

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
are kind of lighter and not read like

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.580 
are kind of lighter and not read like
hope<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.490> heavy<00:02:55.670> books<00:02:55.910> because<00:02:56.270> I<00:02:56.480> read<00:02:57.110> two

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
hope to heavy books because I read two

hope to heavy books because I read two
very<00:02:58.040> very<00:02:58.300> emotional<00:02:59.300> books<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.750> like<00:03:00.350> one
