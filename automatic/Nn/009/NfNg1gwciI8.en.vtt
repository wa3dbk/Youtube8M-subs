00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.750 
scenes interesting and I was really
impressed<00:02:56.739> by<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:56.920> way<00:02:57.010> he<00:02:57.130> did<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.400> now<00:02:57.610> it's

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
impressed by the way he did it now it's

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.160 
impressed by the way he did it now it's
kind<00:02:57.819> of<00:02:58.000> dumb<00:02:58.209> about<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.629> movie<00:02:58.900> is<00:02:59.019> it

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
kind of dumb about this movie is it

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.960 
kind of dumb about this movie is it
falls<00:02:59.410> under<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.799> cliche<00:03:00.310> where<00:03:00.579> if<00:03:00.819> a

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
falls under that cliche where if a

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.240 
falls under that cliche where if a
character<00:03:01.420> were<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:01.780> just<00:03:02.019> say<00:03:02.290> one<00:03:02.680> sentence

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
character were to just say one sentence

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.250 
character were to just say one sentence
the<00:03:03.880> entire<00:03:04.180> movie<00:03:04.480> would<00:03:04.600> be<00:03:04.630> over<00:03:05.019> and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
the entire movie would be over and

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.690 
the entire movie would be over and
everything<00:03:05.620> would<00:03:05.739> be<00:03:05.859> resolved<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.459> would<00:03:06.579> be

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
everything would be resolved it would be

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.640 
everything would be resolved it would be
really<00:03:06.970> awkward<00:03:07.180> but<00:03:08.049> there<00:03:08.260> would<00:03:08.410> be<00:03:08.440> no

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
really awkward but there would be no

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.870 
really awkward but there would be no
more<00:03:08.799> movie<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.280> all<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.459> guy<00:03:09.639> really<00:03:09.790> has

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
more movie and all this guy really has

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.550 
more movie and all this guy really has
to<00:03:10.090> do<00:03:10.209> is<00:03:10.329> say<00:03:10.510> you're<00:03:10.870> my<00:03:10.989> sister<00:03:11.319> I'm<00:03:11.530> your

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
to do is say you're my sister I'm your

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.110 
to do is say you're my sister I'm your
brother<00:03:11.920> but<00:03:12.130> he<00:03:12.190> just<00:03:12.370> can't<00:03:12.579> find<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.030> in

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
brother but he just can't find it in

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.970 
brother but he just can't find it in
himself<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.600> figure<00:03:13.900> out<00:03:14.049> when<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.530> say<00:03:14.739> that

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
himself to figure out when to say that

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.770 
himself to figure out when to say that
and<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.519> movie<00:03:15.760> keeps<00:03:15.970> going<00:03:16.359> and<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.600> does

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
and so the movie keeps going and it does

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.449 
and so the movie keeps going and it does
seem<00:03:17.019> really<00:03:17.319> unrealistic<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:18.069> a<00:03:18.100> person

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
seem really unrealistic that a person

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.949 
seem really unrealistic that a person
wouldn't<00:03:18.670> say<00:03:18.880> look<00:03:19.090> we<00:03:19.239> need<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.480> talk<00:03:19.720> and

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
wouldn't say look we need to talk and

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.840 
wouldn't say look we need to talk and
just<00:03:20.109> say<00:03:20.380> it<00:03:20.530> at<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.799> same<00:03:21.069> time<00:03:21.430> though<00:03:21.700> the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
just say it at the same time though the

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.030 
just say it at the same time though the
movie<00:03:22.209> was<00:03:22.389> able<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.750> realistically<00:03:23.650> find

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
movie was able to realistically find

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.580 
movie was able to realistically find
ways<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.370> make<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:25.150> seem<00:03:25.420> like<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:26.260> makes

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
ways to make it seem like this makes

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.289 
ways to make it seem like this makes
some<00:03:26.950> sense<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.760> was<00:03:27.850> really<00:03:28.060> my<00:03:28.180> main

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
some sense that was really my main

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.520 
some sense that was really my main
problem<00:03:28.660> with<00:03:28.750> this<00:03:28.840> movie<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.139> kept<00:03:29.319> telling

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
problem with this movie I kept telling

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.809 
problem with this movie I kept telling
to<00:03:29.680> be<00:03:29.769> like<00:03:29.889> look<00:03:30.040> dude<00:03:30.160> just<00:03:30.220> say<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.670> just

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
to be like look dude just say it just

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.059 
to be like look dude just say it just
tell<00:03:31.090> her<00:03:31.180> now<00:03:31.630> at<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.230> same<00:03:32.440> time<00:03:32.739> though<00:03:32.920> it

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
tell her now at the same time though it

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.039 
tell her now at the same time though it
did<00:03:33.310> kind<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.730> add<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.329> movie<00:03:34.599> because<00:03:34.870> it

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
did kind of add to the movie because it

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.020 
did kind of add to the movie because it
gave<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.620> scenes<00:03:35.889> an<00:03:36.040> extra<00:03:36.340> bit<00:03:36.489> of<00:03:36.519> tension

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
gave the scenes an extra bit of tension

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.280 
gave the scenes an extra bit of tension
because<00:03:37.090> he<00:03:37.299> kept<00:03:37.540> seeming<00:03:37.900> like<00:03:37.989> he<00:03:38.170> was

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
because he kept seeming like he was

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.990 
because he kept seeming like he was
about<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.889> know<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:39.370> like<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.700> kind<00:03:39.910> of

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
about to you know and I like the kind of

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.879 
about to you know and I like the kind of
twisted<00:03:40.510> style<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.109> movie<00:03:41.380> had<00:03:41.530> because<00:03:41.769> you

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
twisted style the movie had because you

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.830 
twisted style the movie had because you
could<00:03:42.040> tell<00:03:42.160> she<00:03:42.220> was<00:03:42.669> falling<00:03:43.239> for<00:03:43.419> him<00:03:43.599> and

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
could tell she was falling for him and

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.740 
could tell she was falling for him and
that<00:03:44.010> bothered<00:03:45.010> him<00:03:45.250> obviously<00:03:45.599> because<00:03:46.599> it's

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
that bothered him obviously because it's

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.629 
that bothered him obviously because it's
his<00:03:46.930> sister<00:03:47.230> but<00:03:47.680> she<00:03:47.859> didn't<00:03:48.099> know<00:03:48.250> that<00:03:48.459> and

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
his sister but she didn't know that and

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.309 
his sister but she didn't know that and
so<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:48.940> created<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.389> bit<00:03:49.540> of<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.720> drama<00:03:49.989> that<00:03:50.260> you

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
so it created a bit of a drama that you

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.780 
so it created a bit of a drama that you
don't<00:03:50.590> get<00:03:50.799> in<00:03:50.919> a<00:03:50.950> lot<00:03:51.099> of<00:03:51.130> movies<00:03:51.370> these<00:03:51.730> days

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
don't get in a lot of movies these days

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.759 
don't get in a lot of movies these days
