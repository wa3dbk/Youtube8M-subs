00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
that they like buses I think they turn

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.360 
that they like buses I think they turn
up<00:04:40.550> in<00:04:40.669> threes<00:04:41.650> however<00:04:42.650> people<00:04:42.889> who<00:04:43.130> have

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
them on boats swear by them and I guess

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.909
