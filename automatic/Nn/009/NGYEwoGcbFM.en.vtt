tractors<00:00:21.550> and<00:00:21.849> skid<00:00:22.119> steers<00:00:22.509> are<00:00:22.779> going<00:00:23.080> the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
tractors and skid steers are going the

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.979 
tractors and skid steers are going the
exact<00:00:23.619> opposite<00:00:24.279> direction<00:00:24.989> compact

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
exact opposite direction compact

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.229 
exact opposite direction compact
tractors<00:00:26.529> are<00:00:26.739> getting<00:00:27.040> more<00:00:27.279> horsepower<00:00:27.970> and

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:28.239 
tractors are getting more horsepower and

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.920 
tractors are getting more horsepower and
less<00:00:28.810> weight<00:00:29.169> every<00:00:29.860> day<00:00:30.040> a<00:00:30.899> skid<00:00:31.899> steer

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
less weight every day a skid steer

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.130 
less weight every day a skid steer
loader<00:00:32.470> is<00:00:32.980> gaining<00:00:33.550> some<00:00:34.000> horsepower<00:00:34.420> but

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
loader is gaining some horsepower but

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.770 
loader is gaining some horsepower but
they're<00:00:35.350> gaining<00:00:35.890> weight<00:00:36.300> big-time<00:00:37.300> when<00:00:37.660> you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
they're gaining weight big-time when you

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.319 
they're gaining weight big-time when you
add<00:00:37.930> tracks<00:00:38.380> and<00:00:38.739> so<00:00:38.920> forth<00:00:39.280> so<00:00:39.850> you<00:00:39.940> really

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
add tracks and so forth so you really

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.540 
add tracks and so forth so you really
have<00:00:40.539> to<00:00:40.719> design<00:00:41.109> a<00:00:41.140> compact<00:00:41.890> four<00:00:42.219> in<00:00:42.340> one

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
have to design a compact four in one

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.509 
have to design a compact four in one
bucket<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.570> opposite<00:00:44.320> way<00:00:44.530> of<00:00:44.559> what<00:00:45.309> you

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
bucket the opposite way of what you

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.060 
bucket the opposite way of what you
would<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:46.089> skid<00:00:46.390> steer<00:00:46.420> bucket<00:00:47.289> so<00:00:47.769> I'm<00:00:47.859> gonna

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
would a skid steer bucket so I'm gonna

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.610 
would a skid steer bucket so I'm gonna
try<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.399> explain<00:00:49.000> why<00:00:49.719> some<00:00:49.780> of<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.350> things

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
try to explain why some of the things

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.889 
try to explain why some of the things
are<00:00:50.920> thin<00:00:51.250> in<00:00:51.519> this<00:00:51.730> bucket<00:00:52.269> but<00:00:52.690> they're

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
are thin in this bucket but they're

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.380 
are thin in this bucket but they're
built<00:00:53.170> for<00:00:53.379> a<00:00:53.410> compact<00:00:54.010> tractor<00:00:54.579> and<00:00:54.789> there's

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
built for a compact tractor and there's

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.689 
built for a compact tractor and there's
give<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:55.719> takes<00:00:56.140> with<00:00:56.469> this<00:00:56.710> whole<00:00:56.980> deal<00:00:57.280> and

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
give and takes with this whole deal and

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.630 
give and takes with this whole deal and
the<00:00:58.359> winner<00:00:58.659> really<00:00:59.440> is<00:00:59.859> the<00:01:00.070> bucket<00:01:00.489> that

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
the winner really is the bucket that

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.689 
the winner really is the bucket that
works<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.210> best<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.870> is<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.320> lightest<00:01:02.949> so

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
works the best and is the lightest so

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.550 
works the best and is the lightest so
we're<00:01:04.330> just<00:01:04.360> going<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:04.690> show<00:01:04.780> you<00:01:05.050> the

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
we're just going to show you the

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.170 
we're just going to show you the
different<00:01:05.980> things<00:01:06.190> than<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.550> way<00:01:06.700> they<00:01:06.909> make

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
different things than the way they make

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.840 
different things than the way they make
this<00:01:07.420> bucket<00:01:08.020> and<00:01:08.200> some<00:01:08.950> things<00:01:09.220> may<00:01:09.490> seem<00:01:09.820> a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
this bucket and some things may seem a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.940 
this bucket and some things may seem a
little<00:01:10.120> thin<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:11.140> only<00:01:11.350> thing<00:01:11.710> that<00:01:11.920> I

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
little thin and the only thing that I

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.190 
little thin and the only thing that I
would<00:01:12.070> say<00:01:12.430> seems<00:01:12.909> a<00:01:13.090> little<00:01:13.240> thin<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.750> me<00:01:13.930> are

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
would say seems a little thin to me are

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.830 
would say seems a little thin to me are
these<00:01:14.409> cutting<00:01:14.920> edges<00:01:15.430> but<00:01:15.970> this<00:01:16.210> bucket<00:01:16.630> has

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
these cutting edges but this bucket has

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.380 
these cutting edges but this bucket has
three<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.259> them<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:17.950> if<00:01:18.399> I<00:01:18.549> double<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.210> weight

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
three of them and if I double the weight

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.719 
three of them and if I double the weight
of<00:01:19.570> these<00:01:19.720> cutting<00:01:20.140> edges<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:21.159> overall

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
of these cutting edges the overall

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.179 
of these cutting edges the overall
weight<00:01:22.060> goes<00:01:22.420> up<00:01:22.450> so<00:01:22.960> much<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:23.649> it<00:01:24.130> just

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
weight goes up so much that it just

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.630 
weight goes up so much that it just
becomes<00:01:24.820> not<00:01:25.329> as<00:01:25.540> usable<00:01:26.200> on<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:27.009> midsize

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
becomes not as usable on a midsize

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.859 
becomes not as usable on a midsize
compact<00:01:28.420> tractor<00:01:28.990> so<00:01:29.680> this<00:01:30.399> is<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.939> 72<00:01:31.630> inch

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
compact tractor so this is the 72 inch

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.080 
compact tractor so this is the 72 inch
width<00:01:32.229> when<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.740> comes<00:01:33.009> in<00:01:33.219> three<00:01:33.520> widths<00:01:33.939> it

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
width when it comes in three widths it

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.609 
width when it comes in three widths it
comes<00:01:34.329> in<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.570> sixty<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.460> 66<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.909> 72<00:01:37.659> for<00:01:38.590> the

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
comes in a sixty a 66 and the 72 for the

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.429 
comes in a sixty a 66 and the 72 for the
compact<00:01:39.159> tractors<00:01:39.850> remember<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:40.869> has<00:01:41.049> three

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
compact tractors remember it has three

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.039 
compact tractors remember it has three
cutting<00:01:41.890> edges<00:01:42.340> on<00:01:42.549> it<00:01:42.579> these<00:01:43.299> are<00:01:43.630> high

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
cutting edges on it these are high

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.429 
cutting edges on it these are high

dozer blade they all have double welds
on<00:02:01.539> them<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:02.259> give<00:02:02.469> them<00:02:02.619> extra<00:02:02.890> strength<00:02:03.549> to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
on them to give them extra strength to

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.520 
on them to give them extra strength to
connect<00:02:04.420> them<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:04.960> steel<00:02:05.259> they're

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
connect them to the steel they're

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.370 
connect them to the steel they're
connected<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.310> as<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:07.420> can<00:02:07.600> see<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:08.110> whole

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
connected to as you can see this whole

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.850 
connected to as you can see this whole
side<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:09.420> quarter-inch<00:02:10.420> plate<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.320> this

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
side is quarter-inch plate and this

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.010 
side is quarter-inch plate and this
would<00:02:12.070> be<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.220> high<00:02:12.460> quality<00:02:12.490> plate<00:02:13.330> not<00:02:13.600> just<00:02:13.870> a

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
would be a high quality plate not just a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.920 
would be a high quality plate not just a
mild<00:02:14.260> steel<00:02:14.710> so<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.160> strong<00:02:15.520> steel<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.390> it's

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
mild steel so it's strong steel and it's

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.970 
mild steel so it's strong steel and it's
thin<00:02:17.320> not<00:02:18.100> that's<00:02:18.400> actually<00:02:18.970> pretty<00:02:19.150> thick

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
thin not that's actually pretty thick

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.860 
thin not that's actually pretty thick
but<00:02:20.190> there's<00:02:20.400> places<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.940> are<00:02:21.239> thin<00:02:21.480> but

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
but there's places that are thin but

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.390 
but there's places that are thin but
they're<00:02:22.050> meant<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.349> be<00:02:22.560> strong<00:02:22.860> because<00:02:23.280> they

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
they're meant to be strong because they

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.570 
they're meant to be strong because they
use<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.580> good<00:02:23.819> quality<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.360> Steel<00:02:25.400> just<00:02:26.400> like

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
use a good quality of Steel just like

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.759 
use a good quality of Steel just like
one<00:02:26.849> way<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.180> saving<00:02:27.450> weight<00:02:27.870> turn<00:02:28.409> me<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
one way of saving weight turn me to the

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.259 
one way of saving weight turn me to the
side<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.069> little<00:02:29.340> bit<00:02:29.459> Pina

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
side a little bit Pina

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.500 
side a little bit Pina
one<00:02:31.140> good<00:02:31.379> way<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.799> saving<00:02:32.099> weight<00:02:32.489> but<00:02:33.060> making

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
one good way of saving weight but making

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.259 
one good way of saving weight but making
it<00:02:33.599> stronger<00:02:33.989> stronger<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.610> casted

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
it stronger stronger is this casted

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.150 
it stronger stronger is this casted
hinge<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.959> we'll<00:02:37.110> show<00:02:37.379> you<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.590> picture<00:02:37.950> of

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
hinge and we'll show you a picture of

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.640 
hinge and we'll show you a picture of
that<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:39.090> as<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.540> see<00:02:39.599> this<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.379> one

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
that but as you can see this is one

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.039 
that but as you can see this is one
piece<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:40.950> metal<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:41.760> then<00:02:42.269> it's<00:02:42.420> broke<00:02:42.750> and

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
piece of metal and then it's broke and

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.690 
piece of metal and then it's broke and
bent<00:02:43.260> right<00:02:43.530> here<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.190> gives<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.580> your

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
bent right here that gives you your

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.210 
bent right here that gives you your
teeth<00:02:45.030> marks<00:02:45.629> for<00:02:46.230> your<00:02:46.379> gripping<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:47.010> your

teeth marks for your gripping of your
four<00:02:47.489> in<00:02:47.610> one<00:02:47.819> bucket<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.930> whole<00:02:49.260> plate<00:02:49.560> is

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
four in one bucket this whole plate is

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.369 
four in one bucket this whole plate is
quarter-inch<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:50.879> that's<00:02:51.090> plenty<00:02:51.390> strong<00:02:51.780> as

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
quarter-inch so that's plenty strong as

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.069 
quarter-inch so that's plenty strong as
you<00:02:53.099> can<00:02:53.280> see<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.700> cutting<00:02:53.970> edges<00:02:54.569> are<00:02:54.750> thin

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
you can see the cutting edges are thin

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.930 
you can see the cutting edges are thin

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
a heck of a bucket but it just got a

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.380 
a heck of a bucket but it just got a
little<00:03:10.319> bit<00:03:10.560> heavy<00:03:10.920> for<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.459> smaller<00:03:11.849> fort

you know smaller compact tractors this
you're<00:03:16.709> barely<00:03:17.040> going<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.459> notice<00:03:17.849> the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
you're barely going to notice the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.059 
you're barely going to notice the
difference<00:03:18.540> between<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:19.230> bucket<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:19.859> the

difference between this bucket and the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
standard bucket that would come on your

standard bucket that would come on your
machine<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.319> that's<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.069> good<00:03:23.220> part<00:03:23.489> because

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
machine and that's the good part because

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.250 
machine and that's the good part because
that<00:03:24.120> means<00:03:24.329> you'll<00:03:24.480> want<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.690> leave<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.139> on

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
that means you'll want to leave it on

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.670 
that means you'll want to leave it on
your<00:03:25.500> machine<00:03:25.700> use<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.940> when<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.269> need<00:03:27.299> to

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
your machine use it when you need to

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.050 
your machine use it when you need to
instead<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.799> changing<00:03:29.099> back<00:03:29.609> and<00:03:29.639> forth

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
instead of changing back and forth

instead of changing back and forth
constantly<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.079> or<00:03:31.349> needing<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.889> take<00:03:32.099> two

the back of the hose as well and will
show<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.849> that<00:03:48.150> but<00:03:48.989> if<00:03:49.230> you're<00:03:49.769> looking<00:03:50.160> at<00:03:50.280> a

show you that but if you're looking at a

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
bucket and you say well this 3/8 cutting

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.970 
bucket and you say well this 3/8 cutting
edge<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.250> just<00:03:53.489> too<00:03:53.700> thin<00:03:54.030> well<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.739> is

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
edge is just too thin well that is

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.770 
edge is just too thin well that is

new lighter weight compact tractors ok

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.509 
new lighter weight compact tractors ok
so<00:04:12.840> on<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.319> side<00:04:13.590> here<00:04:13.859> you<00:04:13.889> can<00:04:14.040> see<00:04:14.190> the

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
so on the side here you can see the

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.420 
so on the side here you can see the
cylinder<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.299> see<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.930> casted<00:04:16.500> hinge<00:04:16.919> you

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
cylinder you see the casted hinge you

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.779 
cylinder you see the casted hinge you
see<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.820> jaws<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.959> two<00:04:19.169> cutting<00:04:19.500> edges<00:04:20.160> this

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
see the jaws the two cutting edges this

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.790 
see the jaws the two cutting edges this
back<00:04:21.060> cutting<00:04:21.479> edge<00:04:21.780> would<00:04:22.019> be<00:04:22.169> used<00:04:22.440> when<00:04:22.680> you

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
back cutting edge would be used when you

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.730 
back cutting edge would be used when you
roll<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.099> bucket<00:04:23.490> down<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.300> back-drag<00:04:24.960> or

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
roll the bucket down and back-drag or

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.650 
roll the bucket down and back-drag or
better<00:04:25.949> drag<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> bank<00:04:26.820> all<00:04:27.120> for<00:04:27.389> something

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
better drag a bank all for something

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
better drag a bank all for something
after<00:04:28.050> your

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
after your

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.249 
after your
this<00:04:29.460> is<00:04:29.699> all<00:04:29.880> quarter-inch<00:04:30.509> steel<00:04:30.840> on<00:04:31.110> the

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
this is all quarter-inch steel on the

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.219 
this is all quarter-inch steel on the
side<00:04:31.669> all<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.970> hoses<00:04:33.479> are<00:04:33.690> run<00:04:33.900> through<00:04:34.199> a

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
side all the hoses are run through a

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.439 
side all the hoses are run through a
channel<00:04:34.590> here<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:35.460> is<00:04:35.669> a<00:04:35.699> double<00:04:36.240> lip

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
channel here so this is a double lip

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.550 
channel here so this is a double lip
here<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.430> so<00:04:38.720> places<00:04:39.720> like<00:04:39.750> this<00:04:40.229> that<00:04:40.530> take

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
here and so places like this that take

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.659 
here and so places like this that take
the<00:04:40.979> push<00:04:41.539> it's<00:04:42.539> it's<00:04:42.870> more<00:04:43.199> trouble<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:44.220> more

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
the push it's it's more trouble and more

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.600 
the push it's it's more trouble and more
expense<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.960> weld<00:04:46.199> in<00:04:46.530> these<00:04:46.830> three<00:04:47.280> pieces

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
expense to weld in these three pieces

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.360 
expense to weld in these three pieces
here<00:04:48.479> than<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.080> would<00:04:49.289> be<00:04:49.320> to<00:04:49.500> simply<00:04:50.100> put<00:04:50.340> a

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
here than it would be to simply put a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.570 
here than it would be to simply put a
plate<00:04:50.820> there<00:04:51.210> but<00:04:52.169> you're<00:04:52.620> just<00:04:52.860> adding<00:04:53.400> more

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
plate there but you're just adding more

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.180 
plate there but you're just adding more
weight<00:04:53.880> for<00:04:53.940> no<00:04:54.449> reason<00:04:55.020> so<00:04:55.380> this<00:04:55.650> is<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.889> good

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
weight for no reason so this is a good

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.120 
weight for no reason so this is a good
way<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.850> keep<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.570> weight<00:04:57.810> out<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:58.590> but<00:04:58.979> the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
way to keep the weight out of it but the

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.610 
way to keep the weight out of it but the
strip<00:04:59.430> that<00:04:59.729> you<00:04:59.789> need<00:05:00.150> if<00:05:00.870> you'll<00:05:01.050> notice<00:05:01.320> the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
strip that you need if you'll notice the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.529 
strip that you need if you'll notice the
back<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.160> bucket<00:05:02.610> it's<00:05:02.849> double-edged

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
back of the bucket it's double-edged

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.480 
back of the bucket it's double-edged
also<00:05:04.169> because<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.590> cutting<00:05:04.949> edge<00:05:05.099> is<00:05:05.310> on<00:05:05.430> the

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
also because the cutting edge is on the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.820 
also because the cutting edge is on the
other<00:05:05.729> side<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:06.360> rounded<00:05:06.870> but<00:05:07.440> they<00:05:07.590> make

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
other side and rounded but they make

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.689 
other side and rounded but they make
this<00:05:08.070> flat<00:05:08.460> so<00:05:09.030> you<00:05:09.120> can<00:05:09.389> bat<00:05:09.630> drag<00:05:10.020> your<00:05:10.259> dirt

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
this flat so you can bat drag your dirt

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.550 
this flat so you can bat drag your dirt
they<00:05:11.699> get<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.060> put<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.240> good<00:05:12.479> lint<00:05:12.750> cylinder<00:05:13.410> on

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
they get it put a good lint cylinder on

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.240 
they get it put a good lint cylinder on
here<00:05:14.009> this<00:05:14.610> bucket<00:05:15.060> has<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.240> 29<00:05:15.990> inch<00:05:16.440> opening

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250

here this bucket has a 29 inch opening
which<00:05:17.880> is<00:05:18.090> about<00:05:18.389> as<00:05:18.690> high<00:05:19.050> as<00:05:19.110> any<00:05:19.590> in<00:05:19.800> the

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
which is about as high as any in the

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.310 
which is about as high as any in the
industry<00:05:20.669> and<00:05:21.030> I<00:05:21.300> like<00:05:21.570> having<00:05:22.020> a<00:05:22.110> wide
