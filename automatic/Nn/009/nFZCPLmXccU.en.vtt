00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.809
 Actually I did not plan to shoot 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.750
 given combat vehicle since she 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.730
 monument but you wanted to want 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.330
 get and here's carl herat own 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.010
 persona 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.990
 unique and unique in general 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.760
 family of similar heavy self-propelled 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.090
 mortar was just six brothers 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.040
 adam and eve one torus and loki and cyl someone 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.210
 the girl will tell him but if the girl has 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.450
 there is such a trunk 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.850
 she automatically becomes a boy 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.790
 gun design began in 1935 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.950
 Rhinemetal boarding project 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.260
 and glad 040 was supervised by a general from 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.789
 artillery carl baker so the machine 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.329
 got the nickname carl 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.840
 prototype gun made in 1937 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.149
 year mortar fun 55 tons then the Germans 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.649
 first wanted to put it on the course and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.039
 after and book 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:06.540
 in the end, the weight was not childish 126 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.689
 tons and so actually the trunk it's huge i 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.520
 I easily get into it if I don't fall and 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.009
 legs don't break it 600 millimeter 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.409
 rifled March shells shot 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.380
 weighing about 2 tons in distance 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.439
 about seven kilometers shorter projectile 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:33.689
 flies 49 seconds i'm freezing for 49 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:36.960
 seconds and you will understand how long it took 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.620
 only 10 seconds ok let's continue while he 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.480
 flies 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.310
 the initial speed of the wallpaper concrete 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.190
 shells weighing two thousand one hundred seventy 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.610
 kilogram was 220 meters per second and 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.800
 high-explosive projectile was 283 meters in 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.170
 give me a sec 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.750
 the barrel is a monoblock lock wedge gun 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.900
 horizontal with prismatic cylinder 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.870
 wedge loading separate all settings 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.530
 pickups were made manually this 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:08.100
 vertical lift mechanism 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.100
 doesn't work either 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.560
 the trunk could rise to 70 degrees and here 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.360
 left-right guidance was not and 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.880
 had to use caterpillars in 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.810
 Mortars, you know, it was hellish 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.040
 recoil to extinguish this force developed 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.890
 two-stage rollback system 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.470
 that way sucks 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.860
 not only the barrel in the cradle but the whole 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:46.760
 machine and even before the muzzle of mortar here 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.760
 here they are here the position she crawled ask 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.910
 Vasil Vasilich and how are shells here 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.069
 barely delivered crew markers 16 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.950
 person 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.930
 Ammunition 8 separate shots 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.080
 loading 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.670
 zagira there dragged 2t fourth 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.890
 converted ammunition 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:19.330
 gun firing rate was one 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:23.310
 10 minutes shot time one 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.730
 shot after taking a firing position 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.730
 was about three the number 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.730
 productively 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.400
 as you already understood the process of loading was 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.500
 long and laborious with 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.870
 here is the surviving lift 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.930
 mechanism two-ton projectile swore but 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.030
 the tray and with the help of this bannik 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.019
 moved in the barrel behind him was powder 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.989
 charge and sleeve 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.400
 here are clearly visible with an ax fixing 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.400
 bottom of the liner 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.090
 transportation of herat to the place too 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.460
 there was one more song somewhere wrote that his 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.100
 disassembled into four parts painted on 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.530
 special platforms and carried to the place of work 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.050
 on the spot he was again collected somewhere for 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.270
 half a day or night further he could move 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.760
 alone but more common 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.740
 photos of carl transport entirely on 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.660
 special platforms by the way 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.660
 and fastening loops are present 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.360
 creeps through the engine he was standing right here 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.810
 12 cylinder inline diesel 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.530
 liquid cooling daimler-benz 507 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.300
 750 horsepower is a motor from 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.430
 torpedo boat by the way the same 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:15.600
 engine after minor modifications was 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:17.520
 installed here on this tank engine 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.530
 has been docked with hydromechanical 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.840
 transmissions with three included on 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.970
 torque converter queues me speed 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.580
 mortars was a modest 10 kilometers in 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:32.220
 an hour that's where I climb it was a place 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.640
 driver it looked about 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.640
 So 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.520
 undercarriage with respect to one side 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.970
 consists of 11 small road wheels 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.130
 diameter 5 supporting rollers 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.410
 sloth rear layout and front 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.570
 drive wheel type suspension 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.210
 individual torsion width 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.120
 caterpillars 500 millimeters by the way themselves 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:03.240
 dimensions herat omega impressive length 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:07.080

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.690
 before shot for stability mortar 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.590
 went to bed with the help of 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.590
 special hydraulic mechanism 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:28.760
 another place to access the engine here 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:31.550
 behind this door there are clearly visible torsions 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:36.050
 the mechanism is also clearly visible 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.050
 lowering and raising the suspension 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:47.620
 I kept thinking why was it welded here 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:50.650
 so that's when 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.819
 herat lies on the belly all the rollers and get up 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.819
 in such a position 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:02.469
 if you evaluate the design and 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:04.900
 efficiency then a lot of controversial moments 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:06.669
 on the one hand penetration of fortifications 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.069
 the concrete structure was high 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:11.589
 up to three and a half meters thick 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:13.900
 the blast wave also made its way 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:16.060
 hellish but here is the rate of fire and 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.819
 the capriciousness of guns caused a lot 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.770
 the gunners have no complaints 

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:23.349
 firing this shutter jam it in general 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.839
 Herat refuses to go and bombarded 

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:28.389
 Brest Hero City Sevastopol Warsaw 

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:31.839
 with the explosion of a projectile cloud of smoke and dust 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:34.150
 climbed to a height of 170 meters it 

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:36.810
 clearly visible on the shelling chronicles 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.810
 Sevastopol 

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:45.380
 we are artery written hell really 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:48.560
 most likely it is not quite so red 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.070
 the army captured the trigger and then the number 1 4 and 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.580
 6 

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:55.520
 adam tor and cyl according to the soviet report 

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:58.880
 the military could only be restored 

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:03.520
 cyl most likely this assembly gun from 

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.520
 adam down father that's all
