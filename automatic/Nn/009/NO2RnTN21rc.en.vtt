this usually means that you'll need to

this usually means that you'll need to

kayak to weathercock weathercock means

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.780 
kayak to weathercock weathercock means
that<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.049> kayak<00:00:58.320> will<00:00:58.619> turn<00:00:59.189> into<00:00:59.549> the<00:00:59.670> wind

and this tendency to do so make it

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.770 
and this tendency to do so make it

vessels and choose a route that you can

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
be the most sure of for example I'll

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.090 
be the most sure of for example I'll
intentionally<00:02:04.109> head<00:02:04.289> to<00:02:04.439> shore<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.709> further

intentionally head to shore a further

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.340 
intentionally head to shore a further
south<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.700> my<00:02:05.819> end<00:02:05.969> destination<00:02:06.209> so<00:02:07.109> that<00:02:07.229> when

south of my end destination so that when
I<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.740> shore<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.459> follow<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.850> north

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
I get to shore I can follow it north
