00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.949
 So 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.220
 today we launched the combat code 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.840
 less legends ie new legend 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.150
 why we called the same project yes 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.730
 because a long time ago and you have been 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.170
 four all remember her that is with him was 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.500
 essentially doing the same thing works 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.579
 now with this machine that is from scratch 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.190
 brand new absolutely she is still on 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.890
 guarantees she has very low mileage and 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.949
 everything was state the task was to do 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.010
 good powerful bass low to be 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:55.969
 the wind so that they rub there terrible flexo and 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.850
 so on but keeping the look 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.039
 in fact this is now the car 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.539
 have we done it because we don't 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.430
 touched regular radio 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.619
 I am now essentially worth 2 recorders 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.990
 independent of each other and both works 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.020
 that is, the front parking sensors work 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.259
 stereo rear parking sensors stereo stand 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.470
 three extra batteries and 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.729
 shtatnik that is a saved system 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.149
 security the very first patron 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.800
 which shoots the positive terminal 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.420
 Chopping off power to the car case of an accident 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.759
 that is, the machine is fully functional 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.390
 put the case with such a margin on 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:39.470
 future up to 2 with 12 but amplifier sundown 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.189
 audio stv 4000 d it works in 0 5 we 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.659
 so far from the regular generator that is well 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.659
 there is where to grow ie replacement 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.369
 generator replacement add 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.680
 soundproofing the car where it is needed 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.469
 although the car is very strong it can not 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.479
 not happy really because 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:02:01.100
 there are cars become much more difficult to us 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.479
 kill them is a question that is ours so 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.130
 tell about the book of the professor who 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.289
 engaged in the manufacture of ours 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.670
 any such cool grills beautiful to 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.450
 made specifically for this car 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.430
 manually not a sketch of this one here 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.260
 framework which is again too 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.150
 power element back wall because 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.879
 what's included 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.819
 hex bolts well, everything is as if 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.129
 beautiful and harmonious and functional in 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.689
 same time as all sedan owners 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.370
 understand to what the first thing they are 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.590
 face the lack of length 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.510
 the trunk is something that we always do not 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.819
 enough to get on the right 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.750
 frequencies of this particular case become 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:41.769
 full spare to allow them the same 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.200
 time will be it will not be seen wool on 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.879
 camera needed at the clip 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.090
 everything is visible that is, here are the speakers 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.739
 and another centimeter somewhere 30 we have 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.780
 free space to the backs 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.030
 seats that is, the car will be 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.040
 listen as with backs one way or the bottom 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.680
 that is, it will be necessary there absolutely hard there 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.540
 lay down the back gently 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:08.310
 again due to that there are no bolts 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:10.359
 unscrewed nothing and what they wanted so 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.840
 let's go tell you where the new ones are 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.840
 radio cassette player 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.680
 Here are the regular tape recorders, I turned on 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.710
 she works from being born a year bad 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:33.610
 catches such turned off took lopatnik 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.650
 put the panel here we included a new 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.250
 radio cassette player 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.920
 here it is worth duplicating her there 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:46.900
 listened to music 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.670
 removed the panel took shut shut off 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.680
 You can stand such a super voltmeter 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.620
 was controlling the drawdown but it 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.450
 Again, this option is not to cut 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.830
 nothing in the panel in the new car because 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.110
 which again I repeat the car on 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.120
 guarantees and the task was to make well 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.310
 as simple as possible to 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.130
 nothing was visible that is from the wires 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.680
 yes yes that's all these extra items 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.140
 that is, all plastic is assembled back all 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.460
 there is a new glove box clips 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.380
 functionally either notice here 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.850
 just a flash drive that is everything else there 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.400
 things that used to be wrong here 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.620
 and I will lie here radio tape recorder not here 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.680
 she stands under the staff under the panel that is 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.190
 on the invisible is not heated no one 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.500
 straining the central channel empty space 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.840
 as the machine is in music thank God ours 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.160
 happiness was in the minimum configuration 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.370
 now there are acoustically speakers 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.100
 middle, interior audi Tweeter 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.600
 they are now this part of the west of the tonic then 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.790
 have we perry hooked up parktronics on 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.680
 the central channel that is and how would 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.440
 Heard the best all saved that is and 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:57.130
 stereo left rear left right rear 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:59.650
 left right front that is ride like 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.780
 It is until all the system to warm up it 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.100
 some time 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.100
 ride as the speakers are absolutely 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.160
 new fasting all they just put 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.919
 after the warm-up let's see what we have 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.840
 will be further until we have somewhere 148 149 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.020
 decibel 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:20.110
 wide enough stick from 24 to 34 35 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.660
 hertz further everything is clipped since i 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.220
 Again , I repeat, we have a limit on 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.720
 supply but there is a quantity 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.600
 battery in this case does not play 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.340
 roles 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.050
 generator that is at least 10-15 here 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.840
 Now again, I repeat, they cost 4 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.480
 battery along with the standard yes but their 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.730
 you need to charge a regular generator 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.750
 actually very nice there 120 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:46.320
 ampere 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.710
 its current but we all understand yes that 121 in 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.920
 dive 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.660
 he can't work like that all the time when 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.790
 when drew before hearing to that is these 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.680
 amp and constantly vessel he heats himself 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.810
 protection goes this factory protection 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.320
 overheating machines 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:03.270
 so the myth generator 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.390
 setup test settings again 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:10.160
 I think some time we will come 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.160
 really new legend
