video<00:00:05.899> for<00:00:06.890> the<00:00:06.950> one<00:00:07.069> that<00:00:07.250> I<00:00:07.279> did<00:00:07.460> a<00:00:07.490> couple

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
video for the one that I did a couple

video for the one that I did a couple
months<00:00:07.910> ago<00:00:08.120> on<00:00:08.240> how<00:00:08.780> to<00:00:08.840> make<00:00:09.080> wood<00:00:09.290> plank

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
months ago on how to make wood plank

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.420 
months ago on how to make wood plank
bases<00:00:10.129> and<00:00:10.809> this<00:00:11.809> is<00:00:11.959> the<00:00:12.080> base<00:00:12.289> that<00:00:12.799> I<00:00:13.190> made

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
bases and this is the base that I made

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.359 
bases and this is the base that I made
for<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:13.670> video<00:00:13.969> and<00:00:14.469> I<00:00:15.469> mentioned<00:00:16.010> that<00:00:16.190> you

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
for the video and I mentioned that you

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.550 
for the video and I mentioned that you
could<00:00:16.610> change<00:00:17.270> the<00:00:17.449> size<00:00:17.600> of<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:17.900> styrene<00:00:18.350> and

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
could change the size of the styrene and

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.350 
could change the size of the styrene and
rough<00:00:18.710> it<00:00:18.860> up<00:00:18.920> a<00:00:19.040> bit<00:00:19.070> more<00:00:19.190> to<00:00:19.490> make<00:00:19.610> proper

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
rough it up a bit more to make proper

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.540 
rough it up a bit more to make proper
looking<00:00:20.750> wood<00:00:20.930> bases<00:00:21.350> and<00:00:21.590> that's<00:00:22.310> what<00:00:22.490> I

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
looking wood bases and that's what I

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.920 
looking wood bases and that's what I
just<00:00:22.610> did<00:00:22.880> so<00:00:23.240> I<00:00:23.270> just<00:00:23.480> wanted<00:00:23.690> to<00:00:23.780> show<00:00:23.900> you

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
just did so I just wanted to show you

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.260 
just did so I just wanted to show you
using<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:24.980> same<00:00:25.160> techniques<00:00:25.640> in<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.000> video

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
using the same techniques in the video

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.420 
using the same techniques in the video
you<00:00:27.260> can<00:00:27.289> get<00:00:27.530> a<00:00:27.560> completely<00:00:28.070> different

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
you can get a completely different

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.150 
you can get a completely different
looking<00:00:28.820> base<00:00:29.350> now<00:00:30.350> I<00:00:30.380> made<00:00:30.740> this<00:00:30.890> base<00:00:31.130> for

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
looking base now I made this base for

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.810 
looking base now I made this base for
some<00:00:32.410> undead<00:00:33.410> figures<00:00:33.890> are<00:00:34.160> called<00:00:34.340> rotten

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
some undead figures are called rotten

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.620 
some undead figures are called rotten
Belles<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:36.100> for<00:00:37.100> weird<00:00:37.280> smell<00:00:37.730> folk<00:00:37.970> game<00:00:38.210> and

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
Belles and for weird smell folk game and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.160 
Belles and for weird smell folk game and
I<00:00:39.560> used<00:00:39.829> wider<00:00:40.700> styrene<00:00:41.590> on<00:00:42.590> this<00:00:42.829> one<00:00:43.040> this<00:00:43.190> is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
I used wider styrene on this one this is

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.950 
I used wider styrene on this one this is
0.75<00:00:45.170> by<00:00:45.520> 4<00:00:46.520> millimeters<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:47.210> it's<00:00:47.360> wider<00:00:47.600> it's

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
0.75 by 4 millimeters so it's wider it's

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.910 
0.75 by 4 millimeters so it's wider it's
also<00:00:48.110> a<00:00:48.260> bit<00:00:48.440> thinner<00:00:49.630> so<00:00:50.630> you<00:00:50.780> get<00:00:50.960> more<00:00:51.140> bang

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
also a bit thinner so you get more bang

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.110 
also a bit thinner so you get more bang
for<00:00:51.950> your<00:00:52.309> buck<00:00:52.489> you<00:00:52.670> don't<00:00:52.820> need<00:00:52.940> as<00:00:53.030> many

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
for your buck you don't need as many

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.889 
for your buck you don't need as many
strips<00:00:53.540> to<00:00:53.750> make<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.020> base<00:00:54.200> and<00:00:55.630> did<00:00:56.630> this<00:00:56.750> the

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
strips to make the base and did this the

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.560 
strips to make the base and did this the
same<00:00:57.110> way<00:00:57.290> I<00:00:57.500> did<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.739> other<00:00:57.920> one<00:00:58.010> I<00:00:58.399> used<00:00:59.360> the

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
same way I did the other one I used the

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.200 
same way I did the other one I used the
razor<00:00:59.719> saw<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:00.379> scrape<00:01:00.620> in<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.579> wood<00:01:01.940> grain

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
razor saw to scrape in the wood grain

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.259 
razor saw to scrape in the wood grain
like<00:01:02.719> I<00:01:02.930> did<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.379> lot<00:01:03.590> harder<00:01:03.829> to<00:01:04.729> get<00:01:04.879> deeper

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
like I did a lot harder to get deeper

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.699 
like I did a lot harder to get deeper
lines<00:01:05.859> also<00:01:07.030> I<00:01:08.030> did<00:01:08.719> some<00:01:08.840> real<00:01:08.990> deep<00:01:09.259> gouging

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:09.709 
lines also I did some real deep gouging

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:12.219 
lines also I did some real deep gouging
on<00:01:09.799> using<00:01:10.189> of<00:01:10.280> styrene<00:01:10.549> cutter<00:01:10.969> especially<00:01:11.959> on

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
on using of styrene cutter especially on

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.539 
on using of styrene cutter especially on
the<00:01:12.499> edges<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.179> and<00:01:14.389> then<00:01:14.630> I<00:01:14.899> also<00:01:15.549> just

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
the edges of it and then I also just

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.489 
the edges of it and then I also just
used<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:17.060> hobby<00:01:17.299> knife<00:01:17.539> that<00:01:17.779> cuts<00:01:18.020> some<00:01:18.289> big

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:18.499 
used a hobby knife that cuts some big

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:21.010 
used a hobby knife that cuts some big
grooves<00:01:18.909> and<00:01:19.909> some<00:01:20.179> of<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.299> pieces<00:01:20.509> before

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
grooves and some of the pieces before

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.050 
grooves and some of the pieces before
sticking<00:01:21.229> them<00:01:21.439> all<00:01:21.529> down<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.009> once<00:01:22.789> all<00:01:22.939> that

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
sticking them all down and once all that

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.449 
sticking them all down and once all that
was<00:01:23.209> done<00:01:23.409> same<00:01:24.409> way<00:01:24.619> in<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.829> video<00:01:25.069> I<00:01:25.130> just

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
was done same way in the video I just

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.690 
was done same way in the video I just
used<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.979> template<00:01:27.979> actually<00:01:28.189> I<00:01:28.369> don't<00:01:28.459> think<00:01:28.579> I

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
used a template actually I don't think I

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.949 
used a template actually I don't think I
mentioned<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:29.090> in<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.329> video<00:01:29.630> I<00:01:29.689> can't

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
mentioned that in the video I can't

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.539 
mentioned that in the video I can't
remember<00:01:30.109> I<00:01:30.520> was<00:01:31.520> using<00:01:31.849> that<00:01:31.880> dig<00:01:32.299> down<00:01:32.450> a

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
remember I was using that dig down a

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.919 
remember I was using that dig down a
tripod<00:01:34.549> circle<00:01:35.029> valley<00:01:35.209> I<00:01:35.329> remember<00:01:35.749> it<00:01:35.840> in

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
tripod circle valley I remember it in

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.440 
tripod circle valley I remember it in
the<00:01:35.959> video<00:01:36.259> and<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:37.240> remembered<00:01:38.409> afterwards

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
the video and I remembered afterwards

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.109 
the video and I remembered afterwards
that<00:01:41.450> had<00:01:41.719> a<00:01:41.749> circle<00:01:42.200> template<00:01:42.670> which<00:01:43.670> works<00:01:43.939> a

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
that had a circle template which works a

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.899 
that had a circle template which works a
lot<00:01:44.240> better<00:01:44.299> I<00:01:45.310> think<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.340> forgot<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.700> at<00:01:46.789> the

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
lot better I think I forgot it at the

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.849 
lot better I think I forgot it at the
time<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:47.479> use<00:01:47.899> this<00:01:48.049> to<00:01:48.139> cut<00:01:48.319> it<00:01:48.409> out<00:01:48.499> or<00:01:48.770> at

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
time so use this to cut it out or at

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.349 
time so use this to cut it out or at
least<00:01:49.009> draw<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.369> shape<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:49.909> then<00:01:49.999> use<00:01:50.240> my

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
least draw the shape and then use my

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.870 
least draw the shape and then use my
clippers<00:01:50.719> to<00:01:50.749> cut<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.079> out<00:01:52.689> so<00:01:53.689> you<00:01:53.749> can<00:01:54.079> see

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
clippers to cut it out so you can see

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.039 
clippers to cut it out so you can see
same<00:01:55.880> technique<00:01:56.299> totally<00:01:56.630> different<00:01:56.899> base

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
same technique totally different base

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.479 
same technique totally different base
it's<00:01:57.380> also<00:01:57.529> obviously<00:01:58.069> painted<00:01:58.310> with

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
it's also obviously painted with

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.839 
it's also obviously painted with
different<00:01:58.759> colors<00:01:59.119> I<00:02:00.249> did<00:02:01.249> not<00:02:01.429> write<00:02:01.669> them

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
different colors I did not write them

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.330 
different colors I did not write them
what<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.119> use<00:02:02.649> when<00:02:03.649> I'm<00:02:03.739> doing<00:02:03.950> something<00:02:04.249> like

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
what I use when I'm doing something like

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.279 
what I use when I'm doing something like
a<00:02:04.429> one-off<00:02:04.700> base<00:02:05.029> like<00:02:05.270> this<00:02:05.479> or<00:02:05.869> a<00:02:05.899> three<00:02:06.139> off

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
a one-off base like this or a three off

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.589 
a one-off base like this or a three off
I<00:02:06.469> only<00:02:06.649> need<00:02:06.859> a<00:02:06.889> three<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.219> them<00:02:07.479> I'm<00:02:08.479> not

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
I only need a three of them I'm not

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.859 
I only need a three of them I'm not
really<00:02:08.750> write<00:02:09.050> down<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.440> color

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
really write down the color

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.899 
really write down the color
I<00:02:09.929> know<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.860> started<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.870> Laiho<00:02:12.870> us

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
I know I started with a Laiho us

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:18.199 
I know I started with a Laiho us
olive-drab<00:02:15.080> bass<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.549> I<00:02:17.549> just<00:02:17.819> mixed<00:02:18.060> some

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
olive-drab bass and I just mixed some

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.610 
olive-drab bass and I just mixed some
pages<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:19.530> some<00:02:19.739> grays<00:02:20.040> into<00:02:20.909> it<00:02:21.470> let's<00:02:22.470> try

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
pages and some grays into it let's try

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.809 
pages and some grays into it let's try
to<00:02:22.680> stick<00:02:22.890> towards<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.280> grayer<00:02:23.519> tones

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
to stick towards the grayer tones

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.250 
to stick towards the grayer tones
because<00:02:24.150> when<00:02:24.299> wood<00:02:24.480> dries<00:02:24.720> out<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.049> turns

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
because when wood dries out it turns

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.380 
because when wood dries out it turns
gray<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.560> then<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.489> went<00:02:26.640> over<00:02:26.940> with<00:02:27.239> some

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
gray and then I went over with some

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.430 
gray and then I went over with some
black<00:02:27.659> and<00:02:27.930> brown<00:02:28.440> washes<00:02:29.629> to<00:02:30.629> give<00:02:31.230> us<00:02:31.319> some

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
black and brown washes to give us some

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.410 
black and brown washes to give us some
depth<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.040> little<00:02:32.370> low<00:02:32.579> green<00:02:32.879> tones<00:02:33.150> and

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
depth and little low green tones and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.690

socials he undead figures on it and also
the<00:02:35.970> nails<00:02:36.709> on<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:38.069> base<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:39.690> poke

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
the nails on this base I just poke

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.119 
the nails on this base I just poke
little<00:02:40.049> holes<00:02:40.200> because<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.709> wanted<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.040> very

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
little holes because I wanted a very

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.080 
little holes because I wanted a very
fine<00:02:41.569> high<00:02:42.569> quality<00:02:43.140> wood<00:02:43.440> floor<00:02:43.859> this<00:02:44.849> one<00:02:45.030> I

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
fine high quality wood floor this one I

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.449 
fine high quality wood floor this one I
wanted<00:02:45.299> something<00:02:45.480> rougher<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.650> originally

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
wanted something rougher so I originally

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.610 
wanted something rougher so I originally
was<00:02:47.579> gonna<00:02:47.730> use<00:02:47.970> pins<00:02:48.840> but<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.170> didn't<00:02:49.410> have<00:02:49.470> any

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
was gonna use pins but I didn't have any

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.319 
was gonna use pins but I didn't have any
pin<00:02:50.220> heads<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.579> were<00:02:50.700> small<00:02:50.970> up<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.299> I

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
pin heads that were small up so I

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.300 
pin heads that were small up so I
actually<00:02:51.480> just<00:02:51.870> use<00:02:52.049> very<00:02:52.560> small<00:02:52.739> rods

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
actually just use very small rods

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.940 
actually just use very small rods
styrene<00:02:53.879> I<00:02:53.970> think<00:02:54.150> it's<00:02:54.269> one<00:02:54.420> millimeter

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
styrene I think it's one millimeter

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.160 
styrene I think it's one millimeter
styrene<00:02:55.950> rod<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.629> as<00:02:57.629> you<00:02:57.750> can<00:02:57.840> see<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.079> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
styrene rod and as you can see in the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.569 
styrene rod and as you can see in the
bottom<00:02:58.409> there<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:58.650> drilled<00:02:59.040> holes<00:02:59.280> for

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
bottom there I just drilled holes for

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.449 
bottom there I just drilled holes for
him<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.909> then<00:03:00.900> put<00:03:00.930> him<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.379> and<00:03:02.069> I<00:03:02.129> just<00:03:02.310> left

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
him and then put him in and I just left

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.550 
him and then put him in and I just left
him<00:03:02.609> a<00:03:02.700> little<00:03:02.970> bit<00:03:03.060> time<00:03:03.390> then<00:03:03.750> sanded<00:03:04.530> down

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
him a little bit time then sanded down

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.729 
him a little bit time then sanded down
to<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.519> height<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.670> wanted<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:07.140> there's

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
to the the height I wanted so there's

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.319 
to the the height I wanted so there's
the<00:03:07.859> base<00:03:08.040> here's<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> couple<00:03:08.879> of<00:03:09.060> figures

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
the base here's a couple of figures

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:15.250 
the base here's a couple of figures
mounted<00:03:10.250> here<00:03:11.250> are<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.400> rotten<00:03:11.640> bells

Betty Noir
I<00:03:32.030> think<00:03:32.750> she's<00:03:32.930> called<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:34.310> I'm<00:03:34.490> trying<00:03:34.700> to

I think she's called and I'm trying to
paint<00:03:34.910> her<00:03:35.000> up<00:03:35.090> as<00:03:35.210> a<00:03:35.240> ghost<00:03:35.680> kind<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:38.000> I'm

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
paint her up as a ghost kind of so I'm

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.910 
paint her up as a ghost kind of so I'm
using<00:03:38.300> all<00:03:38.510> whites<00:03:38.900> but<00:03:39.320> for<00:03:39.530> each<00:03:39.620> different

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
using all whites but for each different

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.410 
using all whites but for each different
area<00:03:40.190> I'm<00:03:40.280> using<00:03:40.460> a<00:03:40.580> different<00:03:40.820> base<00:03:41.030> for<00:03:41.330> the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
area I'm using a different base for the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.250 
area I'm using a different base for the
white<00:03:41.630> so<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.620> has<00:03:42.800> a<00:03:42.830> very<00:03:43.630> blue<00:03:44.630> grey<00:03:44.930> base

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
white so this has a very blue grey base

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.980 
white so this has a very blue grey base
for<00:03:45.709> it<00:03:45.890> and<00:03:46.820> then<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.000> slight<00:03:47.270> green<00:03:47.480> base<00:03:47.720> for

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
for it and then a slight green base for

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.570 
for it and then a slight green base for
the<00:03:48.110> skin<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.740> then<00:03:48.830> this<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.070> a<00:03:49.100> great<00:03:49.370> base

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
the skin and then this is a great base

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.440 
the skin and then this is a great base
for<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.630> hair<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:52.220> think<00:03:52.640> I'm<00:03:52.700> gonna<00:03:52.850> the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
for the hair and I think I'm gonna the

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.910 
for the hair and I think I'm gonna the
idea<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.810> I'm<00:03:53.900> gonna<00:03:53.990> paint<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.350> blaze<00:03:54.560> white

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
idea is I'm gonna paint the blaze white

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.110 
idea is I'm gonna paint the blaze white
and<00:03:55.280> then<00:03:55.370> she's<00:03:55.520> supposed<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.730> be<00:03:55.790> covered

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
and then she's supposed to be covered

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.150 
and then she's supposed to be covered
with<00:03:56.240> blood<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.780> then<00:03:57.590> I'm<00:03:57.680> gonna<00:03:57.830> have<00:03:57.950> like

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
with blood and then I'm gonna have like

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.479 
with blood and then I'm gonna have like
blood<00:03:58.459> splatters<00:03:59.120> on<00:03:59.450> her<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.980> like<00:04:01.190> she's<00:04:01.400> the

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
blood splatters on her so like she's the
