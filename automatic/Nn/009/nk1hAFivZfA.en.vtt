00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
sections and for us we'll concentrate

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.380

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.300 
maybe on Japan and then the PAL regions
as<00:02:14.810> well<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.470> whatever<00:02:15.650> region<00:02:15.920> you're<00:02:16.190> in

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
as well so whatever region you're in

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.400 
as well so whatever region you're in
this<00:02:16.460> kind<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.730> switch<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.150> around<00:02:17.350> now<00:02:18.350> you

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
this kind of switch that around now you

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.350 
this kind of switch that around now you
can<00:02:18.650> do<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:19.010> several<00:02:19.640> different<00:02:19.910> ways<00:02:20.030> you

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
can do this several different ways you

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.660 
can do this several different ways you
can<00:02:20.720> start<00:02:21.080> off<00:02:21.230> with<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> series<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.250> love<00:02:22.460> or

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
can start off with a series you love or

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.610 
can start off with a series you love or
well-known<00:02:22.880> series<00:02:23.510> that's<00:02:24.200> maybe<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.500> bit

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
well-known series that's maybe a bit

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.440 
well-known series that's maybe a bit
easier<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:25.250> start<00:02:25.430> out<00:02:25.610> with<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.970> would<00:02:26.330> suggest

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
easier to start out with I would suggest

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.620 
easier to start out with I would suggest
maybe<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:26.900> Legend<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.680> Zelda<00:02:27.890> whereas<00:02:28.880> it's

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
maybe like Legend of Zelda whereas it's

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.900 
maybe like Legend of Zelda whereas it's

series to start out with or you could
even<00:02:51.530> take<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.310> next<00:02:52.430> level<00:02:52.580> where

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
even take it to the next level where

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.180 
even take it to the next level where
there<00:02:53.720> was<00:02:53.810> only<00:02:53.959> maybe<00:02:54.260> one<00:02:54.620> game<00:02:54.950> in<00:02:55.100> the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
there was only maybe one game in the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.640 
there was only maybe one game in the
series<00:02:55.400> but<00:02:56.270> all<00:02:56.510> those<00:02:56.870> games<00:02:57.110> are<00:02:57.350> super

rare<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:58.220> for<00:02:59.090> me<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.510> series<00:03:00.230> would<00:03:00.410> be

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
rare and for me that series would be

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.210 
rare and for me that series would be
