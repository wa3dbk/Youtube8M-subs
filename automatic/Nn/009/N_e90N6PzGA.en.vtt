00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
unboxing right here so I guess I mean

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.740 
unboxing right here so I guess I mean
I'm<00:01:14.369> gonna<00:01:14.460> pump<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.270> everything<00:01:15.600> but

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
I'm gonna pump it up and everything but

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.560 
I'm gonna pump it up and everything but
whatever<00:01:16.130> looks<00:01:17.130> better<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.790> think<00:01:18.060> than<00:01:18.299> any

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
whatever looks better I think than any

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.080 
whatever looks better I think than any
other<00:01:18.689> pin<00:01:18.990> I'm<00:01:19.950> gonna<00:01:20.130> use<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.430> pin<00:01:20.700> these

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
other pin I'm gonna use this pin these

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
other pin I'm gonna use this pin these
pump<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.600> ball<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:21.960> know<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.560> feels

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
pump this ball I don't know just feels

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.280 
pump this ball I don't know just feels
right<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.780> don't<00:01:24.780> let's<00:01:24.900> get<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> ball

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
right I don't let's get to the ball

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.359 
right I don't let's get to the ball
itself<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.689> basically<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
itself so basically this is the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.450 
itself so basically this is the
collusive<00:01:29.909> ball<00:01:30.060> right<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.409> see<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.799> foo<00:01:32.250> saw

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
collusive ball right here see a foo saw

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.920 
collusive ball right here see a foo saw
and<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.850> comes<00:01:33.119> with<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.390> symmetrical<00:01:33.780> design

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
and it comes with a symmetrical design

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.100 
and it comes with a symmetrical design
here<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:35.009> ball<00:01:35.189> itself<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:36.060> basically<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
here the ball itself is basically the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.609 
here the ball itself is basically the
tango<00:01:37.799> 12<00:01:38.100> ball<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> Eurocup<00:01:39.540> ball<00:01:39.810> but

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
tango 12 ball in the Eurocup ball but

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.520 
tango 12 ball in the Eurocup ball but
maybe<00:01:41.430> slight<00:01:42.060> updates<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.930> maybe<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.290> couple

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
maybe slight updates on maybe a couple

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.340 
maybe slight updates on maybe a couple
extra<00:01:43.920> panels<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.729> some<00:01:44.909> spots<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.570> obviously

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
extra panels in some spots and obviously

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.200 
extra panels in some spots and obviously
the<00:01:46.500> colorways<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.490> waist<00:01:47.670> design<00:01:48.060> is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the colorways and the waist design is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.090 
the colorways and the waist design is
way<00:01:48.329> different<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.320> tango<00:01:49.710> these

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
way different on the tango these

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.399 
way different on the tango these
triangle<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:50.939> portions<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:51.869> they<00:01:52.200> were<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
triangle or portions here they were the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.289 
triangle or portions here they were the
ones<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.619> were<00:01:52.740> colored<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.159> button<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
ones we were colored in button here the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.389 
ones we were colored in button here the
circular<00:01:54.720> portions<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.229> colored<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:56.250> make

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
circular portions are colored in to make

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.700 
circular portions are colored in to make
it<00:01:56.490> almost<00:01:56.670> looks<00:01:56.880> kind<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.710> Euro

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
it almost looks kind of like the Euro

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.280 
it almost looks kind of like the Euro
past<00:01:59.040> ball<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.610> way<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.509> obviously<00:02:01.079> it's

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
past ball in a way but obviously it's

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.580 
past ball in a way but obviously it's
different<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.899> right<00:02:04.079> here<00:02:04.290> there<00:02:04.439> was<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
different so right here there was a

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.310 
different so right here there was a
Rizzo<00:02:04.890> logo<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.450> was<00:02:06.659> reading<00:02:06.930> about<00:02:06.990> it's

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
Rizzo logo and I was reading about it's

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.139 
Rizzo logo and I was reading about it's
just<00:02:07.469> basically<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> concept<00:02:08.700> behind<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
just basically the concept behind the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.089 
just basically the concept behind the
colorway<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.959> kind<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.649> reflect<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
colorway just kind of to reflect the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.760 
colorway just kind of to reflect the
Brazilian<00:02:11.520> flag<00:02:11.790> which<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.840> does

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
Brazilian flag which it does

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.440 
Brazilian flag which it does
I<00:02:13.800> guess<00:02:14.310> because<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.640> has<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.910> green<00:02:15.120> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
I guess because it has the green the

ball<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:27.690> if<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.560> buy<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.890> replica<00:02:29.220> ball<00:02:29.520> B

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
ball as if you buy like a replica ball B

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.400 
ball as if you buy like a replica ball B
FIFA<00:02:30.090> inspected<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.930> that's<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.200> big

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
FIFA inspected and that's a big

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.140 
FIFA inspected and that's a big
difference<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:32.010> don't<00:02:32.190> think<00:02:32.400> cuz<00:02:32.580> that's<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
difference so don't think cuz that's the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.240 
difference so don't think cuz that's the
difference<00:02:33.960> between<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.230> match<00:02:34.470> ball<00:02:34.770> and

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
difference between a match ball and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.420 
difference between a match ball and
another<00:02:35.940> ball<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.600> good<00:02:37.500> replica<00:02:37.860> ball<00:02:38.070> it's

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
another ball is a good replica ball it's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.890 
another ball is a good replica ball it's
a<00:02:38.490> replica<00:02:38.670> ball<00:02:39.030> I'll<00:02:39.210> have<00:02:39.330> an<00:02:39.420> eye<00:02:39.600> there

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
a replica ball I'll have an eye there

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.140 
a replica ball I'll have an eye there
and<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.590> hit<00:02:40.680> Smash<00:02:40.950> Ball<00:02:41.160> as<00:02:41.310> an<00:02:41.430> egg<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:41.940> don't

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
and it hit Smash Ball as an egg so don't

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.970 
and it hit Smash Ball as an egg so don't
think<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.690> have<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> real<00:02:43.260> ball<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.770> doesn't

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
think you have a real ball it doesn't

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.210 
think you have a real ball it doesn't
