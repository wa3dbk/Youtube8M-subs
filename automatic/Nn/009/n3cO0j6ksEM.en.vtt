00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.630
 First, it will be very helpful for those people who do not know much about 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.109
 mount images in format did 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.289
 This program is called visiting and its main function is to open files in 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.740
 raw format success and all the most popular compression files 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.340

 generally they have to be assembled with comfortable programs and montunos alcohol

 120% pauer iso 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.830
 among others 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.810
 we just start talking 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.560
 The first thing we will do is enter the download page of visit 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.280
 that I will leave them in the description of the video 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.330
 when they open the page they click on the trial version then the first 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.770
 installer that appears to them since this one is in Spanish 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.930
 When you start downloading it is up to you if you want to give your mail 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.870
 electronic since it is only to notify you of new updates and bla 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.830
 bla bla bla 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.080
 the program has a period of 30 days before expiring but never 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.160
 expires because the expiration notice always appears when we close the 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.010
 program so we can always open the imma help problems 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.240
 after having downloaded it we started the installation we placed the following accept 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.720
 the contract and following classic interface of visit and feel here one 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.970
 you have to select which files you want the program to read and the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.570
 there will be if one of you has installed programs like winrar seven fight or 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.470
 programs that will have files in ratified format I suggest you do not 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.380
 have the option ratified to visit one of them, since the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.430
 programs that you have that are enough to open it click on next then on 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.420
 installation destination folder in this case to me is informing me that 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.720
 the folder already exists since I already have it installed so cancel in the 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.000
 installation but obviously you click on next and finally 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.920
 install after they have it installed is ready to open files in 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.049
 iso format without having to mount it on a CD or anything like that 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:15.219
 to open files in format did have to have obviously a file 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.679
 with that format that are usually games 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:23.499
 in vichy perth they click on file open file and there they select the file 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:27.759
 they want to open in case they have a game in that format they open it and 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:31.729
