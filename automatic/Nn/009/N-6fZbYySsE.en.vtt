in my case I heat it to exactly 200

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.970 
in my case I heat it to exactly 200
degrees<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.199> way<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> work<00:01:01.949> done

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and this gives me the correct

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.109 
and this gives me the correct
temperature<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.979> using<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.369> then<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
temperature for using it and then of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.750 
temperature for using it and then of
course<00:01:09.180> you'll<00:01:09.540> need<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.960> hot<00:01:10.320> glue<00:01:10.350> gun<00:01:10.760> mine's

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.620 

I'm<00:02:47.790> about<00:02:48.090> 2<00:02:48.420> inches<00:02:48.900> above<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.290> flame<00:02:52.340> and

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
I'm about 2 inches above the flame and

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.380 
I'm about 2 inches above the flame and
you<00:02:54.630> can<00:02:54.840> kind<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.580> shape<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.760> petals<00:02:57.090> as<00:02:57.240> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
you can kind of shape the petals as a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.540 
you can kind of shape the petals as a
goal<00:02:57.630> but<00:02:57.870> they<00:02:58.050> kind<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.830> like<00:02:59.100> them<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.430> do

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
goal but they kind of I like them to do

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.950 
goal but they kind of I like them to do
their<00:02:59.700> own<00:02:59.730> thing<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.360> want<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.570> be<00:03:00.660> sure<00:03:00.930> of

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
their own thing you want to be sure of

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.760 
their own thing you want to be sure of
is<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.350> they<00:03:01.470> do<00:03:01.530> bend<00:03:01.950> out<00:03:02.250> because<00:03:03.120> your

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
is that they do bend out because your

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.430 
is that they do bend out because your
centerpiece<00:03:04.770> is<00:03:05.070> going<00:03:05.490> to<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:07.290> you're

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
centerpiece is going to that you're

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.060 
centerpiece is going to that you're
going<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.590> be<00:03:07.740> inserting<00:03:08.250> into<00:03:08.460> it<00:03:09.710> it's<00:03:10.710> going

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
going to be inserting into it it's going

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.650 
going to be inserting into it it's going
to<00:03:13.160> lay<00:03:14.160> over<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.610> you'll<00:03:14.790> see<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.090> later<00:03:15.300> here

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
to lay over it you'll see it later here

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.690 
to lay over it you'll see it later here
so<00:03:16.020> we're<00:03:16.200> heating<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.860> while<00:03:17.460> it's

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
so we're heating it and while it's

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.330 
so we're heating it and while it's
heating<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.300> also<00:03:18.540> shrinking<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.560> making

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
heating it's also shrinking and making

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.610 
heating it's also shrinking and making
that<00:03:20.550> very<00:03:20.880> tough<00:03:21.270> it's<00:03:21.660> it's<00:03:22.140> not<00:03:22.350> going<00:03:22.560> to

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
that very tough it's it's not going to

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.370 
that very tough it's it's not going to
be<00:03:22.740> real<00:03:22.950> flexible<00:03:23.459> anymore<00:03:24.020> so<00:03:25.020> you<00:03:25.110> want<00:03:25.320> to

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
be real flexible anymore so you want to

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.670 
be real flexible anymore so you want to
make<00:03:25.560> sure<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:26.280> keep<00:03:26.550> it<00:03:26.730> spinning<00:03:27.030> as<00:03:27.680> you're

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
make sure you keep it spinning as you're

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.190 
make sure you keep it spinning as you're
doing<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.270> and<00:03:30.270> want<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.600> make<00:03:30.720> sure<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:30.990> hit

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
doing it and want to make sure you hit

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.460 
doing it and want to make sure you hit
your<00:03:31.350> edges<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:35.340> make<00:03:36.240> sure<00:03:36.390> your<00:03:36.900> edges<00:03:37.080> look

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
your edges and make sure your edges look

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.680 
your edges and make sure your edges look
good<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.800> smooth

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
good and smooth

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.090 
good and smooth
keep<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.810> above<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.200> heat<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.680> keep<00:03:40.920> it

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
keep it above the heat and keep it

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.390 
keep it above the heat and keep it
moving<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:42.110> spinning<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:44.130> way<00:03:44.340> you

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
moving and spinning and that way you

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.050 
moving and spinning and that way you
won't<00:03:44.670> get<00:03:44.910> any<00:03:45.120> leaves<00:03:45.420> frying<00:03:46.110> on<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:47.060> okay

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
won't get any leaves frying on you okay

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.590 
won't get any leaves frying on you okay
now

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
now

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.220 
now
as<00:03:48.740> you<00:03:49.740> can<00:03:49.920> see<00:03:50.450> it's<00:03:51.450> gone<00:03:51.690> from<00:03:51.930> being

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
as you can see it's gone from being

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.340 
as you can see it's gone from being
really<00:03:52.620> flexible<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:53.640> being<00:03:53.880> nice<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.630> stiff

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
really flexible to being nice and stiff

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.130 
really flexible to being nice and stiff
and<00:03:56.190> that's<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.670> way<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.850> want<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.360> you<00:03:58.019> want

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
and that's the way you want it you want

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.509 
and that's the way you want it you want
to<00:03:58.260> make<00:03:58.350> sure<00:03:58.380> it's<00:03:58.709> stiff<00:03:58.920> all<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.370> way<00:03:59.459> to

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
to make sure it's stiff all the way to

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.520 
to make sure it's stiff all the way to
the<00:03:59.700> core<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.209> now<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:00.900> can<00:04:01.170> even<00:04:01.290> do<00:04:01.500> a

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
the core and now you can even do a

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.050 
the core and now you can even do a
little<00:04:01.620> heating<00:04:02.130> in<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.370> center<00:04:02.760> but<00:04:03.000> you

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
little heating in the center but you

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.550 
little heating in the center but you
don't<00:04:03.300> want<00:04:03.450> your<00:04:03.540> leave<00:04:03.720> petals<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.290> curl

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
don't want your leave petals to curl

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.229 
don't want your leave petals to curl
back<00:04:04.739> down<00:04:05.040> so<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.430> want<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.730> run<00:04:05.850> around<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
back down so you want to run around the

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.020 
back down so you want to run around the
outside<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:07.080> make<00:04:08.070> sure<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.610> know<00:04:08.820> if<00:04:08.940> you

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
outside and make sure you know if you

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.030 
outside and make sure you know if you
get<00:04:09.209> them<00:04:09.300> too<00:04:09.450> hot<00:04:09.720> though<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:10.260> could<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.769> could

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
get them too hot though I could I could

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.060 
get them too hot though I could I could
grab<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:11.910> piece<00:04:12.239> here<00:04:12.540> I'll<00:04:13.410> grab<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.709> scrap<00:04:15.049> and

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
grab a piece here I'll grab a scrap and

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.380 
grab a piece here I'll grab a scrap and
show<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.160> what<00:04:17.340> happens<00:04:17.729> if<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:17.940> get<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.209> too

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
show you what happens if you get it too

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.870 
show you what happens if you get it too
hot<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:19.890> just<00:04:20.660> curls<00:04:21.660> up<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:21.840> starts<00:04:22.380> on<00:04:22.470> fire

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
hot it just curls up and starts on fire

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.159 
hot it just curls up and starts on fire
so<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:23.970> don't<00:04:24.150> want<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.330> get<00:04:24.450> too<00:04:24.630> close<00:04:24.810> it's

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
so you don't want to get too close it's

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.010 
so you don't want to get too close it's
just<00:04:25.260> a<00:04:25.470> warming<00:04:26.010> thing<00:04:26.310> it's<00:04:27.090> not<00:04:27.450> really<00:04:27.510> any

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
just a warming thing it's not really any

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.810 
just a warming thing it's not really any
hotter<00:04:28.320> than<00:04:28.590> like<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:28.860> light<00:04:29.190> bulb<00:04:29.400> at<00:04:29.640> this

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
hotter than like a light bulb at this

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.640 
hotter than like a light bulb at this
point<00:04:30.150> but<00:04:30.750> at<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:31.020> temperature<00:04:31.470> and

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
point but at this temperature and

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.770 
point but at this temperature and
rotating<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.520> constantly<00:04:33.150> it's<00:04:33.360> gonna<00:04:33.510> heat

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
rotating it constantly it's gonna heat

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.900 
rotating it constantly it's gonna heat
it<00:04:33.810> up<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.140> can<00:04:34.290> put<00:04:34.410> your<00:04:34.560> hand<00:04:34.770> here<00:04:34.910> it's

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
it up you can put your hand here it's

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.370 
it up you can put your hand here it's
not<00:04:36.120> bad<00:04:36.590> okay<00:04:37.590> now<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:39.570> second<00:04:40.020> piece<00:04:40.169> we're

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
not bad okay now the second piece we're

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.530 
not bad okay now the second piece we're
going<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.560> be<00:04:40.650> doing<00:04:40.800> here<00:04:41.190> this<00:04:41.940> out<00:04:42.210> when<00:04:42.450> you

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
going to be doing here this out when you

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.880 
going to be doing here this out when you
put<00:04:42.750> this<00:04:42.900> over<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.380> flame<00:04:43.590> you're<00:04:43.770> gonna

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
put this over the flame you're gonna

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.430 
put this over the flame you're gonna
hold<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.310> high<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:44.850> bring<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:45.960> down<00:04:46.140> on<00:04:46.350> the
