00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.390
 teaching some you say you buy 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.830
 for the phone is so cheap the 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.320
 our so cheap I bought them anything 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.140
 less I'm going to leave the link 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.779
 description for them to buy are from 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.090
 of aluminum and have here this this is 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.530
 black they see is from a far and thick 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.160
 but the case is in aluminum as it says 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.469
 it is called the galaxy number 13 the original 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.829
 in here is the case so that you 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.430
 put and we also have this that is a 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.280
 boat see this replaces the the back of the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.059
 phone you have to remove it let me 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.059
 I bring it allows 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.150
 here I'm upside down in what is the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.840
 video 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.460
 but you have to replace the lid 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.380
 from the phone 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.740
 as you can see here you take away this 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.030
 and you put this on, you're not putting it 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.240
 up on top of the other 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.740
 and these guys I like how you look 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.500
 this white stripe that you saw here this is 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.360
 part of the cover is for the one who makes 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.299
 that is cool so that they do not get 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.360
 to land or anything and then look at 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.649
 luxury race I think in my opinion every 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.659
 who has his different opinions 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.810
 but if you want to have a phone like that 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.790
 that you look at the Chinese and the net feels 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.390
 swollen and like these aluminum when 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.159
 you touch it or whatever it is cool 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.630
 through the phone at least 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.390
 that you're playing a game after a lot 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.009
 not using time but if it gets cool 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.770
 when you're not using it cool 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.840
 as it is made of aluminum and it gives you a 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.670
 feels cooler next better not 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.170
 feels like he does not feel like 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.050
 as when he was in before 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.220
 original with this 5 of this cable is 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.860
 It feels like you're grabbing a 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.540
 distinction or something like that there is no energy 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.880
 I want to buy something or mode shown 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.640
 but if you feel like being ripped and you 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.920
 I highly recommend these two countries are 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.410
 of aluminum both and therefore the net are 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.209
 quieter are not 100 this place 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.820
 the link for them to buy 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.780
 and we say well something else do not worry 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.730
 I have a 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.890
 the class and also apart from that I have 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.569

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.400

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.020
 this is not this one last paper this is 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.720
