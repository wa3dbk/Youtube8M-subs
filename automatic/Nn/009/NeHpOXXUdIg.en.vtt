00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.189 
the five of us we're a close-knit family
he<00:04:38.610> doesn't<00:04:38.789> have<00:04:38.879> to<00:04:38.939> pretend<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.449> just<00:04:40.020> act

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
he doesn't have to pretend and just act

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.360 
he doesn't have to pretend and just act
kingly<00:04:40.529> all<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.710> time<00:04:40.830> in<00:04:40.949> front<00:04:41.099> of<00:04:41.159> us<00:04:41.219> were

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
kingly all the time in front of us were

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.129 
kingly all the time in front of us were
a<00:04:41.430> close<00:04:41.610> family<00:04:41.639> and<00:04:42.180> law<00:04:42.569> says<00:04:42.840> that<00:04:42.870> he's

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
a close family and law says that he's

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.379 
a close family and law says that he's
just<00:04:43.319> using<00:04:43.469> them<00:04:43.740> which<00:04:44.159> I<00:04:44.340> mean<00:04:44.490> apparently

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
just using them which I mean apparently

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.119 
just using them which I mean apparently
that's<00:04:45.509> the<00:04:45.629> case<00:04:45.840> cuz<00:04:46.199> he's<00:04:46.409> making<00:04:46.889> the<00:04:46.979> bird

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 
that's the case cuz he's making the bird

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.239 
that's the case cuz he's making the bird
cage<00:04:47.310> closed<00:04:47.580> in<00:04:47.759> so<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:48.509> guess<00:04:48.919> he<00:04:49.919> wants<00:04:50.189> to

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:50.249 
cage closed in so I guess he wants to

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.040 
cage closed in so I guess he wants to
kill<00:04:50.460> them<00:04:50.639> all<00:04:50.789> to<00:04:50.969> for<00:04:51.270> losing<00:04:51.629> and<00:04:51.779> even

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
kill them all to for losing and even

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.300 
kill them all to for losing and even
when<00:04:52.139> trouble<00:04:52.409> disease<00:04:52.710> like<00:04:52.830> all<00:04:52.949> you<00:04:53.069> fool

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
when trouble disease like all you fool

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.029 
when trouble disease like all you fool
so<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.300> guess<00:04:54.659> that<00:04:54.689> is<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:54.990> case<00:04:55.199> he<00:04:55.830> really

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
so I guess that is the case he really

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.529 
so I guess that is the case he really
just<00:04:56.189> sees<00:04:56.340> them<00:04:56.460> as<00:04:56.550> puppets<00:04:56.879> too<00:04:57.029> it's<00:04:57.389> so

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
just sees them as puppets too it's so

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.689 
just sees them as puppets too it's so
cool<00:04:57.749> like<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:57.990> although<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:58.529> puppet<00:04:58.889> stuff

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
cool like it although the puppet stuff

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.399 
cool like it although the puppet stuff
with<00:05:00.120> doflamingo<00:05:00.360> considering<00:05:01.080> his<00:05:01.199> power

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
with doflamingo considering his power

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:02.779 
with doflamingo considering his power
and<00:05:01.620> everything<00:05:01.740> about<00:05:02.099> him<00:05:02.279> and<00:05:02.400> all<00:05:02.460> fits<00:05:02.669> in

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
and everything about him and all fits in

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.339 
and everything about him and all fits in
very<00:05:02.819> perfectly<00:05:03.330> that<00:05:03.750> character<00:05:04.229> was

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
very perfectly that character was

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:05.749 
very perfectly that character was
clearly<00:05:04.710> very<00:05:04.949> planned<00:05:05.340> out<00:05:05.520> from<00:05:05.669> the

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
clearly very planned out from the

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.950 
clearly very planned out from the
beginning<00:05:06.090> or<00:05:06.240> at<00:05:06.449> least<00:05:06.599> room<00:05:06.689> when<00:05:06.779> he<00:05:06.810> was

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
beginning or at least room when he was

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.920 
beginning or at least room when he was
introduced<00:05:07.319> so<00:05:07.819> yeah<00:05:08.819> but<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.479> seemed<00:05:09.719> like

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
introduced so yeah but it seemed like

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.689 
introduced so yeah but it seemed like
they<00:05:10.469> were<00:05:10.529> kind<00:05:10.800> of<00:05:10.860> using<00:05:11.069> doflamingo<00:05:11.310> as<00:05:11.669> a

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
they were kind of using doflamingo as a

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:12.769 
they were kind of using doflamingo as a
puppet<00:05:12.000> at<00:05:12.090> first<00:05:12.240> because<00:05:12.389> you<00:05:12.569> know<00:05:12.659> they

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:12.779 
puppet at first because you know they

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.040 
puppet at first because you know they
came<00:05:13.169> across<00:05:13.439> this<00:05:13.560> kid<00:05:13.800> uses<00:05:14.279> X<00:05:14.669> noble<00:05:15.539> he<00:05:15.900> had

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
came across this kid uses X noble he had

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.920 
came across this kid uses X noble he had
Congress<00:05:16.409> hockey<00:05:16.860> they<00:05:17.159> probably<00:05:17.340> didn't

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
Congress hockey they probably didn't

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.300 
Congress hockey they probably didn't
specifically<00:05:18.930> like<00:05:19.169> him<00:05:19.500> for<00:05:19.800> any<00:05:19.919> reason

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
specifically like him for any reason

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.499 
specifically like him for any reason
they're<00:05:20.460> just<00:05:20.580> like<00:05:20.699> oh<00:05:20.819> yeah<00:05:21.029> that<00:05:21.240> kid<00:05:21.389> will

they're just like oh yeah that kid will

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.420 
they're just like oh yeah that kid will
be<00:05:21.539> good<00:05:21.779> we'll<00:05:22.229> use<00:05:22.439> him<00:05:22.680> you<00:05:23.039> know<00:05:23.129> I<00:05:23.159> feel

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
be good we'll use him you know I feel

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.529 
be good we'll use him you know I feel
like<00:05:23.490> they<00:05:23.639> kind<00:05:23.789> of<00:05:23.879> started<00:05:24.150> out<00:05:24.240> with<00:05:24.330> him

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
like they kind of started out with him

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.809 
like they kind of started out with him
as<00:05:24.689> their<00:05:24.839> puppet<00:05:25.229> and<00:05:25.349> then<00:05:25.409> they<00:05:26.219> became<00:05:26.520> his

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 
as their puppet and then they became his

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.749 
as their puppet and then they became his
so<00:05:27.389> I<00:05:27.659> think<00:05:28.080> that's<00:05:28.319> kind<00:05:28.529> of<00:05:28.560> cool<00:05:28.710> and<00:05:28.949> we
