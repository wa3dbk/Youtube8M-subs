00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
very easy to assemble you basically just

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.709 
very easy to assemble you basically just
put<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.530> together<00:00:52.710> like<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.579> push<00:00:54.570> it

in see with this except you put it on
top<00:00:58.280> now<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.520> it<00:01:00.270> comes<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.690> water<00:01:01.399> but<00:01:02.399> I

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
top now so it comes with water but I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.870 
top now so it comes with water but I
don't<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:04.170> might<00:01:04.830> use<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.729> are

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
beam that shoots out it's not air it's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.660 
beam that shoots out it's not air it's
not<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.079> sensor<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.680> little<00:01:38.460> remote

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
not it's just a sensor a little remote

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.740
