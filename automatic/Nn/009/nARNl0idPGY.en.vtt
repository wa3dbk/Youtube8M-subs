 At the Happy Music Festa Executive Committee, we are working hard to protect the animals . 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:20.110
 Music is unusual because there are many people who want to know the existence of people and groups 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:21.050
 Study meetings to protect homes like dogs and cats are regularly shared with their own latest animal welfare information 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.090
 To 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:30.430

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.820
