time that this is all going to happen

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.900 
time that this is all going to happen
globally<00:03:25.510> there's<00:03:26.140> been<00:03:26.610> currency<00:03:27.610> crises

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
globally there's been currency crises

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.539

here<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.900> there<00:03:29.200> before<00:03:29.709> but<00:03:29.950> it's<00:03:30.310> never

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
here and there before but it's never

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.470 
here and there before but it's never

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
occurred all over the planet at once and

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.650 
occurred all over the planet at once and
that<00:03:34.480> means<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:35.320> this<00:03:36.070> time<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:37.060> downside

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
that means that this time the downside

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.300 
that means that this time the downside
if<00:03:38.019> you're<00:03:38.170> on<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.410> wrong<00:03:38.560> side<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.070> trade

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
if you're on the wrong side of the trade

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.970 
if you're on the wrong side of the trade
is<00:03:39.519> magnified<00:03:40.180> many

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
is magnified many

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.309 
is magnified many
many<00:03:41.430> fold<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:42.569> that's<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:42.840> bright<00:03:43.050> side

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
many fold but so that's the bright side

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.440 
many fold but so that's the bright side
so<00:03:43.800> I<00:03:43.830> believe<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.489> this<00:03:44.610> is<00:03:44.670> still<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
so I believe that this is still the

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.720 
so I believe that this is still the
greatest<00:03:45.750> opportunity<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.769> history<00:03:47.040> there

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
greatest opportunity in history there

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.020 
greatest opportunity in history there
has<00:03:47.819> never<00:03:48.180> been<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.810> time<00:03:49.159> there's<00:03:50.159> a<00:03:50.220> scenario

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
has never been a time there's a scenario

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.869 
has never been a time there's a scenario
presented<00:03:51.629> to<00:03:52.290> mankind<00:03:52.920> where<00:03:53.310> they<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.700> get

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
presented to mankind where they you get

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.839 
presented to mankind where they you get
an<00:03:54.000> individual<00:03:54.510> could<00:03:54.720> become<00:03:55.110> richer<00:03:56.040> than

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
an individual could become richer than

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.940 
an individual could become richer than
in<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.180> next<00:03:57.480> few<00:03:57.750> years<00:03:57.780> here<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:58.799> is

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
in the next few years here this is

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.430 
in the next few years here this is
really<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.090> greatest<00:04:00.450> opportunity<00:04:01.230> in

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
really is the greatest opportunity in

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.160 
really is the greatest opportunity in
history<00:04:02.040> like<00:04:02.569> you<00:04:03.569> have<00:04:03.660> any<00:04:03.780> comments

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
history like you have any comments

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.190 
history like you have any comments
Michael<00:04:05.060> yeah<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.150> think<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.810> think<00:04:07.079> that's

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
Michael yeah I think I think that's

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.800 
Michael yeah I think I think that's
that's<00:04:07.650> true<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.310> think<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:08.879> there<00:04:09.480> are<00:04:09.599> real

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
that's true I think that there are real

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.530 
that's true I think that there are real
headwinds<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.650> if<00:04:11.579> you<00:04:11.909> can<00:04:12.120> sustain

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
headwinds and if you can sustain

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.970 
headwinds and if you can sustain
yourself<00:04:13.019> through<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.410> next<00:04:13.650> couple<00:04:13.950> of

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
yourself through the next couple of

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.189 
yourself through the next couple of
years<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.370> think<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:15.269> agree<00:04:15.870> with<00:04:16.019> both

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
years I think that I agree with both

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.680 
years I think that I agree with both
comments<00:04:17.039> here<00:04:17.250> but<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:17.910> seeds<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.510> seeds

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
comments here but the seeds the seeds

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.199 
comments here but the seeds the seeds
are<00:04:18.930> being<00:04:18.959> sown<00:04:19.440> now<00:04:19.709> for<00:04:20.039> tremendous<00:04:20.760> wealth

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
are being sown now for tremendous wealth

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.810 
are being sown now for tremendous wealth
creation<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:22.079> so<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:23.039> think<00:04:23.160> instead<00:04:23.729> of

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
creation and so I think instead of

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.310 
creation and so I think instead of
worrying<00:04:24.000> about<00:04:24.210> you<00:04:24.570> know<00:04:24.600> trading<00:04:25.110> into

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
worrying about you know trading into

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.620 
worrying about you know trading into
this<00:04:25.470> or<00:04:25.680> that<00:04:25.830> this<00:04:26.580> week<00:04:26.820> or<00:04:27.060> next<00:04:27.180> week<00:04:27.360> I

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
this or that this week or next week I

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.610 
this or that this week or next week I
think<00:04:27.840> we<00:04:28.020> have<00:04:28.139> to<00:04:28.430> be<00:04:29.430> cognizant<00:04:30.300> of

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
think we have to be cognizant of

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.810 
think we have to be cognizant of
deflationary<00:04:31.620> headwinds<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.460> think<00:04:32.669> they're

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
deflationary headwinds I think they're

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.270 
deflationary headwinds I think they're
very<00:04:32.850> strong<00:04:33.510> I<00:04:33.870> think<00:04:34.050> it's<00:04:34.410> very<00:04:34.620> soon<00:04:35.010> I

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
very strong I think it's very soon I

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.550 
very strong I think it's very soon I
think<00:04:35.940> there's<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.180> very<00:04:36.449> big<00:04:36.780> correction

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
think there's a very big correction

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.620 
think there's a very big correction
coming<00:04:37.919> in<00:04:38.039> the<00:04:38.130> capital<00:04:38.580> markets<00:04:39.000> both<00:04:39.419> the

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
coming in the capital markets both the

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.550 
coming in the capital markets both the
bond<00:04:39.810> market<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.830> stock<00:04:41.070> market<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:42.560> you

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
bond market and the stock market and you

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.930 
bond market and the stock market and you

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.860 
know I can just tell you I'm a

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.620 
consultant to the Comex in New York and
they<00:04:49.970> individuals<00:04:50.970> on<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.300> comb<00:04:51.450> they're

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
they individuals on the comb they're

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.969 
they individuals on the comb they're
buying<00:04:51.810> all<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.110> gold<00:04:52.320> they<00:04:52.440> can<00:04:52.590> buy<00:04:52.740> right

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
buying all the gold they can buy right

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.930 
buying all the gold they can buy right
now<00:04:53.160> every<00:04:53.940> one<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.150> them<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.660> so<00:04:55.669> so<00:04:56.669> they're

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
now every one of them and so so they're

they're<00:04:57.240> looking<00:04:57.599> to<00:04:57.630> so<00:04:58.530> I<00:04:58.860> think<00:04:59.010> that<00:04:59.430> the

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
they're looking to so I think that the

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.279 
they're looking to so I think that the
seeds<00:04:59.910> are<00:05:00.060> being<00:05:00.240> sown<00:05:00.539> for<00:05:00.780> great<00:05:01.020> wealth

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
seeds are being sown for great wealth

seeds are being sown for great wealth
creation<00:05:01.680> I<00:05:01.979> think<00:05:02.190> in<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.400> short<00:05:02.669> term<00:05:02.910> I

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
creation I think in the short term I

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.240 
creation I think in the short term I
think<00:05:03.810> this<00:05:04.229> is<00:05:04.320> going<00:05:04.410> to<00:05:04.500> be<00:05:04.590> bumpy<00:05:04.979> it's

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
think this is going to be bumpy it's

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.580 
think this is going to be bumpy it's
gonna<00:05:05.370> be<00:05:05.520> really<00:05:05.700> bumpy<00:05:06.349> well<00:05:07.349> gentlemen
