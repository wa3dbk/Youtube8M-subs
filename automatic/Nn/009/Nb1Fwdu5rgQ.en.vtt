on<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.250> hair<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.239> my<00:00:45.600> opinion<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.170> hair

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
on the hair but in my opinion the hair

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.110 
on the hair but in my opinion the hair
is<00:00:46.559> really<00:00:46.829> low<00:00:47.100> maintenance<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> don't

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
is really low maintenance so I don't

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.779 
is really low maintenance so I don't
feel<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.469> use<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.890> brand<00:00:50.399> I

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
feel like you have to use that brand I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.910 
feel like you have to use that brand I
think<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.300> could<00:00:51.480> buy<00:00:51.629> any<00:00:52.020> type<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.379> shampoo

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
think you could buy any type of shampoo

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.590 
think you could buy any type of shampoo
conditioner<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.610> it'll<00:00:53.820> work<00:00:53.969> okay<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
conditioner and it'll work okay on the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.930 
conditioner and it'll work okay on the
hair<00:00:54.809> because<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.129> said<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.550> low

purchased<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.490> hair<00:05:27.729> because<00:05:28.510> it's<00:05:28.720> been

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
purchased the hair because it's been

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.390 
purchased the hair because it's been
just<00:05:29.080> like<00:05:29.139> sitting<00:05:29.650> in<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:29.800> bag<00:05:29.979> this<00:05:30.250> is

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
just like sitting in the bag this is

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.159 
just like sitting in the bag this is
like<00:05:30.550> a<00:05:30.580> piece<00:05:30.880> that<00:05:30.940> I<00:05:31.150> never<00:05:31.419> used<00:05:31.720> after<00:05:32.139> I

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
like a piece that I never used after I

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.770 
like a piece that I never used after I
color<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:33.520> then<00:05:33.699> I<00:05:33.729> had<00:05:33.970> tested<00:05:34.449> the<00:05:34.570> bleach

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
color and then I had tested the bleach

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.800 
color and then I had tested the bleach
on<00:05:34.960> this<00:05:35.169> piece<00:05:35.380> as<00:05:35.590> well<00:05:35.800> if<00:05:36.130> you<00:05:36.760> can<00:05:36.940> see<00:05:37.180> but

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.010 
on this piece as well if you can see but
the<00:05:38.560> original<00:05:39.070> curl<00:05:39.610> pattern<00:05:40.060> is<00:05:40.330> a<00:05:40.360> lot<00:05:40.750> more

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
the original curl pattern is a lot more

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.430 
the original curl pattern is a lot more
defined<00:05:41.560> than<00:05:41.949> this<00:05:42.639> piece<00:05:42.940> here<00:05:43.389> but<00:05:43.960> I<00:05:43.990> mean

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
defined than this piece here but I mean

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.939 
defined than this piece here but I mean
it<00:05:44.830> got<00:05:45.159> from<00:05:45.520> this<00:05:45.789> to<00:05:46.780> this<00:05:47.320> just<00:05:47.710> bone

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
it got from this to this just bone

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.339 
it got from this to this just bone
straight<00:05:48.340> to<00:05:49.120> straighten<00:05:49.659> the<00:05:49.750> hair<00:05:49.990> it

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
straight to straighten the hair it

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.010 
straight to straighten the hair it
doesn't<00:05:50.650> take<00:05:51.010> you<00:05:51.190> to<00:05:51.310> get<00:05:51.490> any<00:05:51.820> like<00:05:52.120> special

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
doesn't take you to get any like special

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.689 
doesn't take you to get any like special
mechanics<00:05:53.590> or<00:05:53.770> anything<00:05:54.010> like<00:05:54.370> that

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
mechanics or anything like that

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.790

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
through the hair prior to straightening

00:05:58.389 --> 00:05:58.800 
through the hair prior to straightening
it

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
it

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.899 
it
it's<00:05:59.440> strange<00:05:59.770> just<00:06:00.039> like<00:06:00.250> your<00:06:00.430> natural<00:06:00.760> hair

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:00.909 
it's strange just like your natural hair

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.390 
it's strange just like your natural hair
so<00:06:01.270> take<00:06:01.510> the<00:06:01.690> flat<00:06:01.960> iron<00:06:02.169> pass<00:06:02.949> it<00:06:03.190> through

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
so take the flat iron pass it through

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.450 
so take the flat iron pass it through
once<00:06:03.580> or<00:06:03.820> twice<00:06:04.110> and<00:06:05.110> it<00:06:05.740> gets<00:06:05.919> like<00:06:06.190> bone

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
once or twice and it gets like bone

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.730 
once or twice and it gets like bone
straight<00:06:06.849> so<00:06:07.539> I<00:06:07.570> was<00:06:08.020> really<00:06:08.260> really<00:06:08.590> really

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
straight the flat iron that are used on

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.100 
straight the flat iron that are used on
the<00:06:33.099> hair<00:06:33.430> is<00:06:33.580> when<00:06:33.820> I<00:06:33.849> picked<00:06:34.180> up<00:06:34.330> at<00:06:34.539> Sally's

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
the hair is when I picked up at Sally's

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.679 
the hair is when I picked up at Sally's
I<00:06:36.210> can't<00:06:37.210> think<00:06:37.419> of

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:37.689 
I can't think of

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.929 
I can't think of
Braham<00:06:38.019> but<00:06:38.349> it's<00:06:38.499> like<00:06:38.679> the<00:06:38.949> doop<00:06:39.279> -<00:06:39.580> like<00:06:39.759> the

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:39.939 
Braham but it's like the doop - like the

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:40.949 
Braham but it's like the doop - like the
chief<00:06:40.179> flatiron

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:40.959 
chief flatiron

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:42.989 
chief flatiron
and<00:06:41.049> that's<00:06:41.799> the<00:06:41.979> one<00:06:42.129> I've<00:06:42.249> been<00:06:42.279> using<00:06:42.669> for

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:42.999 
and that's the one I've been using for

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:44.850 
and that's the one I've been using for
years<00:06:43.029> it<00:06:43.479> works<00:06:43.689> great<00:06:44.019> so<00:06:44.349> you<00:06:44.439> don't<00:06:44.679> need

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
years it works great so you don't need

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.489 
years it works great so you don't need
like<00:06:45.159> a<00:06:45.389> heavy-duty<00:06:46.389> flatiron<00:06:47.079> or<00:06:47.259> anything

00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:47.499 
like a heavy-duty flatiron or anything

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:49.439 
like a heavy-duty flatiron or anything
like<00:06:47.860> that<00:06:47.889> that<00:06:48.129> when<00:06:48.519> I<00:06:48.549> probably<00:06:48.879> pay<00:06:49.149> like

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
like that that when I probably pay like

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:52.949 
like that that when I probably pay like
60<00:06:49.899> or<00:06:49.929> $70<00:06:50.769> for<00:06:51.039> I<00:06:51.399> purchased<00:06:52.179> those<00:06:52.360> every

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:52.959 
60 or $70 for I purchased those every

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:55.289 
60 or $70 for I purchased those every
probably<00:06:53.829> two<00:06:54.009> to<00:06:54.129> three<00:06:54.159> years<00:06:54.549> they<00:06:54.789> last<00:06:55.059> me

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:55.299 
probably two to three years they last me

00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:58.829 
probably two to three years they last me
a<00:06:55.569> really<00:06:55.959> long<00:06:56.139> time<00:06:56.469> but<00:06:57.089> to<00:06:58.089> wrap<00:06:58.299> things<00:06:58.659> up

00:06:58.829 --> 00:06:58.839 
a really long time but to wrap things up

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:02.279 
a really long time but to wrap things up
I<00:06:59.559> would<00:06:59.979> definitely<00:07:00.669> recommend<00:07:01.110> going<00:07:02.110> with

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:02.289 
I would definitely recommend going with
