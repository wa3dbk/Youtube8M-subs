00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.980
 and hello everyone we meet for a 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.469
 new stone tutorial that addresses 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.990
 today on a 3 x 3 door with 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.650
 super compact spiral opening and 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.990
 quick 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.420
 so what to see her in action on 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.030
 could not their only way the door opens 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.250
 super fast and if they re-pressed 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.060
 she's done so quickly 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.550
 beautiful but the most beautiful is 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.500
 probably there redstone behind that's 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.520
 completely compact it only makes two 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.200
 wide back 9 2-9 long and mostly eight 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.390
 height is really one of the most 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.060
 little door in itself the cover in 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.829
 spiral that exists is so now 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.700
 all we have to do is 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.130
 do the tutorial 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.790
 and built with our zone of 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.610
 twice 9 long and we will use 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.750
 the blocks and the items that are in the 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.570
 inventory bar so he will you 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.910
 have 9 repeater four slices of 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.910
 redstone seventeen son of redstone twelve 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.520
 tickets pistons a lever 4 this to 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.810
 a few building blocks and I 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.310
 will use wool for the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.750
 circuits stays but you can very 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.159
 well use all the blocks you 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.200
 want 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.569
 now we will start doing the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.219
 first circuit so we will put our 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:21.350
 first blog our block we will ask 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.770
 our lever or impose a torch 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.950
 behind in place an ale with blocks 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:33.140
 with a son of redstone here torch 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.729
 torch repeater to CAT-iq son radian 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.399
 here it should turn off the torch and 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.909
 so their editors above we placed 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.520
 a cob block if torch there she 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.409
 should all go out and then you have 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.069
 placed two sticks pistons one above 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.799
 on the other a pistons stick here referred to the 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.390
 side of the torch to place it and a 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.259
 pistons stick a little bit lower where he goes 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.789
 we need a block to place it here 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.969
 it should expand 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.439
 you place a block on its phase and 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.420
 normally by placing your two blocks 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.429
 for the door 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.929
 you have half of the extension you 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.920
 have all the extension and do not miss you 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.599
 more than the end of writing we will 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.879
 tackle after the retraction 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.120
 I will use another color for 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:24.069
 the circuit we will already placed a repeater 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:28.900
 here we'll put right etc 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:32.150
 rip a tic up a block here 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.209
 and here it's kind of a piece of 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.180
 tetris in the hole up husband peter 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.849
 that we still do four tic son of 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.840
 red stone here phil jackson the place one 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.430
 blog it should go cut 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.010
 and here you have placed a son of red 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.840
 stone is a ch'ti that pistons with a 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.819
 block on its phase and normally if you 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.000
 you are not deceived in lowering this 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.299
 related place you have the extension and the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.120
 perfect retractation tackle 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.819
 now to the retraction of dallas 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.599
 laying all the pistons to close the 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.760
 door and for that we will use the 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.680
 block of purple color and we placed a 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:18.540
 repeater here where we liked our game 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:23.260
 we will place a block in front of slab slab 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:26.590
 put on the spot and a block a slave has 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:32.340
 placed the stone rade over sophie if 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:36.860
 we then put two fields blocks 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.080
 repeater a tic repeater crypt 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.380
 block when we can remove this block the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.380
 place and two blocks like this for 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.420
 place a filter blocks is just 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.140
 to prevent his two sons from red stone 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.860
 connect then on the other side we have 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.780
 placed a block above a block next to 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.430
 fielder is alone in the coast and 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.990
 the other a slam with a field stone 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:09.530
 then to finish a repeater at a tick 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.990
 with in front of him a block and blocks 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.360
 underneath with phil dhorasoo is 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.970
 normally if we did everything right 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.239
 the door to be made and ends up in 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.130
 perfect spiral and here you have 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.340
 now finished building your 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.160
 door 3 x 3 and it was probably not very 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.160
 complicated so I thank all those who 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.050
 have watched this video and do not hesitate 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.520
 to share but you're a lover but
