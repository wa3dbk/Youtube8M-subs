00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
now at the start of a really large

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.330 
now at the start of a really large
project<00:00:09.139> replacing<00:00:10.139> my<00:00:11.040> entire<00:00:11.340> suspension

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
project replacing my entire suspension

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.660 
project replacing my entire suspension
shocks<00:00:14.340> struts<00:00:15.350> Springs<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:17.369> all<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
shocks struts Springs and all the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.070 
shocks struts Springs and all the
bushings<00:00:18.140> so<00:00:20.510> first<00:00:21.510> time<00:00:21.689> I've<00:00:21.869> done<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
bushings so first time I've done a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.890 
bushings so first time I've done a
project<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.710> this

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
project like this

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.200 
project like this
you're<00:00:24.900> going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.609> start<00:00:26.609> taking<00:00:26.789> everything

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
you're going to start taking everything

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.839 
you're going to start taking everything
off<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.930> think<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.830> might<00:00:28.949> support<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.580> just

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
off I think it might support this just

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.110 
off I think it might support this just
so<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.090> doesn't<00:00:30.890> fall<00:00:31.890> up<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.399> nowhere<00:00:32.880> with

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
so it doesn't fall up to nowhere with

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.310 
so it doesn't fall up to nowhere with
them<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.530> many<00:00:34.739> things<00:00:35.180> but<00:00:36.320> yeah

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
them this is so many things but yeah

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.840 
them this is so many things but yeah
start<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:39.030> up<00:00:42.649> to<00:00:43.649> remove<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> shock<00:00:44.370> absorber

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
start it up to remove the shock absorber

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.190 
start it up to remove the shock absorber
which<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.239> I'm<00:00:45.329> gonna<00:00:45.420> start<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:45.960> for

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
which is what I'm gonna start with for

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.430 
which is what I'm gonna start with for
this<00:00:46.260> project<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> remove<00:00:47.850> this

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
this project you have to remove this

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.610 
this project you have to remove this
liner<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:53.579> actually<00:00:54.570> folded<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.140> seat<00:00:55.440> down

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
liner and actually folded that seat down

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.790 
liner and actually folded that seat down
and<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.640> unlocked<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.449> from<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> inside<00:00:58.199> I

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and just unlocked it from the inside I

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.160 
and just unlocked it from the inside I
think<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.059> probably<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.600> kind<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
think you can probably just kind of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:38.960 
think you can probably just kind of
wrestle

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.770

found a shot right there and I'll

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.060 
found a shot right there and I'll
release<00:01:44.049> both<00:01:44.590> of<00:01:44.799> those<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:47.140> this<00:01:47.409> I<00:01:47.740> can

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
release both of those and this I can

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.320 
release both of those and this I can
take<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.399> whole<00:01:48.549> thing<00:01:48.610> out<00:01:49.530> fine<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:52.180> can

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
here's the new shock and as you can see

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.260 
here's the new shock and as you can see
significantly<00:04:44.600> Stricker<00:04:45.230> shaft<00:04:46.240> yeah

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.030 

the<00:04:50.270> other<00:04:50.570> significant<00:04:51.320> thing<00:04:51.380> about<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:51.830> is

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
the other significant thing about it is

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.770 
the other significant thing about it is
it<00:04:52.520> is<00:04:53.890> slightly<00:04:54.890> shorter<00:04:55.310> than<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.300> original

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
it is slightly shorter than the original

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.670 
it is slightly shorter than the original
one<00:04:57.070> and<00:04:58.070> that's<00:04:58.430> important<00:04:59.000> because<00:04:59.680> if

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
one and that's important because if

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.130 
one and that's important because if
you're<00:05:00.890> putting<00:05:01.130> in<00:05:01.340> short<00:05:01.700> Springs<00:05:02.120> you<00:05:02.960> need

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
you're putting in short Springs you need

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.480 
you're putting in short Springs you need
a<00:05:03.710> short<00:05:04.250> shot<00:05:05.680> otherwise<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:07.010> shock<00:05:07.250> will

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
a short shot otherwise the shock will

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:19.180 
a short shot otherwise the shock will
bottom<00:05:07.970> out<00:05:17.260> so<00:05:18.260> the<00:05:18.590> next<00:05:18.770> thing<00:05:18.950> I'm<00:05:19.040> gonna

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
bottom out so the next thing I'm gonna

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.440 
bottom out so the next thing I'm gonna
do<00:05:19.400> is<00:05:19.430> I'm<00:05:19.610> gonna<00:05:19.700> take<00:05:19.850> care<00:05:20.240> of<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:22.220> shock

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.400 

so<00:05:27.220> this<00:05:28.220> plate<00:05:28.520> from<00:05:28.820> the<00:05:28.880> old<00:05:29.180> shock<00:05:29.720> goes<00:05:30.200> on

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
so this plate from the old shock goes on

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.200 
so this plate from the old shock goes on
like<00:05:30.650> that<00:05:31.210> then<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.990> rear<00:05:33.230> shock<00:05:33.530> mount<00:05:33.920> and

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
like that then the rear shock mount and

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.400 
like that then the rear shock mount and
the<00:05:35.210> spinal<00:05:35.600> plate<00:05:36.670> and<00:05:37.930> then<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.080> nut<00:05:39.230> and

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
the spinal plate and then the nut and

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.850 
the spinal plate and then the nut and
you<00:05:39.590> can<00:05:39.740> put<00:05:39.920> all<00:05:40.010> this<00:05:40.190> on<00:05:40.370> before<00:05:41.860> you

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
you can put all this on before you

Lynch

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.720 

so<00:06:17.720> here's<00:06:17.990> the<00:06:18.200> assembled<00:06:18.680> shop<00:06:18.980> and<00:06:21.730> we're

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
so here's the assembled shop and we're

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.170 
so here's the assembled shop and we're
gonna<00:06:22.880> go<00:06:23.660> ahead<00:06:23.810> and<00:06:24.050> start<00:06:24.590> by<00:06:25.060> putting<00:06:26.060> the

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
gonna go ahead and start by putting the

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.990 
gonna go ahead and start by putting the
bottom<00:06:26.630> bolt<00:06:26.870> on<00:06:27.080> and<00:06:28.010> then<00:06:28.310> I'll<00:06:28.430> jack<00:06:28.730> it<00:06:28.910> up

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
bottom bolt on and then I'll jack it up

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.670 
bottom bolt on and then I'll jack it up
into<00:06:29.300> place<00:06:29.570> on<00:06:29.900> the<00:06:29.930> top<00:06:30.230> one

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
into place on the top one

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.330 
into place on the top one
you<00:06:31.160> know<00:06:31.250> Bentley<00:06:31.880> recommends<00:06:32.920> putting<00:06:33.920> just

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
you know Bentley recommends putting just

00:06:34.340 --> 00:07:05.460 
you know Bentley recommends putting just
a<00:06:35.530> little<00:06:36.530> bit<00:06:36.710> of<00:06:37.120> Loctite<00:06:38.120> on<00:06:38.600> there

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.360 

and<00:07:05.889> of<00:07:06.190> course<00:07:06.460> the<00:07:06.610> big<00:07:06.820> advantage<00:07:07.300> of

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
and of course the big advantage of

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.680 
and of course the big advantage of
leaving<00:07:09.370> the<00:07:09.490> top<00:07:09.729> three<00:07:10.150> and<00:07:10.330> doing<00:07:10.510> it<00:07:10.600> up

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
leaving the top three and doing it up

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.770 
leaving the top three and doing it up
second<00:07:11.650> is<00:07:11.830> that<00:07:12.220> you<00:07:12.400> can<00:07:12.580> make<00:07:12.729> sure<00:07:12.970> you<00:07:13.690> can

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
second is that you can make sure you can

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.240 
second is that you can make sure you can
move<00:07:13.960> this<00:07:14.139> around<00:07:14.320> make<00:07:14.710> sure<00:07:14.889> you<00:07:15.010> get<00:07:15.130> it

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
move this around make sure you get it

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.750 
move this around make sure you get it
started<00:07:16.860> correctly<00:07:17.860> because<00:07:18.430> there<00:07:18.669> aren't

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:18.760 
started correctly because there aren't

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.300 
started correctly because there aren't
any<00:07:18.880> threads<00:07:19.660> in<00:07:19.990> the<00:07:20.139> top<00:07:20.410> that<00:07:20.800> you<00:07:20.979> have<00:07:21.130> to

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
any threads in the top that you have to

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.450 
any threads in the top that you have to
worry<00:07:21.490> about<00:07:21.580> getting<00:07:21.820> started

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 
worry about getting started

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.260 
worry about getting started
all<00:07:24.460> right<00:07:25.169> now<00:07:26.550> I'm<00:07:27.550> gonna<00:07:27.729> go<00:07:27.970> ahead<00:07:28.120> and

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
all right now I'm gonna go ahead and

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:48.959 
all right now I'm gonna go ahead and
Jack<00:07:28.660> this<00:07:28.990> up<00:07:30.000> to<00:07:31.000> where<00:07:31.030> it<00:07:31.240> belongs

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:48.969 

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.029
