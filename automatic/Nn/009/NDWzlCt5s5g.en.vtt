00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
the engine oil because it just got

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.320 
the engine oil because it just got
changed<00:02:13.440> convertible<00:02:14.440> as<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.560> workbench<00:02:15.340> come

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330

changed convertible as a workbench come
on<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.880> broke

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
on just broke

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:39.620 
on just broke
good<00:02:25.930> job<00:02:27.540> time<00:02:35.340> there<00:02:36.340> we<00:02:36.459> go<00:02:38.100> all<00:02:39.100> right

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630

whoo<00:02:40.630> this<00:02:40.840> stuff<00:02:41.080> smells<00:02:41.200> nasty<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.959> guess<00:02:43.959> if

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
whoo this stuff smells nasty I guess if

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:54.660 
whoo this stuff smells nasty I guess if
the<00:02:44.170> motor<00:02:44.320> has<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.590> be<00:02:44.650> running

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.429 

the<00:02:55.209> key<00:02:55.480> key<00:02:56.170> key<00:02:56.489> my<00:02:57.489> kingdom<00:02:57.849> for<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.150> key

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
the key key key my kingdom for a key

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:16.790 
the key key key my kingdom for a key
there<00:02:59.439> we<00:02:59.560> go

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.870 

missing

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.320 

and<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.480> sort<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:21.870> smoothes<00:03:22.170> out

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.570 

yeah<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.080> fan<00:03:26.350> burger<00:03:26.740> a<00:03:26.770> little<00:03:27.040> noisy<00:03:27.600> okay

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
yeah the fan burger a little noisy okay

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.700 
yeah the fan burger a little noisy okay
let's<00:03:30.580> do<00:03:30.760> this

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.230 

you<00:03:36.010> know<00:03:36.160> I<00:03:36.220> think<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.610> might<00:03:36.640> be<00:03:36.820> easier<00:03:37.090> if<00:03:37.120> I

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
you know I think it might be easier if I

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.150 
you know I think it might be easier if I
just<00:03:37.270> took<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.690> rest<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.020> filter<00:03:38.950> box

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
just took the rest of that filter box

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.250 
just took the rest of that filter box
off

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.250 

I<00:03:45.340> dumped<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.459> quite<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.450> bit<00:03:47.629> of<00:03:47.689> the<00:03:47.750> bottle<00:03:48.079> so

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
I dumped in quite a bit of the bottle so

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.110 
I dumped in quite a bit of the bottle so
far<00:03:48.530> it's<00:03:48.829> not<00:03:49.040> getting<00:03:49.250> at<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.489> smoke<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:49.969> I'm

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
far it's not getting at the smoke so I'm

00:03:50.120 --> 00:04:02.990 
far it's not getting at the smoke so I'm
hoping<00:03:50.420> for

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.430 

well<00:04:03.480> there<00:04:03.600> we<00:04:03.750> go<00:04:03.780> we're<00:04:04.020> starting<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.350> get

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
well there we go we're starting to get

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.280 
well there we go we're starting to get
some<00:04:04.590> smoke

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:16.190 

there<00:04:09.950> we<00:04:10.069> go<00:04:10.219> now<00:04:11.060> we're<00:04:11.239> getting<00:04:11.450> somewhere

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.170 

I'm<00:04:16.710> going<00:04:16.860> to<00:04:16.920> do<00:04:17.010> 2/3<00:04:17.520> in<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.820> motor<00:04:18.060> and

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
I'm going to do 2/3 in the motor and

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:26.230 
I'm going to do 2/3 in the motor and
then<00:04:18.420> 1/3<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.990> tank

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:39.470

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:52.269 

hope<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.230> isn't<00:04:40.380> all<00:04:40.590> we're<00:04:40.710> gonna<00:04:40.800> get

mantra<00:05:10.480> fun<00:05:10.630> to<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.870> point<00:05:11.080> where<00:05:11.200> I<00:05:11.230> should

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
mantra fun to the point where I should

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:21.170 
mantra fun to the point where I should
flood<00:05:11.770> it<00:05:11.890> yet
