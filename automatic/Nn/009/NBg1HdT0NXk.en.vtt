00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.220

 of cfa2 while it will reach the final 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:48.150
 the answer is in the image the beginning of 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.140
 match is balanced the local make game 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.140

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.120
 finally the first half is one 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.070
 cities that are created the most beautiful 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:41.240
 opportunities like this corner 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:43.070
 returning to the mid-time spectators 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.290
 come in numbers believes it just as the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.340
 days of sarrebourg listen it was at the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.340
 half time in the locker room 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.540
 unfortunately the second period does not 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.010
 will give nothing so you have to fight 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.010
 by shootout on goal 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.230

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.370
 stop at the doors of the final had 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.010
 anyway I think there is not bad 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.630
 of people who expect that the 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.670
 logical be faster and do not respect 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.360
 the door the harry cement club the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.980
 first time and then 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.060
 as friendly 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.800
 it does not mean that we reproduce a 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.870
 day so let's take advantage of it 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.910
 that simply he was still 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.190

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.150
