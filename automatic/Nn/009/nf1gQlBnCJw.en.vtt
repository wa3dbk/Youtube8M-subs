and<00:01:30.659> even<00:01:30.780> when<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.020> progress<00:01:31.170> further<00:01:31.530> it's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and even when you progress further it's

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.039 
and even when you progress further it's
a<00:01:31.799> thousand<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.490> 2,000<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.270> 2,000<00:01:33.930> it's

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
a thousand it's 2,000 it's 2,000 it's

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.929 
a thousand it's 2,000 it's 2,000 it's
2,000<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:34.770> 3,000<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.729> gets<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
2,000 it's 3,000 it's then it gets to

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.090 
2,000 it's 3,000 it's then it gets to
4,000<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.810> takes<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> takes<00:01:37.200> time<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.680> so

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
4,000 but it takes it takes time and so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.429 
4,000 but it takes it takes time and so
we've<00:01:38.579> done<00:01:38.820> better<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.840> by<00:01:39.960> attacking

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
we've done better just by attacking

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.039 
we've done better just by attacking
other<00:01:40.590> players<00:01:40.970> for<00:01:41.970> example<00:01:42.060> eye<00:01:42.570> attacks

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
other players for example eye attacks

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899

to be upgrading those as often as

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.990 
to be upgrading those as often as
possible<00:02:10.349> as<00:02:10.440> well<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.400> when<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.700> find

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
possible as well so that when you find

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.730 
possible as well so that when you find
those<00:02:12.150> big<00:02:12.540> rates<00:02:12.840> from<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.080> players

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
those big rates from the players

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.470 
those big rates from the players
you're<00:02:14.370> not<00:02:14.490> just<00:02:14.700> kind<00:02:14.820> of<00:02:14.910> wasting<00:02:15.360> those

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
you're not just kind of wasting those

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.390 
you're not just kind of wasting those
resources<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.380> mean<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.770> kind<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.250> when<00:02:17.370> I

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
resources so I mean I kind of when I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.170 
resources so I mean I kind of when I
found<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.850> 18<00:02:18.390> gold<00:02:18.660> raid<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:20.220> wasted<00:02:20.940> about

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
found that 18 gold raid I wasted about

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.810 
found that 18 gold raid I wasted about
12,000<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.260> because<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.250> only<00:02:23.580> had<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
12,000 to that because it I only had a

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.790 
12,000 to that because it I only had a
maximum<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.540> could<00:02:24.720> take<00:02:24.870> about<00:02:25.020> 4,000

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
maximum that I could take about 4,000

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.320 
maximum that I could take about 4,000
and<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.370> we<00:02:26.460> want<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.670> make<00:02:26.790> sure<00:02:26.820> gold

and so we want to make sure gold

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.150 
and so we want to make sure gold

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
I'm gonna look at my other buildings

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.200 
I'm gonna look at my other buildings
well<00:03:04.530> let's<00:03:04.980> see<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.190> archer<00:03:05.400> tower<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:06.150> can

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
well let's see the archer tower that can

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.080 
well let's see the archer tower that can
be<00:03:06.480> upgraded<00:03:06.980> cannon<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.310> canopy<00:03:08.700> upgrade

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
be upgraded cannon this canopy upgrade

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.930 
be upgraded cannon this canopy upgrade
is<00:03:09.210> as<00:03:09.540> well<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.770> can<00:03:10.980> my<00:03:11.130> gold<00:03:11.520> mines<00:03:11.730> and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
is as well so can my gold mines and

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.880 
is as well so can my gold mines and
everything<00:03:12.330> else<00:03:12.450> now<00:03:12.690> we<00:03:13.200> can<00:03:13.410> only<00:03:13.560> upgrade

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
everything else now we can only upgrade

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.520 
everything else now we can only upgrade
as<00:03:14.460> a<00:03:14.520> building<00:03:15.360> for<00:03:15.600> every<00:03:15.870> builder<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.380> we

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
as a building for every builder that we

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.780 
as a building for every builder that we
have<00:03:16.650> available<00:03:17.160> right<00:03:17.220> now<00:03:17.460> we<00:03:17.520> only<00:03:17.610> have

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
have available right now we only have

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.490 
have available right now we only have
two<00:03:18.030> builders<00:03:18.360> however<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:18.990> our<00:03:19.080> next<00:03:19.290> built

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
two builders however in our next built

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.320 
two builders however in our next built
in<00:03:19.710> our<00:03:19.800> next<00:03:19.980> video<00:03:20.220> we're<00:03:20.790> gonna<00:03:20.850> be<00:03:21.060> having

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
in our next video we're gonna be having

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.450 
in our next video we're gonna be having
more<00:03:21.480> more<00:03:21.870> builders<00:03:22.230> if<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:23.100> know<00:03:23.220> that

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
more more builders if you know that

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.890 
more more builders if you know that
clash<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.820> clans<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.180> gonna<00:03:24.360> be<00:03:24.480> something<00:03:24.810> you

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
want to do long-term you need to have

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.880 
want to do long-term you need to have
five<00:03:27.570> builders<00:03:27.960> I<00:03:28.110> cannot<00:03:28.350> stand<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.650> cannot

five builders I cannot stand I cannot

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.160 
five builders I cannot stand I cannot
stress<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.430> enough<00:03:29.550> if<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.420> have<00:03:30.450> one<00:03:30.900> base

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
stress this enough if you have one base

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.990 
stress this enough if you have one base
that<00:03:31.440> only<00:03:31.560> has<00:03:31.710> two<00:03:31.920> builders<00:03:32.250> for<00:03:32.460> a<00:03:32.520> year

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
that only has two builders for a year

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.760 
that only has two builders for a year
that's<00:03:33.420> gonna<00:03:33.720> be<00:03:33.900> just<00:03:34.080> kind<00:03:34.170> of<00:03:34.290> your<00:03:34.440> set

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
that's gonna be just kind of your set

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.520 
that's gonna be just kind of your set
minimum<00:03:35.130> pace<00:03:35.580> right<00:03:35.880> if<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.870> take<00:03:37.050> that<00:03:37.170> same

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
minimum pace right if you take that same

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.230 
minimum pace right if you take that same
base<00:03:37.800> and<00:03:38.040> have<00:03:38.190> five<00:03:38.490> builders<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.090> keep

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
base and have five builders and you keep

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.610 
base and have five builders and you keep
your<00:03:39.360> builders<00:03:39.690> busy<00:03:40.020> for<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.260> entire<00:03:40.590> year

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
your builders busy for that entire year

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.520 
your builders busy for that entire year
that<00:03:41.100> base<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.390> five<00:03:42.570> builders<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.350> this

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
that base with the five builders is this

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.600 
that base with the five builders is this
2.5<00:03:44.130> times<00:03:44.400> stronger<00:03:44.670> if<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.060> do<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.300> math

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
2.5 times stronger if you do the math

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.830 
2.5 times stronger if you do the math
that's<00:03:47.610> that's<00:03:47.970> not<00:03:48.150> something<00:03:48.420> that's<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.600> big

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
that's that's not something that's a big

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.630 
that's that's not something that's a big
difference

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
difference

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.280 
difference
so<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.760> impact<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.360> gravity<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:51.870> having

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
so the impact and the gravity of having

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.890 
so the impact and the gravity of having
two<00:03:52.620> builders<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.670> huge<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:54.390> imperative

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
two builders is is huge it's imperative

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.720 
two builders is is huge it's imperative
if<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.620> want<00:03:55.800> to<00:03:55.890> catch<00:03:56.040> up<00:03:56.220> with<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.490> rest<00:03:56.670> of

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
if you want to catch up with the rest of

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.640 
if you want to catch up with the rest of
the<00:03:56.850> players<00:03:57.090> without<00:03:57.330> spending<00:03:57.960> too<00:03:58.140> much<00:03:58.350> on

the players without spending too much on
gems<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.220> everything<00:03:59.520> else<00:03:59.670> so<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:01.110> a

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
gems and everything else so it is a

little bit more to manage yes but it's a

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.070 
little bit more to manage yes but it's a
