00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 
hello there today we're here at the farm

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.450 
hello there today we're here at the farm
that's<00:00:12.350> Memorial<00:00:12.770> Day<00:00:12.860> weekend<00:00:13.250> and<00:00:13.370> we've

that's Memorial Day weekend and we've
been<00:00:13.580> working<00:00:13.639> on<00:00:13.850> a<00:00:13.879> little<00:00:14.000> project

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
been working on a little project

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.740 
been working on a little project
couldn't<00:00:16.340> really<00:00:16.550> don't<00:00:16.880> have<00:00:16.940> any<00:00:17.120> trucks<00:00:17.480> to

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
couldn't really don't have any trucks to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.500 
couldn't really don't have any trucks to
work<00:00:17.900> on<00:00:18.140> so<00:00:19.390> we<00:00:20.390> found<00:00:20.660> this<00:00:20.869> irrigation<00:00:21.500> pump

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
work on so we found this irrigation pump

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.200 
work on so we found this irrigation pump
it<00:00:23.510> has<00:00:23.720> one<00:00:23.960> of<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.140> last<00:00:24.550> Buick<00:00:25.550> straight-8

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
it has one of the last Buick straight-8

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.679 
it has one of the last Buick straight-8
engines<00:00:26.810> a<00:00:27.640> straight-8<00:00:28.640> engine<00:00:28.670> only<00:00:29.150> lasted

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
engines a straight-8 engine only lasted

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.340 
engines a straight-8 engine only lasted
into<00:00:30.500> about<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:30.830> 50s<00:00:31.369> and<00:00:31.780> Buick<00:00:32.780> used<00:00:33.080> it<00:00:33.230> to

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
into about the 50s and Buick used it to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.950 
into about the 50s and Buick used it to
about<00:00:33.550> 1953<00:00:34.550> we're<00:00:34.730> not<00:00:34.850> sure<00:00:35.060> what<00:00:35.360> year<00:00:35.630> this

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
about 1953 we're not sure what year this

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.220 
about 1953 we're not sure what year this
engine<00:00:36.320> is<00:00:36.470> but<00:00:37.460> it<00:00:38.090> was<00:00:38.390> used<00:00:38.780> here<00:00:39.079> in<00:00:39.170> the

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
engine is but it was used here in the

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.209 
engine is but it was used here in the
farm<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:39.770> run<00:00:39.950> this<00:00:40.100> irrigation<00:00:40.700> pump<00:00:41.950> so<00:00:42.950> the

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
farm to run this irrigation pump so the

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.200 
farm to run this irrigation pump so the
idea<00:00:43.520> was<00:00:45.010> we<00:00:46.010> would<00:00:46.160> mess<00:00:46.399> with<00:00:46.579> it<00:00:46.730> and<00:00:46.910> see

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
idea was we would mess with it and see

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.860 
idea was we would mess with it and see
if<00:00:47.300> we<00:00:47.420> could<00:00:47.570> get<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:47.809> to<00:00:47.840> run<00:00:49.510> get<00:00:50.510> a<00:00:50.570> single

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
if we could get it to run get a single

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.410 
if we could get it to run get a single
carb<00:00:51.289> up<00:00:51.530> there<00:00:52.809> intake<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:54.079> exhaust<00:00:54.170> on<00:00:55.129> this

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420

happens<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.229> small<00:01:39.590> plunger<00:01:41.229> it's

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
happens is this small plunger it's

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.039 
happens is this small plunger it's
sucked<00:01:42.530> in<00:01:42.649> here<00:01:42.920> by<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.930> engages<00:01:44.930> the

sucked in here by this and engages the

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.920 
sucked in here by this and engages the
gear<00:01:45.290> on<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.860> starter<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.579> then<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.600> starter

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
gear on the starter and then the starter

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.580 
gear on the starter and then the starter
will<00:01:48.049> crank<00:01:48.259> over<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:50.450> wires<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:51.020> little<00:01:51.409> bad

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
will crank over the wires a little bad

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.450 
will crank over the wires a little bad
and<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:53.860> solenoids<00:01:54.860> there<00:01:55.070> on<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.250> plunger

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
and the solenoids there on the plunger

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.789 
and the solenoids there on the plunger
when<00:01:55.729> we<00:01:55.880> ground<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:57.320> can<00:01:57.439> see<00:01:57.590> over<00:01:57.710> here

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
when we ground it you can see over here

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:08.040 
when we ground it you can see over here
we're<00:01:58.100> gonna<00:01:58.189> touch<00:01:59.000> it<00:01:59.149> to<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.890> ground<00:02:00.890> side

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.000 

so<00:02:09.050> what<00:02:10.039> we<00:02:10.160> have<00:02:10.399> done<00:02:10.640> oh<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:12.500> also<00:02:12.650> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
so what we have done oh and also the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.000 
so what we have done oh and also the
fuel<00:02:13.190> pump<00:02:13.690> which<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.810> most<00:02:15.020> likely<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.440> six

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
fuel pump which is most likely a six

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.270 
fuel pump which is most likely a six
volt<00:02:16.100> fuel<00:02:16.850> pump<00:02:17.140> so

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
volt fuel pump so

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:27.360 
volt fuel pump so
when<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.550> ground<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.150> out<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.910> runs<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:27.190> is

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
when you ground it out it runs but it is

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.080 
when you ground it out it runs but it is
very<00:02:27.640> loud<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.840> probably<00:02:29.410> upset<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.850> what<00:02:31.000> we

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
very loud and probably upset so what we

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.960 
very loud and probably upset so what we
do<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.300> we<00:02:31.420> come<00:02:31.600> in<00:02:31.630> here<00:02:31.959> with<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.880> hammer

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.520 

and<00:02:36.970> we<00:02:37.060> wedge<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.510> plunger<00:02:37.959> into<00:02:38.170> space

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
and we wedge that plunger into space

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.550 
and we wedge that plunger into space
into<00:02:39.069> place<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:41.380> then<00:02:41.500> we'll<00:02:41.650> come<00:02:41.890> in<00:02:41.920> here

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.650 

and<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.130> get<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.310> screwdriver<00:02:47.520> put<00:02:48.480> this

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
and you get the screwdriver put this

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.660 
and you get the screwdriver put this
screwdriver<00:02:49.640> set<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.730> in<00:02:50.820> here<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:56.520> that

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
screwdriver set it in here and that

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.700 
screwdriver set it in here and that
cranks<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.090> engine<00:02:57.330> over<00:02:57.770> now<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:01.470> have<00:03:01.560> two

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
cranks the engine over now you have two

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.870 
cranks the engine over now you have two
other<00:03:01.860> things<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.280> need<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.520> turn<00:03:02.670> on<00:03:02.850> the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
other things we need to turn on the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.340 
other things we need to turn on the
ignition<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.600> have<00:03:03.690> power<00:03:03.900> go<00:03:04.140> into<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
ignition so we have power go into the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.740 
ignition so we have power go into the
coil<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.760> fires<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.330> here<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.660> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
coil so it fires up here to the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.330
