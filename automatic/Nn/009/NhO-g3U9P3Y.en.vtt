we are looking at four day now we are
south<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.770> Ford<00:00:05.359> you<00:00:06.359> can<00:00:06.480> see<00:00:06.660> Reno<00:00:07.049> Creek

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
south of the Ford you can see Reno Creek

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.960 
south of the Ford you can see Reno Creek
and<00:00:07.950> go<00:00:08.040> back<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.370> east<00:00:08.550> here

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.079 
Reno Creek the cottonwood trees moving
left<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.910> right<00:00:12.080> and<00:00:13.080> as<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.679> get<00:00:13.920> down<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.969> this

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
left to right and as we get down in this

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.019 
left to right and as we get down in this
area<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.570> see<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> lot<00:00:15.960> more<00:00:16.139> trees<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.890> is

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
area you see a lot more trees this is

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.840 
area you see a lot more trees this is
the<00:00:18.029> Little<00:00:18.390> Bighorn<00:00:18.779> River<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:20.220> confluence

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
the Little Bighorn River the confluence

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.010 
the Little Bighorn River the confluence
of<00:00:20.910> Reno<00:00:21.180> Creek<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> Little<00:00:21.869> Bighorn

of Reno Creek and the Little Bighorn

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.870 
of Reno Creek and the Little Bighorn
River<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.189> see<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> river<00:00:23.580> loop

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
River and you can see the river loop

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.060 
River and you can see the river loop
there<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.960> if<00:00:25.109> we<00:00:25.230> come<00:00:25.410> around<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.920> see

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
there and if we come around you can see

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.500 
there and if we come around you can see
another<00:00:26.279> part<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.699> loop<00:00:26.880> right<00:00:27.119> here<00:00:27.150> so

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
another part of the loop right here so

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.359 
another part of the loop right here so
basically<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.930> river<00:00:28.109> comes<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.710> makes<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.189> big

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
basically the river comes in makes a big

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.669 
basically the river comes in makes a big
loop<00:00:29.400> comes<00:00:29.970> around<00:00:30.300> makes<00:00:31.170> another<00:00:31.410> loop

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
loop comes around makes another loop

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.940 
loop comes around makes another loop
it's<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.340> up<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.579> way<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.590> Reno<00:00:34.590> arrives

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
it's going up that way so Reno arrives

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.979 
it's going up that way so Reno arrives
at<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.309> location<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.180> his<00:00:36.300> attack<00:00:36.600> orders

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
at this location with his attack orders

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.400 
at this location with his attack orders
across<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.280> river<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.660> actually<00:00:40.110> attack

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
across the river and actually attack

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.260

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.310 
into the Little Bighorn Valley the
Indian<00:00:42.510> village<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> north

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
Indian village is up to the north

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.970 
Indian village is up to the north
somewhere<00:00:44.660> cook<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.870> Keo<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.289> followed<00:00:46.710> and
