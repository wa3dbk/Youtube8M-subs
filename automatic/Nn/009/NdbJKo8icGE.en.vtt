outside<00:04:56.600> of<00:04:56.960> Konoha<00:04:57.170> is<00:04:57.950> that<00:04:58.130> you'll

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
outside of Konoha is that you'll

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.530 
outside of Konoha is that you'll
occasionally<00:04:58.430> have<00:04:58.790> to<00:04:58.910> travel<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.390> another

branch across trees these little

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.860 
branch across trees these little
gameplay<00:05:03.920> scenarios<00:05:04.550> are<00:05:04.760> really<00:05:05.150> cool<00:05:05.360> at

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
gameplay scenarios are really cool at

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.560 
gameplay scenarios are really cool at
first<00:05:06.490> unfortunately<00:05:07.490> like<00:05:08.090> some<00:05:08.330> of<00:05:08.450> the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
first unfortunately like some of the

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.390 
first unfortunately like some of the
missions<00:05:08.930> they<00:05:09.440> never<00:05:09.620> really<00:05:09.860> changed<00:05:10.280> and

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
missions they never really changed and

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.370 
missions they never really changed and
so<00:05:10.520> even<00:05:10.910> though<00:05:11.030> you're<00:05:11.240> traveling<00:05:12.200> to

these<00:05:15.140> travel<00:05:15.710> sequences<00:05:16.160> never<00:05:16.490> really<00:05:16.790> feel

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
these travel sequences never really feel

these travel sequences never really feel

you have which ends up kind of making

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.890 
you have which ends up kind of making
every<00:05:40.040> fight<00:05:40.280> feel<00:05:40.580> the<00:05:40.760> same<00:05:41.030> as<00:05:41.270> you'll

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350
