00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:09.360
 Hello dear friends and I do 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:14.820
 Now review on my games that I have 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:18.270
 sorry it just is not that fly yusbi 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.170
 he is not talking about this and i will show you what game 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.710
 and you will write in the comments on 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.750
 what game to make a passage or your 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.609
 I offer to download the same game and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.840
 a must and thing for this game review 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.840
 also start the first game of the year war 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.860
 through of olympus or I donâ€™t remember 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.899
 this continuation of the ghost of sparta part 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.050
 it's very cool too 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.000
 have tried 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.790
 really all the sound is not very give 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.590
 the ghost of sparta was better voiced as 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.900
 It would seem to have been the fact that it does not speak well 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.260
 there is still the same graphics gta 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.700
 liberty city stories 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.520
 this is something like on computers only 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.229
 for psp 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:19.800
 The Russian version also performs everything 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:24.619
 missions also drive him 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:27.750
 Kady however will appear so clean 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.580
 spent i could assassin's creed 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.820
 bloodlines 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:37.590
 very much for pi pi it is very much in my opinion 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:42.360
 good graphics everything is very good there 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:48.470
 worked out the proportions are very mission such 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:52.600
 funny also sound good 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.439
 Nazira roofs are these dances 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.680
 this is an indicator and the other is not clear 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.070
 ti-dog 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:04.659
 who made bandicoot 1 2 3 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:08.440
 an anthology but not his already changed somehow 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.239
 remembers who played Odessa game crash 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.350
 bandicoot there she was different at all 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:18.430
 Such graphics was of course while 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.630
 they were for this game as if 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.150
 animated so they sort of animation 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.940
 such then it was so folders he well everything 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:38.010
 equals messi cool us pots by their 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:41.430
 teach to beat cool stickman ski 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:46.420
 this is also fun play all sheet 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.239
 such people painted on it here 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.330
 what's the point and here you sit on 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.580
 helicopter and save the little men 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.060
 which fits a maximum of four 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.769
 human 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.360
 make it harder and harder for everyone there 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.700
 other men throw bombs to 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.680
 kill them try but you have them 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.870
 kill them more and more and you 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.040
 must be in time 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:16.650
 little men bring to the base so that they 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:23.650
 managed to evacuate this chinatown wars 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.900
 that is, the chinatown war is gta view 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.269
 on top of 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.150
 like this 2 on the computer but it's even better 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.930
 anyway cool on top so 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.959
 I didn't play so much in missy 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.709
 but if I ask I will pass Lego 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.730
 Harry Potter 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.750
 5 7 years I somehow was not a toy 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.750
 liked with 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:58.880
 the plot but so you can play spider man 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:00.050
 web of shadows is generally a bad game there you are 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.000
 run and 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:07.940
 as if to the right of the form that is to the right and more often 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.010
 show how he runs sideways and all this 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.160
 the whole plot you will run so there 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.710
 I don't know how to fight like that at all 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.640
 did not like it probably delete little 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.390
 big planet 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:25.100
 I myself am in my opinion a cool game 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:28.820
 which I really liked and when I 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.270
 downloaded first thought what a garbage but 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.160
 then when I understood the meaning of the game obviously for days 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.200
 and at night as soon as I played played 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.430
 held in two days went by that all 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.169
 time the game is very cool game will 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.810

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:49.030
 lego star wars right here for me 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.710
 liked the fact that there are all sorts 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.110
 special here can be raised to 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.650
 Airplanes can be mission at all 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.630
 cool plot I liked each of 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.419
 zombies very cool game 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.580
 if you see in the screenshot he will run 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.039
 such a little man and 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.110
 run away from the zombies and at the same time in them 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.050

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.180
