sky-blue so I'm going to spend a little
bit<00:01:03.870> more<00:01:04.019> time<00:01:04.589> blending<00:01:05.070> these<00:01:05.460> two<00:01:05.790> colors

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
bit more time blending these two colors

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.570 
bit more time blending these two colors

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
together using some of those vertical

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.260 
together using some of those vertical
blending<00:01:09.090> strokes<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.900> then<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.920> long

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
blending strokes and then the long

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.000 
blending strokes and then the long
horizontal<00:01:12.270> strokes<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.740> really

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
horizontal strokes to get that really

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.560 
horizontal strokes to get that really
nice<00:01:14.340> smooth<00:01:14.880> blend<00:01:15.979> if<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.790> particularly

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
nice smooth blend if it's a particularly

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.380 
nice smooth blend if it's a particularly
dry<00:01:19.409> day<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:20.280> need<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.640> wet<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> back<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
dry day you need to wet the back of the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.749 
dry day you need to wet the back of the
canvas<00:01:21.689> before<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.500> start<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.460> that'll

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
canvas before you start this and that'll

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.200 
canvas before you start this and that'll
stop<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:24.150> paints<00:01:24.509> drying<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:25.080> too<00:01:25.110> fast<00:01:26.210> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
stop your paints drying out too fast the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.240 
stop your paints drying out too fast the
final<00:01:27.720> step<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.320> skies<00:01:28.619> I'm<00:01:28.950> going<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
final step for the skies I'm going to

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.240 
final step for the skies I'm going to
add<00:01:29.369> some<00:01:29.820> cobalt<00:01:30.509> blue<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.110> blend<00:01:32.040> those

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
add some cobalt blue and blend those

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.789 
add some cobalt blue and blend those
colors<00:01:32.310> together<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:34.290> I'm<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.710> to

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
colors together and then I'm going to

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.469 
colors together and then I'm going to
get<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.369> clean<00:01:35.759> dry<00:01:36.630> house<00:01:37.110> painting<00:01:37.650> brush<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
get a clean dry house painting brush and

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.499 
get a clean dry house painting brush and
I<00:01:39.479> call<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.170> step<00:01:40.409> polishing<00:01:41.130> where<00:01:41.369> I

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
I call this step polishing where I

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.510 
I call this step polishing where I
quickly<00:01:42.509> brush<00:01:42.930> over<00:01:43.530> all<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.979> colors<00:01:44.159> with

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
quickly brush over all the colors with

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.240 
quickly brush over all the colors with
my<00:01:44.700> clean<00:01:45.000> dry<00:01:45.329> brush<00:01:45.409> now<00:01:46.409> watch<00:01:46.649> how<00:01:46.950> these

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
my clean dry brush now watch how these

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.969 
my clean dry brush now watch how these
colors<00:01:47.880> blend<00:01:48.780> together<00:01:49.020> as<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.590> do<00:01:49.649> this

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
colors blend together as I do this

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.940 
colors blend together as I do this
polish<00:01:50.399> instead<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.990> polishing<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.799> be

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
polish instead this polishing can be

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.120 
polish instead this polishing can be
only<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.579> done<00:01:53.790> before<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.420> paint<00:01:54.780> dries<00:01:55.200> so

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
only be done before you paint dries so

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.980 
only be done before you paint dries so
can't<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.490> done<00:01:56.610> when<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:56.969> too<00:01:57.270> wet<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.810> it

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
can't be done when it's too wet and it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.840 
can't be done when it's too wet and it
can't<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.259> done<00:01:58.320> when<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.770> too<00:01:58.979> dry<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.790> a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
can't be done when it's too dry it's a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.050 
can't be done when it's too dry it's a
bit<00:02:00.030> tricky<00:02:00.770> now<00:02:01.770> I'm<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.280> add<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
bit tricky now I'm going to add in the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.209 
bit tricky now I'm going to add in the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
white paint again and I'm over painting

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.499

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.170
