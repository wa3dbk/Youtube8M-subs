theme<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:37.100> took<00:01:37.250> me<00:01:37.370> a<00:01:37.400> while<00:01:37.550> to<00:01:37.610> actually

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
theme it took me a while to actually

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.670 
theme it took me a while to actually
crop<00:01:38.420> out<00:01:38.630> all<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.960> stuff<00:01:39.170> took<00:01:39.440> a<00:01:39.500> while<00:01:39.650> to

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
crop out all the stuff took a while to

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.260 
crop out all the stuff took a while to
make<00:01:39.950> this<00:01:40.100> actually<00:01:40.550> longer<00:01:40.880> than<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:41.240> thought
