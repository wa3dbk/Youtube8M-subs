and<00:02:18.560> we'll<00:02:18.950> just<00:02:19.099> try<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.310> keep<00:02:19.430> doing<00:02:19.670> that

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
and we'll just try to keep doing that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.610 
and we'll just try to keep doing that
you<00:02:19.940> know<00:02:19.970> try<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.209> chip<00:02:20.450> away<00:02:20.540> with<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.379> and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
you know try to chip away with that and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.259 
you know try to chip away with that and
get<00:02:22.220> him<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.400> little<00:02:22.580> more<00:02:22.670> comfortable<00:02:23.030> and

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
get him a little more comfortable and

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.809 
get him a little more comfortable and
faster<00:02:23.659> and<00:02:23.780> but<00:02:24.500> as<00:02:24.590> far<00:02:24.709> as<00:02:24.769> I<00:02:24.980> mean<00:02:25.159> you<00:02:25.700> know

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
faster and but as far as I mean you know

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.369 
faster and but as far as I mean you know
the<00:02:25.970> fact<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:26.420> have<00:02:26.569> been<00:02:26.959> out<00:02:27.140> there<00:02:27.290> and

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
the fact that I have been out there and

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.720 
the fact that I have been out there and
being<00:02:27.500> successful<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:28.069> don't<00:02:28.250> think<00:02:28.519> that

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
being successful I don't think that

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.170 
being successful I don't think that
changes<00:02:29.120> anything<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:31.250> needing<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:32.000> good

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
changes anything you needing a good

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.180 
changes anything you needing a good
friends<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> point<00:02:33.440> where<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.590> don't<00:02:33.709> feel

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
friends to the point where I don't feel

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.369 
friends to the point where I don't feel
like<00:02:34.340> it's<00:02:34.489> new<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.849> him<00:02:34.879> to<00:02:35.239> be<00:02:35.360> around<00:02:35.599> me<00:02:35.840> so

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
like it's new to him to be around me so

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.350 
like it's new to him to be around me so
I<00:02:37.010> think<00:02:37.160> there's<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.430> lot<00:02:37.459> of<00:02:37.610> pressure<00:02:37.819> mainly

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
I think there's a lot of pressure mainly

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.699 
I think there's a lot of pressure mainly
from<00:02:38.629> I<00:02:38.930> think<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.260> pressure<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.560> he<00:02:39.650> puts

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
from I think the pressure that he puts

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.190 
from I think the pressure that he puts
on<00:02:39.950> himself<00:02:40.209> he's<00:02:41.209> at<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:41.360> tough<00:02:41.599> year<00:02:41.629> tough

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
on himself he's at a tough year tough

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.289 
on himself he's at a tough year tough
few<00:02:42.349> years<00:02:42.519> so<00:02:43.519> I<00:02:43.549> think<00:02:43.790> he<00:02:43.849> really<00:02:44.060> wants<00:02:44.239> to

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
few years so I think he really wants to

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.360 
few years so I think he really wants to
take<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:44.510> opportunity<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.379> obviously<00:02:46.160> turn

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
take this opportunity and obviously turn

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.940 
take this opportunity and obviously turn
it<00:02:46.519> into<00:02:46.640> something<00:02:46.879> real<00:02:47.120> positive<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.720> and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
it into something real positive and and

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.650 
it into something real positive and and
in<00:02:48.950> put<00:02:49.280> himself<00:02:49.459> in<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.819> position<00:02:49.849> where<00:02:50.239> this

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
in put himself in a position where this

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.349 
in put himself in a position where this
is<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:51.440> know<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.739> he's<00:02:51.980> normal<00:02:52.359> whether
