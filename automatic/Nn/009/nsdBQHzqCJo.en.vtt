00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
very well for me talk about a few of the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.170 
very well for me talk about a few of the
the<00:02:15.069> features<00:02:16.480> first<00:02:17.480> size<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.819> watch<00:02:20.000> is

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
the features first size the watch is

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.940 
the features first size the watch is
about<00:02:20.420> 40<00:02:20.750> millimeters<00:02:21.230> across<00:02:21.440> not

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
about 40 millimeters across not

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.509 
about 40 millimeters across not
including<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.489> crown<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:24.129> it's<00:02:25.129> actually<00:02:25.489> I

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
including the crown and it's actually I

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.619 
including the crown and it's actually I
think<00:02:25.900> 39.3<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.050> be<00:02:27.200> exact<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:28.300> crown<00:02:29.300> adds

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
think 39.3 to be exact the crown adds

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.990 
think 39.3 to be exact the crown adds
another<00:02:29.930> couple<00:02:30.319> of<00:02:30.409> millimeters<00:02:31.159> making<00:02:31.909> it

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
another couple of millimeters making it

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.089 
another couple of millimeters making it
probably<00:02:32.390> around<00:02:32.629> 40<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.019> 43<00:02:33.590> millimeters

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
probably around 40 to 43 millimeters

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.250 
probably around 40 to 43 millimeters
with<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.580> crown<00:02:37.360> as<00:02:38.360> far<00:02:38.569> as<00:02:38.659> height<00:02:38.930> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
with the crown as far as height the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.790 
with the crown as far as height the
watch<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.650> only<00:02:39.830> about<00:02:40.519> 10<00:02:40.819> millimeters<00:02:41.420> thick

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
watch is only about 10 millimeters thick

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.100 
watch is only about 10 millimeters thick
and<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:42.890> really<00:02:43.129> like<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.610> doesn't<00:02:44.450> stick<00:02:44.930> up

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
and I really like that doesn't stick up

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.160 
and I really like that doesn't stick up
on<00:02:46.010> my<00:02:46.159> wrist<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.510> when<00:02:47.629> I'm<00:02:47.750> walking<00:02:47.900> around

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
on my wrist so when I'm walking around

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.039 
on my wrist so when I'm walking around
on<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.500> dive<00:02:48.830> boat<00:02:49.269> for<00:02:50.269> example<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.780> don't<00:02:50.930> have

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
on a dive boat for example I don't have

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.660 
on a dive boat for example I don't have
to<00:02:51.140> worry<00:02:51.319> as<00:02:51.470> much<00:02:51.500> about<00:02:51.709> banging<00:02:52.459> the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
to worry as much about banging the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.649 
to worry as much about banging the
crystal<00:02:53.299> or<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.780> bezel<00:02:53.989> into<00:02:55.000> scuba<00:02:56.000> tanks<00:02:56.480> or

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
crystal or the bezel into scuba tanks or

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.119 
crystal or the bezel into scuba tanks or
railings<00:02:57.290> on<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.769> deck<00:02:58.060> or<00:02:59.060> dive<00:02:59.269> ladders

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
railings on the deck or dive ladders

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.020 
railings on the deck or dive ladders
so<00:03:01.909> it's<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> nice<00:03:02.269> it's<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.870> nice<00:03:03.049> size<00:03:04.030> and

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
so it's a nice it's a nice size and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.360 
so it's a nice it's a nice size and
actually<00:03:05.480> on<00:03:06.079> your<00:03:06.290> wrist<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.739> actually<00:03:07.069> feels

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
actually on your wrist it actually feels

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.190 
actually on your wrist it actually feels

the<00:03:52.159> helium<00:03:52.400> escape<00:03:52.549> valve<00:03:52.760> is<00:03:53.239> for<00:03:53.480> use<00:03:53.659> when

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
the helium escape valve is for use when

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.240 
the helium escape valve is for use when
diving<00:03:54.590> in<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:55.810> mixed<00:03:56.810> gas<00:03:57.230> environment<00:03:58.069> where

diving in a mixed gas environment where

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.550 
diving in a mixed gas environment where
helium<00:03:58.939> is<00:03:59.120> used<00:03:59.329> to<00:03:59.480> offset<00:03:59.629> nitrogen<00:04:00.560> and

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
helium is used to offset nitrogen and

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.379 
helium is used to offset nitrogen and
what<00:04:03.560> can<00:04:03.709> happen<00:04:03.919> is<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.280> helium<00:04:04.819> molecules

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
what can happen is the helium molecules

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.119 
what can happen is the helium molecules
in<00:04:05.629> the<00:04:05.720> atmosphere<00:04:06.260> under<00:04:06.560> pressure<00:04:06.829> can

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
in the atmosphere under pressure can

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.759 
in the atmosphere under pressure can
actually<00:04:07.549> get<00:04:07.669> past<00:04:07.909> the<00:04:08.269> rubber<00:04:08.479> seals<00:04:08.870> and

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
actually get past the rubber seals and

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.089 
actually get past the rubber seals and
o-rings<00:04:09.949> on<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.519> watch<00:04:10.699> and<00:04:11.000> then<00:04:11.989> when<00:04:12.319> the

o-rings on the watch and then when the

o-rings on the watch and then when the

diver decompresses or a sins the extra

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.779 
diver decompresses or a sins the extra
helium<00:04:18.440> can<00:04:19.010> actually<00:04:19.340> create<00:04:19.549> enough

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
helium can actually create enough

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.270 
helium can actually create enough
pressure<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.239> pop<00:04:20.449> the<00:04:20.599> crystal<00:04:20.989> so<00:04:21.859> the<00:04:21.979> idea

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
pressure to pop the crystal so the idea

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.409 
pressure to pop the crystal so the idea
is<00:04:22.460> that<00:04:22.490> you're<00:04:23.300> decompressing<00:04:24.080> or

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
is that you're decompressing or

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.460 
is that you're decompressing or
ascending<00:04:27.010> not<00:04:28.010> in<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.280> water<00:04:28.520> obviously<00:04:29.470> you

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
would unscrew this helium escape valve

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.189 
would unscrew this helium escape valve
