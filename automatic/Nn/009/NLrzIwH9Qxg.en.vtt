 if you want, I will introduce to you 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.950
 awesome 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.410
 this is tyrannosaurus rex from jurassic park 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.130
 period 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:26.520
 you know what his name means lizard tyrant and 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.100
 true scary name he lived in western 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.200
 parts of north america 66 million years 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.160
 back and was one of the last 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.160
 extinct species 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:43.320
 would see his teeth if he were his 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.200
 this size is not together was 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.710
 this room he reached 4 meters in 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.119
 height and 12 meters length only 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 imagine him in front of you 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:02:00.060
 when he growls more he was 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.700
 carnivorous and so he has such sharp 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:09.739
 his teeth are good that he does not live ours 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:12.299
 time for a video of his claws what sharp 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.519
 what if he meets with another 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.250
 dinosaur do you think they will fight 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.170
 I think yes 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.650
 tyrannosaurus rex was a thunderstorm of all 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.650
 dinosaurs 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:35.480
 the carnotaur was red 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.930
 and what else did you notice during the day look at the horns and 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.510
 chic back his name means 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.230
 carnivorous bull because his scheme he 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.690
 remind us the bull why he could not 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.280
 there is no fight with a tyrannosaurus rex 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.560
 of course we can play 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:59.580
 I adore minus in fact already in different 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.000
 carnaurus shell time 70 years million 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.220
 years ago before 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.360
 tyrannosaurus rex and besides he lived in 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.670
 South America 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:15.750
 do you know what the most interesting thing is that he 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.120
 runs fast do you think can 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.610
 tyrannosaurus catch up with him no not exactly 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.459
 can a carnotaur run much faster 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.540
 but wait ka this dinosaur is much 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.060
 more peaceful and old is brachiosaurus 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.350
 and he lived on earth 150 million years 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.280
 back be careful 2 i'm tomorrow you 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.590
 can attack tyrannosaurus rex 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.900
 his name means a broad box in his 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.410
 front limbs were much longer 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.430
 rear 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.580
 and were like hands he lived in the north 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.010
 America and Europe and Africa and you know what 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.079
 I like him best in his neck 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.500
 reminds me of a giraffe 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.140
 of course big giraffe do you think 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.380
 that if he can get it off his neck 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.400
 to the top of the pine 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.260
 This is one of the most 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.870
 big animals that ever lived 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.360
 for winter 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.349
 and yes yes even much more than 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.560
 Tyrannosaurus Rex 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.989
 about heal for a thief could reach a height of 13 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.720
 meters well it's good that he was peaceful 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.720
 dinosaur and you want to know his secret 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:33.400
 pay attention to his limb see 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.470
 this claw is only one he had 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.160
 one claw on each limb 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.220
 curious truth what you say knock 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.110
 tyrannosaurus rex that he is somewhere near 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.889
 that you have a wonderful scent of course for 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.289
 what else do you need okay leave 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.600
 legs back let them fight
