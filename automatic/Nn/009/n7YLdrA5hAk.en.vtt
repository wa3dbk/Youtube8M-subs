the next gen kind of 3ds that my head
hurts<00:00:40.079> even<00:00:40.260> thinking<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.190> of

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
hurts even thinking of that now of

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.770 
hurts even thinking of that now of
course<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.760> doesn't<00:00:41.820> mean<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.390> console

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
course this doesn't mean that a console

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.030 
course this doesn't mean that a console
is<00:00:42.840> gonna<00:00:42.989> come<00:00:43.140> out<00:00:43.260> next<00:00:43.469> year<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.980> would

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
is gonna come out next year that would

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.100 
is gonna come out next year that would
be<00:00:44.129> stupid<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.640> them<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.539> does<00:00:45.780> suggest

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
be stupid of them but it does suggest

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.889 
be stupid of them but it does suggest
that<00:00:46.559> potential<00:00:47.280> product<00:00:48.030> roadmaps<00:00:48.629> are

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
that potential product roadmaps are

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.410 
that potential product roadmaps are
being<00:00:49.469> thought<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:49.950> right<00:00:50.219> now<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.120> what

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
being thought out right now this is what

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.170 
being thought out right now this is what
Miyamoto<00:00:51.930> had<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> say<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> AP<00:00:53.010> we're<00:00:53.699> focused

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
Miyamoto had to say to AP we're focused

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360

this<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.600> what<00:02:00.719> he<00:02:00.780> had<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.960> say<00:02:01.170> about<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
since we first created Mario people have

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.620 
since we first created Mario people have
compared<00:02:04.740> him<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.950> Mickey<00:02:05.399> Mouse<00:02:05.610> I've<00:02:06.329> always

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
compared him to Mickey Mouse I've always

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.449

said<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:06.899> Mickey<00:02:07.229> Mouse<00:02:07.469> evolved<00:02:08.099> with<00:02:08.220> each

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
said that Mickey Mouse evolved with each

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.969 
said that Mickey Mouse evolved with each
evolution<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.300> animation<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.410> saw<00:02:10.679> Mickey

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
evolution and animation you saw Mickey

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.520

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
Mouse each step of the way from early

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.920 
Mouse each step of the way from early
I<00:02:13.590> wanted<00:02:14.280> Mario<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.850> be<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.240> character<00:02:15.569> in

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
I wanted Mario to be that character in

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.480 
I wanted Mario to be that character in
the<00:02:16.080> digital<00:02:16.470> world<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.130> with<00:02:17.250> each

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
the digital world so that with each

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.210 
the digital world so that with each
digital<00:02:18.090> evolution<00:02:18.420> he<00:02:19.319> was<00:02:19.470> there<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.830> usher

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
digital evolution he was there to usher

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.760 
digital evolution he was there to usher
in<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.490> next<00:02:20.670> era<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.420> think<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.260> maybe<00:02:22.530> when

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
in the next era I think that maybe when

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.980 
in the next era I think that maybe when
we<00:02:22.860> released<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.430> next<00:02:23.580> Hardware<00:02:24.120> system<00:02:24.390> you

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
we released the next Hardware system you

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.750 
we released the next Hardware system you
can<00:02:25.140> look<00:02:25.290> forward<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.740> seeing<00:02:25.950> Mario<00:02:26.340> take<00:02:26.610> on

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
can look forward to seeing Mario take on

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.120 
can look forward to seeing Mario take on
a<00:02:26.790> new<00:02:27.030> role<00:02:27.060> or<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.990> new<00:02:28.140> game<00:02:28.440> now<00:02:28.950> that

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
Sega has done in the past where they

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.360 
Sega has done in the past where they
came<00:03:16.019> out<00:03:16.170> with<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.380> new<00:03:16.530> system<00:03:16.890> because<00:03:17.069> their

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
came out with a new system because their

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.190 
came out with a new system because their
other<00:03:17.519> system<00:03:17.910> was<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> screw-up<00:03:18.540> like<00:03:19.079> they

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
other system was a screw-up like they

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.560 
other system was a screw-up like they
did<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.829> when<00:03:20.250> Burnie<00:03:20.489> stole<00:03:20.850> our<00:03:21.000> now

out with the Dreamcast that was what

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.630 
out with the Dreamcast that was what
kind<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.690> would<00:03:30.840> hurt<00:03:31.049> Sega<00:03:31.530> okay<00:03:32.459> now

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
obviously Nintendo is in a much better

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.699 
obviously Nintendo is in a much better
financial<00:03:36.360> position<00:03:36.510> I'm<00:03:36.900> not<00:03:37.049> talking<00:03:37.470> about

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
financial position I'm not talking about

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.340 
financial position I'm not talking about
what's<00:03:37.920> in<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.190> bank<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.700> was<00:03:38.959> that<00:03:39.959> had<00:03:40.320> a

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
what's in the bank that was that had a

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.530 
what's in the bank that was that had a
lot<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.650> do<00:03:40.920> with<00:03:41.010> what<00:03:41.220> killed<00:03:41.489> Sega<00:03:41.880> two<00:03:42.209> is

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
lot to do with what killed Sega two is

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.599 
lot to do with what killed Sega two is
the<00:03:43.260> fact<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.590> they<00:03:43.739> had<00:03:43.920> no<00:03:44.100> money<00:03:44.310> left

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
the fact that they had no money left

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.430 
the fact that they had no money left
they<00:03:44.820> literally<00:03:45.239> just<00:03:45.540> did<00:03:45.780> not<00:03:45.989> have<00:03:46.260> the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
they literally just did not have the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.319 
they literally just did not have the
they<00:03:46.890> didn't<00:03:47.220> not<00:03:47.400> have<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.670> finances<00:03:48.120> to

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
they didn't not have the finances to

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.470 
they didn't not have the finances to
keep<00:03:49.079> supporting<00:03:49.500> hardware<00:03:50.160> but<00:03:51.090> well<00:03:51.359> my

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
keep supporting hardware but well my

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.560 
keep supporting hardware but well my
concern<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:52.049> is<00:03:52.200> if<00:03:52.560> Nintendo<00:03:53.000> does<00:03:54.000> rush<00:03:54.329> out

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
concern is is if Nintendo does rush out

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.120 
concern is is if Nintendo does rush out
another<00:03:54.840> system<00:03:55.260> because<00:03:55.560> they<00:03:55.680> they<00:03:55.890> want

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
another system because they they want

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.380 
another system because they they want
something<00:03:56.459> that's<00:03:56.609> a<00:03:56.670> little<00:03:56.760> more<00:03:56.910> relevant

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
something that's a little more relevant

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.390 
something that's a little more relevant
a<00:03:57.420> little<00:03:57.600> more<00:03:57.720> powerful<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:59.010> on<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.280> so

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
a little more powerful so on and so

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.830 
a little more powerful so on and so
forth<00:03:59.670> is<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.910> they're<00:04:00.030> gonna<00:04:00.180> lose<00:04:00.480> the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840
