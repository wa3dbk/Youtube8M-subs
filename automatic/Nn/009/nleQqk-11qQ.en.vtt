00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello that you again 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.780
 turned on because 8 tv today where 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.990
 to demonstrate myself 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.610
 at night in perfection again we have 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.529
 our fight position of the world at the bme 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.810
 the aggressive opponent ahead of us 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.130
 maybe because he hands maybe 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.699
 sees and does not know exactly what he is doing 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.939
 should 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:30.529
 which simply beats away we guide him 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:33.059
 into the empty grazing of this half-time 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.730
 the envelope is immediately followed 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.070
 forward in the world I am already Sunday 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.070
 contacts came forward as soon as I did 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.980
 Contact has a tolerable pressure too 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.730
 if he is very strong in the leisurely 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 empty and shoot head together 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.449
 front 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.699
 more because of very fluent very fast 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.379
 very easy due to the eight movements 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.230
 by doing so research and of course 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.750
 continue editing and very fast because of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.760
 big lead always self-protection 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.320
 at most two seconds 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.970
 from here japan event movement 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.040
 thereby their animal opponents 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
 he comes in my range includes 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.210
 contact line into the empty space 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.530
 Let him run completely into the empty space 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.830
 see what the head forward 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830
 come 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:35.030
 It is reported to have been seen here too 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:38.040
 of course with the further following technology 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.260
 So they feilte here all German on 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.990
 the unexplained 8 even if I am now 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.120
 here would change education as 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.700
 mass movement is fast at 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.270
 do not push everything fluent angle of 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.570
 to entertain your family relationships 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.570
 stop perfectly 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.150
 another dangerous other strike 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.580
 their normal ones demonstrate that once 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.560
 means the opponent beats here in liver 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.450
 very dangerous in the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.800
 Street fighting can be very dangerous 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.560
 can be like here again for 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.720
 Of course, it's important to me , he said 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.320
 I'm not coming to the front of the baton 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.120
 not blog little but stay if 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.950
 So here I actually manage his 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.950
 tracks at the same time 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.670
 it had stopps easily and experienced that 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.560
 they him actually I just again 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.360
 I can reinstit his mutation 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.770
 so therefore the second meeting with the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.870
 hand can not come 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.360
 I do not want to do that 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.160
 stop blocking or second 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.650
 Therefore, pitch up before we 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.689
 his second one can block his head 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:56.260
 because that would be of course responsible 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:59.129
 for all his action of data with 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.129
 follow techniques
