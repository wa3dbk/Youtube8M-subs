and then you want to knead the dough for
about<00:02:13.330> five<00:02:13.690> minutes<00:02:14.100> four<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.190> five<00:02:15.400> minutes

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
about five minutes four to five minutes

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.290 
about five minutes four to five minutes
until<00:02:16.000> it's<00:02:16.240> smooth<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.110> elastic<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:18.300> if

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
until it's smooth and elastic and if

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.550 
until it's smooth and elastic and if
while<00:02:19.540> you're<00:02:19.720> doing<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.170> need<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.410> add<00:02:20.530> a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
while you're doing it you need to add a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.840 
while you're doing it you need to add a
little<00:02:20.650> more<00:02:20.800> flour<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.460> work<00:02:21.610> surface

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
little more flour to the work surface

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
little more flour to the work surface
that's<00:02:22.300> okay<00:02:24.150> work<00:02:25.150> with<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.420> heel<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.840> your

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
that's okay work with the heel of your

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.860 
that's okay work with the heel of your
hand<00:02:26.970> turn<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.120> 90<00:02:28.480> degrees<00:02:28.510> after<00:02:29.050> each<00:02:29.350> knead

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.290 

until<00:02:34.870> it's<00:02:35.230> nice<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.500> smooth<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.130> elastic

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
until it's nice and smooth and elastic

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.030 
until it's nice and smooth and elastic
again<00:02:37.300> this<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.630> four<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.320> five<00:02:38.530> minutes<00:02:38.920> of

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
again this is four to five minutes of

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:48.980 
again this is four to five minutes of
doing<00:02:39.310> this

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.990 

when<00:02:49.890> you're<00:02:50.040> done<00:02:50.160> kneading<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.760> want<00:02:50.910> to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
when you're done kneading you want to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.450 
when you're done kneading you want to
cut<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.510> dough<00:02:51.720> into<00:02:52.050> quarters<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.160> make<00:02:53.310> them

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
cut the dough into quarters to make them

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.140 
cut the dough into quarters to make them
easier<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.910> roll<00:02:54.600> out<00:02:54.630> later<00:02:55.020> on<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:56.790> cut<00:02:57.060> it

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
easier to roll out later on just cut it

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.420 
easier to roll out later on just cut it
into<00:02:57.270> quarters<00:02:57.720> and<00:03:00.770> you<00:03:01.770> want<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.010> take<00:03:02.160> all

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
into quarters and you want to take all

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.100 
into quarters and you want to take all
the<00:03:02.670> quarters<00:03:03.090> take<00:03:03.300> all<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.630> dough<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.050> put

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
the quarters take all the dough and put

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.800 
the quarters take all the dough and put
it<00:03:04.920> either<00:03:05.040> in<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.310> plastic<00:03:05.820> bag<00:03:06.030> or<00:03:06.330> wrap<00:03:06.570> them

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
it either in a plastic bag or wrap them

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.530 
it either in a plastic bag or wrap them
in<00:03:06.960> some<00:03:07.530> plastic<00:03:08.100> wrap<00:03:08.210> something<00:03:09.210> to<00:03:09.390> keep

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
in some plastic wrap something to keep

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.600 
in some plastic wrap something to keep
them<00:03:09.720> from<00:03:09.840> drying<00:03:10.170> out<00:03:10.470> while<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.280> let<00:03:11.430> them

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
them from drying out while you let them

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:24.089 
them from drying out while you let them
rest<00:03:11.910> for<00:03:12.060> about<00:03:12.300> 40<00:03:12.810> minutes<00:03:16.340> any<00:03:17.340> left

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.530

then using a cookie cutter cut out as

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.140 
then using a cookie cutter cut out as
many<00:05:19.229> pieces<00:05:19.770> as<00:05:20.069> you<00:05:20.099> can<00:05:20.430> keep<00:05:20.699> in<00:05:20.819> mind<00:05:21.029> of

many pieces as you can keep in mind of

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.179 
many pieces as you can keep in mind of
course<00:05:21.180> each<00:05:21.689> ravioli<00:05:22.229> is<00:05:22.439> going<00:05:22.680> to<00:05:22.800> need<00:05:22.949> two

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:23.189 
course each ravioli is going to need two

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.879 
course each ravioli is going to need two
of<00:05:23.340> the<00:05:23.460> pieces<00:05:24.169> let's<00:05:25.169> cut<00:05:25.379> out<00:05:25.499> as<00:05:25.680> many

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
of the pieces let's cut out as many

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:34.210 
of the pieces let's cut out as many
pieces<00:05:26.129> as<00:05:26.430> you<00:05:26.460> can

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
be putting it on half of the pieces I'm

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.390 
be putting it on half of the pieces I'm
just<00:05:44.820> doing<00:05:45.000> one<00:05:45.270> here<00:05:45.480> just<00:05:45.780> to<00:05:45.870> demonstrate
