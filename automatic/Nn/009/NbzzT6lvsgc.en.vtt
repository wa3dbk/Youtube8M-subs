00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
keep the phone mostly protected so you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440 
keep the phone mostly protected so you
put<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.740> volume<00:01:17.729> button<00:01:18.210> side

sleep of weeks you can just kind of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200 
sleep of weeks you can just kind of
click<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.520> snaps<00:01:23.880> into<00:01:24.150> place

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
click it all in and it snaps into place

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.359 
click it all in and it snaps into place
like<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> other<00:01:25.920> cool<00:01:26.130> things

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369

about this that most snap on the back

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.380 
about this that most snap on the back
style<00:01:28.020> shells<00:01:28.320> don't<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.460> lay<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
table protection in this case does this

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.219 
table protection in this case does this
lip<00:01:32.490> comes<00:01:32.759> up<00:01:32.970> higher<00:01:33.210> than<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> screen<00:01:33.960> so

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
lip comes up higher than the screen so
