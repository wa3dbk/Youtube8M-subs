were<00:01:39.600> born<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.110> pair<00:01:40.500> running<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:41.250> a

were born to do pair running with a
powerful<00:01:41.549> throw<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.119> we<00:01:42.240> sounded<00:01:42.630> like

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
powerful throw and we sounded like

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.359 
powerful throw and we sounded like
pretty<00:01:43.259> good<00:01:43.380> hunters<00:01:43.710> guys<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.189> there's

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
pretty good hunters guys but there's

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.069 
pretty good hunters guys but there's
more<00:01:44.520> than<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:45.060> study<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.720> journal

even when blindfolded humans are

even when blindfolded humans are
freaking<00:01:50.670> awesome<00:01:50.790> at<00:01:51.119> chasing<00:01:51.509> stuff

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
freaking awesome at chasing stuff

something<00:01:53.909> there<00:01:54.210> are<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.329> couple<00:01:54.450> of

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
something there are a couple of

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.940 
something there are a couple of
different<00:01:54.840> strategies<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.740> choose

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
different strategies that you can choose

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.039 
different strategies that you can choose
from<00:01:56.100> sharks<00:01:56.610> use<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> pursuit<00:01:57.390> method<00:01:57.689> they

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
from sharks use a pursuit method they

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.780 
from sharks use a pursuit method they
get<00:01:58.170> behind<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.590> they<00:01:58.649> chase<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.189> mofo<00:01:59.579> down

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
get behind and they chase that mofo down

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.249 
get behind and they chase that mofo down
it<00:02:00.149> works<00:02:00.390> because<00:02:00.540> they're<00:02:00.840> powerful<00:02:01.110> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
it works because they're powerful and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.600 
it works because they're powerful and
they're<00:02:01.409> fast<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:01.860> if<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.040> thing<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.369> good

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
they're fast but if that thing is good

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.639 
they're fast but if that thing is good
at<00:02:02.790> avoiding<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:03.840> almost<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.439> fast

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
at avoiding you and it's almost as fast

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.620 
at avoiding you and it's almost as fast
a<00:02:04.890> better<00:02:05.159> strategy<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.670> constant<00:02:06.360> angle

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
a better strategy is constant angle

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.600 
a better strategy is constant angle
