00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.944
 "Breast Cancer and Alcohol: How Much is a Safe Quantity?" 

00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:09.150
 Recently, IARC, 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.480
 International Cancer Research Agency 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.700
 which is the official body of the World Health Organization (WHO) 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.700
 who decides what is not carcinogenic, 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.460
 has issued a statement that alcoholic beverages - all alcoholic beverages - 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.740
 should be considered carcinogenic to humans. 

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:26.977
 The latest research has focused on acetaldehyde, 

00:00:26.977 --> 00:00:31.730
 the first and most toxic alcohol metabolite as a cancer agent. 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.460
 The bacteria in our mouth seem to oxidize alcohol to a carcinogen 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.712
 called acetaldehyde, which we then swallow. 

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:42.720
 There is convincing evidence 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.720
 that alcohol consumption increases the risk of breast cancer 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.650
 but most of the data were obtained from studies 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.440
 which have focused on the impact of moderate or high alcohol intake, 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.500
 while we know little about mild drinking, 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.140
 thus thinking into one glass a day. 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.607
 Therefore, this new study meta-analysis was conducted, 

00:00:59.607 --> 00:01:02.607
 who compare light drinkers to non-drinkers 

00:01:02.607 --> 00:01:06.046
 and there was a weak but significant association with breast cancer, 

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:09.206
 more than hundreds of studies. 

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:13.864
 It is estimated that approximately 5,000 deaths from breast cancer per year 

00:01:13.864 --> 00:01:16.024
 can be attributed to drinking a small amount of alcohol, 

00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:19.762
 which means that nearly 5,000 women who have died of breast cancer 

00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:21.052
 maybe they didn't have to die 

00:01:21.052 --> 00:01:24.109
 if alcohol consumption is completely avoided. 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.160
 That is why the editorial was published by Breast, 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.160
 who concluded: 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.737
 "Women who regularly consume alcohol have an increased risk of breast cancer 

00:01:31.737 --> 00:01:35.153
 which is dose-dependent, but without a threshold, " 

00:01:35.153 --> 00:01:38.423
 which means that there is apparently no level of alcohol consumption, 

00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:41.580
 which at least minimizes the risk of breast cancer. 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.250
 So there is no "no safe subliminal level". 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.710
 Any alcohol consumption seems to increase the risk 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.710
 development of alcohol-related cancer. 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.098
 For example, in a Harvard nursing study, 

00:01:54.098 --> 00:01:57.360
 that less than one drink per day 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.490
 may be associated with a slight increase in risk. 

00:02:00.973 --> 00:02:04.340
 Forget one drink, just a sip? 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.750
 A new study found that even just holding a teaspoon of hard alcohol in your mouth 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.250
 for five seconds, and then spit it out, 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.460
 leads to carcinogenic concentration of acetaldehyde, 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.580
 which in the oral cavity is immediately formed from alcohol 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.080
 after a sip of a strong alcoholic drink. 

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:23.253
 And his influence lasts about ten minutes 

00:02:23.253 --> 00:02:24.820
 after you spit it out. 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.600
 And you didn't even drink it! 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.000
 Even alcohol-containing mouthwashes can cause an increase in carcinogenic effects. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.300
 Scientists conclude 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.460
 that "in general, taking alcohol-containing mouthwashes 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.900
 there is a relatively small margin of security. " 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.864
 Typical use reaches concentration range 

00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:45.864
 beyond which adverse effects can be expected. 

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:48.590
 "Until a stronger scientific foundation is established 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.220
 for the acetaldehyde threshold in saliva, 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.980
 a prudent public health policy should generally recommend 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.760
 alcohol in such products. " 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.210
 So why don't we have the same recommendations for alcoholic beverages? 

00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:05.193
 The Harvard Study Closes: 

00:03:05.193 --> 00:03:08.933
 "Women will have to individually compare the risk of mild to moderate alcohol use 

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:10.510
 on breast cancer development 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.800
 its benefits for preventing heart disease, 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.934
 to make the best personal choice about alcohol consumption. " 

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:21.140
 He talks about the famous J-shaped curve. 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.076
 While smoking is bad and more smoking is even worse 

00:03:24.076 --> 00:03:27.450
 or movement is good and more movement even better 

00:03:27.453 --> 00:03:31.730
 alcohol appears to have a beneficial effect on small doses. 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.073
 Six beers per day increase overall mortality 

00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:38.073
 but also total abstinence. 

00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:42.900
 The main killer of women is not breast cancer, they are heart disease, 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.040
 and one drink a day reduces the risk of heart disease. 

00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:50.959
 But why just reduce the risk of heart disease 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.280
 if you can almost completely remove it 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.940
 using healthy eating? 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.480
 Vegetable diet that excludes certain vegetable drinks 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.420
 it can be the best for overall survival.
