realism<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:38.450> success<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.200> two<00:01:40.530> opposite

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
realism and success are on two opposite

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.480 
realism and success are on two opposite
ends<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.789> the<00:01:41.909> spectrum<00:01:42.860> now<00:01:43.860> what<00:01:44.069> do<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.190> mean

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
ends of the spectrum now what do I mean

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.249 
ends of the spectrum now what do I mean
by<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.299> you're<00:01:48.299> always<00:01:48.509> told<00:01:48.929> in

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
by that you know you're always told in

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.690 
by that you know you're always told in
life<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:50.869> things<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.259> grand<00:01:52.740> accomplishment

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
life that things of grand accomplishment

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.950 
life that things of grand accomplishment
are<00:01:53.850> unrealistic<00:01:56.180> but<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.360> few<00:01:57.570> successful

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
are unrealistic but the few successful

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.980 
are unrealistic but the few successful
people<00:01:58.289> actually<00:01:58.680> act<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.700> belief<00:01:59.990> to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
people actually act on that belief to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.929 
people actually act on that belief to
prove<00:02:01.289> those<00:02:01.560> naysayers<00:02:01.859> wrong<00:02:03.680> is<00:02:04.939> what

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
prove those naysayers wrong is what

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.810 
prove those naysayers wrong is what
determines<00:02:07.429> someone<00:02:08.429> who<00:02:08.549> is<00:02:08.670> successful

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
determines someone who is successful

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.170 
determines someone who is successful
from<00:02:09.539> someone<00:02:10.019> who<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.350> not<00:02:10.820> you<00:02:11.820> know<00:02:11.850> it's

from someone who is not you know it's

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.069 
from someone who is not you know it's
unrealistic<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:14.030> think<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:15.720> could<00:02:15.870> put

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
unrealistic to think that we could put

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:24.170 
unrealistic to think that we could put
people<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:18.920> metal<00:02:19.920> fixture<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:22.850> fly<00:02:23.850> them

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
people in a metal fixture and fly them

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.080 
people in a metal fixture and fly them

you<00:02:36.450> know<00:02:36.540> it's<00:02:36.720> unrealistic<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.859> think<00:02:38.310> that

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
you know it's unrealistic to think that

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.720

it means that the idea of this great

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.910 
it means that the idea of this great
grand<00:03:18.879> accomplishment<00:03:19.900> takes<00:03:20.900> time<00:03:21.170> this
