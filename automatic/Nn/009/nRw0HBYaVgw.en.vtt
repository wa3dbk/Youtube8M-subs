00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.150 
over decorate with either a pattern or a
color<00:01:14.000> or<00:01:14.390> texture<00:01:14.869> or<00:01:15.170> something<00:01:15.619> that<00:01:16.070> it

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
color or texture or something that it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.460 
color or texture or something that it
can<00:01:16.190> just<00:01:16.400> look<00:01:16.729> too<00:01:17.030> noisy<00:01:17.360> as<00:01:17.960> you<00:01:18.110> always

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
can just look too noisy as you always

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.469 
can just look too noisy as you always
want<00:01:18.710> to<00:01:18.740> add<00:01:18.890> something<00:01:19.280> else<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.970> tweet

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
too crazy or too Stark

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.660 
too crazy or too Stark
I<00:02:52.590> thought<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.680> was<00:02:53.770> important<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.430> give<00:02:54.580> it

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
I thought it was important to give it

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.510 
I thought it was important to give it
that<00:02:54.820> wow<00:02:55.090> factor<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.860> basically<00:02:57.190> took<00:02:57.459> a

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
that wow factor and I basically took a

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.040 
that wow factor and I basically took a
little<00:02:57.760> bit<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:57.970> confectioner<00:02:58.540> glazed<00:02:58.810> with<00:02:59.020> a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
little bit of confectioner glazed with a

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.170 
little bit of confectioner glazed with a
brush<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.560> brushed<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.370> right<00:03:00.550> on<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.880> entire

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
brush and brushed it right on the entire

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.820 
brush and brushed it right on the entire
cake<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.840> kind<00:03:02.050> of<00:03:02.110> gave<00:03:02.290> like<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> leather

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
cake and it kind of gave like a leather

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.910 
cake and it kind of gave like a leather
appearance<00:03:03.550> I<00:03:04.020> think<00:03:05.020> that<00:03:05.170> technique<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.800> the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
appearance I think that technique of the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.530 
appearance I think that technique of the
confectioner<00:03:06.400> glaze<00:03:06.610> just<00:03:06.640> boosts<00:03:07.240> it<00:03:07.330> up<00:03:07.420> a

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
confectioner glaze just boosts it up a

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.800 
confectioner glaze just boosts it up a
notch<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:08.050> just<00:03:08.920> makes<00:03:09.130> it<00:03:09.220> special<00:03:09.640> love<00:03:10.630> it

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
notch and just makes it special love it

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.570 
notch and just makes it special love it
I<00:03:10.990> think<00:03:11.440> it's<00:03:11.530> gorgeous<00:03:11.740> I<00:03:12.160> would<00:03:12.280> want<00:03:12.459> this

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
I think it's gorgeous I would want this

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:26.229 
I think it's gorgeous I would want this
cake<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:13.950> wouldn't<00:03:14.950> mind<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.130> bag<00:03:15.340> either

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.270 

the<00:03:26.599> Porsche<00:03:26.930> could<00:03:27.140> turn<00:03:27.530> out<00:03:27.680> amazing

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
the Porsche could turn out amazing

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.940 
the Porsche could turn out amazing
actually<00:03:28.610> better<00:03:29.209> than<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.480> was<00:03:29.629> expecting<00:03:29.950> it

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
actually better than I was expecting it

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.920 
actually better than I was expecting it
is<00:03:31.099> really<00:03:31.340> important<00:03:31.909> to<00:03:32.060> be<00:03:32.090> fast<00:03:32.569> when

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
is really important to be fast when

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.020 
is really important to be fast when
you're<00:03:33.110> decorating<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.680> cake<00:03:33.860> because<00:03:34.489> it

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
you're decorating a cake because it

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.390 
you're decorating a cake because it
depends<00:03:35.510> on<00:03:35.720> production<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.439> mean<00:03:36.739> that<00:03:37.010> means

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
depends on production I mean that means

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.830 
depends on production I mean that means
that<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:37.790> want<00:03:37.879> to<00:03:38.000> be<00:03:38.090> able<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.329> put<00:03:38.689> together

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
that you want to be able to put together

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.319 
that you want to be able to put together
more<00:03:39.200> cakes<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.769> not<00:03:40.459> spend<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.120> whole<00:03:41.269> day

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
more cakes and not spend the whole day

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.360 
more cakes and not spend the whole day
doing<00:03:41.780> just<00:03:42.170> one<00:03:42.319> cake<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.709> course<00:03:43.129> there's

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
doing just one cake of course there's

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.800 
doing just one cake of course there's
some<00:03:43.549> certain<00:03:43.790> designs<00:03:44.269> that<00:03:44.480> are<00:03:44.540> going<00:03:44.720> to

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
some certain designs that are going to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.569 
some certain designs that are going to
require<00:03:45.109> the<00:03:45.349> entire<00:03:45.590> day<00:03:45.859> maybe<00:03:46.129> more<00:03:46.430> than

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
require the entire day maybe more than

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:58.680 
require the entire day maybe more than
one<00:03:46.760> day<00:03:46.939> but<00:03:47.689> speed<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.319> really<00:03:48.560> important

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.270 

what's<00:03:59.690> cuter<00:04:00.079> than<00:04:00.230> this<00:04:00.409> I<00:04:00.709> love<00:04:01.040> my

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
impressed myself it's not something that

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.379 
impressed myself it's not something that
I<00:04:05.239> normally<00:04:05.299> do<00:04:06.260> at<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.769> shop<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:07.459> it<00:04:08.000> was<00:04:08.180> it

you

you

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.260 
you
for<00:05:47.170> me<00:05:47.290> I<00:05:47.320> like<00:05:47.590> new<00:05:47.770> text<00:05:48.160> because<00:05:48.520> the<00:05:48.970> green

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
for me I like new text because the green

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.240 
for me I like new text because the green
in<00:05:49.450> a<00:05:49.510> sponge<00:05:49.840> is<00:05:50.080> a<00:05:50.110> lot<00:05:50.320> tighter<00:05:50.590> you<00:05:51.100> have<00:05:51.190> a

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
in a sponge is a lot tighter you have a

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.010 
in a sponge is a lot tighter you have a
better<00:05:51.490> mouthfeel<00:05:52.060> you<00:05:52.540> know<00:05:52.660> it's<00:05:52.840> more

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
better mouthfeel you know it's more

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.890 
better mouthfeel you know it's more
smoother<00:05:53.530> and<00:05:53.710> I<00:05:54.580> also<00:05:54.730> think<00:05:55.060> that<00:05:55.180> it<00:05:55.390> holds

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
smoother and I also think that it holds

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.920 
smoother and I also think that it holds
in<00:05:56.020> moisture<00:05:56.050> a<00:05:56.530> lot<00:05:56.710> better
