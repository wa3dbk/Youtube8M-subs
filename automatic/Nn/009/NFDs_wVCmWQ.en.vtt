hi everyone this is Jack here I'm

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.769 
hi everyone this is Jack here I'm
speaking<00:00:28.950> about<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.460> difference<00:00:29.910> between<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
speaking about the difference between a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:40.880 
speaking about the difference between a
channel<00:00:31.680> and<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.550> portal<00:00:34.880> now<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:39.590> channel<00:00:40.590> for

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
channel and a portal now a channel for

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:51.049 
channel and a portal now a channel for
instance<00:00:46.399> we<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:48.679> the<00:00:49.679> dimensions<00:00:50.370> about

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
instance we have in the dimensions about

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:01.209 
instance we have in the dimensions about
a<00:00:51.539> year<00:00:51.960> ago<00:00:53.929> shut<00:00:54.929> down<00:00:55.280> all<00:00:56.449> channels<00:00:59.690> now

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
a year ago shut down all channels now

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.610 
a year ago shut down all channels now
the<00:01:02.219> reason<00:01:02.819> why<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.719> did<00:01:03.929> that<00:01:04.170> was<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.100> see

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
the reason why we did that was to see

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.359 
the reason why we did that was to see
which<00:01:07.620> human<00:01:08.159> beings<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:09.530> channels<00:01:10.530> were

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
which human beings as channels were

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.940 
which human beings as channels were
deceiving<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:13.130> which<00:01:14.130> human<00:01:15.030> beings<00:01:15.509> were

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
deceiving and which human beings were

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.410 
deceiving and which human beings were
actual<00:01:17.509> channels<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:19.320> were<00:01:19.590> accessing<00:01:20.579> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
actual channels that were accessing the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.410 
actual channels that were accessing the
dimensions<00:01:22.670> how<00:01:23.670> did<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.619> do<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:26.420> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
dimensions how did we do this the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.950 
dimensions how did we do this the
following<00:01:27.869> way<00:01:28.520> we<00:01:29.520> shut<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
following way we shut down all the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.240 
following way we shut down all the
channels<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.740> closed<00:01:32.520> them<00:01:32.880> down<00:01:33.079> completely

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
channels we closed them down completely

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.550 
channels we closed them down completely
by<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.450> metallic<00:01:36.450> placement<00:01:36.719> this<00:01:37.170> boys<00:01:37.409> like

year ago they were unconscious mind

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.570 
year ago they were unconscious mind
pre-programmed<00:03:06.110> manifestations<00:03:07.110> within<00:03:07.580> the

leave her body completely for as long as

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.950 
leave her body completely for as long as
she<00:04:40.010> wants<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:41.120> know<00:04:41.300> if<00:04:41.419> it's<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.660> week

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
she wants you know if it's a week

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.050 
she wants you know if it's a week
another<00:04:42.410> being<00:04:42.680> wants<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.130> come<00:04:43.340> here<00:04:43.640> it's<00:04:43.820> a

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
another being wants to come here it's a

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.530 
another being wants to come here it's a
week

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
week

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.860 
week
there's<00:04:45.320> no<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:46.010> doesn't<00:04:46.370> matter<00:04:46.580> then<00:04:47.150> she<00:04:47.690> is

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
there's no it doesn't matter then she is

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.060 
there's no it doesn't matter then she is
in<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.200> dimensions<00:04:48.890> for<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.220> week<00:04:51.070> so

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
in the dimensions for a week so

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.330 
in the dimensions for a week so
therefore<00:04:52.370> there's<00:04:52.520> no<00:04:52.630> codependency<00:04:54.340> she

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
therefore there's no codependency she

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.820 
therefore there's no codependency she
contacts<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.180> dimensions<00:04:56.780> whenever<00:04:57.260> it's

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
contacts the dimensions whenever it's

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.770 
contacts the dimensions whenever it's
like<00:04:58.100> a<00:04:58.130> normal<00:04:58.550> conversation<00:04:59.150> that<00:04:59.750> I

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
like a normal conversation that I

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.420 
like a normal conversation that I
mentioned<00:05:00.320> her<00:05:00.470> communication<00:05:01.250> and

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
mentioned her communication and

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.010 
mentioned her communication and
participation<00:05:01.610> with<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.330> dimensions<00:05:02.870> it's

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
participation with the dimensions it's

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.600 
participation with the dimensions it's
like<00:05:03.169> participation<00:05:03.890> a<00:05:03.950> communication<00:05:04.550> you

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
like participation a communication you

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.570 
like participation a communication you
within<00:05:04.880> human<00:05:05.180> beings<00:05:05.210> it's<00:05:06.200> normal<00:05:06.740> it's<00:05:07.400> how

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
within human beings it's normal it's how

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.110 
within human beings it's normal it's how
it<00:05:07.730> is

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
it is

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.600 
it is
there's<00:05:08.600> no<00:05:08.870> inequality<00:05:09.110> of<00:05:09.770> some<00:05:10.010> higher

there's no inequality of some higher

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.550 
there's no inequality of some higher
issuance<00:05:11.120> or<00:05:11.240> higher<00:05:11.480> being<00:05:11.780> first<00:05:12.169> having<00:05:12.410> to

give her permission to do anything no

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.800 
give her permission to do anything no
it's<00:05:15.500> not<00:05:15.710> like<00:05:15.950> that<00:05:16.330> so<00:05:18.460> there<00:05:19.460> has<00:05:19.729> been

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
it's not like that so there has been

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.310 
it's not like that so there has been

being said I'm not going to continue

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.240 
being said I'm not going to continue
channeling<00:05:43.520> again<00:05:43.850> I<00:05:44.060> am<00:05:44.680> treating<00:05:45.680> I'm

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
channeling again I am treating I'm

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.480 
channeling again I am treating I'm
stopping<00:05:46.760> it<00:05:46.880> I'm<00:05:47.000> closing<00:05:47.390> it<00:05:47.510> down<00:05:47.540> and<00:05:48.490> what

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
stopping it I'm closing it down and what

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.990 
stopping it I'm closing it down and what
happened<00:05:50.229> the<00:05:51.229> channel<00:05:51.710> couldn't<00:05:52.070> access<00:05:52.280> the

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
happened the channel couldn't access the

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.330 
happened the channel couldn't access the
particular<00:05:53.630> dimensional<00:05:54.530> being<00:05:54.740> so<00:05:55.070> what<00:05:55.250> is

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
particular dimensional being so what is

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.000 
particular dimensional being so what is
that<00:05:55.490> that<00:05:56.000> is<00:05:56.030> confirmation<00:05:56.690> that<00:05:57.680> there<00:05:57.890> is

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
that that is confirmation that there is

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.010 
that that is confirmation that there is
a<00:05:58.039> real<00:05:58.280> channel<00:05:58.640> that<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.510> being<00:05:59.750> does<00:05:59.990> not

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
a real channel that the being does not

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.010 
a real channel that the being does not
have<00:06:00.350> a<00:06:00.380> mindfuck<00:06:00.890> going<00:06:01.220> on<00:06:01.539> by<00:06:02.539> is<00:06:02.600> there<00:06:02.840> any

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
have a mindfuck going on by is there any

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.070 
have a mindfuck going on by is there any
other<00:06:03.229> channels<00:06:03.770> in<00:06:04.039> the<00:06:05.000> world<00:06:05.240> there<00:06:05.840> so

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
other channels in the world there so

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:13.900 
other channels in the world there so
continued<00:06:06.650> after<00:06:06.979> year<00:06:07.190> ago<00:06:07.430> except<00:06:08.180> that<00:06:08.360> one

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.230 

but<00:06:14.750> in<00:06:15.740> essence<00:06:16.220> very<00:06:16.640> channels<00:06:17.060> that

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
but in essence very channels that

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.560 
but in essence very channels that
continued<00:06:17.900> a<00:06:18.310> year<00:06:19.310> for<00:06:19.580> Mirabeau<00:06:20.150> it's<00:06:20.450> a

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
continued a year for Mirabeau it's a

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.140 
continued a year for Mirabeau it's a
mind<00:06:20.810> consciousness<00:06:21.610> manifestation<00:06:22.610> but

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
mind consciousness manifestation but

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.880 
mind consciousness manifestation but
this<00:06:23.300> particular<00:06:23.450> one<00:06:23.900> I<00:06:24.020> just<00:06:24.470> mentioned

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
this particular one I just mentioned

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:30.430 
this particular one I just mentioned
isn't<00:06:25.750> it<00:06:26.750> in<00:06:26.930> different<00:06:27.770> scenario<00:06:29.200> and<00:06:30.200> the

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
isn't it in different scenario and the

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.970 
isn't it in different scenario and the
beings<00:06:30.740> are<00:06:30.980> I'm<00:06:31.190> talking<00:06:31.550> about
