00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
this lesson is simply an exercise that I

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.310 
this lesson is simply an exercise that I
created<00:00:10.710> very<00:00:11.550> early<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.300> my<00:00:12.420> practice<00:00:12.660> in

a<00:00:43.140> lot<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.040> based<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.550> coordination<00:00:45.210> now

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
a lot of it is based on coordination now

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.139 
a lot of it is based on coordination now
with<00:00:46.230> an<00:00:46.350> electric<00:00:46.739> guitar<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:48.000> your

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149

pedal steel guitar these are your feet

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.840 
pedal steel guitar these are your feet
right<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.530> coordination<00:00:53.100> between<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.610> right

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
right so coordination between the right

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.479 
right so coordination between the right
hand<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.539> pigs<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.890> feet<00:00:56.129> is

hand and the pigs and the feet is

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.529 
hand and the pigs and the feet is
paramount<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.329> I've<00:00:58.260> developed<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.890> simple

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
paramount so I've developed this simple

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.080 
paramount so I've developed this simple
basic<00:01:00.539> major<00:01:00.750> scale<00:01:01.109> exercise<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.250> begin

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
basic major scale exercise and begin

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.990 
basic major scale exercise and begin
getting<00:01:03.390> faster<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.170> faster<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.830> faster<00:01:05.000> my

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
getting faster and faster and faster my

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.910 
getting faster and faster and faster my
pig<00:01:06.360> blocking<00:01:06.780> improved<00:01:07.200> my<00:01:07.530> dexterity

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
pig blocking improved my dexterity

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.929 
pig blocking improved my dexterity
improved<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:09.119> ear<00:01:09.420> improved<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.640> still<00:01:11.640> use

this<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.600> day<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> matter<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.530> fact

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
this one to this day as a matter of fact

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.800 
this one to this day as a matter of fact
this<00:01:14.400> morning<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> sat<00:01:15.210> down<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.450> just

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
this morning when I sat down I just

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.270 
this morning when I sat down I just
started<00:01:16.080> noodling<00:01:16.590> around<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:17.100> my

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
started noodling around with my

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.789 
started noodling around with my
exercises<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.900> came<00:01:19.080> upon<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
exercises and I came upon this one I

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.010 
exercises and I came upon this one I
thought<00:01:19.979> well<00:01:20.250> maybe<00:01:20.460> they<00:01:21.390> want<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> see<00:01:21.869> it

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
thought well maybe they want to see it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.410 
thought well maybe they want to see it
so<00:01:22.460> if<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.759> going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> work<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.390> you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
so if this is going to work for you you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.840 
so if this is going to work for you you
let<00:01:24.780> me<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.770> guys<00:01:25.920> post<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> comments

let me know you guys post the comments
because<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.210> mean<00:01:27.479> all<00:01:27.600> your<00:01:27.750> negative<00:01:28.049> ones<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
because I mean all your negative ones I

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.260 
because I mean all your negative ones I
can<00:01:28.530> delete<00:01:28.799> anyway<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:31.939> let's<00:01:32.939> look<00:01:33.119> at<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
can delete anyway so let's look at a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.240 
can delete anyway so let's look at a
straight<00:01:33.600> major<00:01:33.900> scale<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:35.040> not

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
straight major scale and it's not

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
straight major scale and it's not
necessarily<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:36.770> 24<00:01:37.770> notes<00:01:38.119> I'm<00:01:39.119> actually

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
necessarily a 24 notes I'm actually

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.640 
necessarily a 24 notes I'm actually
going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> cut<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> short<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.380> actually

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
going to cut it short it's actually

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.440 
going to cut it short it's actually
going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> stop<00:01:41.040> at<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.280> 5th<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> top<00:01:42.119> but

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
going to stop at a 5th at the top but

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.209 
going to stop at a 5th at the top but
let's<00:01:43.259> look<00:01:43.470> at

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.639 

now<00:01:49.030> I'm<00:01:49.119> in<00:01:49.240> one<00:01:49.390> position<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.960> have<00:01:50.109> my<00:01:50.319> AMD

this<00:03:21.240> is<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.510> key<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:22.610> now<00:03:23.610> if<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.030> drop<00:03:24.420> this

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
this is the key of a now if I drop this

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.440 
this is the key of a now if I drop this
second<00:03:25.650> string<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:25.980> half<00:03:26.280> step<00:03:26.640> it'll<00:03:27.090> become<00:03:27.300> a

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
second string a half step it'll become a

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.990 
second string a half step it'll become a
D<00:03:27.690> major<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.320> we<00:03:28.980> can<00:03:29.130> end<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.520> a<00:03:29.640> little<00:03:29.820> bit

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
D major and we can end it a little bit

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.510 
D major and we can end it a little bit
differently<00:03:30.390> but<00:03:30.750> all<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.590> notes<00:03:31.830> are<00:03:32.250> still

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
differently but all the notes are still

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.180 
differently but all the notes are still
diatonic<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.360> fore<00:03:33.570> court'<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.890> here<00:03:35.070> we

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
diatonic to the fore court' so here we

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.360 
diatonic to the fore court' so here we
have<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:37.250> but<00:03:38.250> it's<00:03:38.370> also<00:03:38.960> D<00:03:39.980> I'm<00:03:40.980> going<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.190> drop

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
have a but it's also D I'm going to drop

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.449 
have a but it's also D I'm going to drop
the<00:03:41.550> second<00:03:41.910> string

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.270 

you<00:03:48.459> don<00:03:48.879> t<00:03:48.909> know
