count<00:00:48.510> out<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.750> LG<00:00:48.960> g2<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.860> still<00:00:50.129> pretty

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
count out the LG g2 it's still pretty

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.930 
count out the LG g2 it's still pretty
pretty<00:00:51.360> compact<00:00:52.070> to<00:00:53.070> hold<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.820> not

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
pretty compact to hold not it's not

pretty compact to hold not it's not
really<00:00:54.420> wide<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.140> still<00:00:55.410> easily<00:00:55.530> hold

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
really wide so you can still easily hold

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.889 
really wide so you can still easily hold
it<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.190> hand<00:00:56.250> no<00:00:57.000> problems<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.690> so

it in one hand no problems at all so
that's<00:00:57.989> pretty<00:00:58.350> neat<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> plastic<00:00:59.760> buys

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120

that's pretty neat but the plastic buys
they<00:01:00.390> give<00:01:00.570> them<00:01:00.690> very<00:01:01.199> lightweight<00:01:01.590> fee<00:01:01.980> on

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
they give them very lightweight fee on

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.390 
they give them very lightweight fee on
the<00:01:02.250> hand<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.000> constructions<00:01:03.719> are<00:01:04.019> ok<00:01:04.400> decent

gigahertz<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.330> we<00:03:36.840> just<00:03:37.020> noticed<00:03:37.350> that

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
gigahertz and we just noticed that

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.460 
gigahertz and we just noticed that
there's<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:38.130> fine<00:03:38.430> level<00:03:38.820> of<00:03:39.000> finesse

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
there's just a fine level of finesse

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.710 
there's just a fine level of finesse
much<00:03:40.470> more<00:03:40.740> snappy<00:03:40.980> than<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.700> Samsung<00:03:42.600> Galaxy

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
much more snappy than the Samsung Galaxy

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.100 
much more snappy than the Samsung Galaxy

there's<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.800> experience<00:03:47.190> they<00:03:48.150> both<00:03:48.360> have

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
there's the experience they both have

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.240 
there's the experience they both have
they're<00:03:48.930> both<00:03:49.050> running<00:03:49.260> Android<00:03:49.830> of<00:03:49.980> course

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
they're both running Android of course

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.250 
they're both running Android of course
lot<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.790> personalization<00:03:51.180> but<00:03:51.660> unique

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
lot of personalization but unique

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.770 
lot of personalization but unique
features<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.860> separate<00:03:53.580> them<00:03:53.760> really<00:03:54.570> quick

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
features that separate them really quick

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.600 
features that separate them really quick
with<00:03:54.990> the<00:03:55.140> galaxy<00:03:55.500> s4<00:03:55.650> when<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.190> comes<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.430> most

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
with the galaxy s4 when it comes to most

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.160 
with the galaxy s4 when it comes to most
tasks<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.030> they<00:03:57.120> have<00:03:57.360> different<00:03:57.810> ways<00:03:57.990> of

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
tasks and they have different ways of

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.460 
tasks and they have different ways of
executing<00:03:58.980> them<00:03:59.459> so<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.450> Galaxy<00:04:00.600> s4

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
executing them so the Galaxy s4

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.170 
executing them so the Galaxy s4
you're<00:04:01.800> going<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.040> have<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.490> multi<00:04:02.790> windows

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
you're going to have the multi windows

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.090 
you're going to have the multi windows
so<00:04:03.780> basically<00:04:04.110> you<00:04:04.380> could<00:04:04.530> have<00:04:04.740> two

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
so basically you could have two

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.470 
so basically you could have two
applications<00:04:05.790> running<00:04:06.060> running

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
applications running running

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.780 
applications running running
simultaneously<00:04:07.040> so<00:04:08.040> for<00:04:08.190> example<00:04:08.550> I<00:04:08.580> have<00:04:08.610> the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
simultaneously so for example I have the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.480 
simultaneously so for example I have the
gallery<00:04:09.209> there<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:10.200> could<00:04:10.380> have<00:04:10.560> also<00:04:10.800> the

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
gallery there and I could have also the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.070 
gallery there and I could have also the
memo<00:04:11.730> at<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.240> bottom<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.780> get<00:04:12.870> two<00:04:13.050> things

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
memo at the bottom so you get two things

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.820 
memo at the bottom so you get two things
at<00:04:13.410> once

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
at once

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.710 
at once
LG<00:04:14.370> has<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.490> different<00:04:14.970> approach<00:04:15.209> so<00:04:15.450> let's<00:04:15.600> say

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
LG has a different approach so let's say

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.509 
LG has a different approach so let's say
if<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.930> want<00:04:16.140> get<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.440> gallery<00:04:16.620> yeah<00:04:17.310> what

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
if I want get to the gallery yeah what

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.430 
if I want get to the gallery yeah what
they<00:04:17.609> call<00:04:17.820> their<00:04:18.060> slide<00:04:18.510> on<00:04:18.750> feature<00:04:19.230> which

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
they call their slide on feature which

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.979 
they call their slide on feature which
basically<00:04:19.769> we<00:04:20.340> slide<00:04:20.609> with<00:04:20.910> three<00:04:21.150> fingers<00:04:21.390> we

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
basically we slide with three fingers we

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.360 
basically we slide with three fingers we
could<00:04:22.140> save<00:04:22.410> up<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.860> three<00:04:23.220> different

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
could save up to three different

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.730 
could save up to three different
applications<00:04:23.669> at<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.510> same<00:04:24.600> time<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.680> I'm

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
applications at the same time so I'm

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.980 
applications at the same time so I'm
going<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:26.010> save<00:04:26.430> this<00:04:26.640> one<00:04:26.700> here<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.720> let's

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
going to save this one here and let's

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.050 
going to save this one here and let's
say<00:04:28.200> I<00:04:28.230> one<00:04:28.470> use<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.770> browser<00:04:28.980> -<00:04:29.430> I'm<00:04:29.850> just

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
say I one use the browser - I'm just

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.030 
say I one use the browser - I'm just
going<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.300> save<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:30.600> so<00:04:31.290> in<00:04:31.530> order<00:04:31.650> for<00:04:31.770> me<00:04:32.010> to

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
going to save that so in order for me to

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.230 
going to save that so in order for me to
actually<00:04:32.400> switch<00:04:32.700> between<00:04:32.940> those

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
actually switch between those

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.420 
actually switch between those
applications<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:34.200> just<00:04:34.620> swiped<00:04:34.890> three<00:04:35.160> hands

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
applications I just swiped three hands

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.550 
applications I just swiped three hands
one<00:04:35.700> way<00:04:35.850> and<00:04:36.270> you<00:04:36.419> see<00:04:36.600> those<00:04:36.840> windows<00:04:37.200> all<00:04:37.410> up

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
one way and you see those windows all up

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.500 
one way and you see those windows all up
there<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.040> little<00:04:38.250> bit<00:04:38.400> different

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
there so a little bit different

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.730 
there so a little bit different
implementation<00:04:39.510> with<00:04:39.660> both<00:04:39.870> so<00:04:40.530> that's<00:04:40.620> a

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
implementation with both so that's a

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.409 
implementation with both so that's a
quick<00:04:40.919> look<00:04:41.070> between<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.520> Samsung<00:04:41.729> Galaxy<00:04:41.970> s4

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
quick look between the Samsung Galaxy s4

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.690 
quick look between the Samsung Galaxy s4
and<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.930> LG<00:04:43.200> g2<00:04:43.380> guys<00:04:43.800> do<00:04:44.370> on<00:04:44.430> learn<00:04:44.669> more

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
and the LG g2 guys do on learn more

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.240 
and the LG g2 guys do on learn more
about<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.270> check<00:04:45.840> our<00:04:45.990> website<00:04:46.169> for<00:04:46.560> an<00:04:46.800> ACOG
